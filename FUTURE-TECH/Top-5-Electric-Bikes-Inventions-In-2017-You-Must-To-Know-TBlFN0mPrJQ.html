you just have to want it bad enough
visualize the goal and get it but what
is it goal without a journey
this story isn't about getting there
it's about the ride it's not for the
faint of heart it's not for those who
cut corners
it's about the rhythm of the path the
joy of the process
it's not the destinations that plot your
life your journeys do let's play
hi I'm John Madden and I'm from the
Newport Beach California and I'm on a
mission to build the best electric bike
for every scenario magical biking is a
huge part of our culture here so we
understand how it feels Ryan bikes have
been around for a long time now
but with little chaining so I thought
what better time than ever to give bikes
a tech upgrade with full functionality
after many iterations prototypes and
hundreds of hours of are indeed I could
humbly say that I've come up with a
perfect bike for everyone let me
introduce you joy
Jules is not your typical bike it's
electric foldable and affordable for
everyone paid for anytime any situation
and any rider and designed and
engineered in the US jolt will get you
anywhere you need to be with a smile on
your face every time enough for the
details
let's take Joel for a ride jolt is our
answer to connecting people within
cities without polluting the planet or
breaking a sweat
it makes Hills easier to overcome and
arriving in style without a sway so you
can focus on what's important to you
like having fun we design goal to be
funner faster and easier than anything
else you've ever experienced with jolt
you can ride over 50 miles on a single
charge
using our patent pending and the spinner
wheel technology
jolt is handcrafted with top of the line
components comes with a 6-speed onboard
computer and comes in a variety of hip
cool colors
jolt will never let you down it even
allows you to charge any of your mobile
devices thanks to its built in USB
charging port jolts is perfect for
getting around town fast without
breaking a sweat
but if you still want exercise just ride
jolt like you would a normal bike
without any assistance of the motor or
ride in hybrid mode and set the level of
assistance you need using a six-speed an
on-board LCD display the choice is yours
don't feel like pedaling hit the
throttle sit back relax and let jolt do
all the work jolt is fun for all ages
and riding styles day or night whatever
your mission is Joel's got you covered
one of my favorite things about Joel is
how compact I can be in just a few quick
steps
Joel folds up in a matter of seconds so
you can transport it in the back of a
car or keep it stored inside without
taking up tons of space I'm on a mission
to revolutionize the way we commute
every day but that's not all in addition
to a greener form of transportation I'm
going to donate a portion of all
proceeds to the Greenpeace non-profit
organization who since 1971 has been
fighting toward greener healthier world
for our oceans forests food and climate
this is just the beginning
my dream is to globalize the electric
bike revolution but I need your help
once we get your boy funded we can start
production immediately and start
rethinking how much more I can do
we've all had that childhood dream of
cruising it faultlessly on the coolest
bikes around going further than anyone
else faster than anyone else exploring
entirely new places hi I'm Elliot and
I'm Albert we developed the fuel systems
like series to bring that dream to life
and to show everyone the unexploited
potential of electric bikes the FX and
the SS are ultra light strong sleek
powerful bikes with no compromising
style the X series look just like normal
bikes but they're powerful matters get
rid of the pain so that you only keep
the fun the SX is equipped with a mid
motor which allows you to use its 9
speed Shimano gears to their full extent
at any power level this enhances the
range of the motor stock you will feel
as light as a feather going uphill and
which impressive speeds in only a few
seconds meanwhile the FX compact you
matter will take you anywhere in a flash
whilst nine speech manual gears let you
ride it like a normal bike our on-board
computer is full of smart functionality
it essentially gives you the choice
between an effortless glide and a
fitness ride comfort and control while
top priority in order to make sure that
the X series provides you with the best
riding experience there are no secrets
here we equipped our bikes with high
performance hydraulic disc brakes and an
ergonomic saddle we also added phone
suspensions to the SX so that riding
through rough terrain feels like flying
over smooth hills
the FX can be fully folded and unfolded
in a few seconds thanks to its easy
three steps folding system it is compact
and light enough to literally take it
anywhere with you the SX will take you
more than 60 kilometres away its battery
pack perfectly locks and integrates
within the bike's slick carbon frame the
FX also carries more than 50 kilometres
of range in a compact energy dense
battery that easily and discreetly fits
onto the bike a lot of our design
efforts went into integrating wires and
electric components in the frame while
getting rid of the bulky shapes that
made it bikes notoriously awkward we
tested the x-series in all environments
all conditions to make sure that you get
a bike you trust a bike that never lets
you down the x-series is now finally
ready for production we need your help
to bring these incredible bikes to life
and reduce production costs with your
trust and our knowledge and hard work we
will finally release the true potential
of electric bikes to you and the world
so join us
make your commutes a pleasure your free
time and adventure and help us create a
brighter future thanks guys thanks guys
the love we share for cafe racer bikes
goes way back to 1977
when we bought our first bike back then
we were just three brothers that loved
tuning and riding bikes
fast forward 37 years something and we
are still the same brothers that share
the love for cafe racer bikes we decided
that we wanted to create a new type of
cafe racer that has never been seen
before we wanted to create the world's
first electric cafe racer scooter our
idea and vision was to mix the past with
the future and rumble was the perfect
name of the scooter we wanted to share
with the world fast forward three more
years and we have created the perfect
scooter for everyday use for people
around the world
rumble is an electric scooter that you
can ride to work meeting up friends or
just take it out for a nice ride
we have sourced parts from countries in
Europe
say and easy to create the best high
performance electric bike one our
customers to get quality
our background in engineering compassion
for bikes has been the key to create the
perfect electric cafe racer scooter
