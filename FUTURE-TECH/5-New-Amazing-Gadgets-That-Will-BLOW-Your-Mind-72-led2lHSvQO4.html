it's really just the fact that you can
just throw a camera in between these
little spots and cracks you've never
been able to do before
it's the same crisis really hi I'm
Andrea from Barrow where we aim to make
the impossible film shop possible
introducing the next generation cable
cam we enable easy filming in places
even drones can't go
this is the viral life the first ever
portable and easy to use cable cam the
light kit is the perfect extension to
your existing camera setup the viral
light is foldable making it easy to
carry with you in a backpack and with
the intuitive mounting system they can
be set up in less than three minutes we
wanted to create something that will
make people go WOW how did they do that
when they saw the video going through
windows through cars really Packwood's
or other places where you would never
imagine flying a camera but at the same
time keep it so simple that anyone can
use it
even though it's the first time
operating a cable camp you would
definitely be successful
the viral light goes faster to follow
the action of high speed and slow enough
to capture the perfect time-lapse shot
and the battery will it last up to three
hours with lights indicating how much
you have left
that is exactly the tool that we needed
in the sport it takes less than a minute
setup and your way to go get the bangin
shots just like the pros with our
background from arranging and filming
extreme sport events and festivals we
have seen that more and more filmmakers
from beginner to pro level are seeking
new angles when capturing their most
extreme and memorable moments on video
that's why we wanted to make viral light
available for everyone and compatible
with any camera and stabilizer up to
three point three pounds
have to admit first few times I used it
I got a little bit carried away of the
speed and it fingers gonna go as fast it
did which is pretty damn far it always
came back up and kept asking for more
I've been shooting films professionally
for about seven years and I've never
seen a product that can do that with our
strong team of engineers filmmakers and
athletes we're bringing this product to
life here on Kickstarter we've iterated
and tested the product with lead users
from all over the world and the product
is now ready for manufacturing but we
need your help to press play on
production back us today and you can
start to be creative with your
filmmakers and to make that impossible
shot possible
say hello to the powerstroke modular
what's unique to the powerstrip modular
is that we've created extension modules
that allow you to solve your day-to-day
necessities without the use of thousands
of different adapters say you need a
Wi-Fi extender well there is a module
for that or if you need to charge up
your phone there is a module for that
too we're even working on a power bank
module that you can just snap in charge
up and snap back out to take with you on
the go there are many other modules that
we're working on such as the light
module a USB type-c module a sensor
module so basically there's a ton of
modules that we can create and our
team's goal is to make the power strip
future-proof for example every day we
struggle with power for us a simple sip
of coffee can do the trick but for our
devices the problems usually start with
inefficient power strips whether it's in
the office or at home we can all relate
to this annoying problem of not finding
the right plug adapter or charging port
and this leads us to throwing away power
strips or replacing them with temporary
solutions and that's where we want to
make and change power strip modular will
allow you to attach what every module
you need whenever you need it
