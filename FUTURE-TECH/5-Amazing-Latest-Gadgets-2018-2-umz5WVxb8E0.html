today everything is becoming mobile we
live in a world that people are
constantly on the go and are running
their chores everywhere but there's one
office tool that is still stuck behind
that hasn't changed in the past decade
and isn't mobile we're talking about the
printer we looked at printers today and
we saw big bulky boxes with a printhead
inside moving from left to right then we
thought why not just take the printhead
out and put it on a robot when I first
started thinking about creating the
printer the most important thing fast
was that it should be small we knew we
had to utilize every single inch we
wanted a pocket-sized printer that can
print on any size of paper precise
images young people can take it
everywhere and music not only in the
office or at home the printers cover is
made of polycarbonate with a glossy
finish we have two options one is in
Mars black the other is titanium white I
started working on the mechanical
configuration how it will look inside
and how to configure the motors so it
will be as small as possible and as
accurate as possible we had to keep it
small everything was designed prior to
building on computer we have initial
mechanical prototype we have our initial
code there's about 10 by 10 by 8
centimeters our initial prototype is
aimed for grayscale images and text the
prototype aims were printing a page on
under a minute we are using a special
Bluetooth protocol which allows us to be
able to print from any device it means
that no drivers will be needed it will
print on a regular a 4 paper if you have
multiple pages it will hold and it will
tell you to change a page
we started working on this project at
our college JCT at the pre-trib
intrapreneurship challenge we received
the initial funding and the help and
guidance of the college's professors in
order to work on this we've been working
hard and we built several prototypes for
the robot and we have our design for
manufacturing prototype all designed out
now we need your support so we can start
ordering and working on this small and
stronger custom-made parts in order to
make this robot even smaller and make
this incredible device a reality thank
you for your support
looking for a simple way to make your
LOC smarter transform your deadbolt with
kevo convert from quick set installation
is a snap simply replace the interior of
your existing lock quick set or
otherwise with a stylish kevo convert
while keeping the beautiful exterior you
know and love now you can use the Kibo
app available on iOS and Android to lock
and unlock your door sendy keys to
anyone to a few taps and revoke access
just as easily you'll receive
notifications whenever someone comes or
goes so you can always feel secure
knowing your home is safe even when
you're away vivo convert only from quick

eSports is more sexual activity than
with a keyboard but the keyboard wasn't
designed for gaming professionals in
their early twenties are suffering
frequent neck back and wrist issues if
there are already experiencing health
problems
what will be like in 10 years and for
the millions playing computer games
every day
hi I'm Lewis de leur Sevilla founder and
CEO of digna former fanatic League of
Legends head coach and two times
EU LCS champion looking for solutions
for my players I discovered that the
keyword that we used for gaming hasn't
changed in 30 years and that's way too
long
during the last 14 months we've been
prototyping and testing with users we've
created a beautiful premium quality
mechanical gaming keyboard design team
with performance health and comfort it's
called grace
a normal keyboard forces the risk to
vent over the pink side of your hand
raises split design allows you to rotate
both halves so you reduce the strain in
wrists and shoulders race has a cool
aluminum body their connectors and
joints are magnetic and the cable gives
you an extra USB port you can create
multiple fully configurable layouts and
toggle instantly between them and assign
to each group of keys a different
backlight color and the under glow will
give you visual feedback when you change
layouts race has the functionality of a
full-size or in a much smaller footprint
it's crazy that we use both hands for
only one massive key race has eight some
keys they are comfortable to use because
they're in the area where our thumbs
naturally rest race is a keyboard and
again in keypad in the same device you
can touch any side and the other will
still work this way you can have more
space for your mouth while you're gaming
it's comfortable for both left and
right-handed gamers there are many kinds
of mechanical switches all races
switchers are hot swappable so you can
easily pull them out and replace them
whenever you want regular keyboards then
the wrist up creating strain over time
punters are needed to raise the wrist
making a neutral angle if you want a
premium quality mechanical gaming
keyboard with a beautiful design that
can help you improve performance health
and comfort support us let's make race a
reality
what an amazing city I need to write
about this place did you ever miss a
flash of creative genius well
you're definitely not alone I need to
bring Jessica here she would love this
place
I have to share that with everybody we
are building a first smart voice
recording wearable
it's handy and allows you to capture
your thoughts with a quick motion
nothing to distract we can stay focused
on what really matters to you organize
your notes with hashtags can integrate
them with your favorite apps

send reminders to your colleagues our

removes noise and transit through our
own AI system for noise patent
identification
take notes and capture your greatest
ideas with ease when you're out for a
walk or run it works offline just fine
so don't worry about leaving your phone
at home a full battery charge lasts for
about four days of average use sandstone
has futuristic design to make it
memorable and you remarkable it's
created in the intersection of waves and
symbolizes the sound that you create
when you speak it fully charges in 30
minutes on a specially designed dock
station that can fit the device and all
of you interchangeable backs with all
the distractions and life on the go it's
so easy to forget a great idea sandstone
is a notepad built for your busy
