faster and faster it is sometimes hard
to take a break and to let go we tend to
forget that it's often too small and
simple things that make us happy coming
home after a long stressful day we all
need to recharge our batteries what else
would be better to relax and to unwind
than bringing back the simplicity of
your childhood by watching the toys over
wind gravity also simply having fun with
your friends and loved ones is very
precious in these techniques time
we have created business involves the
fastest spinning toy on this planet a
fascinating spinning toy
we invented an elegant plate
Bennett's pinball's amazed from two
solid steel balls box
welded together
we have used industry-leading coating
technologies and materials for a perfect
swimming experience exposed to light
beams involved also create fascinating
light effects you have never seen before
together with our smart skin base and
its integrated smart controlled LED
light you can create your very own light
show by using the spinners iOS and
Android app we could spend hours
exploring all the different light
effects and colors which can be created
by this wonderful toy we have spent more
than 10 months with developing dining
testing and over typing to bring this
toy to perfection we have looked into
every detail and we've been working hard
together with our suppliers
ensure only the best materials are used
the result is an amazing and exceptional
choice within lovers and everyone else
who is fascinated by simplicity applied
the or was the great back childhood
memories
helped us to bring this toy to life
support is now and become a spinard
you
you
I'm Tommy and this is this is someone
really special
he's very close to me even though he's
from far away like the difference from
here to the sky photon rice in faraway
galaxies but his amazing fascia collided
with Nashville and ended up broken into
pieces
luckily he managed to survive we're
trying to put it together somehow for
the time being
photon is staying with a knife become
his friend or showing him what's what
how he live here that will render at all
at first couldn't even move now he's
running around like an adult and he
keeps developing yep an obstacle we got
that covered already Photon quickly
figured out but we little people were
playing the most sometimes we like to
make mess and we don't necessarily like
cleaning up as much and that there are
other beings living on it and by the way
he is really happy would you be able to
help how do we community programming
control commands and photonic language
photon is a great companion memory place
until indexable macaques
thanks to him I know that there are no
black light bulbs I keep working on
these and we gettin better photon is
amazed by the amount of technology in
our lab now we're learning about it
together all of us because you have to
know that my friends got to a friend
photon as well so she loves to light up
his eyes and keep stressing to Mark II
thing keeps on wanting to take me
everywhere and all of us to teach your
new stuff even our kindergarten teacher
says that photon absorbed everything
like a sponge that he'd smarty it would
be great if there were more of them
filled more photons are going to land on
our really soon close row including
together support us on Kickstarter meet
photon calm
hello there hi ru how are you what are
some of the ways okay so it's a lot of
ways it depends on what's going on I
mess up my hands a lot I do that's a
little snapping just kind of like like
that even though I don't need to fix my
hair it's like one of those things like
you know I'm not trying to be stylish
I'm just kidding I'll catch myself doing
it and I'm like whoa what's going on I
was told it's because my mind is just
always racing I think everybody said
dude even if they don't know they know I
have not a fidget spinner like a salad
spinner a few people in my class does is
a fidget cute the Frederic is really
cool because you just don't even have to
look you just look just keep squeezing
in like pulling things okay so the goal
that's always nice looks different than
their other fidgets manners I've seen
it's hard to describe a heavier bottle
opener maybe oh it's kind of like a
spinner and a cube or something ones are
definitely really cool it's easier to
balance just like a center and then it's
got some things in the phidget tube I
wonder what these tabs are for I don't
know this is very strange and it makes a
nice sound the clicking help if that was
they like get some tension out kind of
like a stress ball I know you'd do it
like that there we go Oh like this ah
that rings me like so much simple
 I didn't think I needed
something like this but now that I've
been using it I could see this being
really useful
where years old definitely in class
everywhere you know somebody has trouble
paying attention and would fidget in
another way if I'm fidgeting otherwise
people would really see here is
secret I feel secure with the weight
just something to hold on to and kind of
play with them something to do with my
hands kind of comfy no I sit I don't
want to give it up I'm just trying to
see how long it's going to consider
going with a perpetual motion machine

doesn't stop hello my name is Dale and
