I don't want always what's left store
sweet cheese to leading us is all will
ever trust ya know I don't always
we'll go
through wastelands through the highways
zoom a shadow through the sunrays
on the way melodies we haven't played I
don't wanna know
I go in around these walls planning to
create a song
we'll go through the wastelands through
the highways through my shadow to
sunrays and
and we'll probably number if you burn
them to see the horizon so duster
and will grow the number phew
to see the whole
we'll go
and
sell me this pencil a rebar cane
we have successfully identified and
solved a number of issues with existing
pencils it's a pleasure to introduce to
you magna as design engineers is in our
nature to challenge and innovates
products we use every day
other products use a full release or
incremental action which dictates the
lead position our patent-pending
magnetic propulsion technology offers
finite controllability unlike other
pencils the secret to our revolutionary
invention is concealed within the core
of the pencil the outer sleeve
synchronizes position to the inner
magnet shielded within the premium grade
aluminium body it works like magic
every detail has been considered whilst
it may not be visible to the naked eye
the ends of the pencil are slightly
larger in diameter to prevent the sleeve
from falling off
we have sourced our manufacturers paid
for tooling and have received our final
prototypes
so now we need your help to raise the
funds and hits and minimum order
quantities it really is the last piece
of the puzzle we want to make our dream
a reality and start shipping these
fantastic new products to your door we
strongly believe that making profits you
become a second to great design
therefore we price these pencils an
extremely affordable rate to make them
accessible to the wider Kickstarter
community a product with this level of
consideration really is a tool for life
and perfect as a gift for your family
and friends so now it's up to you to
help us bring the pencil into the 21st
century thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
