it's 7:30 8 a.m. and your family's
heading out the door
dad's going on a work trip mom's headed
to the office loop and Sarah off to
school it's nice to know that Gus will
guard the house while you're out but
luckily you also have this guy to keep
an eye on things
lighthouse is a new kind of smart home
device that's actually smart it knows
the difference between your dog your dog
walker and any unexpected dog walkers
ask lighthouse to let you know what time
your kids get home from school to let
you know if they're running late or if
Sarah comes home with a brad lighthouse
will recognize that she has a guest with
her and moms notification gives her a
chance to welcome him herself lighthouse
also recognizes certain gestures like
waving so Luke can get dad's attention
while he's out of town really cool and
if mom comes home to discover something
out of place all she has to do is ask
did the dog jump on the couch today
maybe the better question is who is
running between 3:00 to 5:00 p.m.
and that's why we created lighthouse
simply put lighthouse is the first of
its kind it uses a 3d time-of-flight
sensor and the most advanced computer
vision and machine learning ever put
into a home device with this kind of
smarts you can keep your home and family
safe while engaging with your loved ones
in a totally new way because it's about
time a smart home device actually knew
the difference between this this and
this welcome home dad say hello to the
future
say hello to lighthouse find out more at
lighthouse bending the water leaves us
feeling refreshed awakened an enameled
meditative state scientists even call
this sensation the blue mine
it seems pretty ironic that something
attributed to such a peaceful state
continues to take lives
year after year in 2017 almost 300
australians drowned in rivers beaches
and harbors the World Health
Organization recorded over 360,000
drownings globally lifejackets aren't
hard to come by we just avoid using them
because they're not designed for
performance or comfort we want to change
this let me introduce the Aqua Tron see
pal
it's the lifejacket just reinvented it's
lightweight non-invasive and effective
we've created these products to be
suitable for both adrenaline fueled
watersports and what same water
activities even swim training to deploy
simply pull on the red ripcord and
you'll be buoyant in seconds they can be
used over and over again by replacing
the co2 cannister rinsing off any
saltwater and repacking them in a few
simple steps
after countless iterations our products
and our suitable for Australian
compliance and the quality is second to
none
we're on kick started to get your help
we formed a partnership with an industry
leading manufacturer and are ready to
place our first order
we need $50,000 in pre-orders to help
cover certification expenses and our
initial order help us increase water
safety and reduce the number of water
related fatalities by sharing this video
or making a donation every little bit
helps if we can save a single life then

worthwhile

hi guys this is Tim with tactical walls
and behind me we've got one of our
travel displays it's one of the displays
we had out at SHOT Show this year as
well as the great American outdoor show
in Pennsylvania you already know we've
got some of the fastest access firearm
storage on the market I'm gonna prove
that point right now with our magnetic
keys one on each side we've got access
to our Tavor in here go ahead and close
it up locks it right back up that's our
1242 we've been doing that now for about
a year very fast access but what we're
really excited about is a new product
for this year it's our RFID model so
initially it's going to be on the 825 a
8:12 the 1420 and the 1450 product line
and it works just like this you take
your RFID key place it right up top and
the shelf opens right up now like I said
this is our display we've had this thing
to shot show we've had it out to the
great American outdoors show and we have
literally opened and closed this
particular 825 thousands and thousands
of times some of the additional features
of the RFID system is that you're able
to actually program multiple products to
the same key card and you're also able
to program multiple key cards to one
product so if you wanted to be able to
give out keys to two or three different
people to have access to your home
defense weapons you're able to do that
or if you want to be able to unlock four
different products in four different
parts of your home you're able to do
that as well so that's one of the really
neat things about the rfid technology
another thing is you can see it in this
form is a key card you could put it in
your wallet you can carry around with
you everywhere you go or in the case of
this book we have one just stowed away
right inside that lets you open it right
up something that's real close by right
on the shelf now you can hear it's
actually chiming if you leave your
product open for too long it will let
you know that you've left it unlocked
it's a safety feature it's also able to
be disengaged and you can turn that off
that's our new RFID 825 come check out
these awesome products and the rest of
our line at tactical walls comm take
care and God bless
tres is a action sports tracker it's a
small little device the size of a
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and you mount
your snowboard your surfboard your
wakeboard whatever and tells you how
fast you're going and how many waves
you've cut how many calories you burn
for skiing snowboarding it'll tell you
things like air time how high you're
jumping which lifts you were on a bunch
of other things but basically it
measures your activity
tres will also auto edit video footage
for you so if you're taking video with a
GoPro or a Sony or Canon you can
actually put the video into our auto
editor and it'll edit out all the
highlights for you as well as color
correct and overlay your stats all
automatically
definitely some of the differences
between you know some of the other
gadgets that are out there would be that
it's physically mounted audiosurf ports
there's nothing that's on your arm or
you know any kind of odd you know stat
that can be thrown there it's something
that's going to be as close to the water
as possible and so you're gonna get you
know the closest results and it's so
easy is kind of stick it on your board
and I just like to face it and you're
good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
