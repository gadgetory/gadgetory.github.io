my name is DJ Brunner and I'm one of the
founders of precast we have created a
wireless live streaming system available
for all creators I also want a
production company called anthem films
and I've worked in nearly every role in
film production wireless video and live
streaming is a tool all filmmakers can
use to benefit their productions my name
is Clayton Blaha I'm a co-founder of
free cast I've also been skateboarding
my entire life and I co-founded the
record label out slow I'm always looking
for opportunities to help take content
creation to the next level being a
filmmaker you have a lot of moments
where you realize how lucky you are I've
traveled the world and I've worked with
amazing artists like Selena Gomez
Lindsey Stirling and ASAP Rocky a few
years ago we started asking is there a
better way to share this experience what
if we could livestream from any camera
how would that change film production we
decided to create an affordable solution
that could change content creation
forever
during our beta test phase free cast has
already changed the way we think about
wireless video and live streaming we
have three free cast models standard pro
and universal standard and pro kits work
with gopro cameras and our universal kit
works with any camera with HDMI out
you can also livestream from any DSLR or
HDMI camera to your social network the
free cast app lets you watch live record
footage and live stream in real time you
can view your footage on any iOS device
as well as any monitor with HDMI in you
can also be your footage up to five
hundred meters away from your camera
we've been using free casts and three
basic ways to cast your iOS device to
cast the production monitors and of
course to cast your social network
it's lightweight and we designed to
deliver professional quality video at a
price that even the smallest budget
productions can afford we are ready to
manufacture and we want your help

your world more freely
