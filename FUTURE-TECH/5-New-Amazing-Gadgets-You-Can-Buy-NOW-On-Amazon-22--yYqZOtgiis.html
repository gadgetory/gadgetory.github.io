from drowning this year that's why it's
our mission if Kinji to provide water
safety hi I'm Tom agape Oddie's I came
up with the idea of Kinsey after I lost
a very good friend of mine three years
ago he drowned in the lake similar to
this one and it could have been
prevented when you drive a car you put
your seatbelt on when you ride a bike
you put on your helmet but how did you
protect yourself in water you set out to
make the smallest inflatable in the
world and we came up with a convenient
non-intrusive way to provide safety to
all of those in and around water
this is Kinji affordable floatation
device that comfortably secures onto
your wrist it's fast to deploy durable
and contained within a compact design
Tingy helps in case of exhaustion or
heavy currents or when there's poor
circulation or cramps anytime you're on
the water even if you're just relaxing
you'll want a Kinji for you and a friend
we like kenji because it's small doesn't
get your way when you're trying to
paddle out a lot of times when you're
surfing there's not a lifeguard anywhere
near so this gives you a little bit more
sense of security
Kinji can stay inflated for over 48
hours it includes a compass as well as a
whistle for signaling help in case of
emergency having knowledge of your
judgement and first steps in water
safety but Tingy can be an important aid
when you're need it's easy and fast
deploy and it's already been great on
Kinji is durable and the co2 cartridge
is replaceable so you can reuse Kinji as
many times as needed we need your help
to stop production and fight the dangers
of drowning with your support you become
an integral part of our team of
ambassadors and you'll be the first to
receive a kingdom do it for yourself do
it for your friends surf mates fishing
models and your family together we can
revolutionize water safety on the global
scale join the movement if you're like
me your phone is basically always on
you're texting using your apps clicking
your tweets and even in the car you have
this compulsion to treat it the same way
but you can't because when you do bad
things happen Oh mother you can mount
your phone on the dash for navigation
sure is that any safer no it's not bad
you need your eyes in front of you you
need Navi
now be in the portable device we put on
your dashboard with every mobile app
you'd move keep your eyes on the road
ahead
it's a heads-up displays just like what
commercial airline pilots use when
they're landing you hear that pilots
using safe there's a timing super high
quality projector that puts the UI on
the transparent screen in the field of
view projected like it's 2 meters out in
front of you so you never have to adjust
your focus away from your driver it
connects wirelessly to your phone on iOS
or Android and has its own apps all
designed around the driving experience
hi mom
I am just wanted to say I love you ok I
love you I'm making a video right now ok
I love you you use hand gestures and
your voice to control read new text hey
bro where are you reply
I'm right here friend share my location
place sugar beet sugar beet
it's a fake band name I made it up for
this video I want to introduce you to
somebody
this is Doug Navitus his thing is real
excited about it it's really cool and I
think you're going to want me driving
with Doug and navigate feels like
driving in the future said and I think

these are activity trackers they help
you become healthier move more lose
weight sleep better you get it this is
also a tracker and it helps you become
healthier too except it's the lighting
so what happens when you take the same
principles that help you become more
active and use them to help you quit
smoking you gets equipment
the world's first smart aligner it
lights your cigarettes using an equip
and tracks every time you smoke it shows
you how much you've smoked how long it's
been since your last one it helps you
stay on course to achieve your goals
learning your smoking habits simple with
the quick adapt you can take a closer
look at your trends and set custom goals
to quit about a year ago my friend asked
me how many cigarettes I took that day
and I realized I really wasn't sure
sometimes
you light up without even thinking about
it the quickly tracks when you smoke so
you can be mindful and start to cut out
cigarettes one violet if you can measure
it you can manage it visualize your
progress and share it with the built-in
community we're big into the power of
customization so you can even limit when
or how often the lighter works the clip
that can be used alone but it also plays
nicely with others we had a team of
industrial designers that have created
something wonderful so you can be proud
of quitting we also wanted it to last so
we've been living in China for the last
four months working directly with
factories and suppliers to make sure we
produce something quality and that will
stick by your side no matter how long
the tape
with your support we can go through
large-scale manufacturing and finalize
that you can't wait to get the equipment
into your hands and see how you use it
please Bacchus help spread the word and
join our journey
thank you
hi my name is Glenn clucker this is my
son Nathan I've been a engineer and
designer and inventor for about 14 years
now and I've designed a lot of knives
and multi tools that you might be
familiar with I came up with the idea
for the clacks last year over the last
six months I've been designing
developing prototyping and testing out
the clacks
to end up with the floor versions that
we have here today the clacks is more
than an axe the clacks is a multi-tool
built into the head of an axe it has a
lot of useful features carabiner thumb
jimping this is the bottle opener the
axe blade the scraper lanyard hole a
hammer with a built-in ruler five wrench
sizes and a hex bit driver the clacks
has a lot of useful features like
wrenches hammer head and scraper along
with our innovative new clamping system
that allows you to take the axe to the
field and be able to break it down for
easy transport flax is useful for people
who are involved in hiking climbing
camping survival experts people who do
bushcraft all sorts of things including
emergency preparedness I'm Mike peel for
Mike Pihl logging Vernonia Oregon and
I'm a logger the clacks it's a great
tool this morning I use it to wedge over
a Douglas fir tree and it did a good job
this is the klax lumberjack it's our
most popular model because it includes
all of the features this is the clacks
woodsman the clacks woodsman has the
clamping system carabiner hammer the axe
blade but the more rustic version that
we've created is called the clacks
teller the clacks feller attaches using
the paracord bracelet by pulling the
paracord out and wrapping it around the
handle like you would a tomahawk this is
the tie clacks the tie clacks is a
titanium version of the clocks
lumberjack it is our top of the line
model and it includes all of the
features plus it has blue anodized
highlights and it comes weighing in at
half of the weight of the feller that's
why the tie clacks is our top of the
line model we've backed two dozen
projects on our own already we're
reaching out to you the Kickstarter
community to see if you'll help us by
backing us to get the clasp out there
class thanks for watching we appreciate
your support
relax more than an axe
welcome to the loop QuickStart guide the
loop litter box is designed to make
cleaning your litter box quick simple
and easy we recommend changing your
litter box at least once a day for best
results start by stacking the 3 sifting
trays so that the rockers on adjacent
trays alternate and overlap a shell
add approximately 15 pounds of clumping
cat litter to an approximate depth of 3
to 4 inches all cats are unique when it
comes to the use of their litter box be
mindful to maintain a litter level that
allows liquids to clump before reaching
the bottom of the tray please allow
adequate time for liquids to dry before
sifting to clean lift the top tray to
separate the waste from a clean litter
keep the sifting trello inside the
bottom tray while sifting to minimize
dust being gentle helps minimize clump
breakage once the waste is separated
tilt the tray to collect a waste into
the corner for easy disposal after
disposing them anyways check the tray to
make sure no litter clubs have adhered
to the plastic surface
wait the tray clean with a paper towel
if necessary turn the tray 180 degrees
and place it at the bottom of the stack
you'll know the bottom tray is turned
the right way when it matches the same
orientation as the top tray and a stack
lift the two tray stack containing the
litter by the outer edge of the lower
tray gently place the stack in the
bottom tray wiggle the loop while it is
on the floor after cleaning to even out
litter in the pan and you're done from
time to time top up the litter level as
necessary to maintain a minimum depth of
3 to 4 inches for additional information

may have please go to luscom slash
