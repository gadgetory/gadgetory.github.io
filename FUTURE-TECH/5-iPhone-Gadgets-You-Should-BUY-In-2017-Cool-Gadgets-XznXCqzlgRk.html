this shift button way clear shift on
shift off upper lower next I need a
quicker way to edit so give me more
control over the cursor how about like
this

emojis because why type where I can
express exactly how I feel with an icon
of a poop let's put the emojis right
here so there one tap away and then lift
them all here with a simple scroll and I
want you to suggest the emoji that best

tell my mom I was shopping and you said

we are all in love with smartphones and
tablets while you get the hottest phone
the number one tech problem remains weak
battery life introducing the you
speeding the first charging table that
not only doubles your charging speed but
also maximizes battery life with
healthier longer-lasting charges
featuring LED indicator magnet again
durable exterior and the right length
devices you smarter each year but the
charger still gets met it breaks and it
slowly kills the precious battery with
heat and many cycles so experts warn us
don't leave your fully charged phone
plugged in lithium-ion batteries can
overheat when charged for too long
samsung says unplug once charge is
complete and Apple tells us remove
certain cases during charging but we
can't always follow them tenets that's
why we created goose Lee once fully
charged to speedy cuts off the power
completely so you don't have to unplug
removing battery damages overnight and
extending battery life the next day when
you finish syncing simply touch the
button to switch into smart and fast
mode now you sleevee charges your phone
twice as fast cutting your charging time
in half
store you speeding using its magnetic
ends next to your bed in your car on
your desk behind your desktop each use
speedy cable comes with a durable and
colorful printed exterior so no more
afraid or 10 report
you deserve better charging experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
