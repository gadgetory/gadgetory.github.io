within seconds is easily mounted to the
top of the weapon there is no
obstruction to the sight picture for the
operator and there's no obstruction to
the functionality of the weapon or the
rail system it still allows an officer
the ability to attach a flashlight on
their weapon once the weapon is fired
the bullet travels down the barrel
embedding itself inside the alloy
projectile with no chance of escaping
instantly becoming one solid unit the
projectile immediately separates from
the weapon as the docking unit is
instantly ejected then a new bullet is
cycled in for follow-up shots if
necessary the alternative is as accurate
as the operator using it once the
projectile impacts the threat it will
send a shock wave of pain to the suspect
without the internal damage that a
penetrating bullet would cause and now
here's a simulation of police training
and when to utilize the alternative
drop it drop it less lethal less lethal
the salvo 12 contains a system of rods
and baffles to contain the blast of a
shotgun
the rods allow gas to escape into the
baffles while preserving the function of
the wad after it exits the barrel the
salvo 12 attaches to your shotgun
through a removable choke system a
variety of chokes are available to fit
your specific weapon the modular system
of rods baffles and caps allows for the
customization of the salvo 12 depending
on your desired weight and noise
reduction specs this also allows for
easy cleaning of the suppressor we have
seen significant reduction in decibel
levels making the blast of a shotgun
quieter and an unsuppressed 22 rifle the
salvo 12 also significantly improves the
perceived recoil of a shotgun making
shooting a more enjoyable experience for
all

being a gun owner is not just buying a
gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained

mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoras locked

tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel

unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need

direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter

your weapon without looking at it even
