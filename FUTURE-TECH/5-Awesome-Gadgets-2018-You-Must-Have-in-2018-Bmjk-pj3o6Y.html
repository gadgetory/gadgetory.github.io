changed in decades and I intend to

carbon fiber ring named the Triton

glow-in-the-dark stripes and comes in
four colors green aqua blue and purple
it can also be ordered three different
widths full medium or narrow the ring
has loomed directly infused into the
carbon fiber composite material itself
when you take one of my rings out of the
package and put it on your finger and
see it light up for the first time I
know it'll make you smile I want to
change the world one finger at a time

say 40% on the new triton design

you
damn that's smooth it's really just the
fact that you can just throw a camera in
between these little spots and cracks
you've never been able to do before it's
the same priceless really hi I'm Andrea
from Barrow where we aim to make the
impossible film shop possible
introducing the next generation cable
cam we enable easy filming in places
even drones can't go
this is the viral life the first ever
portable and easy to use cable cam the
light kit is the perfect extension to
your existing camera setup the viral
light is foldable making it easy to
carry with you in a backpack and with
the intuitive mounting system it can be
set up in less than three minutes we
wanted to create something that will
make people go WOW how did they do that
when they saw the video going through
windows cars really Packwood's
or other places where you would never
imagine flying a camera but at the same
time keep it so simple that anyone can
use it
even though it's the first time
operating a cable camp you would
definitely be successful
the viral light goes faster to follow
the action of high speed and slow enough
to capture the perfect time-lapse shot
and the battery will it last up to three
hours with lights indicating how much
you have left
that is so cool exactly the tools that
we needed in the sport it takes less
than a minute setup and your way to go
get the bangin shots just like the pros
with our background from arranging and
filming extreme sport events and
festivals we have seen that more and
more filmmakers from beginner to pro
level are seeking new angles when
capturing their most extreme and
memorable moments on video that's why we
wanted to make viral light available for
everyone and compatible with any camera
and stabilizer up to three point three
pops
have to admit first few times I used it
I got a little bit carried away of the
speed and it finger was gonna go as fast
as it did which is pretty damn fast I
always came back up and kept asking for
more even shooting films professionally
for about seven years and I've never
seen a product that can do that with our
strong team of engineers filmmakers and
athletes we're bringing this product to
life here on Kickstarter we've iterated
and tested the product with lead users
from all over the world and the product
is now ready for manufacturing but we
need your help to press play on
production back us today and you can
start to be creative with your film
angles and to make that impossible shot
possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
