what matters say music oh hi how are you
what I want to hear Michael Jackson
Michael Jackson from iHeartRadio what's
in the news
here's your flash briefing from reddit
the shower thought as a child I
pretended to like carrots for my parents
as an adult I pretend to like them for
my child I hate carrots but what's the
matter right now the Los Angeles is 52
degrees with clear skies today's
forecast has mostly sunny weather with a
high of 62 degrees in the lower 46
degrees with that timer for five seconds
five seconds starting now
this is air bar air bar brings touch to
your new or existing PC by projecting an
invisible light field over the screen
and what's good about light is that it
responds to pretty much anything so you
can slide with your gloves or long
fingernails pinch with your chopsticks
scroll while you're cooking or why not
use a paintbrush
you get the idea with air bar you get
touch gestures when you need them it's
easy to attach it's sleek it won't drain
your battery and you can unplug it when
you want to best of all there's no
manual no installation it's plug and
touch it just works air bar plug and
touch when you need it yeah well I don't
really know where to start
Rango was probably the coolest cat on
the face of the planet used to ride up
to work with me on my motorcycle used to
go to a cafe to get out there's a
critical relationship and eventually I
came across a note stuck to a tree
saying that they had found this really
beautiful tabby cat dead on the side of
the road I decided if nobody else had
found a way of tracking cats and dogs
then I was certainly going to so this is
pod life it's the smallest and lightest
GPS tracker in market has an
interchangeable battery it's waterproof
it has bluetooth but the most important
thing is that this device can be
attached to your animals collar and sync
to your phone allowing you to always
know where your animal is you never have
to worry about losing your phone again
we've spent a lot of time getting the
product design absolutely bang-on the
ergonomic design is really cool with no
sharp edges so it's as comfortable as
possible for the animal the app is a
really sleek user experience that's both
fun and functional to you and we've
squeezed as much as we can out of the
battery life getting up to a week's
usage I don't know you be inconsolable
would give off your dog not knowing
where they are or what they're doing
with their live or well he's that type
that tends to just wander and then we
rely on other people to bring him back
but we're always worried that there'll
be a time when we lose them forever
they're one of the most amazing features
that we've developed is a pet League
which is like a social network for your
animal this is going to allow you to
compare your animals results across the
world so you'll be able to determine
whether you've got the fastest dog in
the park
or the most adventurous cat in the
country the app also allows you to set
safe zone alerts so you can actually see
when your animal breaches the set
perimeter through an alert on your phone
you know here just he disappears you
guys are adventures it's cool like that
just to be able to see what he's done
tell us how fast each dog ran and then
we can just compare them to see which
one Scott Maggie's fast last for the
perfect day
so we're really excited because we have
confirmed orders from some of the
largest pet retailers in the world we've
finalized the design and we're just
about to go into the final stages of
production we really need some help in
production and that's why we'd like you
to support us in this campaign and make
sure that nobody ever has to go through
the pain of losing your animal again
like I did
it is a wrist-worn sub-woofer which is
exactly what it sounds like you put it
on your wrist you sync it up with this
little dongle right here plug that into
your phone play music it syncs up with
the music and it sends bass vibrations
through your arm so really the source of
life I met with the company a couple of
days ago and the first thing that I
asked was you know why is this something
that anybody would possibly want and
it's they basically told me to try it
out so I did and it's kind of anything
it's supposed to simulate the experience
of going to a live show and you know
really feeling the music in your body
and you you do you know did it vibrates
your arm but you feel it very very
localized it says $200 of ice so it's
really pricey essentially what they're
saying is anyone who's really an
audiophile is you know going to spend a
lot of money on a pair of headphones so
I guess why not spend an extra $200 on a
wrist form subwoofer I don't really
think the technology is there yet it's
an interesting company it's really
interesting tech you know I know that
they're meeting with a lot of other
folks you know game developers music
companies and things like that in order
to build the tactic into system so it
could potentially make VR a more
immersive experience in the future but
right now this is about as close as
you're going to get and watch us today
it's $199 and it's a baked foot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
