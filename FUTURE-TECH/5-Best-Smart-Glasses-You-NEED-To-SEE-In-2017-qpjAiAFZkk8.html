single day over the years they've
adapted from magnifying spectacles to
key fashion accessories however one

ever before so change the way you wear
glasses change the way you live get let
glass now and open your eyes to a whole
new world of style and convenience
hallo tor is one of the hololens launch
experiences it's a travel experience
that makes you feel like you've been
transported to a place and feel like
you're really there
it's a crazy goal feel like you're
really there what does that even mean
like how could you ever possibly achieve
that we were able to take video and
blend it with some 3d geometry near the
user so you can get up out of your chair
and experience the world around you as
you go the fact that's untethered you
can actually walk on the room you can
turn around there are no wires to be in
your way and that's just something that
you just can't get on another device my
favorite moment in Rome is when you
travel back in time in the Coliseum and
watch a gladiator fight from the
perspective of the Emperor that's a
really cool way to connect with history
that you can't even get even when you're
there the app developer side of this it
is very approachable a lot of your
design stems from a user's natural
behavior when the users head is the
virtual camera the user turns their head
where they want and that drives the
virtual camera that controls what
they're seeing and so finding ways to
use body movements that match what your
app is doing that's really the challenge
with the sound because we have a very
accurate understanding of where the
users head is in space we can localize
those sounds and make them feel like
you're actually in the real world in
exactly the same way that we do with
Holograms the sound source feels like
it's coming from that location I feel
like it taps into these sort of
underlying subconscious behaviors you
know you can sort of start localizing
things just by sounding like oh it
sounds like it's right up there
as long as you focus on building
experiences that bring these Holograms
into your real world it doesn't really
matter precisely what they're about as
long as you're building human centered
experiences Paulo tor is showing you
what this device can do and I hope that
it's an inspiration for people that want
to build their own apps with a mixed
reality device the real key is that
ability to navigate the physical space
very comfortably well at the same time
occupying this immersive virtual space
it still feels like magic

tour of jets main features then we'll
show you how to set things up to make
