your mouse 3d print a toy for your child
in the comforts of your own home what if
you could create gifts for your friends
and minutes introducing the 101 hero
mini 3d printer the most affordable 3d
printer in the world we work with the
best in the industry to ensure a compact
and easy to use design simply turn it on
insert a memory card and print anything
imaginable the beauty of the 101 hero
mini is in its simplicity
all you have to do is download one of
thousands of lab tested g-code files
from our website save it to your SD card
and make it real with one touch we think
that everyone should have access to 3d
printing technology and it's for this
reason that we've made the 101 hero mini
the most affordable way to 3d print the
hero mini uses a new technology to drive
the plastic extruding motor and we've
come up with many innovations in the
structure and design of the printer
itself with these adaptations you're
able to have the same functionality of a
high-end 3d printer but for a fraction
of the cost
meanwhile we've also worked hard to
ensure a safe design so the 101 here how
many can be enjoyed by the young and old
alike the 101 hero mini represents an
entirely new medium for kids engineers
artists and makers have you ever dreamt
of improving your home with crown
molding or refrain one faced with a
tricky business of getting it right
crown moldings are one of the
architectural features that really add
value to upend they add a visual
presence that makes a home feel more
upscale although until now installing
crown molding has been a task that
strikes fear in the heart of every
amateur carpenter even from
professionals because the molding sits
at an angle on the wall each joint is
made of compound angles and hard to get
right the biggest problem has always
been cutting the angles rather than the
actual installation the angles in a room
of the ship slightly and very few rooms
have exactly square corners with 90
degrees because it comes out from the
wall it really is the 3d cuts not
getting it right makes a pine consuming
and expensive because you get a lot of
ways and that is enough to make you lose
your mind luckily we have a solution for
you one cut is a world cup and good
measurement tool that lets you get it
right at the first try it makes no
difference whether it's an outer or
inner angle you have to measure you can
keep the instrument up against the stall
for precise cut
no more calculations no complicated
settings of the stall no more trial and
error but perfect results each time
without wasted a failed efforts so say
goodbye to ugly gaps and crown molding
join this handy little tool will help
you take on crown molding installations
along with other molding projects such
as base molding all kinds of frames and
many other woodwork project after
numbers design iterations and prototypes
we finally have a fully functional world
patented solution we worked closely with
industrial leaders to find the best
materials and refine details we have
manufacturers ready the only thing
missing
performance check below for more
information about the project and the
various reward levels you can only make
one kind of reality if we reach our goal
so please support us now we're super
excited to see what you can create with
one cup thank you for watching I wanted
a good keyboard and there weren't any
out there I figured well how hard could
this be
and then we built the best keyboard we
possibly could
it's not what you'd expect from a
keyboard but people love it
creating a keyboard is kind of a weird
thing it's been an obsession hi I'm
Jesse Vincent I'm co-founder and CTO of
keyboard EO I'm kaya Dekker I'm the CEO
of keyboard EO I'm also married to Jesse
most people are typing eight plus hours
a day on uncomfortable flat plastic
boxes that are pretty much the same as
they were a hundred years ago you
deserve something better
the musicians not like well just take
the plastic guitar up a shelf it'll be
fine
when I'm staking my entire career and my
you know my professional everything on
this like they're really thinking about
it I found a bunch of research but
better keyboard layouts higher hands
work and what actually matters in
keyboard design and every keyboard
design in the last 20 years is flat-out
ignored so we built a good keyboard the
model one is different it takes some
getting used to but it's worth it the
model one is that great sort of tool
that supports the way you want to work
and then gets out of the way and lets
you do the kind of work that you
couldn't have done without it and I love
the way my fingertips kind of rest in
the Kuban have easy the keys are to
reach we're trying to build a keyboard
you'll enjoy using for years we have
this gorgeous maple wood enclosure
we've sculpted the key caps to guide
your fingers right keys and yeah advise
us the LEDs that glows from under each
key are actually totally customizable
and programmable originally the
butterfly shape was an accident but we
love it it feels warm it feels friendly
I bring the keyboard out in public and
people look at it and say can I touch it
it's a keyboard you're supposed to touch
it that's the whole point up till now
we've been designing and designing and
designing and testing and testing and
testing we've made dozens of prototypes
before we liked one enough to call it
the model one and now we're going to
make a few thousand I've spent most of
my career building open-source software
it was important enough that we build an
amazing product that wasn't going to be
locked down most products get worse over
time
open products get better because it's
open source hardware I know that I can
customize it to my needs and then share
those customizations with the community
you're going to get firmware source code
you're going to get schematics to the
electronics you're going to get a
screwdriver even if you never touch a
line of code plenty of other type is
swill and their work will make your
keyboard better this is a tool that I
can use over the next 20 years in my
career because it's going to grow with
me and so now it's possible for us to
come to all of you and share with you
what we're making thank you for paying
attention it means a lot to us if typing
matters to you please back our
Kickstarter
