I'm a cool mom but things need to be
under control well have you seen my
notebook Thanks there isn't a lot that
goes on around here without me knowing
about it I mean have you seen me Thanks
and when it comes to my home it's no
different healthy home coach monitors
the vitals of my home so I don't have to
worry about the things that I can't see
or hear it lets me know when things can
be better better I can check every room
in the house for my phone and make
adjustments of any two seems like it's a
bit too loud in my little ones room and
nap time is extremely important
extremely important
healthy home coach also monitors indoor
air quality just great because indoor
air can be much more polluted than
outside air oh no it's like having eyes
in the back of my head to shame when all
is good make sure you know healthy home
coach helps me take care of the people I
love most these guys guys for us it's
not a tire it's not a wheel quite
frankly it's not like anything else
you've ever seen
it's the Michelin xed wheel turn and
it's only on john deere z track zero
turn mowers so what sets this apart from
every other dramatic tire on earth first
of all the michelin text wheel surface
area it has all the qualities you want
in a pneumatic tire but it never means
air so say goodbye to flat downtime and
patch kids but how it performs is where
the Michelin X Tweel turf really shines
you think the Michelin X field turf has
a unique construction the outer portion
is a strong yet flexible being called a
sheer being this beam is connected to
the inner tub by thin yet very strong
deformable spoke as contact with a
surface such as asphalt or Turkish apply
the folks at the bottom daquan taking
the force of the service providing a
unique energy transfer that reduces
found the result is a much smoother ride
take a look at how the missile and he'll
takes on a bum crack versus a pneumatic
tire you easily see that while the
pneumatic can't cushion the shock of the
bum crack the michelin tuile easily
cushions the impact of beans can
everyone and in the area of wear and
tear a Michelin x12 search has no
competition since it's made of
automotive grade public it delivers a
consistent footprint with Sloan we're
lights that is three times that of an
anatomic so whether it's nails or black
or anything else to fit ruin or
penetrated mattifier the Michelin X
tuile turf just peaceful
remember it's not a tire it's not a
wheel it's the Michelin X tuile turf
made exclusively for John Deere's
e-track mowers for more than the
Michelin XP will serve go to John Deere
calm / steal supplies are limited
keep mowing
you
ha
Oh
every once in a while a revolutionary
product comes along that changes
everything I'd like you to meet the
bubble here it all started five years
ago when I was working for a company
called immersive media at that time they
were working with Google to create what
is now known as Street food a problem
the market that I saw was that spherical
technology was only being used for the
mapping you could probably use it for
some other things like panoramic photos
and filmmaking interactive videos we
decided upon ourselves to make something
special the global cam doesn't just
capture photos or videos but also
streams live videos we want to make this
technology affordable small so portable
and available to every people are
accustomed to shooting panoramas with
their mobile phone there's a problem
with that it's inherently at a sync with
the bubble can you press the button once
and boom you've got your photos your
video and you pop it in our software you
can look all around it's amazing we've
designed the camera in a tetrahedral
orientation ventra there no blind spots
because each camera overlaps the joining
camp no other camera that we've seen on
the market is able to handle that as
well as put it in their form factor
that's the size of a baseball that's
light portable and easy to prepare out a
few in any environment that you want to
record with bubbles patent-pending
tetrahedral design you'll get 14
megapixel photos h.264 video capturing
1080p 15 frames per second in 720p at 30
frames per second wife I live streaming
a microSD slot and USB streaming I
really think people are going to want to
buy the bubble camera just because of
his ability to shoot in many different
directions the fact is it takes in all
views in real time whether it be
security and surveillance action sports
gaming real estate teleconferencing I
really do think the opportunities are
Liz with bubbles SDK an API our goal is
to allow people to experiment and
explore with this new technology we've
seen it used in music videos before with
the black eye peas back we've seen the
commercial used for I kien Budweiser one
of the most exciting things that I'm
looking forward to seeing how filmmakers
are going to be using 360 video it's a
whole new way to shoot things and create
interactive experiences and a new way of
telling story body-mind change is a
co-production between tip and the CFC
media lab we can start to figure out
what we can do it in and I'm really
excited about the insulation work the
video work the interactive work that you
can do a technology like this we've
designed a bubble chem to be ready and
available to everyone you don't have to
make a choice sometimes you want that
straight on shot that one angle but
they're going to be moments where you
want to see everything with your health
we're going to make 360 degrees of your
world available at any time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
