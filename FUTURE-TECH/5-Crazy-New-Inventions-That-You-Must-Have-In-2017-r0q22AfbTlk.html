been developing a new technology that
once only existed in science fiction
today we invited our friends to
experience the magic behind using kayo
for the first time all right well let's
talk about what we're doing here today
what if I told you guys that you could
control your home and bring to life the
space around you with no screens no
physical remotes and no yelling across
the room just this meet hey it
transforms the space and objects around
you into a set of magical remote
controls with just a simple movement of
your hand
hey-ohh allows you to control lights
music television temperature and much
more setup is quite simple place heyo in
the space of your choice connected to
your Wi-Fi and then heyo will
automatically 3d scan your space once
scanning is complete
using hyo's augmented reality app you
can create a virtual button on an object
or even in thin air to control any of
your favorite devices and that's it
wherever you live
hey√∂ connects the space around you with
you whenever you want for whatever you
need
how would you feel about some music
right now
seeing people discovers a magic being
here is an incredible feeling but this
is just a beginning we are integrating
new features another time
Haley will grow smarter we need your
help to go through the manufacturing
process we want to improve here and we
want to bring it to your home please
join us
Thanks
excuse me I don't know how to buy this
ticket
I wanted with a nice view
it's very karaoke near here
to Los Angeles when it comes to romance
is it better to listen to your hearts or
your head or should you just let your
bra listen to your heart for you and
take your head out of the equation
entirely I'm Jen Marcum I'm buzz60
Japanese lingerie brand Ravager says
it's developed a bra that could only be
unhooked for true love how do any of us
know what true love is
and how does this bra know well the
company claims a sensor and one of the
bra cups
sends heart rate data to a smartphone
app via bluetooth if the app concludes
the heart rate falls in the true love
zone which is very dubiously described
as somewhere below jogging but above
eating spicy food it sends a signal to
the bra and an unhooks automatically not
in the true love zone bra stays on but
until when some poor woman is trapped in
the same bra she can't wash and as
digging into her skin forever until the
right guy comes along as if being single
isn't hard enough the company bills the
bra as a way to protect women from
unwanted advantage but I'm pretty sure
they already have some much more
effective technologies for that we're
sorry your call cannot be completed as
dialed from the phone you are using
buzz60 now you know pass it on Gina is a
start-up footwear company that
specializes in adjustable height heels
bringing convenience flexibility and
practicality to the everyday woman we
women love our heels and it's easy to
see why they elongate our legs and
enhance the femininity of our gear but
we've also developed a love/hate
relationship with them the sharp pains
aches and cramps but why do they have to
be this way
women shouldn't have to suffer to look
and feel amazing this motivated us to
change the conventional heal we wanted
to create something that could bring you
through your busiest day and still look
great at that dinner party
Gina's heels are able to transform from
a 2cm to a 9 cm heel these heights were
selected after an online poll of over
10,000 women which found these to be the
most comfortable and practical Hugh
Heights for walking switching from high
to low can be done in a matter of
seconds giving your feet a break
whenever you feel like it
our heels are made from napa leather
which is known for his luxurious feel
softness and durability
this also means you won't need to bring
into our heels and for the extra comfort
with integrated additional cushioning
throughout the heel so that you won't
have to purchase additional padding
design for everyday wear our prototypes
were subjected to a four-month long
testing period to ensure that every heel
continues to provide comfort remains
durable even after being exposed to the
elements our heels come in two styles a
classic and bus stop pump and send us
for more casual look switching the heel
is easy just release the catch push the
heel up and click to lock the store the
heel release the catch pull the heel
down and wait for the click being able
to share this model design with every
woman and making their life that much
easier is what we want to achieve
visit our Kickstarter page for more
information
we live in a world today where so much
natural beauty of this world remains
there is so much to see so much to
experience so much nature to explore it
would be a waste not to see more if
there was a way to save the nature we
have untouched and unspoiled from modern
industrialism would you take part and
support it with the protection of nature
in mind we created wama Android the
world's best hemp underwear for both men
and women our key ingredient hemp is
often referred to as the miracle planet
for how versatile it is and how much
good it can do for nature as a textile
hemp is known to have antibacterial
antimicrobial and even anti-odor
properties and we all have that special
area on our bodies that carries the most
bacteria along with odor that is why we
created wama underwear you know to take
care of your privates we believe
everyone deserves to cover their
privates with a natural fabric like
hammock
available we have a men's boxer briefs
and the women's hip sters design both
designs went through dozens of patterns
and samples until the fit was perfected
every stitch every centimeter every
detail was developed with the highest
quality standards the design is simple
yet stylish and with him fabric being
naturally breathable you can rest
assured these will be the most naturally
comfortable underwear you have ever worn
because wama isn't just a pair of hemp
underwear
it's a fashionable everyday underwear
that you will feel good about wearing
and by backing this campaign today you
are not only helping bring wama
underwear to life you are supporting the
hemp movement in the fashion world by
bringing more awareness to him and all
of its benefits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
