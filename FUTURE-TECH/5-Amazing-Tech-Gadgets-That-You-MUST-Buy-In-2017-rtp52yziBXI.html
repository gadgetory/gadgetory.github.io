hello Hypno's
hi are you an expert in killing plants I
know I used to be and it was because I
didn't have the time or the skills to
keep them alive
I wanted to solve this problem so I
teamed up with you Alice and Mario
together we created betánia
it is an automatic and self watering
planter but lets you grow effortlessly
so you can have fresh herbs without
giving up your life in between them you
can grow herbs like basil thymus or mint
you can also grow vegetables like
tomatoes or chili
petain ium is a complete kit for growing
your own plants from seeds this is how
to not kill a plant pour water into the
tank add some nutrients fill up with the
included growing medium plant the seed
connected to an outlet and let Petain
ium take care of the plant for you
the roots really thrive in betánia
which makes the plants grow larger and
faster than in common soil if you fill
it up it can last up to a month so you
don't need to worry if you go away we're
a group of entrepreneurs engineers and
designers we know what it takes to make
a product we have done it before we have
made many prototypes and are now ready
for mass production to do that we have a
big startup cost and need your help to
back this project
