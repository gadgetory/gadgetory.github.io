but today we just mostly poke at the
screen fingers and hands are incredible
why are we so limited introducing vela
an innovative device that instantly
turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
vela will make your life more convenient
use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination
and you only need one valid device to
control multiple devices or applications
you can use our presets like letter
Surat your own gestures according to
your preference simply assign chester's
through different scenarios and switch
between them just by moving your hands
our human hand is fantastic they can not
only feel but also manipulate things in
a versatile way the current smartphone
technologies are just putting everything
into small tiny screen which highly
limits and constraint to interactive
areas of our hands Vela works on any
surface so you can clip it anywhere you
like or even design your own control pad
unlike other devices Vela gives you
tracking and multiple texts to action
features so you are not limited to just
one action but if different patterns to
assign for different actions it is super
easy to use and really works for
everyone if you are a developer you can
try new ideas and figure out different
customized applications with our
well-designed API to track the human
gestures Vela uses a special sonar
technology that is nowadays widely used
in military cars and drones it transmits
signal pulses collects the reflective
energy from your finger and then
translates it into the performed action
our team has been focused on sensing
techniques for couple of years
we are passionate about making tours
which are just human needs by amplifying
human capabilities turning any surface
around you into a remote control enables
many potential possibilities in our
daily lives we have been seeing lots of
products in the market but we have not
found any of them capable to track and
to recognize with high probability with
Wella attracts your finger with the
finest precision and transform it into
customized action
Weller brings magic to our daily life
introducing the mark to by Mycroft
Mycroft will wake you up hey Mycroft
play my morning jams playing your
morning gems or do simple tasks like

and all the things you would expect from
a voice assistant things like whether
it's 78 degrees and sunny calendar you
have a 10:00 a.m. team meeting and
conversions there are three teaspoons in
a tablespoon a computer remind me to get
my winter clothes out of storage other
voice assistants can use your
conversations to sell your data and send
you ads Mycroft never sells your data or
send you ads the new screen is great for
features like setting multiple timers
hey Mycroft
can you send another timer for 10
minutes second time I started nailed it

work a Mycroft
hey Trinity hey you okay Victoria and
your voice hello my name is Trinity
hello my name is Mycroft and you can be
hooked up to start multiple systems in
your home with a single command
hey Minecraft it's game time hey but it
doesn't work with this he can help with
that our open source community is
expanding the capability of the mark to
supporting things like Roku and other
devices
Mycroft private custom open
hello I'm Joshua Montgomery the CEO of
my craft AI in 2015 we launched the
world's first open-source voice
assistant right here on Kickstarter in
July we delivered the mark 1 to backers
in 56 countries and 38 states the
software that we built for the mark 1
now runs anywhere you can download and
run it on the Linux desktop or the
Raspberry Pi this is the first step
towards our larger goal an artificial
intelligence that runs anywhere and
interacts exactly like a person an AI
that understands context can communicate
naturally and hold a complete
conversation with our second Kickstarter
we're looking to expand the community
and work with them to build software
that allows you to voice enable anything
software that's customizable and lets
you rename the assistant and change its
personality and appearance to fit you
the mark 2 uses an advanced microphone
array so it can hear at long distances
even when music is playing we've also
added a screen so you can see things
like calendar entries timers even
security camera feeds to bring the mark
2 to life we need your help we need to
invest in tooling optimize our design
for manufacturing and continue to
improve the software that's why we're
asking for your support we need you to
help us bring an open transparent
privacy minded intelligent personal
assistant to life you can begin helping
us now by going to voice my crafty eye
and donating your voice installing my
craft on your Raspberry Pi or backing
our Kickstarter ticket
you
being a gun owner is not just buying a
gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained
you are your gun see when it's not on
you you want to know it's secure and
accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are nuisance to
operate as for smart guns while smart
guns are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing sorex the new
generation of gun storage sorex is
calibre specific and has two modes the
first mode is awareness if someone tries
to tamper with your gun you're
immediately alerted
and when you need your gun charging it
will eject syrettes and chamber a fresh
round the second mode is when your gun
is locked when Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel
soraa's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it you can also open zorax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth to
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zuhr watchdog the zuhr
watchdog is not a lock but rather a
notification device
its sole purpose is to notify you if
your weapon is tampered with sorex was
invented by veterans of elite IDF
technological and in combat units we
worked on it for two years bringing it
to perfection
zorax allows you to be ready and aware
and safe more than ever before
join the zuhr revolution own your gun

you used to be more like this thanks to
your outstanding vocal performance you
got a lot of this yep your snoring is
putting a damper on things at home and

strokes and heart attacks so you go out
there and try all kinds of anti snore
products and then you meet Nora using
Nora is simple just pick your favorite
pillow put the expander in your
pillowcase tap Nora and go to sleep when
you start snoring
Nora gently moves your head so you stop
before your partner wakes up the science

causes the vibrations the slight
movement of your head stimulates these
muscles and opens the airway so you can
breathe normally again

part of the pillow our patent-pending

natural objects and the smooth matte
finish looks great in any setting nor
comes in a beautiful portable bag
equipped with the rechargeable battery
making it easy to use on the go we
created Nora because we were frustrated
with the impractical and expensive
products out there a year of obsessive
designing prototyping and testing has
brought us here the result is unlike any
other snoring solution an elegant device
with the seamless experience now ready
for mass production
Nora bless that and more this we can't
wait to bring silent sleep to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
