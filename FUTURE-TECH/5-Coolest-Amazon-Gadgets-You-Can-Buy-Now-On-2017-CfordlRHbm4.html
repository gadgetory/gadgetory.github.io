Tyl mind what matters
well nowadays people take thousands of
pictures with their cell phones but they
never look at them so we decided to
create an object that will be that will
make them able to share pictures with
their their friends and family and a
tangible way print is the first
smartphone case that prints out pictures
instantly you just have to play your
smartphone it's not a picture and to
print instantly we worked during a year
on about 15 different prototypes to come
up with one product that's really easy
to use for example it doesn't use
Bluetooth technology or Wi-Fi you can
take a picture but you can also use
pictures from Facebook Instagram any
picture that is already on your smart my
biggest design challenge was to create
an object that will work with different
type of smartphones who are compatible
with the iPhone 5 the iPhone 6 and also
the galaxy s4 in galaxy s5 and we are
trying to bring it to more smartphones
so we don't need any ink cartridge all
the ink is already in the paper you just
have to hit it and the picture will
appear like neck magic
like I said what we really love about
instant cameras is the whole experience
so we try to capture it by recording
your short videos five six seconds just
before you take a pictures this video
will play automatically on the paper
through augmented reality when you scan
it with our app
we wanted to go further than just
printing pictures we wanted to bring
memories that you could hold in your
hands and that you could give away
whenever you wanted print is for
everybody because everybody likes a
printed picture that you can hold in
your hand you know it's it's like a
memory that you can give away so we are
on Kickstarter because we need your
support to go to production and also we
need your feedback so that we can
improve our product
