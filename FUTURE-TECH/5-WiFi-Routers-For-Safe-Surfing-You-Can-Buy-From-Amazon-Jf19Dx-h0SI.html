problems we live in a time where
everything you do online is monitored

and none provide coverage on multiple
devices making it a hassle to stay
protected we created filter in order to
make privacy and security more
accessible and easier to use filter

capability and Tor anonymity and all the
devices in your home this is especially
important for devices that don't
normally support these applications like
gaming consoles Smart TVs and media
players those who not only protects you
from unwanted ad targeting but it
prevents companies government's and
internet providers from seeing more

location in VPN mode filter uses
enterprise grade encryption to protect
all the devices in your home

like to connect to or automatic for the
speediest connection you can switch
between VPN mode and tour or configure
more advanced settings
Foles are also just a job of blocking
advertisements dangerous websites
checkers and malware infected
advertising is a huge threat annoyance
with filter you'll never have to see my
let's just add again to stay ahead of
threats all security features and lists
are kept up-to-date automatically you
can choose what you want to have updated
or turn this off at any time filter has
a lot of capabilities but setup couldn't
be easier on all of your network traffic

between any modem and router filter will
start working automatically and can be
configured within the app filter can be
used as a regular router which you can
connect your devices to via Wi-Fi or
