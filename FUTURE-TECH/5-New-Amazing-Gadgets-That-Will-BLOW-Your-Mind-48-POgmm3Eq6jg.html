a guess as kids we always wanted to have
some supernatural powers for instance to
make things happen with the power of
thought
and now you can feel like a real
superhero especially
beware of the superpowers home will be
one hottie can deny
life is about human connection our
strongest bonds are with family but you
can't always be there with them calling
doesn't give you that same feeling there
are a lot of things you enjoy doing
together and you can see through a call
so we made Omni the robot that makes
these things possible even if you live
miles away
omni's in like a phone call or ordinary
video test you're there in the robot you
have the control to move and look around
and this frees up the other side from
having to stop and answer a call you can
just join in no matter what they're
doing no more phone tags or scheduling a
call like a meeting our testers are
using Omni to do awesome stuff like cook
together hang out for a barbecue or even
watch a whole movie together it's the
stuff they never do with Skype or
FaceTime because it's just way too
cumbersome and the coolest part is that
none of this was planned at a time as
soon as they got the bot these
experiences just happen naturally we
want to make a home robot that's not
just a toy but something's built to last
and be truly useful week after week our
design philosophy has two main parts and
the first is to maximize the human
connection so Omni is made to be human
height to give you that most natural
view of the world people on the other
side can look straight at you and talk
to you just like normal we really wanted
to enhance presence a feeling that
someone's there with you so we design
Omni with a moving neck and a seamless
control interface we call motion at the
neck may seem subtle but we found it
really makes experience a lot more
engaging a lot more human so the second
part of our design philosophy is to
minimize all hassle because nothing
should get in the way of the Omni
experience setup is simple unfold
connect to Wi-Fi then call in with just
one click
there's no software install we also made
Omni super quiet so you can hangout for
a long time without bugging anyone if
you need to move it around it's light
you can take it upstairs move it out in
the patio or pull it up into your car
you don't feel worried about keeping it
charged when you're finished
press one button to auto dog Tommy is
different right down to its materials
and how we make it resource sustainable
bamboo and we use Sutton anodized
aluminum another cool thing is we use
additive manufacturing to build omni in
a scalable and efficient way we're doing
it all in-house to keep it lean that
means less risk if are even shipping
omni to test uses around the world for
over a year
we're also back there's like you tired
of campaigns over-promising and
under-delivering so that's why we waited
to launch our campaign until now after
two years and nine generations of
prototypes we're super passionate about
bringing families closer and with your
support we can bring the omni experience
to everyone join our campaign and enjoy
Omni with your own family
have you ever dreamt of improving your
home with crown molding or refrain will
face to the de tricky business of
getting it right
crown moldings are one of the
architectural features that really add
value to a home they add a visual
presence that makes a home feel more
upscale although until now installing
crown molding has going to pass that
strikes fear in the heart of every
amateur carpenter even some
professionals because the molding sits
at an angle on the wall each joint is
made of compound angles and hard to get
right the biggest problem has always
been cutting the angles rather than the
actual installation the angles in a room
often shift slightly and very few rooms
have exactly square corners with 90
degrees because it comes out from the
wall it really is a 3d cut not getting
it right makes a time consuming and
expensive because you get a lot of ways
and that is enough to make you lose your
mind luckily you have a solution for you
one cut is a world patented measurement
tool that lets you get it right at the
first try it makes no difference whether
it's an outer or inner angle you have to
measure you can keep the instrument up
against the stall for precise cuts no
more calculations no complicated setting
building saw no more trial and error but
perforin results each time without
wasted and failed efforts so say goodbye
to all the gaps in crown molding joints
this handy little tool will help you
take on crown molding installations
along with other molding projects such
as base molding all kinds of frames and
many other worker projects after numbers
design iterations and prototypes we
finally have a fully functional world
patented solution we've worked closely
with industrial leaders to find the best
materials and refine details we have
manufacturers ready the only thing
missing is your support check the low
for more information about the project
and the various reward levels you can
only make one kind of reality if we
reach our goal so please support us now
we're super excited to see what you can
create with one cut thank you for
