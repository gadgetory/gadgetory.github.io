originally inspired by brainstorming
cases that allows you to add wonderfully
to your phone and we thought why not
make one case that allows for many
features that you can customize realized
not we have an experienced team with
members spread across the world all
bonded together through our passion for

clock to collaborate on each other's
time zone and get our advice to where it
is today what comes out of this campaign

working on additional modules for the
near future but even more importantly we
are building a community for developers
to thrive and meet the needs and wants
of nexpaq users think about an app store
for modules that can enhance your phone
whenever we show it to someone we get
some crazy ideas for future modules what
about a tiny'mon box or a little blush
