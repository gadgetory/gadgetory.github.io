family
I do lifeguard duty I lock all the doors
I make sure they have their helmets shin
guards you know all the right gear I
even checked the smoke alarm twice a
year and I'm pretty sure I'm the only
dad on the block who does that
now when it comes to protecting my
family from cybercrime I'm no expert but
I do know that my wife and I log into
hundreds of websites every month our
bank accounts our investments our
shopping our entertainment everything's
online I'm guessing that if a hacker
wanted to steal our data there's not
much I could do to stop him he even
password security companies have servers
and where there are servers there are
hackers that's where our passwords used
to be but now they're here identity card
stores your passwords offline when a
website wants my password it asked my
card for it and my passwords are in my
wallet not somewhere on the Internet
and if you're like me you're good at
losing things thanks but we're in luck
identity card is useless to anyone but
you
it uses your unique biometrics to make
sure that only you can see what's on it
that's it all your passwords for all
your devices organized on one unhackable
card oh that's what I call protection
