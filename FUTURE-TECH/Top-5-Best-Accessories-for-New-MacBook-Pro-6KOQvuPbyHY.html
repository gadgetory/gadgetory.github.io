the brand new macbook one of the many
new devices between the powerful new USB
type-c port your entire computer's power
beta transfer and output through a
single port it's the heights of
technological simplicity but what about
your stuff and when you need to
multitask how do you fit it all into a
single port your stuff needs Marmol the
first integrated system designed to work
with the USBC port the martha's offers
the single compact way to connect your
many devices to your new macbook it's
got two USB port through USBC port an
HDMI time a poor a micro SD card reader
and a 60 watt HD inlet to power at all
it's the only system made to charge your
new macbook while also powering all of
your devices
I think of marble as your new
supercharger it gives you all the
functionality of having your device's
nearby and connected as though they were
still plugged straight into your
computer and disliked the new macbook
marble is easy to take the view no need
to bring your mac adapter with you on
the road bring marble and you'll be able
to power your devices and your computer
while you're on the go Carmel is
designed to be relatively the same size
as your computer standard powers out
there and when you consider the other
mess that marble enables you to leave
behind model makes a whole lot of sense
that you constantly find yourself off a
move marble safety space safety weight
and had the ease-of-use you need evenly
quit from working at the office to hold
to your favorite cafe around the corner
use the micro SD card quarter to get
access to your videos and photos inc
debris with marbles you have the
versatility and portability you need to
work from anywhere and while you work
charge your phone your tablet and your
computer in the same place and have axes
calling files at once while you're at it
it kind of like having your entire
office but neatly in your pocket
and remember marble works with any
computer that supported us bc technology
systems like the Dell XPS 13 9350 and
the hallway maple among others the
potential of using the marble for USB be
sorted devices is continuing to grow
every day get marble and supercharge
your life
