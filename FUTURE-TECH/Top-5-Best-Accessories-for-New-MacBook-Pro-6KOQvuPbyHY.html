designed to be relatively the same size
as your computer standard powers out

behind model makes a whole lot of sense
that you constantly find yourself off a
move marble safety space safety weight

access to your videos and photos inc
debris with marbles you have the
versatility and portability you need to
work from anywhere and while you work
charge your phone your tablet and your
computer in the same place and have axes

office but neatly in your pocket
and remember marble works with any
computer that supported us bc technology
systems like the Dell XPS 13 9350 and
the hallway maple among others the
potential of using the marble for USB be
sorted devices is continuing to grow
