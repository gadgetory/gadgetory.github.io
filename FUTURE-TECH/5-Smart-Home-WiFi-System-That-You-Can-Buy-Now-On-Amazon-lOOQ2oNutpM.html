wireless dead zones into your house how
about endless buffering where oh where
could that Wi-Fi password be oh look the
network froze again let's just pull the
plug to that over these words if you
want real speed and coverage in your
home that demands a network that's
actually designed for streaming this
zero zero is the first Wi-Fi system
that's right team this is not a router
this is a network a network that
blankets every inch your beautiful home
and hyper-fast
super stable Wi-Fi
apparently you really can't have it all
here oh you can finally stream music or
video anywhere Hiro was designed to be
simple - you want to create a new
network easy pick up your phone type in
a name choose a password you're done

friends while you're watching the mother
door dragons do her thing here oh he's
improving itself which means you always
get the fastest Oh secure most awesome
Wi-Fi network on earth how's that
you
this is not the future I was promised
Wi-Fi routers are dumb machines and they
make us act like dumb people yes we
unplugged it these machines work just
fine a decade ago when I only had one
computer but now my house is more
connected devices and I can even count
I want a modern Wi-Fi network that's
reliable and consistent wherever I am in
the house a network that's fast and
secure a network that keeps kids like my
nephew out of harm's way
enter luma an intelligent Wi-Fi system
that actually delivers on the promise of
fast reliable internet it surrounds you
with Wi-Fi using technology that was
previously only available to large
companies you put one here another one
there immediately you're up and running
we call it surround Wi-Fi luma is smart
enough to know things like what devices
you're using what networks are
interfering and where potential problem
spots are so it can make smart decisions
to get you the fastest data everywhere
and of course no network should be
without a good security system
I can easily grant people access to my
network and just as easily revoke it
speaking of that I can rest easy knowing
that luma has modern parental controls
so I can limit the kid 2g level websites
and monitor to make sure he's not up to
any shenanigans I can even set time
limits pause the internet like during
dinner time yay awesome here I'll put
this in
I love you speed safety security this is
the future I was promised this is luma
hi I'm Shawn and I'm Frank and this is
echo echo is a revolutionary new audio
device that enables your existing
headphones or speakers to receive
wireless - Oh from any source each user
simply takes a battery-powered sound pop
from the base station and plugs in any
pair of headphones the result instant -
e wireless audio for the whole family
most wireless headphone systems are
bulky and expensive and often designed
for only one user we designed echo
because we believe everyone should be
able to use their headphones or speakers
to enjoy a phenomenal wireless listening
experience echo is specifically designed
to accommodate multiple users up to four
or more can listen together at the same
time it's built in Wi-Fi technology
delivers high quality ultra-low latency
sound for a real-time listening
experience it's perfect for movies music
gaming and wind echo delivers a highly
customized listening experience that's
designed to fit each user's preference
each sound puck has individual volume
controls while the smart mobile app
controls equalizer settings streaming
settings and more it even has parental
controls like volume limiting to help
ensure safe listening for kids
we designed echo because we wanted to
create a high quality social wireless
listening experience that our expensive
wireless headphones simply couldn't
provide we wanted something powerful
enough to create an audiophile grade
listening experience it's simple enough
for the whole family to enjoy something
that untethered you that allows you more
freedom and better range in Bluetooth or
RF
and when we couldn't find it we decided
to build it over the past year our
in-house team is prototype two working
proof of concept created an elegant
beautiful industrial design and laid out
a development roadmap for finishing the
consumer ready device we've teamed up
with world-class designers and engineers
and lineup suppliers and manufacturing
partners capable of producing EKKO to
our high standards we designed EKKO to
complement your existing entertainment
accessories EKKO offers each user
individual control of their own
listening experience it was thoughtfully
designed to look great in any setting
now we're turning the kickstart to make
EKKO a reality for everyone by joining
us and backing this project you'll be
