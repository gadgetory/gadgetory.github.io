safe your colleagues roommates and
Internet service provider can see what

your online activities secure all your
Wi-Fi devices at the same time make sure
others no longer see your apps or
websites none of their business side of
the work Keisel uses a technology called
virtual private network their keys will
connects to Wi-Fi networks like the
wanting to play the coffee shop at the
same time their keys will provides a
separate secure Wi-Fi network just for
you sounds complicated well good news
Keisel is super simple to use one button

or tablet you don't have to install a
thing and it works with all your Wi-Fi
devices oh and keysville has great
battery life it might even save today
when your phone runs out of power order
your key Hill today tell all your
friends about it let's help everyone
enjoy their online freedom
we
well nowadays people take thousands of
pictures with their cell phones that
they never look at them so we decided to
create an object that will make them
able to share the truth with their
friends and family in a tangible way
print is the first smartphone case that
prints out pictures instantly you just
have to tell your smartphone get the
picture and complete instantly
we work during a year on about 15
destined for the sides to come up with
one product that's really easy to use
for example uses technology or Wi-Fi you
can take a picture that you can also use
pictures from facebook Instagram any
picture that is already on your smart my
biggest design challenge was to create
an object that will work with different
type of smartphone who are compatible
with the iphone 5 the iphone 6 may also
the galaxy s4 and galaxy s5 and we are
trying to bring it to more smartphone so
we do need any ink cartridge all the ink
is already in the paper you just have to
hit it and the picture will appear like
like magic
like I said which we realized that
instant cameras is the Holy Spirit we
will try to capture it by recording of
short videos at five six again just
before you take a picture this video
will play automatically on the paper
through augmented rarely when you scan
it with our app
we wanted to go further than just
printing pictures we wanted to bring
memories that you could hold in your
hands and that you could give away
whenever you want it print is for
everybody because everybody likes a
printed picture that you can hold in
your end it's like a memory that you can
see the way we are antique that are
because we need your support to go to
production and also we need your
feedback so that we can improve our hi
my name is Olaf i'm the founder of hills
collected during the last year we have
created this if the world's first
digital pin it is you can create wear
and share and kind of gives a pattern
that you wish just open up the app and
choose from one of your friends or
followers design why not assign one of
your own pin in the Creator here you can
choose any color texture pattern can
also take a picture or upload one from
your library
our team have created prototypes for the
pin in the app now we need to use to
join pins collective at the compart of
our extended team please the part of the
Kickstarter and help us reach our goal
you
steel blades are completely we're
looking whoops drops the retractable
hand pallet put them on and they
intimate feel like park you are working
alongside industry experts we developed
an inner fifth hand paddle custom that's
lightweight comfortable and able to
power you through the water up to thirty
five percent faster than just using your
hands it's really amazing you can really
feel the full of the water it's awesome
fun series use you feel that you're
putting like a super Paris Leon great
fun so much fun I've been designing
pedals for world champions and Olympians
the last 30 years and I think steel
blades are an absolutely fantastic news
okay the reason that steel blades work
is our unique patented quick release
system allows you to simply to release
your grip and the blade of tracks in
your hands freely if you like go and
they peg back in it's like they're not
even there and they just go clever they
kind of snap back which was felt cool
little bit like and I'm spider-man is
only to actually catch weight and get
into the sport it's a no-brainer we're
currently building the tools for the
manufacturing process though we have
steel blades produced and ready to ship
later this year we're also offering to
exclusively on Kickstarter heel blade 0
for a dog and feel they zero rush dying
for smaller adult and team thanks for
watching the video and cleaner back our
family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
