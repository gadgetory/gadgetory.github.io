this is our life
this is Freetown
uh-uh
this is creativity
this is precision
this is attached
this is our inspiration this is our
future
this is your freedom
this is Howard
this is x1d
tell me do you enjoy a nice glass of
wine I think you might say you know that
as good as wine is when you open a
bottle it only tastes that way for about
a day and now with cuvee because Cavalia
have the super smart bottling and
dispensing system
it keeps oxygen from touching a lot this
is what you order and this is how you
pour it the screen tells you what you're
drinking tells you how much there is
left to drink
shows you the story of the wine lets you
rate the wine and even order more hey
guys what are we drinking well I was
gonna open a red I've been craving a
Chardonnay Oh see now that's a problem
what are you gonna do open two bottles
well I've read it's like now I find no
good cuvee you can have that Chardonnay
Vega knock yourself out
or both take it apart the rest of us not
to match with cuvee you can choose
between hundreds of varietals styles and
vineyards in order from the cuvette
online store or even from the bottle
this means you can keep more wines
around and not worry about wastage
oxygen never gets into this bottle so
every glass you pour will taste coming
for up to 30 days
drink what you want always fresh one
glass citizen
Oh
Oh
you
you
I'm Friday yes I'm a lock but that
doesn't mean I'm not smart I know that
any second now mom will be home and I'll
unlock the door for as long as she has
her phone with her I can sense it and
grant her access I can also tell when
someone shuts the door so if the kids
forget to lock it when they head out
again I can do it for them
just another way that I keep your home
safe and secure but why stop with your
house I do a great job of looking after
your work studio to keyless access is
perfect for those times that you have
your hands full speaking of things that
can be a handful Bruno wants to go
walkies don't worry you might be at work
but I'm still at home just give me the
word and I'll let the dog-walker in you
can share access with anyone you choose
maybe you're always on the go or maybe
that's dad's excuse for never doing any
repair work himself either way I can
deal with the handyman so don't worry
about waiting around for him oh and you
can revoke his access when the jobs
finished but that was obvious right of
course I'll notify you whenever someone
opens your door so when the kids get
home from school you'll know that
they're safe and sound I don't want you
worrying about who's in or out I just
want to give you peace of mind well I
also want to look good but I do that
anyway but no matter how fancy I might
look I won't mind if you ignore all my
smarts and treat me like a normal lock I
mean it would be a bit of a waste but
hey you're in charge and did I mention
that I'm the smallest retrofit smartlock
in the world
seriously check out my curves but what
really matters is that you can rely on
me to make your life easier and keep
your home more secure I'm smart I'm
reliable I'm safe I'm Friday
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
