it has been said that f Favaro
we learn from the perfect forms that
have been present in nature since the
dawn of time they're just waiting to be
discovered
we created the flood sensor binding
technical perfection into a shape
inspired by a water drop
we gave it an independent power source
Bluetooth connectivity and temperature
sensor as well as telescopic probes
covered with 24 karat gold all of this
in one of the smallest devices of its
type in the world
the device will alert you in case of
flooding or temperature changes with
light and sound and a status update in
the smartphone app the sensor will
detect even the slightest change in
location or any attempts to tamper with
its case
our goal is to design solutions which
are perfect both in form as well as in
their functionality and
now you get to explore what they can
offer
Favaro flood sensor works with apple
homekit

this year alone 480 billion bottles will
be consumed and less than 7% of these
get recycled this has a huge impact on
our environment people are drinking more
and more bottle of water as they worry
about the health concerns and the
content of their tap water but this is
costly and unsustainable at tap water we
decided there has to be a better way so
we spent three years researching
existing water filtering technologies
and we came up with tap a revolutionary
water filter system for the kitchen tap
tap - is easy for anyone to install and
reduces plastic by an average of 380
bottles in carbon footprint by 45 kilos
of carbon dioxide per year and the best
part of it is that it's the first
biodegradable water filter so once the
cartridge life is over it can be
composted so no plastic waste ends up in
our nature and oceans with your help we
will reach our goal of avoiding 1
billion plastic bottles by 2020</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
