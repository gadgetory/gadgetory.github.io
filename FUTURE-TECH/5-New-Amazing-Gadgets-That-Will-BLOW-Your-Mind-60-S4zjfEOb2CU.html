the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product it would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution bringing the gym to you
the platform is strong the posts are
spaced evenly apart on both sides so you
can simulate any exercise movement and
quickly just difficulty the base is made
wide enough to stand comfortably during
your workout and we even added a layer
of non-slip material to assure you stay
in place the bands were customized for
this concept and can handle any height
there's even cloth in the band's to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add vans to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort
the ends of the bar spend a full 360
degrees and are shaped to avoid the
clips from slide providing you the most
natural feel possible through all of
your exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
levels we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight padding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor can
increase the workout the body boss is
lightweight made of high-grade injection
molding and capable of handling hundreds
of pounds of force the underside has
non-slip feet for safe use on any
surface the adjustable posts make for
easy storage starting from day one you
can choose your color green pink you can
choose your package and choose how you
want to follow workouts live replay
program all on your own but by backing
this IndieGoGo today you can get it for
a fraction of that price empowering
people just like you to reach their
goals body boss bringing the gym to you
