and behind me we've got one of our
travel displays it's one of the displays
we had out at SHOT Show this year as
well as the great American outdoor show
in Pennsylvania you already know we've
got some of the fastest access firearm
storage on the market I'm gonna prove
that point right now with our magnetic
keys one on each side we've got access
to our table or in here go ahead and
close it up
locks it right back up that's our 12 42
we've been doing that now for about a
year very fast access but what we're
really excited about is a new product
for this year it's our RFID model so
initially it's going to be on the 8:25
8:12 the 1420 and the 1450 product line
and it works just like this you take
your RFID key place it right up top and
the shelf opens right up now like I said
this is our display we've had this thing
to shot show we've had it out to the
great American outdoors show and we have
literally opened and closed this
particular 8 25 thousands and thousands
of times some of the additional features
of the RFID system is that you're able
to actually program multiple products to
the same key card and you're also able
to program multiple key cards to one
product so if you wanted to be able to
give out keys to two or three different
people to have access to your home
defense weapons you're able to do that
or if you want to be able to unlock four
different products in four different
parts of your home you're able to do
that as well so that's one of the really
neat things about the rfid technology
another thing is you can see it this
form is a key card you could put it in
your wallet you can carry around with
you everywhere you go
or in the case of this book we have one
just stow it away right inside that lets
you open it right up something that's
real close by right on the shelf now you
can hear it's actually chiming if you
leave your product open for too long it
will let you know that you've left it
unlocked it's a safety feature it's also
able to be disengaged and you can turn
that off
that's our new RFID 825 come check out
these awesome products and the rest of
our line at tactical walls comm take
care and God bless
you
no matter who your family is we all want
to keep the people we love safe and
that's why we made salt the first safe
gun for a safe home
hi I'm Adam this is Andy we're the
creators of salt salt is a gun but it's
not like any gun that you've ever seen
it was designed around the belief that a
firearm shouldn't have to take a life in
order to protect a life from that simple
idea we started by completely rethinking
the bullet instead of LED salt was
designed to shoot a specialized round
filled with a powerful toxin so instead
of killing the target salt opens up on
impact in a cloud that instantly causes
respiratory and visual distress so while
an intruder or a curious child would be
incapacitated the encounter wouldn't be
fatal
this rethink also lets salt be used not
only offensively but defensively as well
so if an intruder is kicking down your
door
salt allows you to shoot the area around
it before the danger is on top of you
this creates a protective cloud of toxin
between you and the intruder before he's
ever a threat to you or your family our
last big idea was to make salt easy to
use for everyone so we replaced the
violent bang of black powder with the
silent power of compressed air the
result is a fear free user experience so
the only person that should have
anything to be scared of is an intruder
and that's all a safe gun for a safe
home so now all we need is you the
testing the Rd the prototyping is all
done and we're ready to begin production
but salt can't be made without you
without all of us really wanting a
better way to keep the people we love
safe so if you're is intrigued by the
ideas as we are we'd love to make you
one just click our support button and
together we can make the world just a
little bit safer
