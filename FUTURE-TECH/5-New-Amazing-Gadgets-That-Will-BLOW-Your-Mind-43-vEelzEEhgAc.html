them for years but that hasn't really
improved the way that we drive them in
creating automatic we set out to unlock
our cars potential and redefine people's
relationship to driving making it safer
more efficient and fun we did this by
introducing your car to your smartphone
it all starts with the automatic link
just plug it in to your car's data port
and follow the simple instructions on
the screen
now your car and smartphone will connect
wirelessly whenever you drive most
people don't realize just how big an
impact their driving style can have on
fuel efficiency you can save up to 1/3
on gas with only a few adjustments to
how you drive an automatic helps you do
that without being a backseat driver it
learns about your driving style and
gives you subtle audio cues when you do
things that waste gas like accelerating
quickly the app shows your weekly Drive
score and trip timeline so you can track
your progress and see where to improve a
high score could save you hundreds on
gas every year when you drive automatic
monitors your car's health and more and
do something's wrong so if your check
engine light comes on you'll see a
description of the problem and possible
solutions you can even clear the light
yourself and save a trip to the mechanic
because Adam attic connects to your car
when you drive it always knows where you
parked your family can even access that
location for seamless car sharing
accidents happen and far too often there
isn't someone there to help if you're
ever in a crash automatic alerts 9-1-1
with your location it can even contact
your loved ones to let them know what's
happened and that help is on the way we
wanted to reimagine what driving could
be and I think we did that with
automatic we believe that cars should
live up to their potential and that
every driver can be a smarter driver
that's why we created automatic that's
smart driving assistance
