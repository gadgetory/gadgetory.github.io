gun
you must always be prepared have to be
trained
you are your gun see when it's not on
you you want to know it's secure and
accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are a nuisance to
operate as for smart guns while smart
guns are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing sorex the new
generation of gun storage saw Rex's
caliber specifically it has two modes
the first mode is awareness if someone
tries to tamper with your gun you're
immediately alerted
and when you need your gun charging it
will eject syrettes
and chamber a fresh round the second
mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel
szura's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter
these two factors allow you to unlock
your weapon without looking at it even
in the dark you can choose a simple code
or any length code you wish you won't
believe how fast and simple it is until
you try it you can also open zorax from
your phone but you can only lock it by
physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zuhr watchdog the zuhr
watchdog is not a lock but rather a
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with
sar X was invented by veterans of elite
IDF technological and combat units who
worked on it for two years bringing it
to perfection door x allows you to be
ready aware and safe more than ever
before
join the zuhr revolution own your gun
you
these small medical grade polymer
earplugs are necessity for everyone
don't ever skip on keeping yourself safe
surefire sonic defenders come in three
sizes with medium fitting most people
you can choose to filter models which
give you the versatility of caps in or
caps out or the full block models and
they come with soft polymer tips or foam
ones try a few parents to see what works
for you use them for all parts of your
life like more than the line the room
would take its toll over time and get
clear sonic defenders your neighbors
won't even know you're wearing them see
be sure to wear them when operating any
power tools they're really comfortable
and will protect you from long-term
hearing loss you can even leave the caps
out on filter models so that you can
communicate between your teammates or
coworkers which is important if it's
your trade sonic defenders are ideal for
concerts you'll still hear the music as
it was meant to sound that a far safer
level they're also perfect for sleeping
with the crazy schedule I keep I use
them for my airline travel just to cut
down on the overall noise and to get
some sleep on the plane yes you can
always use your fingers but if you're
actually trying to get anything done you
need professional-grade plug from
surefire they'll protect you and they
were usable for months so wear them
daily stay safe
you
hi guys this is Tim with tactical walls
and behind me we've got one of our
travel displays it's one of displays we
had out at SHOT Show this year as well
as the great American outdoor show in
Pennsylvania you already know we've got
some of the fastest access firearm
storage on the market I'm gonna prove
that point right now with our magnetic
keys one on each side we've got access
to our Tavor in here go ahead and close
it up locks it right back up that's our
1242 we've been doing that now for about
a year very fast access but what we're
really excited about is a new product
for this year it's our RFID model so
initially it's going to be on the 825 a
8:12 the 1420 and the 1450 product line
and it works just like this you take
your RFID key place it right up top and
the shelf opens right up now like I said
this is our display we've had this thing
to shot show we've had it out to the
great American outdoor show and we have
literally opened and closed this
particular 825 thousands and thousands
of times some of the additional features
of the RFID system is that you're able
to actually program multiple products to
the same key card and you're also able
to program multiple key cards to one
product so if you wanted to be able to
give out keys to two or three different
people to have access to your home
defense weapons you're able to do that
or if you want to be able to unlock four
different products in four different
parts of your home you're able to do
that as well so that's one of the really
neat things about the rfid technology
another thing is you can see it in this
form is a key card you could put it in
your wallet you can carry around with
you everywhere you go
or in the case of this book we have one
just stowed away right inside that lets
you open it right up something that's
real close by right on the shelf now you
can hear it's actually chiming if you
leave your product open for too long it
will let you know that you've left it
unlocked it's a safety feature it's also
able to be disengaged and you can turn
that off that's our new RFID 825 come
check out these awesome products and the
rest of our line at tactical walls comm
take care and God bless
