Aria with Aria finger movements direct
your SmartWatch today's devices are
awesome
the way we control them is not
especially for wearable buttons very
vintage touchscreen tiny set user
experience
voice control from this high-tech
devices on the market I would expect a
super engaging experience then I
discovered that with a bunch of sensor I
could see this everyone dreamed about
controlling things with their mind and
that's how we started the next step was
to transform this into a product and
that's why we applied hacks and came to
Shenzhen China
the manufacturing capital of the world
here we build and build and build until
area area is a tiny gesture controller
designed very specifically for
smartwatches where is the calibrated
and then you use it with your favorite
modules disclosed to the menu and launch
the application you want you can play
some music or check email or tell mama
we worked closely with a series of
SmartWatch in order to guarantee the
best user experience possible
aria is a Bluetooth compatible device so
it can be connected to most of the
electronics you always use we're
starting with a set of essential up to
cover the main names and we're
developing more we're also releasing an
SDK for all the developers who want to
create apps for Aria we develop this
technology and now we need your support

handgun via a custom adapter and remains
attached in both the lock and unlock

is specifically keyed to you when you
press the fingerprint reader guardian

unlocks allowing immediate access to the
handgun trigger so literally you are the
key

need it and responsibly secured when you
don't Guardian is the revolutionary
solution and responsibly securing your

unprecedented readiness ensuring the
protection of the ones you love
he started verifier with fervent belief
that there was a way to balance our
desire to be both ready and responsible
and over the last five years we have
refined Guardian to be the best product
it can be but to manufacture a product
like this is expensive and in order to
bring Guardian to market we need your
help and we look to you responsible gun

glass as a coating that is specially
designed terrific specific amount of
lights for optimal display quality USB
and HDMI ports allow devices to connect
and display on the home from dishonest
controls like these motion to bring
sensors and a 3d printer we have tested
them all in two colors and are adding
more dimension options to make the
Polish more natural and intuitive to
interact with making the whole is
combined water systems also and hardware
makes it even more complex that's why we
have assembled the best team possible to
