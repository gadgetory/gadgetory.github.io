day smartphones are becoming smarter but
the battery life remains critical we'd
like to use our phone without the fear
of running out of battery of course
there are solutions such as fire cases
and extra batteries but are either not
portable enough or is to forget we
designed a product so compact that will
follow you everywhere a cable the size
of an inch we call it in charge it's a
very simple product yep so useful that
we believe everybody should own one
that's why one of our main goals was to
keep it affordable
a tiny product at the tiny price
we spent an average 70% of our day next
to USB port and every time it's a chance
to top-up for batteries there are over
five billion USB ports around the world
in charge will fit in your pocket and
you wanted to fight with tangle cords
ever again thanks to its remarkably
compact design you can snap it onto your
keyring and there's no chance to forget
it at all we spent the last three months
to design the product and testing the
prototypes and now we are finally ready
to start the production in charger will
be available with both lightning
connector and micro USB so it's
compatible with most of the devices out
there we are really excited about this
