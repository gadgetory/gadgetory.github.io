why Eric Brody and I were playing
first-person shooter we're sitting there
on the couch revenues Jeep I'm on the
back and I'm pounding away with the gun
and he's hitting the bump and then the
thing explodes on the screen we go
flying but there's really nothing except
a little vibration what good is that
like something missing here we started
thinking about wow you know that would
be great if we could kind of get that
feeling across not only you feel the
impact but you feel a spread you get to
kick back and it's all there the whole
experience and that's when you actually
feel like you're totally immersed with
air eggs that's what you get my name is
Brody Stanfield I'm the president
co-founder of if tech my name is Michael
Stanfield and I'm the vice president and
co-founder gaming today is a two
dimensional product experience is
limited to sight and sound and so we're
providing a new dimension if the suit is
a haptic product that provides sensory
stimulation taking the user into the
game whether it be found sensations of
touch the idea of an impact air I will
put you into that experience that you've
always wanted there are three major
components to the suits there's the
decoder the exoskeleton and the sim skin
the decoder is a piece that attaches
actually to your console or platform
take information then it brings that and
send it to the exoskeleton the
exoskeleton is now the component that
sort of has all the pieces in ARAG that
you're wearing from the nervous system
which is the feedback to the control
center which takes the information from
the decoder as well as the power supply
to make sure it's wireless
the sound that we're providing is a
patented sound it's quite a different
experience we want to make it a surround
sound feel for the ideas we have six
speakers two on the front on this side
two on that side and then on the back
one here one here as well as a subwoofer
you're always in the sweet spot no
matter where you are
and as for like vibratory feedback right
now it's always been to the controller
so you feel a rumble in your hand now
we're actually getting it so it's
located on the specific parts your body
where it should be there are sixteen
points on the front eight points on the
side and sixteen points on the back all
right the first thing we're going to do
is I'm going to test out some
vibrational stuff so to start with I'm
just going to set a value here and I'm
going to top right here that yeah all
right let's switch that over to bottom
left and we'll see yeah which is ah
that's pretty much how vibration works
as for stim they're pretty much focused
on particular muscles they contract the
muscles it can either give a full
contraction or can be a slight
contraction once again same thing top
right so they just stick some value okay
shut that off
how you feeling we can see it moving
your shoulder forward like that yeah
nothing a weight all right that's pretty
much it for the basic fundamentals of
what air a can actually do so what do
you think of it it was pretty
interesting I'm never really experienced
anything like that
yes virtual world awareness you actually
inside the world that you're playing it
in video games even virtual reality who
are merely a player in a world that is
not your own supersuit lets you become
you in a world limited only by your
imagination forged from technology
light-years away powered by the energy
inside you get ready to go on this super
suit super suit is the world's first
wearable gaming platform and uses new
sci-fi technology to communicate soup to
suit so they work anywhere the super
vest is its power core it lights up
makes them and has haptic feedback
letting you feel when you get hit the
super glove is the tool to activate
special abilities it's engaged gesture
technology gives you the power to at
least shockwaves generate force fields
and much more inside every suit is a
special super vine which act as allies
boosting your defense zap your opponent
or be the goal of the game stock full of
a variety of games at launch gives super
suit the ability to be experienced
single or multi player like in super
suits take on capture the flag the suit
spots become goals sought after by
opposing team X and in its flagship
strategy game Robinhood players use the
super suits give and take features to
steal resources from the rich team and
give them to the poor team with super
suit the more you play the more powerful
you become instead of leveling up a
character you level up rewarding you
with new powers and gestures as your
abilities increase and tracking those
powers is done in the app where you can
monitor current level compare scores and
active minutes and download new games
inside super suit exists the dueling
world of gaming get ready to unlock your
potential get ready to dawn this super
suit
and live the gay
you
building Tesla suits is our dream
initially we wanted to build something
for the vr gaming but while developing
this technology we realized there's a
lot more potential to it and this is our
story and it was really cool they might
work Wow I made Tesla suit is a
full-body haptic suit that lets you
touch and feel sensations and virtual
reality the haptic system uses mild
electrical impulses to transmit signals
through the skin and muscles the
technology is used widely in physical
therapy to help train muscle groups as
well as the pain relief we've adapted
that technology to help transmit signals
through virtual reality either
stimulating smashing potential
everything changed this is this is the
real deal this is not so in fictional
process this is definitely teacher you
guys have nailed it make it worth
melting for the potential of the Tesla
suit is enormous I've always been a big
fan of we are important to find partners
that would make it more real
there wasn't anything that led by the
interactive virtual reality world beyond
Tunisia so we started developing place
it took us three prototypes to be able
to deliver pleasure work really Texas
age
the reason pollution Kickstarter
campaign now was to get SDK and
destitute in the pencil developers and
build communities that will take
projects to the next level
we spent a lot of time developing
strategy we designed our smart textiles
from scratch it's durable washable and
comfortable - there we made two versions
pioneer we have stickers impact foil and
prodigy we have digital impact point
which means more reality experience the
onboard control unit connects wirelessly
to any device such as games consoles VR
headsets mobile phones and tablets PCs
and Macs taking the potential
applications of Tesla suit well beyond
gaming I think it'd be very interesting
with their physical year and children
many other uses of even compass for an
academic a lots of different uses uses
for right away from gaming medical to
sports exercise anybody else's gain
implications for actual imagine a lot of
skill up to it than that and get
notifications on whether or if I've
missed an email from my girlfriend or my
boss or something is a subtle additional
cue in our Nelson see first the music
industry for pretty much every industry
as well and we can start this off that'd
be something exceptional earlier with
the game with with someone shooting you
I think a video variable for a military
training I enjoy most about its
potential to be used in any work in any
industry from music to help the
re-education to a pleasure and enjoyment
we wanted to make something that would
showcase our passion for virtual reality
and game development we've built VR
digital paintball game for the help of
professional paintballers
the first online multiplayer game that
combines haptic feedback and virtual
reality our developer kit is ready to
play and give you full freedom to create
your sensation
software pack includes the haptic editor
studio and easy to use SDK we are a
digital paintball game and a virtual
meeting up the virtual meeting app
enables friends and family to add
tactile sensations to video calling and
messaging such as the ability to send
and receive real hugs over the internet
generation make a bridge together we're
