turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
vela will make your life more convenient
use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination and you only need
one valid device to control multiple
devices or applications you can use our
presets like letters to write your own
gestures according to your preference
simply assign gestures for different
scenarios and switch between them just
by moving your hands our human hand is
fantastic they can not only field but
also manipulate things in a versatile
way the Korean smartphone technologies
are just putting everything into small
tiny screen which highly limits and
constrained the interactive areas of our
hands Vela works on any surface so you
can clip it anywhere you like or even
design your own control pad
unlike other devices Vela gives you
tracking and multiple text to action
features so you are not limited to just
one action but if different patterns to
assign for different actions it is super
easy to use and really works for
everyone if you are a developer you can
try new ideas and figure out different
customized applications with our
well-designed API to track the human
gestures Vella uses a special sonar
technology that is nowadays widely used
in military cars and drones it transmits
signal forces collects the reflective
energy from your finger and then
translates it into the performed action
our team has been focused on since
for couple years we are passionate about
making to us which is just human needs
by amplifying human capabilities turning
any surface rounds into a remote control
enables many potential possibilities in
our daily lives we have been seen lots
of products in the market but we have
not found any of them capable to track
and to recognize with high probability
