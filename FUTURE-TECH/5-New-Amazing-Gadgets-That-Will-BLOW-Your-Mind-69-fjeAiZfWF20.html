wearable technology that helps us face
the challenges of our stressful
lifestyle even when you're chronically
stressed elf Emmett will help you return
to a balanced state
with so many things going on it's hard
to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn elf Emmet will
help you focus and concentrate when you
need to
most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting elf
Emmet will calm you down
and rock you into a deep sleep elf Emmet
works in synergy with the natural rhythm
of your mind and body waves when you're
active and focused your brain frequency
is high when you're resting it slows
down however
because of our busy lifestyle our brain
waves aren't always in tune with what we
need elf
Emmet uses pulsed electromagnetic
technology to non-invasively synchronize
your mind with the frequency of what you
want to do
learn and concentrate while feeling
stressed improve the quality of your
sleep stay awake when feeling tired
relax after a hard day
we designed the technology around a
beautiful light headband that is powered
by your smartphone or tablet and
operated with a simple application
people have always used extremely low
frequencies to achieve altered states of
consciousness just think of meditating
to the rhythmic sound of drums Gong
therapy or the steady flashing light of
a fire things that take us into a state
of thoughtfulness even when the sound of
creme means
different rhythms in music
they all have an effect on us we always
adapt to an external frequency our
entire biological system the brain and
the earth itself work at the same
frequencies mister Nikola Tesla once
said that if we can influence those
frequencies electronically we can
directly stimulate the entire body and
mental system of humankind elf Emmet
uses the same power source as your
headphones to generate a weak
electromagnetic pulse between two coils
to demonstrate we can connect the coils
to a speaker and actually hear the
frequency that the application transmits
it's music you can't hear the cerebellum
is the part of our brains that links the
brain in the heart
depending on our situation it suggests
our performance rhythm this is the spot
that says slow down there's no danger
relax or it says hurry up we have work
to do concentrate elf Emmet works
directly on the cerebellum and can
influence the whole system it tells both
the brainwaves and heartbeat to speed up
or slow down

the gym and combines them into one
solution

strong the posts are spaced evenly apart
on both sides so you can simulate any
exercise movement and quickly adjust
difficulty the base is made wide enough
to stand comfortably during your workout
and we even added a layer of non-slip
material to assure you stay in place the
bands were customized for this concept
and can handle any height
there's even cloth in the band's to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
uppers we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell

comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor can
increase the workout the body boss is
