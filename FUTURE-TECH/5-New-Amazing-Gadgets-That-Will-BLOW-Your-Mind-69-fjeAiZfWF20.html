wearable technology that helps us face
the challenges of our stressful
lifestyle even when you're chronically
stressed elf Emmett will help you return
to a balanced state
with so many things going on it's hard
to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn elf Emmet will
help you focus and concentrate when you
need to
most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting elf
Emmet will calm you down
and rock you into a deep sleep elf Emmet
works in synergy with the natural rhythm
of your mind and body waves when you're
active and focused your brain frequency
is high when you're resting it slows
down however
because of our busy lifestyle our brain
waves aren't always in tune with what we
need elf
Emmet uses pulsed electromagnetic
technology to non-invasively synchronize
your mind with the frequency of what you
want to do
learn and concentrate while feeling
stressed improve the quality of your
sleep stay awake when feeling tired
relax after a hard day
we designed the technology around a
beautiful light headband that is powered
by your smartphone or tablet and
operated with a simple application
people have always used extremely low
frequencies to achieve altered states of
consciousness just think of meditating
to the rhythmic sound of drums Gong
therapy or the steady flashing light of
a fire things that take us into a state
of thoughtfulness even when the sound of
creme means
different rhythms in music
they all have an effect on us we always
adapt to an external frequency our
entire biological system the brain and
the earth itself work at the same
frequencies mister Nikola Tesla once
said that if we can influence those
frequencies electronically we can
directly stimulate the entire body and
mental system of humankind elf Emmet
uses the same power source as your
headphones to generate a weak
electromagnetic pulse between two coils
to demonstrate we can connect the coils
to a speaker and actually hear the
frequency that the application transmits
it's music you can't hear the cerebellum
is the part of our brains that links the
brain in the heart
depending on our situation it suggests
our performance rhythm this is the spot
that says slow down there's no danger
relax or it says hurry up we have work
to do concentrate elf Emmet works
directly on the cerebellum and can
influence the whole system it tells both
the brainwaves and heartbeat to speed up
or slow down
what is the cage part the cage part is
an awesome dude yourself robotic hit
with both easy-to-use software
and very rigid hardware components it
was designed to give you complete
creative freedom to build whatever
robotic application you have in mind so

of professional German developers based
in Berlin and Taipei we were frustrated
with the solutions on the market so now
we want to create a tool that everyone
can use software tools to start right
away are waiting for you and we will
provide future software development to
support and advance your ideas cage bot
will teach you more about the world of
technology you will easily learn how to
create your own system and soon you will
go beyond your limits we created the
software system with a user in mind who
isn't really an expert at programming
yet still wants to move beyond analog
parts right into the digital age
therefore cage bot enables you to
incorporate sophisticated components
like ultrasonic sensors was just a
couple of clicks and the best part is
you can use a smartphone and tablets
doing it because high multimedia
accountability who's one of our

the design of the cage bot Hardware
follows two main premises a it needs to
be extremely versatile to spark
creativity by freeing you from any
technical constraint and B it needs to

a three-year development phase we hold a
finished product in our hands we have a
full manufacturing chain in place with
contracts to all the necessary partners

part of it because cage bug growth with
your ideas
you
there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product it would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution
bringing the gym to you the platform is
strong the posts are spaced evenly apart
on both sides so you can simulate any
exercise movement and quickly adjust
difficulty the base is made wide enough
to stand comfortably during your workout
and we even added a layer of non-slip
material to assure you stay in place the
bands were customized for this concept
and can handle any height
there's even cloth in the band's to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
uppers we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor can
increase the workout the body boss is
lightweight made of high-grade injection
molding and capable of handling hundreds
of pounds of force the underside has
non-slip feet for safe use on any
surface the adjustable posts make for
easy storage starting from day one you
can choose your color green pink you can
choose your package and choose how you
want to follow workouts live
