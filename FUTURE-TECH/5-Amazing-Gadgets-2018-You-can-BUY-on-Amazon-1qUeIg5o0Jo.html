powerstrips
we have cords bricks AC adapters and we
can never get them to fit right that's
why we turn them inside out we move them
upside down we block our power switch
it just isn't efficient that's what's
great about pivot power we've crafted
this thing to be flexible you can turn
it into whatever direction you need to
in order to fit all of your devices and
plugs so go ahead and plug in all those
cords you never know what to do with and
that's pivot power a product invented

dim lights to 70%
do you have the same problem I do you
arrange the furniture in your home just
the way you like it but you can't move
the light switches so now you need to
call an electrician hey Kevin hey man
what's up
I need that light switch changed that
one I want a light switch right here
so I won't fall off the bed anymore and
I can turn on the light switch right now
whoa how did you do that I also have a
toddler and I would like to switch lower
so he can reach it and I can turn on the
switch like this you used to think you
need to tear out pieces of the wall and
run additional wires but now this is no
longer necessary you just need to open
the package no setting replace the
existing light switch with this base
switch then you can put the gecko switch
wherever you want
and it's done you can place an icon lets
you know what the geckos switch controls
here there are many icons to select from
the LED behind the icon lets you know
when the light is on or off make the
bedroom light gradually brighten to wake
you up or make it to turn off with a
time delay 3 to 1 if you can't find the
geckos switch use the search function
and it will beep oh here it is hmm do it
now switch it up with the Gecko switch
and make your home and life exactly the
way you like it
hey no need for a hammer Kevin you just
need a gecko switch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
