our children are growing up in a world
where computer literacy is as essential
as reading writing and arithmetic
introducing - and opt their toy robots

detection to complex sequences of
instructions and this is dubbed dot can
detect when it is being moved allowing
children to invoke characters these
robots can detect each other and
accessories can be added to give them
special abilities they teach the basics
of computer science and one of the best
ways possible problem-solving through
hands-on playtime and our research shows
that that is one of the best ways for
children to learn
- and DAW are designed to be programmed
by children using our touch interface
with music animation and stories as well
as existing languages like scratch and
blockly we try to get them to watch less
TV push them to learn new things but it
wasn't until these robots came out of
the box and our kids just got so

by virtually every field art

program is really learning problem
solved
taking something big and seemingly
incomprehensible breaking it down and
building up a solution and this concept
really applies to virtually anything
