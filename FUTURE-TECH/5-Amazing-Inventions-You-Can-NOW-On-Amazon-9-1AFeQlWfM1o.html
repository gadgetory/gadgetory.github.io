magical to unbelievably magical body
wash that's also shampoo Mentos and cola
things suck fly with your help the
magical is about to get magical a meek
shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
wants try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy Olie said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone a few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power up the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of shiz told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane I took
a moment to think and said challenge
accepted 2 years of research and 57
prototypes later he made it happen meet
shiz unbelievably magical invention
power up three the first ever smartphone
controlled paper airplane using
state-of-the-art technology power up
three turns your embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just fold a piece of copy paper to a
plane catch power up three and install
the app now call your mom and tell your
pilot because it works out of the box in
the back of the module are a propeller
and a runner that are in charge of
controlling the play in the front there
is an advanced ship with powerful
Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beast out of juice charge
the battery with any micro USB cable
absolute in his career as a pilot claims
to be building on flying and for
crashing that's why all components of
the power up three are super durable and
crash proof but here's where shy made it
really cool power up threes smart shape
is programmed to optimize user happiness
you don't need a PhD in aero now text to
be able to fly it the prototype is fully
functional and the super food from
magical power up three is ready for
production this is where SH I need your
magic beans if you help shy get to 1400
backers you'll help him bring the joy of
flight to everyone and obtain the
privilege to look down on regular paper
planes for the rest of your life so back
power up three and help make the magical
magical
so I'm Robert lady I'm the VP of
Technology with Cujo I was part of a
team that protected the world on this
Bank government agencies etc so Cujo is
essentially a simple sophisticated smart
firewall how this works is you plug it
into your router one even a cable and
power it on that is it there is
literally nothing to consume your
nothing to set up now this is different
from everything else is that instead of
having rules on our router or firewall
system where you either have to be an
enthusiast or an expert we do all the
hard work for you your devices are
communicating you know within your
network to the Internet we sample you
know header level data we have to be
encrypted and we set it to the cloud
that's what we do the heavy lifting we
are making sure you're not talking to
virus planet control systems we're
making sure you're not talking to a
phishing site for things like ssl making
sure there's no man in the middle of
actual people are trying to downgrade
the security so week one when the device
gets a signal to block a specific device
to a rogue server you get a notification
on your app and that's how you're in
terms of the user ideally something like
that shouldn't exist in a world where
things are secured by default but sister
or not something like this is necessary
because it's plug and play there's
literally nothing to configure so in
that context you really just plug in one
cable to your router that's it like
that's not how easy it is I once ate a
whole box of Girl Scout cookies simoes
there's a really good and daddy takes a
nap I'll eat as much candy as I can once
I was watching a movie and at the end I
realized I eat a whole pint of ice cream
I love hot cheeto I love bacon I love
hot cheetos once 8 50 pieces of bacon
single day and the step of the hot
cheetos I can't stop eating hot cheetos
helmet I'm excited to introduce you to
the kitchen state if one an easy way to
control temptation the kitchen safe is a
Tom Watkins near that puts you in
control let me show you how it works
first place an item in the container
next locate sadabs set the timer and
finally press the dial to activate the
lock once the container is locked cannot
be opened until the timer reaches zero
it's daddy I came up with the idea of
the kitchen safe will complete my
graduate studies I was looking for
something fun and easy to use and help
me with my food craving lose a little
weight and live a healthier lifestyle
all still being able to enjoy the
occasional snack to design a product
that lives up to the highest standards I
work with Ryan thing an engineer and
classmate I met while studying at MIT
the kid is safe is a time-lock
containment that puts you in charge you
put an item in the container and set the
timer once the timer is set and the
button is pressed the container lost and
cannot be opened until the timer reaches
zero it is a simple concept that
produces powerful results the goal when
designing the kitchen safe is create a
high quality product that works well
looks good and it's fun to use the
product has a large clear display a
smooth dial 30 lakhs and a clean look to
compare to the highest quality
containers available in store
the design process took over a year we
investigated many options and with each
prototype will refine the design until
we ended with a great working product
the container base is made from four
millimeter thick acrylic for durability
and a clean look the LCD display was
custom developed to incorporate large
high contrast characters for easy
viewing the dial is specifically
selected for a smooth action time can be
set for short is one minute or long with
ten days the electronic locking
mechanism with designed to ensure a
strong appeal we have tested the kitchen
safe and your confidence that it is a
great product there you have it the
kitchen state we worked harder to
develop a great product and a blind to
the factory for production and this is
where we need your help by ordering a
kitchen space and spreading the word to
your friends you can help us turn is
just an idea into a product that
thousands of people can use and enjoy
from all of us at the kitchen safe we
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
