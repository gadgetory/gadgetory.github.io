or purse is impractical uncomfortable or
just a little bit risky so we made
curved the world's first contactless
payment ring now you can leave all this
at home and still pay for stuff with a
single gesture no pin or ped smartphone
required you can use a curve to make
instant payments anywhere that displays
the contactless payment symbol which at
last count was over 38 million locations
worldwide engineered from zirconia
technical ceramic curve is
hypoallergenic nearly a scratch
resistant as diamond and waterproof and
unlike power-hungry smartphones or
smartwatches curved never need charging
but there's more to curb than just
payment if you're in London you can
simply tap in on buses and on the
underground avoiding card clash and that
frenzied search of a barrier is ticket
or Oyster card you kill so store contact
details to share with friends or
colleagues at the tap of an NFC enabled
phone and you can even use to operate an
NFC door lock that access your home or
office
curse the world's first contactless
payment
the Rufus Cup connects to your iPhone or
Android smartphone allowing true
hands-free calling in Travis what's up
hey I'm in traffic to be there no
product being better it also works with
your smartphone's voice control to
easily compose messages send a text to
match
Travis is very late and since the Rufus
cuff is connected to your smartphone
you'll instantly be alerted if you leave
it behind and when the situation is an
ideal for voice dictation the Rufus
cuffs 3 inch wide screen allows you to
easily compose emails messages or text
built-in GPS accelerometer and gyroscope
allow the Rufus cuff to track stats like
steps walk calories burned and distantly
traveled
full two-way connectivity to your
smartphone allows the Rufus crop to
control things like your smartphone's
playlists so you don't have to take it
out of your pocket backpack or purse to
find the music you want you can even
trigger your smartphone camera to make
sure everyone gets in the group shot
with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi the Rufus cuffs
can connect to an endless amount of
smart devices like light your Bluetooth
enabled smart lock and your thermostat
when your smartphone runs out of power
the Rufus cuff will continue working on
Wi-Fi all on its own and with an
integrated front facing camera the Rufus
cuffs can make and receive video calls
we're proud to introduce the ample smart
backpack the world's most advanced
portable charging solution integrated
directly into the fabric of the bag I
think that it should be easier to charge
your phone in your laptop wherever you
are without needing to find a power
outlet my life is lived on the go I
can't keep my laptop charged past noon
my phone needs to be plugged in before
3:00 p.m. I must have tried every
portable charging system portable
battery most of them just don't get it
done what I really need is a serious
charging solution that can power
anything anytime anywhere
the portable charging solution that I
needed didn't exist and I wanted to
build it and when I explained what I
wanted to do to some engineering friends
of mine they wanted to help because they
needed it - we're proud to introduce the
ample smart backpack affordable charging
solution that we needed and we think you
might need - and we're proud to have
been named a 2015 CES Innovation Awards
honoree in two categories a testament to
the engineering rigor that was put into
the development of this product so I've
been designing bags for over a decade
and the challenge here was that the bag
wasn't just holding your devices but you
are also plugging your devices into the
bag for them to be charged I started to
create illustration drawings where I
would then send them to Tomoko and she
would start engineering the housings
around those pieces and then she would
send them back and I would tailor the
bag design around her CAD day our goal
was to create a design that was truly
intuitive for the user and we wanted the
electronics to almost disappear into the
fabrics of the bag the amplifier
backpack can charge all of your devices
overnight or throughout the day we
integrated a powerful custom-built
battery that can recharge a smartphone
two to three times there's a USB port in
every pocket and you can add three
expansion batteries for days that you
need more power the modular batteries
charge rapidly when docked into the bag
but can also be removed and used
separately you can stick in your coat
pocket area first and take to dinner
with you and you don't have to carry the
with you to have that backup power when
we first thought about putting
electronics into a backpack we
immediately worried what happens if you
drop it so we added shock absorbers and
an extra layer foam all the way around
and we apply the water-resistant coating
to all of the exterior fabric to help
keep the rain out you ever forgotten
your backpack at a coffee shop the ample
smart backpack can alert you if you do
and we built a mobile app that will
monitor battery levels connected devices
and smart sensors in the bag where you
can use the OLED display and touch
sensor to monitor the vitals inside of
the bag without ever opening a zipper
sample is a talented team of designers
and engineers with decades of experience
launching new products more importantly
though we're commuters travelers coffee
shop dwellers and on-the-go doers and we
needed a more ample bag we have a plan
to get into production by early summer
but we need help to get there we're
hoping to raise at least 125,000 dollars
to cover the cost of tooling and raw
materials and as a thank you to our
early backers we're offering a 25%
discount on the bag and all of the
accessory modules please support us in
bringing ample smart backpack to life
introducing drum pants 2.0 better back
stronger attack the wearable midi
triggers to any part of your clothing
choose from infinite down wirelessly
control over 300 music apps on your
phone or icons in your pants you're
under than your shoes wherever you wanna
go
so with all right get money holy ring
what I like about the drum dances that
they're really small very light Wireless
being able to bring my higher
the new insurance we're going to
incorporate these three realities on
work loadings well my other is we really
improve the latency over Bluetooth le
and now with Apple's MIDI over Bluetooth
you can connect your pants to your
laptop or can get wireless give you
phone iPad control other apps we're
making from hands open doors with your
help sometimes will be customizable
upgradeable and have the support of the
Arduino community kind in our production
on is set up and ready to go don't ever
get another chance to give this unique
wearable controller let's rock the drill
pants together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
