sometimes or worse have you ever felt
that the wires come here earbuds were
inconvenient especially when playing
sports now you have an option
that's the sound of your phone
connecting to a charger it's the sound
of relief knowing you are still
connected to the world connecting and
disconnecting your phone from a charger
should be a simple seamless task but it
isn't we've all been there frustrated at
our cables for any number of reasons the
spiky looks it's becoming smaller they
haven't evolved to become any easier to
connect until now presenting the future
of USB cables ASAP Connect featuring
rare-earth neodymium magnets with 18
karat gold plating ASAP Connect will
change the way you interact with your
USB devices forever
featuring the world's first reversible
cable on both the phone end and charger

it works by inserting the tip to the
phone and the cable magnetizes on to the
tip instantly meaning you can
effortlessly connect when you only have
one hand free or in a hurry to head out
or even in the dark
you no longer have to worry about your
devices getting damaged ASAP connect

devices such as Android phones mini
cameras and speakers the other is for
Apple products we've removed the
weakness of your traditional Apple
Lightning connector tip which snaps off
easily by combining the tip and base
into one piece we call this the alpha
connector one of the engineering hurdles
in designing a SAP Connect was its
compact size by condensing the
technology down to the size of a
fingertip we're able to make sure that
it's compatible with all phone cases in
creating a new standard for USB cables
we have performed the most stringent
quality control tests combined with
superior material to really challenge
the users expectations of what a
state-of-the-art USB cable should be
we've spent the past two years working
closely with one of the world's largest
USB cable manufacturers we're a team of
disruptors from Sydney to LA we believe
that users should be the creators of
products not large corporations seeking
profit over practicality we've created
the final prototypes and delivered
samples to dozens of major tech
publications worldwide through your help
combined with the magic of IndieGoGo we
hope to bring a SAP connect to life and
unleash the future of USB cables today
