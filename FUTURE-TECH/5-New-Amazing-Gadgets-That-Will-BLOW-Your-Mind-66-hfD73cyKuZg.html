first electronic candle lighter powered
by our patent-pending art lighter
technology when we first set out to
design a new CAD lighter
we started by reinventing everything you
know about candle letters today from its
design to how it works even replacing
the traditional flame
simply press point and light blending
canvas will never be the same
unlike an open flame that can reach
extreme temperatures as it rises our
patent-pending
art lighter technology creates a super
high intensity electric arc that focuses
of energy
and because it's flameless it can be
used in any direction without any
flare-ups and lights perfectly every
time
why settle for hard and use disposable
candle lighters when you can have a
rechargeable lighter designed to be seen
always Within Reach always charged and
always ready thanks for watching people
try to lose fat in different ways some
exercise some diet and some do nothing
but are they happy with the results yeah
except for these thunder thighs
well this mommy tummy is impossible
these handles don't get much love let's
face it we all have those stubborn areas
of fat we just can't get rid of meet
Silk'n lipo the first targeted fat
reduction device for home use that
really works no diet no exercise simply
use Silk'n lipo for just 15 minutes a
day and get results no diet no exercise
only 15 minutes a day that's right just
eight weeks targeting stubborn areas
will reduce fat and strengthen
underlying muscles so you can give your
body the shape you've always wanted
I don't know silken lipo really works
silken lipo uses the same proven
technology found in a large professional
light therapy machines found in the
world's most advanced and expensive
beauty clinics we've simply shrunk that
same technology into the first-ever
affordable easy-to-use home device to
make it even better we've combined the
low-level light therapy with electrical
muscle stimulation technologies EMS to
optimize the fat reduction and
strengthen underlying muscles
low level light therapy is a proven
technology for the permanent reduction
of fat with years of clinical experience
in my own clinic low level light therapy
is one of the most popular it can
permanently slim firm and shape areas
without downtime without pain without
discomfort without the side effects
associated with traditional surgical
treatments when I first heard that
they've been able to compact lower light
therapy into a simple little home device
I was understandably skeptical but when
I reviewed the basic science and the
results I've come to realize the Silk'n
lipo is as effective as some of my large
body contouring low light therapy
systems I use in the office that the
patient can use 15 minutes a day and
over the same kind of permanent fat
contour and body slimming results I've
been able to achieve within office
treatments
how does it work that is accumulated by
your body and stored in fat cells under
your skin Silk'n lipo uses specifically
calibrated frequencies of light to
perforate fat cell walls releasing their
fatty contents and harmlessly causing
shrinkage in the region once outside the
cell your body's natural processes flush
the fatty acids out of your system in
the same natural way regular dietary
fibers expelled to accelerate this
process and to help build strength and
muscle tone so can added EMS technology
this stimulates muscle activity and
circulation in the treated area speeding
up the rate at which the excess fat is
flushed out of your system leaving your
body looking its best Silk'n the
pioneers of permanent hair removal
technology shrunk down for home use now
brings you clinically proven
non-invasive fat reduction technology to
let you target those stubborn areas and
give your body the shape you want one
last thing for the first time on
IndieGoGo we're promising to ship by
Christmas or your money back guaranteed
say goodbye to stubborn fat
does this situation look familiar you're
flipping your pillow at night
desperately trying to fall asleep Munna
is a unique device that understands your
sleeping pattern and regulates your head
temperature to help you get the best
possible sleep Munna will help you to
start your day feeling fully recovered
and energetic sleep well live well hi
I'm David and this is Colleen and we're
the founders of Munna for years it took
me hours every night to fall asleep so
we decided to do something about it
together we developed a product that not
only gets you to sleep faster but also
helps you get the best sleep until it's
time for you to wake up so how do we do
that with temperature
temperature is the key to good sleep to
fall asleep our body needs to cool down
and lower temperatures help us get a
better sleep quality when we wake up it
is the opposite our body needs to warm
up and our head plays a critical role in
this temperature regulation that's why
munna improves your sleep by regulating
your pillow temperature simply place the
device on your bedside table insert the
pad into your pillowcase and use the app
to set the wakeup time the temperature
of the pad is regulated through water
circulation system which cools down as
you lay in bed to help you fall asleep
faster sleep and environment sensors
combined with machine learning help
understand your perfect sleeping pattern
and regulate the temperature accordingly
when it's time Munna will gently warm up
and wake you at naturally with the app
you will get key insights on your sleep
and how to improve it further
we believe that is not about how long
you sleep but how well you sleep so by
improving your night munna also improves
your day body temperature is very
important for sleep quality
so munna is one of the best sleep
technology to improve sleep we've done
more than 200 user tests and have an
ongoing clinical study we have spent the
last four months in Shenzhen China
working closely with manufacturers to
make sure we have a great design and can
ship a quality product on time to our
backers we've been working on this
project for nearly two years now and
we're finally ready for production we
want to bring you better sleep now all
we need is your supports thank you
the pocket tripod is an entirely new
concept it redefines conventional
standards for Portability and
functionality it's the world's first
iPhone stand that can transform from the
shape of a credit card to that of a
fully articulating stand which is able
to just iPhone continuously to any angle
in both portrait and landscape
the iPhone unlike any other smartphone
has a constant cross section all
throughout its edge on both sides that
means that you could place your iPhone
inside the cutout of the pocket tripod
and any direction both in landscape and
in portrait which in combination with a
90 degree sweep of the pocket tripod
gives the user a full 360 degrees of
angle adjustments
adjusting the angle of your iPhone with
a pocket tripod is just as you'd
naturally expect it to be like on a
full-size photography tripod all you
need to do is to swivel your iPhone to
the intended tilt angle and it stays in
that position having full control and
how your iPhone is oriented gives you
access to a whole new set of options
you'll find yourself using familiar
functionalities of your iPhone and
completely new and creative ways and the
quality and precision of the results
you'd get will amaze you the pocket
tripod being as thin as only a couple of
credit cards stacked on top will always
be there when you need it and you'll be
surprised by how often you'd end up
using it in everyday unexpected
situations making those tasks so much
more convenient to do using a stand that
gives you full control on the angle of
your iPhone means that it can adjust
your frame to get that perfect shot
every time instead of being limited by a
preset angle one of the best things
about the pocket tripod is that unlike
almost any other portable stand it
actually lifts right phone off to
services place on keeping it safe from
accidents
the pocket tripod is an assembly of six
parts and each of these parts have
dozens of complex little features that
allow the pocket tripod to transform
from one shape to another to develop the
really cool app available for free and
apps so for any way to inches to the
downloaded that has an interactive 3d
model of a pocket tripod in it to give
you a virtual hands-on experience with a
pocket tripod it even has a section we
can pick colors for the pocket tripod
that you think might look good and
suggested to us for future productions
the keys and passwords that you use

the revolution of access control
everything you just saw demonstrates
real technologies that work today now

for two
we plan to release an SDK which allows
other access control technologies to
seamlessly integrate with every key that
means your wristband could unlock and
start your car unlock your house store
turn on your lights and even replace
your credit cards think of all the
possibilities we designed every key from
the ground up with fashion as our North
Star we applied the same methods as a
haute couture fashion brand placing
meticulous attention to detail with
absolute precision
resulting in an elegant and sleek
product without compromise in aesthetic
or performance each beautiful color
option has been carefully refined to
reflect a unique personality our
continued obsession with design and
usability extends to every other aspect
of the every key experience every key
was born in an entrepreneurship class of
mine two years ago right here at Case
Western Reserve University I love the
idea so much I invested some capital to
help develop the product after receiving
an every key I've used it every day
since we used resources like the
Blackstone Launchpad for product
development and are currently signing
deals and manufacturers to mass-produce
every key we already have a mold for a
custom-made batteries and all we need
now is to develop a production mode for
the wristband enclosure that's where you
come in Kickstarter we need your help in
order to fund our first production run
become an owner of one of the first-ever
et's and you'll be a part of the access
control revolution
