reflections from the surface combined
with internal reflections to give us
emotion signals in fact we invented the
world's smallest three-dimensional laser
interferometer that is truly amazing let
me take it from here

just see everything in my normal range
of motion it's probably fine

know what's on I kind of like how this
is just here on my thumb kind of forget
that it's there it is cool to just look
down and see it much easier it's it's
Aries the viewing angle is much improved
like I can just look down and it's right
there it's facing up at me it still
lights up the screen when I move my arms
during cycling when you're in a narrow
position the watch is over here so
you're kind of turning your wrist a lot
for cycling and running I think it
really pretty comfortable have a
long-sleeve shirt on yes they're like

kind of cool I know when I have my son
toe on that when you're riding you have
to actually get one hand off and look at
your watch you put it on got it easy

your dashboard with every mobile app you

quality projector that puts the UI on a
transparent screen in the field of view
