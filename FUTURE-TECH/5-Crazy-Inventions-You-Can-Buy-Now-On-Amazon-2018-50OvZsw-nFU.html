this tablet
we wake up each morning to a brand new
day a day of balance and wellness we
nourish our body with healthy foods we
physically stretch our bodies in hopes
of stretching our minds everything we do
goes back to our well being but there is
one piece we often tend to neglect from
the wellness puzzle introducing turbo a
simple and effective addition to your
daily routine before the 19th century
toilets were non-existent people used to
squat to release two thirds of the world
actually still do and for good reason as
we adopted the toilet into our lives we
unknowingly added tension and straining
during bowel movements studies have
shown us the perpendicular posture
brought on by the toilet creates a kink
in the colon which makes it difficult to
go it also makes us susceptible to a
number of other health issues by
elevating your feet that kink disappears
your muscles are able to relax and your
colon is open for quick and efficient
release and that's why we invented turbo
turbo is an elegant yet affordable
solution that makes a great addition to
any bathroom it's sleek design allows
for flexibility and comfort the unique
ramp design makes using turbo easier for
any person of any size the lower toe
area allows you to easily load your feet
then you can position your feet forward
or backward on the ramp to adjust to a
squat that's just right for you and with
turbo squatting is only the beginning
turbo comes with interchangeable massage
rollers to further increase your comfort
on the toilet not only does it feel good
but it can help with constipation too
your feet have pressure points that can
stimulate your colon when it's time to
go massaging with turbo also helps with
blood circulation which can improve your
energy levels to get you through the day
we have come a long way and we are
almost there the only thing missing is
your support
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
