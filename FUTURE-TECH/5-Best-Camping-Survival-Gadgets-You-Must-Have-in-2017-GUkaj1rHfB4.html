hurricanes leave us without running
water gas and electricity quick stove
was born because we SCI need to provide
affordable but reliable camping and
emergency preparedness cooking solutions
we designed this emergency cook kit to
provide you and your loved ones with the
assurance that you will have a way to
cook food and boil water in any
situation the quick stove cook kit
includes a custom stainless steel pot
with a sturdy handle that locks the lid
down for easy transportation the lid can
also be used as a cooking pan eating
plate or flipped upside down while
cooking to be used as a double boiler
when not in use the pot holds the stove
and to fuel discs for easy
transportation as a self-contained kit
the cube stove weighs less than a pound
and is made of durable steel which makes
the stove strong enough to support any
sized pot or pan you would like to use
the stove is optimized to burn the quick
stove fuel disks but easily burns other
fuel sources like hexamine fuel tablets
sterno cans wood charcoal and alcohol
burners
when using the provided pot and fire
starters you can boil four cups of water
in under four minutes the fuel disc is
made of cedar and wax and will burn for
25 to 35 minutes the fuel disc is
essential for emergency preparedness
because it is waterproof and because it
can be stored for years without going
back we hope you never have to use this
emergency cook kit but in the event that
you do you will be prepared to cook food
boil water and provide heat in any
situation thank you for supporting our
Kickstarter and make sure to keep a kit
in your car office and home the kit is
great for gifts so make sure you buy
extras for friends and family

obviously weight is a huge factor but
days like that also demand that you stay
fully hydrated so that you can
consistently be performing at your best
those two things really conflict because
water adds a ton of weight
we designed the trail shop micro filter
to help you save weight essentially it
gives you a full day's water supply at a
mere five ounces and fits in your pocket
when I trail run I like to carry two
small water bottles when those are empty
I can use the trail shop filter to drink
directly and instantly from a stream
along the trail then I can quickly fill
up my bottles with clean water and get
going again or if I'm wearing a
hydration pack I can connect it straight
to my hose and fill up my reservoir the
trail shaft filter is so tiny it fits in
a stash pocket alongside my bars and
it's quick to deploy you just dropped
the pre-filter in the water and start
filtering it treats a liter of water in
60 seconds the trail shop filter uses
hollow fiber technology that meets the
highest standards for removing protozoa
like Giardia and Cryptosporidium and
bacteria like e.coli and Salmonella so
you have reliable water all along your
journey the filter cartridge has a 2000
litre lifespan depending on water
conditions which for me is seasons of
water at MSR our goal is to design
products for simplicity and
functionality giving you everything you
need and nothing you don't
you
