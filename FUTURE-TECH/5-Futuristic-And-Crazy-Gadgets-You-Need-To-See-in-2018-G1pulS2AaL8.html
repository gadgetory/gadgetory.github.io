on your own
follow your dreams to a place a space
the grace that takes you
to keep me
presents this is often touted as a holy
grail of virtual reality but what is
presence his presence just feeling like
you're in another world well no I think
that's the bare minimum for me true
presence is about being a part of this
other world being aware of it as it is
aveer i'm Lachlan Wilson CTO and
co-founder of Furth and we are
presenting to you the world's first
consumer eye tracking virtual reality
had not displayed one of the keys to
this is our eyes communication for the
first time virtual characters will
perceive your gaze how about you lock
eyes with a monster stare them down
well how about share a moment of eye
contact with a fellow hero a heroine
before they dive into peril gaze our
natural human reaction will become a
trigger for modern storytelling and
expand the possibilities of interactive
cinema - even in the field of healthcare
we enabled a boy with muscular dystrophy
to play music with his eyes and a 90
year old grandmother used our systems
remotely attempter grandson's wedding by
a robot when she could not control aim
with your eyes accurately and faster
than with any other controller this
could give you a killer edge in intense
action games
a lie tracking works with the speed of
thought both can enable a magical UI
experience where the information you're
looking for is in front of your eyes
before you even know it depth of field a
key to presence is a sense of immersion
by rendering realistic depth of field in
the fovea regions and appropriately
blurring the periphery when fovea -
rendering is properly adopted in the
future it would be possible to focus the
GPU power where the user is looking
greatly reducing the overall power
required to render a scene with no
perceptible reduction in quality we
build a specialized state-of-the-art eye
tracking solution into a solid via our
hardware platform that boasts 42% more
pixels the current mainstream PC
headsets we back all this off with our
own compositing SDK and open VR and os
VR support to leverage existing content
and ensure developers don't waste their
time developing for a closed ecosystem
as a firm developer you will have access
to potentially up to 25 million users
per month at 7,000 internet cafes across
Japan and Korea that are using our head
mount display on their high-end pcs we
have finally finished something that
everyone here at firm is proud of and we
are getting ready to ship our first lot
to Kickstarter backers and then to you
VR developers around the world
interested in creating new experiences
let's push the boundaries of what is
possible but a reality as
yes together older year for a 12 count
what's been missing of course is
the interface between the real world and
the simulated world I really felt like
it was messing with my senses and taking
me somewhere else but the thing that
science fiction never shows us is the
set of tools the infrastructure that
gets us there PC based virtual reality
is incredible the graphics are amazing
but it's the positional tracking that
really immerses you but what if you
didn't need a PC bridge is a new headset
designed specifically for the iPhone
with an onboard structure sensor Bridge
unlocks full inside-out positional
tracking no high-end PC no markers and
no external cameras unlike existing
mobile VR where all you can do is look
around with bridge you'll be free to
actually move bridge even brings the
real world into view automatically
helping you avoid obstacles bridge comes
with a unity plugin so you can easily
upgrade your projects with these new
capabilities plus you can still use
existing iPhone VR apps and rotation
only mode but we didn't stop with
virtual reality bridge can actually
sense the world around you and we use
this to enable something unprecedented
full mixed reality all on an iPhone with
bridge you could visualize new furniture
practice keeping a garden
create a portal to anywhere in the world
or bring the world to you
you can experience the virtual and the
real at the same time in a way the
bridges the essential gap between the
augmented reality of the past ten years
and the mixed reality experience of the
next step to make all of this possible
on the iPhone we had to create a
completely new software engine for
mobile mixed reality we call it bridge
engine we engineered bridge engine from
the ground up to run in real-time
completely on device with no external
processing immersive mixed reality
requires a wide view of the world so we
designed a custom glass lens that
doubles the iPhones field of view bridge
engine fuses this view with 3d sensor
data displaying a unique image to each
of your eyes bridge engine is capable of
powering amazing creations like Brigitte
our curious little robot companion
Brigitte can already do some incredible
things like navigate around obstacles
play fetch
and even interact with real objects
will collaborate with the developer
community to teach Bridget more about
the world in fact we're making Bridget's
high-level functions open source and
developers can use them in their own
projects Bridget the little robot popped
up and she kind of walked around a
footstool and and it's something that's
really hard to do I think most people
probably don't realize that just for the
ability to move from point A to point B
you need to know what the map looks like
your honor where there are obstacles so
we can navigate around these things and
I was I was just shocked that it worked
so well the first ideas for bridge were
sketched in 2014 and we've been
obsessing over the details ever since
for example we chose to use lightweight
anodized aluminum for precision
alignment of the optics we developed a
magnetic system that holds bridge
securely shut yet is easily opened and
we designed a bike helmet inspired
ratchet to easily adjust fit while
simultaneously improving weight
distribution the dust rose design is
good the optical design is good
certainly your camera is magic the
bridge headset felt like it was a
product 5-10 years into its evolution
join us get a bridge headset our limited
Explorer edition for developers is being
assembled now and will ship in a matter
of days here's what you'll get a bridge
headset complete with structure sensor a
Bluetooth controller access to bridge
engine and our unity plug-in and of
course bridget at occipital we've always
wanted to help shape the future of
computing bridge is part of our effort
to do just that
and it builds on everything we've done
to date
we hope you'll join us on the frontier
of this strange and fantastic new world
well yeah I have a closing statement I
won't whine how soon can I get it
hey check this out
360 video
tonight
introducing expanse expanses an
immersive near eye display with
see-through capability that uses your
smartphone to project panoramic IMAX
like imagery add up to five times a
resolution of VR viewers
providing you a personal theater
experience anytime and anywhere
compatible with most modern smartphones
simply slide your phone into expanse
connect an optional controller or air
mouse and immerse yourself in your
favorite movies shows and apps in
stunning resolution hi I'm will founder
of expanse as a gamer I love the idea of
3d hands-on fully immersive
virtual-reality like the rift revived
but there just isn't enough good content
out for these devices and it'll take a
while before there is so with that in
mind I set to work designing a VR device
that would transform the way we use non
VR content like playing video games or
binge watching your favorite movies or
TV shows anyone who's watched a movie in
a gear VR or a rift knows how immersive
it is to watch a video and a life-size
virtual theater the current VR devices
just don't have the resolution needed
for movies and games why is that
well Nagar VR each eye sees a separate
roundish image but uses less than half
of the screen worse the standard
rectangular aspect ratio for videos and
most non VR content has to fit within
your VR square aspect ratio wasting
another half of the pixels this is why
gear VR content is pixelated and suffers
from the so called screen door effect
there just aren't enough pixels but with
expanse each eye can see all of the
displays pixels providing up to 3.6
million pixels per eye almost twice the
resolution of a 1080p TV and five times
more than a movie in gear VR or a rift
but resolution is only half the battle
immersion also requires field of view
other near eye displays are described as
looking like say a 50-inch TV of eight
feet
as you can see here this gives you about
a 30 degree field of view for comparison
behind it is a 10 foot projector screen
which provides a 64 degree field of view
and here is expanse and almost twice the
resolution and over 90 degrees field of
view this means you can catch your
favorite movie show or sports game on an
IMAX sized screen in full resolution
anywhere in your house or on the go
expanse uses your phone so you can
stream your content anywhere you can get
a cellular or Wi-Fi connection
we've also sourced a full HD display
cartridge that slides into expanse and
connects to your favorite HDMI device
and we're currently working on a 4k
AMOLED cartridge which would provide a
4k TV experience at 10% the cost of a
similar TV but this is only the
beginning expanses head tracking and
see-through capability allow you to use
it in new and exciting ways with it's
stunning resolution expanse is the
single best way to experience new and
immersive 360 content spans doesn't
suffer from pixelation or the so called
screen door effect which can ruin
immersion drone enthusiasts can watch a
high-definition real-time feed from
their drones camera overlaid on the real
world letting you pilot your drones
while simultaneously getting a
first-person view of the flight from the
cockpit and GoPro heroes can show off
their most recent adventures the way
they were meant to be seen while HDR
photography enthusiasts can see their
photos on-site in wide field of view
right when they take up expanse also
offers new and exciting challenges for
software developers to begin making the
first wave of apps that utilize our
unique see-through design whether it's a
heads-up display of GPS or an augmented
reality pet your imagination set the
limit for what expanse can view we've
been through countless product design
and prototype iterations we finally
arrived at a design that is comfortable
functional and stylish we have
production quotes from multiple
manufacturers including a handful that
are capable of moulding and coding our
unique
optics and should be ready to start
production in 12 weeks we're extremely
excited to share expansion the
Kickstarter community so please support
us and help make expanse a reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
