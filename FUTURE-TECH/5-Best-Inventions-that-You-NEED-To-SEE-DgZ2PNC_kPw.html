super efficient camping stoves that run
on the natural resources around you like
twigs and sticks in 2011 we created the
original solo stove a 9-ounce super
efficient backpacking stoves that can
boil a pot of water with literally a
handful of sticks we also created a
number of accessories to go along with
it we have been blown away by all the
positive response people all around the
world love the Sola stove the solo stove
is a great stove for one or two people
but we had a lot of customers asking us
for a larger stove so in 2013 we created
the solo stove Titan a larger Sola
stoves that can be used for you and your
friends still our customers wanted an
even larger solo stove we heard your
requests and that's why we're creating
our largest stove yet the solo stove
campfire the campfire uses the same
design and technology as the original
patented Sola stove but it's bigger
don't worry though it's still super
efficient and weighs only 2 pounds it's
made out of premium stainless steel and
our one piece construction ensures
durability and quality the campfire is a
perfect stove that your entire group of
friends or whole family can enjoy at the
same time we wanted to bring that
campfire experience and excitement to
all of you who just want a simple and
easy campfire whether it's at a campsite
or in your backyard it's designed with a
double wall which allows airflow through
the bottom hole to the stove to channel
air to the bottom of the fire and up
between the walls of the scope this
preheated air feeding back into the fire
through the smaller holes at the top of
the stove causes a secondary burn this
allows the fire to burn more complete
which results in a more efficient fire
with very little smoke a more efficient
burn also means you'll use much less
wood compared to an open campfire we are
running this Kickstarter campaign
because we need your help our Factory is
ready our tooling is done and our
prototypes have been tested
we now need your help to cover the costs
of our first production run if we meet
our goal of $20,000 we will be able to
bring you solo stove campfire
here and it will allow it to continue
building new and better products we have
awesome rewards at all levels including
a custom cooking set just for the solos
of campfire the cooking set comes with
two stainless steel pots which the
Phyllis's campfire connection for easy
packing and storage it also includes a
compact aluminum tripod for cooking soup

a few years ago no one would have ever
thought that life would become a giant
collection of digital files this
ever-increasing amount of digital
information is your history your
memories your life where do you store it
how do you keep it safe we can't count
on our hardware devices they break they
get stolen or we lose them and our
lifetime of photos and personal
information goes with them we all love
the cloud it makes sure our information
stays intact even when our devices don't
but we also fear the cloud our entire
digital life is somewhere else in
someone else's hands what if they wanted
to sell your data or steal your identity
or use your bank information what if
they could see or duplicate your photos
or find out where you live it's
important to remember that what gets
uploaded to the cloud stays in the cloud
even if you delete your copies they're
out there forever but what if you had a
small easy-to-use device that encrypted
all your cloud stored data at the source
so your files would appear jumbled
unreadable to everyone but you there is
such a device it's called Smid and it's
built for people like you who love the
cloud but need to make 100% sure that no
one will ever see your data
Smith Pro is the only cloud privacy
device designed and priced for personal
use
it automatically encrypts your
information before it leaves your home
or office or wherever you are you get a
light portable device and a single
startup key all you need to do is create
an account and choose your cloud
providers that's it you're up and
encrypting all of your cloud stored data
even if someone did try to access or
view your information in the cloud all
they would see is encrypted data it
would be of absolutely no value or
interest to them at all one total
privacy in the cloud just plug in your
Smith safeguard your digital life
forever
