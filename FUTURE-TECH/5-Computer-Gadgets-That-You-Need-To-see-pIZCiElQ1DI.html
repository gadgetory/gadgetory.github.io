on IndieGoGo thank you your support
matters
my name is viktoria who I just graduated
from UC Berkeley and I am the co-founder
of accent accent where is a company that
makes innovative headphones that you
haven't seen before I came up with idea
wild goat but I was never able to turn
into a reality
fortunately I met my best friend
Victoria and she was able to help me
with a lot of the things that I could
accomplish by myself so we came up with
the idea for the name for accent where
when we were actually just on Facebook
and we were chatting with a bunch of our
friends and we were like hey guys let's
think of a good name that would be
fitting for this new company and we're
just throwing ideas back and forth and
finally someone said oh you know what
what about accent wear and we're like
you know what that sounds pretty good
first I came up with a few sketches I
drew them on people's had to get idea of
how they were looked I tried all
different colors different designs
there's a great lab at UC Berkeley and
we just got a fellowship at the
Innovation Lab and we would go in every
week and we would take her around and we
just put things online finally got a
design that I'm happy with I started
doing a 3d model of it I have a physical
model to try on people one of the things
that we ended up changing through
feedback from our our fans on Facebook
was that they wanted bigger cans they
wanted it over the year instead of on
the year so we changed that because a
lot of people were requesting that each
new prototype the headphones get closer
and closer to what we envisioned so
these are the headphones accent or
accent and the headband and all the
plastic parts are made of ABS which is a
recyclable material so it is
environmentally friendly that way these
are the LED lights that are that show up
that would be the color that you choose
we're going to have a couple of options
these are the external speakers so you
can share music with your friends we're
really excited to make these a reality
and to take these from the prototyping
stage to the final product we really
hope that you'll support us and our
endeavor please back us up on our
campaign and help us turn this into a
reality thank you
