pretty handy Sesame's different you can
install it in seconds literally no one's
screwing no replacing Sesame has a
patented design that fits any latch
anywhere in the world the app is
handsome and intuitive but you can open
your door without it like this or like

Sesame senses when my phone is nearby
and gets ready for my special not
and I can get the optional Wi-Fi access
point it plugs into the wall nearby so
sesame is always on my home network and
it's linked to the access point with
Bluetooth which keeps it connected while
going easy on the batteries it would no
keys it's easy to let other people in -
I can choose who has access and who
doesn't

and closes so I can always know what's
going on no matter where I am and it's
got military-grade encryption
