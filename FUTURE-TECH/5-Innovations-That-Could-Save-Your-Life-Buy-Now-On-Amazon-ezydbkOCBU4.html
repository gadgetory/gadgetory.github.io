Sawyer's very first product in 1984 was
the extractor pumpkin the extractor come
from this poison from snakebites wasp
and bee stings mosquito bites and more
the pump acts as a vacuum which provides
the most powerful suction available to
remove venom from the body by sucking it
out the same cavity through which it was
injected there's no need to use
dangerous blades or knives that come in
less effective bite kits Deezy extractor
select the suitable sized suction cup
pull the trigger to its full extent and
place the suction cup over the bite of
the stain using your thumb press the
plunger all the way in until you feel
the suction and let the pump remove the
poison this should take about 60 to 90
seconds for insect bites pull the
plunger out to gently release the vacuum
for snakebites Center a suction cup over
one thing hold a time and alternate
between fan holes every 2 to 3 minutes
for 15 minutes discontinue use after 15
minutes retrieving venom can
significantly improve treatment results
most snake bites occur in the
extremities like the arms lower legs or
the angle and the effectiveness of the
extractor probably varies with the
location of the snake bite the extractor
pump can most effectively remove venom
that pools outside the muscle areas and
venom often pools outside the muscles
and bites to the hands feet and ankles
in large muscle areas like the calf the
venom enters the circulatory system much
quicker and the extractor pump is less
effective at removing venom in those
areas stings and insect bites leave
venom and poisons close to the skin
surface where they can easily be
retrieved best results occur when you
apply the pump quickly before fluids
enter the circulatory system barber
mosquito bites can be treated
successfully hours after the bite has
occurred
