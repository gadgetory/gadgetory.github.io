you're breastfeeding and managing a
career today I'd like to make it easier
for you
this is Anya she's the reason I'm making
this video I can't stop working because
I like living in a house and having food
on the table but I don't want to
compromise my daughter's well-being as
well so I don't want to stop
breastfeeding whether I'm at home or an
important meeting
that's why milk pumping machines were
invented so that someone else my husband
for example could fidget but there's one
huge problem most of them suck only up
to 60% of the milk because their suction
cups are designed like this does this
look like it imitates the section of a
baby I don't have enough milk for the
bottle after Anya is finished eating my
body doesn't accelerate the milk
production because 40% of the milk is
still left inside my breasts so my body
thinks there's too much milk inside my
breasts and reduces the milk production
sometimes I know gets hungry and mad and
I'm frustrated because I can't do
anything to help her I looked for a
pumping machine that would pump 100% of
my milk but I couldn't find one
after hours of research I came up with a
way to make the existing pumping
machines better I met up with a genius
engineer who has already designed more
than 30 patents and challenged him to
design one for me
six months later meet Annabella
Annabella is a pumping machine that
draws close to 100% of mothers milk
because it actually simulates the baby's
sucking motion this spherical part under
the main opening contains a mechanism
which imitate the baby's tongue and the
upper part enables power and Gryff
adjustment just like a real muscle
system it has a unique patent-pending
mechanism which makes you feel like a
real baby is sucking the milk the pace
and the intensity can be adjusted it's
user-friendly washable quiet and small
you can charge it and easily take it
with you we made sure that the
production process is also simple to
make Anabella affordable our concept has
been validated by breastfeeding experts
as well as a respected pediatrician it
solved the problems I was experiencing
as a first-time breastfeeding mother it
has one part that needs to be washed and
it's designed to connect with almost any
bottle type the battery allows you to
pump several times before needing to
charge it again we are currently
developing an app which will monitor the
amount of milk thought and recommend the
optimal pace and intensity of the
process we need your support to
introduce this product to the market
millions of moms are waiting for an
innovative product like the Annabella
your financial support will help us
start production in the future we will
take an ability to retail companies in
order to distribute worldwide we hope
you're excited as we are about the
Anabella
even a small contribution will help us
get to the finish line that much sooner
if you have followers on Facebook or any
other social media please share this
video think of all the moms you'll be
helping by doing so
it's my new best friend I love my hi so
this is called the H eye massager or hi
massager it was originally developed to
help women with post c-section pain it
was effective at relieving that
discomfort but it had an unexpected side
effect without direct genital
stimulation women claim to have
experienced some of the most intense
orgasms ever yes you can keep it if you
want during our research we found that
learning a few key skills can
dramatically improve the quality of life
for couples other researchers have found
similar conclusions in fact a recent
study of over 8,000 people found those
who enjoyed their lives most
consistently had two characteristics
while some would think it would be well
for fame that actually had little to do
with it the happiest people basically
got enough sleep and had a great sex
life I just really wanted to Reese Park
things between us but nothing seemed to
work and they were doing research on
intimacy with couples and they had this
product called hi and an online intimacy
program hi I'm dr. Steve McGee and I'm
doctor Wendy media we're clinical
sexologist and the founders of women a
couples wellness we discovered the
method behind hi accidentally in 2009
since then we've worked with several
thousand people testing and refining
with high I can get a great all-over
body massage with my clothes on and then
decide from there if I want to keep
going which usually I do some of the
guys were talking about high at work and
making fun of me saying I was gonna
become obsolete but the truth is when I
take care of her she just wants me more

hi there I'm dr. diva Tomei and as many
of you know I'm the CEO of Salonika and
inventor of kaya the natural lighting
robot kaya first premiered on IndieGoGo
this past September and ever since we've
been offering her on IndieGoGo in demand
as a pre-order over the past several
months kaya has evolved past even what I
could have dreamed we have changed her
name for those of you who remember Lucy
and have significantly improved her
design to the point that today we call
the final version kaya 2.0 we are now in
the process of getting kaya manufactured
and the entire Salonika team is
absolutely thrilled that we'll be able
to start shipping soon to our backers in
just a few short months but now let me
tell you a little bit more about what
she does
using kaya couldn't be easier just place
in a sunny spot point her towards the
room you want to illuminate and turn her
on she'll find the Sun all in her own
and redirected slide into your home or
office
kaya solar-powered so you never have to
worry if she's charged and she
continuously monitors the movement of
the Sun throughout the day and remembers
where you want to send the sunlight so
you have natural light indoors all day
long if you have a dark or gloomy room
in your home or office
then kaya is for you with more than half
a million dollars raised to date on
IndieGoGo it's been a truly
life-changing experience to see the
amount of support for kaya around the
world as an organization we here at
Salonika believe in the importance of
upgrading our indoor spaces into places
in which we don't only live but we
thrive we won't be on IndieGoGo forever
so I strongly encourage you to take
advantage of our limited pre-order
offers on IndieGoGo and as always have a
bright day
hi my name is Rebecca Ozzie and I'm a
lactation consultant today I'm going to
be sharing my new paper product called
the lovey lactation massager
which is literally a lifesaver if you're
breastfeeding or pumping it's easy no
mold has multiple vibration modes
there's a hundred percent waterproof
which means you could use it in the
shower what I love about this product is
its unique shape it has three different
sides which helped you solve a bunch of
different recipe ting problems the
smooth back side can be used to help
soften the breast and stimulate letdown
the rounded edge can be used to dig into
plug ducts and help break them up and
the sides can be used to help move fluid
and express milk whether you're in the
beginning middle or end of your
breastfeeding journey this is a
wonderful tool to have on hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
