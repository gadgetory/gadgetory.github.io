and their movements to the beauty in the
way they light up a room they can't
survive in just any aquarium they need a
specialized tank with no sharp objects
or corners hi my name is Blake Fratton
on Brock rad and we are the co-creators
of the jellyfish and yes we're planning
a year ago we set out to create the
ultimate jellyfish tank one that solved
all the problems every other tank on the
market every aspect of the jelly tank
design was based on functionality in
form with its clean lines sophisticated
look and natural flow our proprietary
tank design patent it slow bark ensures
a current similar to what jellyfish
would experience in their natural
environment we designed the spray bar in
a way to keep the jellyfish from getting
sucked into the grades while promoting
movement within this allowed us to
develop a powerful filtration system to
ensure hospital and water quality the
tank is small enough to fit on your desk
yet big enough to hold dozens of
jellyfish our design is twice as big as
other tanks and market which gives
jellyfish more stable environment to
makes it easier for you to maintain
there's nothing more beautiful and
illuminated jellyfish so we integrated a
high-quality remote-controlled LED light

color suits your mood
