home automation is awesome but current
smartphone products are both very
expensive and difficult to set up that's
why we created
hook is a platform that connects any
radiofrequency enabled device in your
home to the Internet with these $5 RF
outlets you can already add remote
control to any device in your home but
they only work within range of the
remote and with basic functionality
connecting a new device is incredibly
simple just sync your devices remote
with the hook app now I can control that
device from anywhere in the world
hook is compatible with IFTTT which can
be used to schedule operations of
routine tasks like turning on your
holiday lights at sunset
or turning your entire room into an
alarm clock folks capabilities are
limited only by your imagination you can
create rules that flash your lights when
your bus is nearby notify you if an
appliance is left on
or turn off your router if your daughter
is watching too much Netflix
wait wait wait come back
luck is powered by spark IO and will be
provided with an open API so anyone can
develop provoke and help expand its
capabilities and the best part you only
need one hook for your entire home
regardless of how many devices you are
connecting so we've been working for
over a year now trying to develop this
technology and then get it into a
packaged device that the users gonna
like and that we like ourselves so we
started off with a big board a big set
of electronics we added Wi-Fi
compatibility we added a USB hub so we
could power it through USB and then we
started adding things like radio chips
that we had a mixer it didn't interfere
with each other and then the trick is
trying to get that thing smaller get it
more compact to get it into the right
packaging so we made multiple 3d printed
designs each time we print something fit
the electronics into it put it on a
board look at it and figure out no wait
we can pop these chips off we can move
them this way we can read opt it we can
solder it's smaller we can get this
thing more compact and then the end we
we really came down to a product but it
feels nice looks good
a prototype that we're really proud to
ship hey Kickstarter
were the team behind hook we have been
working really hard for a little year to
make hook a reality we've got a great
product and we're very excited to bring
it to market but we need your help with
your funding we can get our molds get
our manufacturing process dialed in and
get hook to production so Phil as
excited as via back us share us and tell
our friends about hook so join us in our
journey to bring affordable home
automation to everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
