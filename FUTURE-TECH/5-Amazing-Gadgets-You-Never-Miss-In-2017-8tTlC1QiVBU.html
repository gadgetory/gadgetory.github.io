its smart technology it gets better with
every use it consists of a powerful
combination of high-tech IO glasses and
the user-friendly i/o app when designing
IO we put a special attention toward a
detailed scientific proof state of the
art technology and innovative thinking
we're all linked to each other
we are constantly interacting with our
potential customers to test our
decisions and real sure foods that
expection what I'm really proud of is
that we managed to create a highly
functional stylish and user-friendly

the oxygen this color is just the
beginning as you plan to release an open
API and there are many more of those
data dishes
the technology behind IO is based on
scientific proofs and research
breakthroughs developed over the past 20
years by leading institutions worldwide
IO is his first step in personal
adjustment of the internal body clock

us speed up the development delivery of
new features and starting production by
supporting us today you will become one
of the very first exclusive owners to
experience higher at an amazing price
additionally your contribution will help
us move this next generation technology
forward so pledge support us and share
our company it is incredible how much we
rely on weather forecasts and so-called
local temperatures the truth is that
those values available online or through
apps come from weather stations that can
easily be dozens of miles away
nothing beats measuring the values by
yourself right where you are but that's
just not possible and silly so we have
created the world's smallest weather
station that can easily fit in your palm
simply plug weather point into your
device and start the app simple as that
it consists of four sensors for
temperature humidity atmospheric
pressure and ultraviolet radiation with
this information you can have the most
accurate weather forecast anywhere you
are also by measuring atmospheric
pressure you can know you altitude more
precisely than GPS devices you can also
measure UV radiation and limit your
exposure to these harmful UV rays the
housing is made from aluminium and
titanium and ensures longer life time
when you're not using weather point it
is safely placed on your keychain so you
don't have to worry about losing it
where the point doesn't use a battery
well who likes them anyway it doesn't
even require internet connection but
building hardware is costly we invested
a lot of resources into making weather
point possible and now we need your
support to make it available and
affordable for everyone thank you
you
many people may not realize it but
quality sleep is key to a healthy life

diseases increased cognitive processes
promotion of anti-aging hormones
combating cancer and much more the key
to quality sleep this temperature these
facts would led us to develop the defect
utilizing convection the most effective
means for cooling your bed and your body
you're able to drift into a deep
rejuvenating sleep and stay there
without interruption
hi I'm Kurt Tompkins inventor of the
beef and did you know that most people
don't realize that they are sleep
deprived some simple signs of sleep
deprivation are feeling sluggish
irritability anxiety slow reaction time
difficulty controlling emotions as well
as people saying you just look tired
signs that the B fan can help are
tossing and turning kicking off your
covers or even sweating at night people
that are sleep-deprived due to
temperature will cycle from REM sleep to
deep sleep several times during the
night never really staying in the deep
sleep zone long enough to receive the
benefits of deep sleep with the beef and
you will gently slip into a deep sleep
that reward your body with rest and
rejuvenation the beef n combats
temperature swings the Rob you of the
quality sleep your body needs the beef n
is very simple to install once you have
it in place at the foot of your bed you
simply cover it with your top sheet tuck
it in and replace your comforter from
there you turn it on and enjoy a gentle
quiet breeze between your sheets this
breeze will cool your body and your bed
at the same time it makes no difference
as to why you are a hot sleeper we can
help and if you're looking to cut back
on your energy cost we can help there as
well according to the US Department of
Energy
raising your thermostat five to eight
degrees during the summer can return as
much as thirty percent savings on your
summer cooling cost the B fan allows you
to do this and still maintain a deep
comfortable sleep rest assured once you
use the B fan you won't know how you
ever slept without it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
