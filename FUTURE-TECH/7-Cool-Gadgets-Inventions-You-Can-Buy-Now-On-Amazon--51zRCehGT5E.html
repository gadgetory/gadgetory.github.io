let's be honest upgrading your home is
hard home automation should be easy but
today's products are difficult to
install and use that's why we created
switch mate switch mate turns your
current light switch into a smart switch
simply install it with a snap and
control it from your phone for a tap
simple right switch mate attaches with
magnets which means no rewiring or
modifying your switches perfect if
you're renting or on the move
with switch mate you can set timers for
your lights to come on when you're away
from home it's simple to control any
device powered by a light switch for the
additional ability to control your
lights from anywhere an optional hub can
be added and finally the comfort of
knowing that you never have to come home
to a dark house again so let's make our
home smarter one switch at a time
starting with yours
we've worked hard over the past year to
make switch made a reality but smart
lighting is just the beginning we want
to create a suite of products they're
extremely simple to use and our users
can take right out of the box and
install in seconds by backing us you're
joining our mission of making home
