a symbiotic and reliable device

attention to design and portability a
single device
for seamless digital experience
you
lined up organizes your day while you
organize your thoughts
we all want to be able to protect what's
important to us
but it's not always easy
and sometimes it's downright dangerous
that is until now the gun box is the
ideal way to defend responsibly the gun
box keeps your handgun safe while
allowing you quick convenient access
when you need it most the gun box is
built tough its die casts using aircraft
strength aluminum alloy with a tensile
strength of over 24,000 psi and a
melting temperature of over 1,000
degrees the gun box opens using your RF
signature your biometric signature or if
you want a combination of both you can
charge your phones tablets and other
devices using the two USB ports on the
back beneath the premier models tough
aluminum exterior you'll find other
innovative features like the gun box
auto alert system which will send
notifications directly to your phone in
the event that your gun box is tampered
with and if your gun box is stolen you
can track it in real time with the
equipped GPS technology safe storage
quick access
and all the fancy tech you would expect
from James Bond himself the gun box
defend responsible
you
you
if how we spell
is always connected staring at our
screens well that would be how we spend
the rest of our lives you see as humans
we are vulnerable and our smartphones
are engineered to use these
vulnerabilities against us this is why
we've intentionally designed a phone to
be used as little as possible the light
phone your phone away from phone it's a
casual second phone that encourages you
to enjoy quality time doing the things
you love the most free of distraction we
call this going light light phone uses
your same phone number source 10 speed
dials and only makes it receives phone
calls then leave your smart phone behind
while maintaining the peace of mind they
are still reachable light was born out
of Google's inaugural design incubator
in 2014 our idea was welcomed by some of
the brightest minds and technology and
design
soon after we launched our Kickstarter
campaign we pre-sold thousands of phones
and got over $400,000 in pledges we've
since partnered with Foxconn to engineer
and develop the light phone we've also
built a prior Thierry cloud platform
that enables the light phone to maintain
your existing phone number this is a
first for the US market the light phone
is packaged in a hardcover photography
book it reminds us the value of the
light phone is in the experience not the
object itself we've collected feedback
from our nearly 9000 users who are
working on a next iteration of the phone
it's going to be even better your
investment will help us to develop this
next light phone acquire contracts the
biggest telecoms and put the light phone
in a variety of stores taking light to
the next level you see light is a
different kind of technology company we
designed beautiful tools that respect
inspire and empower objects that help us
appreciate our lives
the light phone is just the beginning
hey there you are
okay he goes this skin a new breed of
other system kin is smart designed to
replace all the different kind of
systems up there with just one gene is

set with portable speakers they
