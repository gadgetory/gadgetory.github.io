I think it's amazing how many people had
the same experience with their earbuds
it definitely is you know an earbud
problem you know they're falling out you
can tell people are kind of pushing them
back in or they're uncomfortable they
make your ears tender so we needed to
create a solution in that solution is it
your hooks when you're running you know
outside or when you're working on the
gym you want something to stay with you
as an active person you want to achieve
that focus where you can push yourself
to a limit that you've never been before
and why be distracted by any earbud when
you don't have to be and we don't want
you to think this is only for athletes
this problem of earbuds falling out is
so common so what we've created with ear
hooks is a universal attachment that
connects to almost all in-ear circular
earbuds that increases their fit
increases their comfort as far as design
goes we've really looked at every piece
of ear hook you can see we've got a
shark fin design on the top here which
we call the tip this piece is what this
burst is a lot of the weight of the
actual earbud you see you've got the
elastic tire here which stretches on and
off we did a lot of testing we'd
relentlessly tweaked and changed the
design we prototyped over 20 different
ear hooks throughout the process the
testing ranged from running cycling
swimming surfing we really tried to do
everything we could to make sure that
these ear hooks could endure and with
every environment that they would ever
see we were very thoughtful in our
design process each step of the way
we've redesigned and we've reproduced
and we've retested it and we know now
that we have a product that is passing
all those tests we have flying colors
the same way athletes push themselves to
be great at what they do
we've pushed ourselves to make your
hooks great at what they do
right now your hooks are something that
not too many people know about but the
people that do know about it have had a
great response we want to share this
product with the world and we can only
do that with your help we're hoping this
will be a collaboration we're hoping to
learn more about our product from all of
you willing to hear some stories from
you guys and you know really make this a
great product together when you talk
about listening to music it makes you
want to move and with your hooks you
finally can
you
