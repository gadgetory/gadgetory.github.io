well thanks for the heads up Jeanne and
for everything
hi I'm Jordan and I wanted to tell you
about human gears new utensil line the
go bites
there's the uno duo and trio we made the
go bites from a proprietary nylon
material that's virtually unbreakable
while other utensils may not hold up
there's a reason we back the go bites
with a lifetime warranty the unos
u-shape is ergonomic and we improved the
fork and spoon ends the spoon is deep
enough for soup and designed to scrape
up every last piece of food the fork
tines are long enough for pasta and the
tapered splitter tines easily cut up
softer foods
the duo has the same optimized fork and
spoon ends and adds some neat tricks of
its own you can use the fork and spoon
separately or connect them together for
a tool that's even longer than most
extra-long utensils so it's no sweat to
reach into deep containers without
getting sauce all over your hands the
trio packs a full sized fork spoon and
knife into an ultra-thin case the tools
feature the same optimized ends and
they're accessible separately just grab
the one you want
the trio's knife is sharp enough to cut
chicken and it even has a bottle opener
we think you'll like the toothpick too
so that's the go bites lineup
super-strong
ergonomic smart and backed 100% by our
lifetime warranty the go bites uno duo
and trio the civilized tools for eating
on the go
