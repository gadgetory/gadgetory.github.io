prisms are unique collections containing
some of the world's rarest and most
valuable materials there are six
different collection configurations
available and each one contains six
genuine and authentic specimens these
specimens come from around the world and
some are hundreds of millions of years
old let's take these Alaskan gold
nuggets for example amazingly the gold
inside these nuggets was actually formed
in outer space so far as we know the
gold can only be created inside
exploding stars and meteorites brought
that God to earth billions of years ago
and how about this 3.5 millimeter
diamonds it took 1 million pounds per
square inch of pressure to create them
from carbon that's equivalent to the
force of an elephant standing on the top
of a regular-sized pencil and then -
Tyrannosaurus 4 hippos 500 6 draft seven
pandas and one Labrador climbing on top
each of these specimens is hand selected
and each collection was carefully
crafted by a team of expert acrylic
casters in the UK
producing a glass clear finish so if
you'd like to find out more about the
specimens the collections available and
the awesome extras that come with each
collection please scroll down the page
