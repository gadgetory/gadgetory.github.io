here and it looks pretty stylish the
misfit vapor is more in the vein of a
traditional round watch something that
plenty of other companies are aiming for
as well what separates it from the pack
is refinement a slightly slimmer and
lighter than other smartwatches I've
held even with a large 44 millimeter
case the vapor includes all the health
tracking pieces you've grown to expect
from it and also the company's first
wearable with built-in GPS and heart
rate tracking it also packs in four
gigabytes of storage so you can store a
decent selection of music for working
out phone free this is developing a
custom operating system for the vapor
which centers around a radial home
screen that you can navigate by swiping
along the edges of the screen the
software still early in testing though
so if it couldn't show off mini app at
$1.99 the vapor will be in line with
many other Android wear smartwatches and
it could be a decent alternative for
anyone who wants more stylish option
it'll be available later this year just
in time to compete with Android wear 2.0
devices if you've ever been in a rush
and snag your headphone cord if you've
ever been listening and needed to

ten years ago I was in my room feeling
suffocated I realized this was because
all I could see out my window was the
apartment building next door only I
could see nature spread out before me
that is the absent window but if you
dance who are hanging up on the wall and
the digital window will open up a whole
new world before you creating liberating
feeling different experience beautiful
scenery and sound from around world as
if you are actually there
encompass monitoring your day your
quality of time routines
beyond that windows the boundless world
stretching endlessly
read a book on a beautiful beach in
Hawaii or enjoy music with the tropical
breeze they even have a drink kayvyun
city lights of metropolis videos are
exclusively filmed with a 4k camera and
high performance microphone that's not
all
everyone is interested in what's
happening now so what's the world using
at most live-streaming it's easy to
operate
just select the scenery of your choice
iPhone or Android also with the AdMob

chirping of birds at the same time

large production costs
