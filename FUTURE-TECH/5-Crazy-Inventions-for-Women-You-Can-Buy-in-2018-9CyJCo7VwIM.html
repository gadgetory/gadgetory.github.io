had this big idea I wanted to build the
nail body
the smartphone nail art printer and
after hard work and perseverance we did
the nail BOTS uses your phone to print
art directly onto your fingernails and
it's instant here's how it works first
prep your nail you have to manually
paint your nails with a light colored
base coat
we recommend white because it really
makes that art pop next personalize
choose the images you'd love to print
whether it's pictures from your camera
roll of your best friends your dog your
cat or one of our three thousand free
emojis and icons in our mobile app and
eventually your own art designs finally
tap print and about five seconds that
art will appear
I'm a product manager here pre-madonna
I'm a coder but I'm also an artist and
in developing the nail BOTS we have
created a product that truly meets art
with engineers
it's fast it's simple I can print my
school mascot on my nails I can wear
them to all the football games all the
spirit weeks and all my friends say how
did you get that I said that I did it I
created it myself with the nail pot so
I'm in college and I'm really busy and
I'm always studying but I also want to
go out and have my nails look good too
so the nail ball just gets it done for
me in like five seconds like in and out
and I'm out the door and it's way better
than I could ever do thanks no BOTS the
real MVP I'm brandy Olson I'm Lauren
Olson were from Palo Alto and we love an
ale bot I think the nail bot is really
awesome because it integrates math
science technology art and you can print
whatever you want on the nail pot on
your nails and that's just super awesome
I really like that idea we built the
nail BOTS for you for the engineers the
hackers the coders the artists the maker
girls so three percent of this nail bot
campaign will go towards teaching the
next generation the tech behind the nail
body you're a partnership with maker
girl our Ambassador Program and our art
and coding tutorials if you want your
nail BOTS we need your help today early
backers will get a significantly
discounted price and access to beta
tests or nail box the nail bot is
powered by smart and dynamic
technologists we call ourselves prima
donnas and together with your support we
can build seriously fun technology with
the next generation of girls
thanks for watching go nail bye
maintaining our parents throughout the
day keeps us happy and confident we all
have those busy lives balancing work
family or even our daily routine when
there's a hangnail or hair that needs to
be plugged you want it gone now hi my
name is ty and the creator of s ago the
world's first any time
Nayland tweezing styler as an L bladder
myself I wanted it was quick and
convenient to keep my nails clean normal
nail kits are cheap bulky and get lost
when I was a teen I created the first s
ago in my dorm room using a soldering
iron tin snips and bolt cutters s ago
has 420 stainless steel and a nylon base
polymer with soft to the touch rubber to
keep everything quality and compact s a
ghost patent-pending design sets it
apart from any other styler or tool on
the market the nail clippers are
extremely durable razor thin and easy to
clean all you do is push down on the OL
on top extended to put back in the show
press down gently and slide back in the
shell the handmade slanted tweezers have
a perfectly aligned 25 degree angle for
high-definition brows it also has a
magnet and a ballpoint to make sure the
tweezers don't get lost in any bag or
drawer s ago is fully compliant with TSA
regulations the 180 grit nail file is
perfect for smoothing out those rough
edges it also includes a tip to get any
dirt under your fingernails to use all
you do is open up s a go find the no
break dial wheel it out and close
our multi-purpose curved scissors are
perfect that dreaded tag or any dead
skin to use open up si go put your
finger on the no brake dial then put
your finger on top of the scissors and
just snip
the Halfmoon cuticle pusher is designed
with the right angle to sculpted
cuticles all you do is open up s ago
find the no break dial and pull out the
cuticle pusher close s ago the cuticle
nippers are the tool we design the most
so in normal cuticle nippers well
they're actually made a tear and rip we
changed all that first off it stops at
an exact place you want it to be
also we drop down the angle in the
cutting so it clips instead of tears you
and your nails are special we believe
your nail care should be too
we need your help to fund first
production run up s ago for support
you'll be the first one to own an s ago
let's make on-the-go and style one
who says smart can't be beautiful now
you can have the best of both worlds
this is cuff it's a tiny device with
technology inside that fits into
different pieces of jewelry you wear it
on you throughout your day and it helps
in a bunch of different ways first cuff
keeps you notified your cuff can vibrate
when someone important needs to reach
you so you can be available even if your
phone isn't directly on you cuff also
helps you in an emergency if you ever
get in trouble you can press your cuff
an alert will go out to your friends and
family telling them you need help
they'll get your location and coordinate
with others to get you the help you need
fast cuff fits into an ever-expanding
selection of jewelry which means that
whatever your style and wherever you're
going cuff is with you tomorrow
you can put your cuff into a different
piece of jewelry to match your new
outfit notifications with a buzz safety
with a press all within a pretty
accessory don't you look smart and
coming soon cuff will keep you fit cuff
will monitor your movement and let you
know how active you are using the cuff
app you'll see how close you are to your
personal activity goals which is
literally a lifesaver if you're
breastfeeding or pumping it's easy no
bolt has multiple library modes there's
a hundred percent water group which
means you could use it in the shower
what I love about this product is its
unique shape it has three different
sides which helps you solve a bunch of
different breastfeeding problems the
smooth back side can be used to help
soften the breast and stimulate letdown
the rounded edge can be used to dig into
plug ducts and help break them up and
the sides can be used to help move fluid
and express milk whether you're in the
beginning middle or end of your
breastfeeding journey this is a
wonderful to
you have on hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
