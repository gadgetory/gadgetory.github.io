distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation why
isn't there a single tool that lets us
measure everything now there is
introducing beigel the smart tape
measure bagel lets you measure just
about anything at home and at work
bagel has three different modes string
mode wheel mode and remote mode string
mode is great for measuring straight
lines curves and around corners wheel
mode lets you measure irregular or odd
shaped objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice
descriptions just take your measurement
push the Save button and then tag a
voice memo to it dog the future ADA when
you're done bangle will send your
measurements to bagels mobile app via
bluetooth this mobile application lets
you review your saved measurements and
share them with your friends bagel is
precise it uses our patented technology
to make sure you always get an accurate
measurement also bagel has an
easy-to-read digital display that's
viewable and most lighting conditions in
the past few years
also some measuring devices have become
smarter and made our lives easier it's
math skills smart thermometers and even
smart watches but when it comes to
measuring size we still use a tape
measure which is more than a century old
why don't innovate the way we measure
size so we created bagel a smart tape
measure we put a lot of effort into
creating bagel our team worked night and
day to make the best quality product
with the spendable design we have our
final prototype that is ready for mass
production now we need your help to
deliver this amazing product to everyone
please help us bring this bagel to life
thank you
science matters
bagel
my name is Benny me product developer
and founder of the EB Tool Company we
use tools to make tools me and my father
spent seven years developing a quick
gripper uses patented technology to
convert pulling force into gripping
force anytime you get a nail or a staple
that needs to come out it's always a
paint hammer uses a conventional cloth a
lot of nail much like the cat's paw it's
on the back of the put the quick gripper
basically coming around the head and
then pulling the nail out that way the
quick Ripper it's got that cat's paw but
it's also got these jaws it'll pull just
about anything you can get in those be
it screws staples nails whatever you
actually get a lot more leverage with a
quick Ripper more force up top more of
it is translated into polling force
because of the way it's designed so as
you're pulling it out it's gripping
harder and harder and harder the harder
you pull the harder it grips and it
makes just about anything come out
staples are pain to get out with a
conventional hammer because it can only
grab one side at a time
the quick grippers wide jaws can grab
both sides of the staple at once pulling
the whole thing out in one fluid motion
no matter where it's at nothing else
pulls a nail in the corner out but the
quick Ripper does the jaws will pull out
what conventional forks won't ever come
close to because it can actually get
right into a corner and pull those nails
screws and staples out things like long
nails right now conventional hammer
can't get a nail past a certain point
the quick Ripper allows you to take a
second bite at that nail and pull it all
the way through pretty much no matter
how long the nail is you can get it out
with the quick gripper it doesn't matter
if the nail is mangled if it's headless
in fact it's got enough gripping force
that it can actually grab the pointed
end of the nail
pull it right through a board doesn't
matter if the head is there or not the
quick rubber helps save you money in
several different ways it replaces a lot
of tools that you wouldn't normally have
to carry around things like locking
pliers a large crowbar a hammer it
replaces several tools at once so you
don't have to hunt for another tool when
the one you have won't do the job does a
quick River does them all it can
actually help you repurpose wood you can
take old boards off of a deck pull all
the nails out no matter how embedded
that head is you just grab the whole
thing pull it through in one fluid
motion reuse all those boards it works
great for trim because trim always uses
those little tiny Brad's
that are pain to get out because you
can't pound them through where they Bend
but we could just grab them from the
back side pull them right through and
you can reuse that trim it saves
everybody time and money
no matter what their project the quick
Ripper was designed to be used by
everybody from professionals down to
your home hobbyist who's just got a
small project that they need to do the
quick Ripper is great for everyone from
your professional construction worker
down to your home hobbyist who just has
a project here and there makes a great
gift and it'll make every job that much
easier
I think we can all agree that we're
living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to auto ride home control the
temperature turn on the lights - face it
we're living in a technological
Wonderland and yet here we find Phil
Phil's forgotten the combination of his
travel log is the current solution to
that problem
we live in an era filled with
technological marvels and yet this is
what happens when Phil forgets a lock
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air Baltics is the air bolts is a travel
lock you control with your smartphone
it's a lot the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
airball opens whenever my phone is
within bluetooth right well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your life that's
fine the settings on this airball
require me to went to a password into
the app or maybe your air bolts been
stolen that's fine too because you can
set your air ball to activate an alarm
when it moves too far away from your
home or you can activate the alarm
manually stop that man it's the Justice
the future deserves hi Bill hi tell them
what happened bill I lost my bag you
lost your we live in a world where I can
use my smartphone to model my sleeping
patterns but bill here can't find his
bag if bill have been using the air bolt
instead of some antique you could have
located it using the air box crowdsource
GPS networks what if you lose your phone
well you can still unlock your air ball
by logging in from another device well
you can enter our backup button code
using your hands like some kind of
prehistoric man
the air vault has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year via a standard microUSB connector
it's TSA approved so airport security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your airport you can even share
access to your ever with your friends so
you'll be able to unlock it from the
other side of the world thanks pal
you're welcome buddy
and look how small it is seriously look
at it it's really small a volt it's the
travel lock we all deserve a kick
starter over the last year we've worked
really hard on building the air box and
we got to say that we're truly proud of
how far we've come but now we need your
help to fund the last stages of
production tooling raw materials and
manufacturing honestly we've all been
there we've all forgotten the
combination to a look the most
frustrating thing ever
and losing your baggage even worse and
that's why we designed the air boat we
believe in innovation like this is long
overdue and it's time we bring luggage
lock technology into the 21st century
the air boat has so many possibilities
we're even including it with a software
development keep so that you can make
your own features for example imagine
unlocking the air vault with your voice
or gamifying it and using it at a
scavenger hunt
we hope you agree and get on board our
Kickstarter campaign and as a reward for
backing us early we're offering some
awesome deals on the able thanks from
all of us here at airboat

hi there I'm dr. diva Tomei and as many
of you know I'm the CEO of Salonika and
inventor of kaya the natural lighting
robot kaya first premiered on IndieGoGo
this past September and ever since we've
been offering her on IndieGoGo in demand
as a pre-order over the past several
months kaya has evolved past even what I
could have dreamed we have changed her
name for those of you who remember Lucy
and have significantly improved her
design to the point that today we call
the final version kaya 2.0 we are now in
the process of getting kaya manufactured
and the entire Salonika team is
absolutely thrilled that we'll be able
to start shipping soon to our backers in
just a few short months but now let me
tell you a little bit more about what
she does
using kaya couldn't be easier just place
in a sunny spot point her towards the
room you want to illuminate and turn her
on she'll find the Sun all in her own
and redirect its light into your home or
office
kaya solar-powered so you never have to
worry if she's charged and she
continuously monitors the movement of
the Sun throughout the day and remembers
where you want to send the sunlight so
you have natural light indoors all day
long if you have a dark or gloomy room
in your home or office
then kaya is for you with more than half
a million dollars raised to date on
IndieGoGo it's been a truly
life-changing experience to see the
amount of support for kaya around the
world as an organization we here at
Salonika believe in the importance of
upgrading our indoor spaces into places
in which we don't only live but we
thrive we won't be on IndieGoGo forever
so I strongly encourage you to take
advantage of our limited pre-order
offers on IndieGoGo and as always have a
bright day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
