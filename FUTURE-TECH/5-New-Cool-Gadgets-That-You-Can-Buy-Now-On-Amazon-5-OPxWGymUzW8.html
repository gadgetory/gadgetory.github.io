application that allows you to capture a
scale accurate 3d model of your home in
minutes all on an iPad here's how it
works first attach a structure sensor to
your iPad and launch the canvas app next
start scanning canvas captures thousands
of measurements per second and combines
them into a single 3d model you can use
instantly you don't have to anticipate
every measurement or view that you'll
need because with the 3d model you'll
have all of them the great thing about
canvas for us is that we can take any of
our employees send them out to a site
have them capture the whole thing and we
have all the information we need without
error a raw 3d model is powerful but if
you want to make changes using
professional tools you'll need to
simplify an editable CAD file that's why
we built a new first-of-its-kind service
right into canvas
we call it scan to CAD and it converts
your raw 3d model into CAD within 48
hours when I got my first CAD file back
I really wasn't sure what to expect and
when I saw the file I couldn't believe
it
it was so accurate so thought out
everything was in perfect layers I can
rely on canvas and structure sensor to
provide me with more information than my
brain would even remember
to take a look at clients of all levels
you want to see 3d modeling now that we
have canvas we can create that same
level of project and a presentation for
all of our clients I think it would pay
for itself in one project to make
real-time 3d mapping possible on the
iPad we had to create new hardware and
new software first we created the
structure sensor giving mobile devices
scale accurate depth sensor next we're
introducing a new 120 degree wide vision
lens which means you'll experience our
most stable motion tracking yet and most
importantly we've upgraded our mapping
algorithms we've gone from enabling you
to scan objects to now allowing you to
capture entire spaces for the first time
it's actually easy to turn a physical
space into data space is the new digital
asset that you can store and bring with
you wherever you go
canvas is available now at canvas dot IO
and on the App Store and we can't wait
to see what you do with it
you
imagine coming home from a long day
pouring your favorite beer on Draft
imagine tasting the quality that the
brewer intended sharing their stories
with your friends and family and
supporting a cornerstone of your local
community well it's here cynic is that
vision by filling a simple bag from any
tap you'll soon be pouring your favorite
local beer or your best friend's home
brew with perfectly preserved quality
our community of beer pioneers rallied
to make this dream of reality by raising
over $650,000 on Kickstarter
after hand-delivering pre-orders to 42
local communities across North America
we're making that reality a success
mm brewery partners have already joined
us and dozens more are being trained
every single day but we're now stopping
until every brewery is available to you
their craftsmanship deserves to be
shared

the pocket tripod is an entirely new
concept it redefines conventional
standards for Portability and
functionality it's the world's first
iPhone stand that can transform from the
shape of a credit card to that of a
fully articulating stand which is able
to just iPhone continuously to any angle
in both portrait and landscape the
iPhone unlike any other smartphone has a
constant cross-section all throughout
its edge on both sides that means that
you could place your iPhone inside the
cutout of the pocket tripod and any
direction both in landscape and in
portrait which in combination with an
angle degree sweep of the pocket tripod
gives the user a full 360 degrees of
angle adjustments
adjusting the angle of your iPhone with
a pocket tripod is just as you'd
naturally expect it to be like on a
full-size photography tripod all you
need to do is to swivel your iPhone to
the intended tilt angle and it stays in
that position having full control and
how your iPhone is oriented gives you
access to a whole new set of options
you'll find yourself using familiar
functionalities of your iPhone and
completely new and creative ways and the
quality and precision of the results
you'd get will amaze you the pocket
tripod being as thin as only a couple of
credit cards stacked on top will always
be there when you need it and you'll be
surprised by how often you'd end up
using it in everyday unexpected
situations making those tasks so much
more convenient to do using a stand that
gives you full control on the angle of
your iPhone means that it can adjust
your frame to get that perfect shot
every time instead of being limited by a
preset angle one of the best things
about the pocket tripod is that unlike
almost any other portable stand it
actually lifts your iPhone off the
surfaces place on keeping it safe from
accidents
the pocket tripod is an assembly of six
parts and each of these parts have
dozens of complex little features that
allow the pocket tripod to transform
from one shape to another we developed a
really cool app available for free lapse
so for anyway too anxious to the
downloaded that has an interactive 3d
model of a pocket tripod in it to give
you a virtual hands-on experience with a
pocket tripod it even has a section we
can pick colors for the pocket tripod
that you think might look good and
suggested to us for future productions
hi i'm dr. jason wars hland founder and
head of performance development at
faragon the Thera gun is for
chiropractors physical therapists
trainers and athletes and anyone that's
active the benefits of the ther gun is
it increases blood flow decreases lactic
acid and interrupts the pain cycle in
the brain I've seen the most success
with the Thera Gong in athletes within
minutes loosen up their muscles and go
out and perform the way they need to we
all have our own routines what we like
to eat to how we work out and the best
addition to my routine has been Sarah
gonji one whether it's a pre workout or
after a long trip on the road and I'm
just unwinding at home the g1 is
unmatched when it comes to recovery its
aggressive but it's not painful and I
feel as soon as when I use it or dr.
Jason uses it on me I mean it's it's
immediate results and it's easy to use
it's not heavy it's lightweight you can
travel with it so I like that they're
going a lot better
the g1 is absolutely the real deal I
used all my quads calves hip flexor I
use it everywhere it helps create blood
flow where you have knots or scar tissue
the ther gun is better than anything
currently in the market because it's
lightweight easy to use battery-operated
handheld mobile you can go anywhere with
you with a really strong amplitude which
is the distance the head travels the
feedback on the ther gun has been
unanimously positive period</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
