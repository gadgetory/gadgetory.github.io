selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
Micro land ultralight it comes with it's
very own device for storage and charging
with an easy one-hand control from its
own where did the idea come from well
I'll show you look at this what an epic
day out a bonafide selfie time as they
say just need to squeeze a teeny bit no
oh never mind
ah more manageable group just two guys
actually they want to take a selfie to
remember this wonderful place well I
guess they can just describe the view to
their friends back home right okay one
more try
this time a good old barbecue outside on
a sunny day with lots of friends let's
try the selfie stick strategy
still can't fit everybody in annoying
situations am i right
we've all been there buddy that's how
air selfie was born a perfect team
gathered together working in London
Milan and Shanghai to combine micro
flying technologies ultralight HD
cameras with in flight stability systems
air selfie can travel in a 20 meter
radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's
only 52 grams and it slots into its
phone cover and recharges so what if the
guys had an air selfie with them they
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air awesome
what about the two explorers they select
the classic flying mode from the three
options available control layer selfie
through the app by holding the phone
horizontally and take both memorable
photos and videos and what would have
happened at the barbecue enough with the
squeezing
just select the selfie mode use only two
buttons to find the right distance to
shoot and take a great picture what
about an indoor location whatever it may
be a party at somebody's house for a
night out in a club there are no issues
there selfie fly's easily it's simple to
control and very safe and once you shoot
a great picture don't keep it to
yourself it's so easy to share it right
from your phone as easy as grabbing the
air selfie safely while it's still
hovering in the air so this is air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
ready to explore new perspectives let's
take a look at its technical features
power bank inside its own custom phone
cover a battery that charges itself in
only 30 minutes 5 megapixel HD video
camera to shoot social media optimized
images sophisticated sensors and its own
Wi-Fi control unit in flight stability
systems to hover autonomously the
smallest and most powerful brushless
motors it's safe to grab while it's
still hovering and of course its own 4
gigabyte microSD memory ultralight with
a solid italian-designed case compact

go ready for the revolution air selfie
is on Kickstarter help us to get it into
production become an air selfie
ambassador by pre-ordering now
you
hi Kickstarter I'm Avram over the past
year me and my partner John have been
working hard to bring you ding a
beautiful simple smart doorbell for your
home the idea is a simple one
when you press the doorbell button you
hear a chime in your home like a normal
doorbell but you also receive a call to
your smartphone allowing you to talk
with the person at the front door from
wherever you are in the world whether
you rent your flat out on Airbnb
you're out of earshot in the garden or
even on holiday you carry your doorbell
wherever you go is right there in your
pocket you'll never miss your door again
currently doorbells are unloved and
forgotten objects they don't work with
how we lead our busy lives that we
control through our smartphones we want
to fix this for you you should control
ding - our smartphone app this allows
you to set the kind of time you have
look at caller history and even set some
quiet time when you don't want to wake
up the household we've worked for over a
decade in the design and technology
industries and design is really
important to us we don't want to make
just another plastic box that sits in
the corner of your room we want to make
ding something really special that
complements your home rather than
distracting from it who didn't spend a
lot of time trying to find the right
finish in color for ding whether it was
for the chime which had to feel really
it belong inside the home so we made it
really friendly and warm using the
fabric for example doorbells haven't
really changed in 50 years it's about
moving a kind of doorbell from something
that you're only able to interact with
when you're in the home to actually
something that you can use from anywhere
we've had some great support in
developing ding from both the UK Design
Council and from John Lewis a leading
department store in the UK from a John
Lewis perspective it's the perfect
product you know we are really excited
about new innovation coming our way and
given the kind of the big boom that
we're seeing around smart home we think
this place perfect is that
we believe ding will change the way
people think about smart homes making it
more about the home and less about the
tech inside with our manufacturing
partners were almost ready for
production so if you want to be one of
the first to own ding check out our page
below
there's several rewards for you to
choose from including ordering your very
own ding we hope you're all as excited
about ding as we are and we're looking
forward to bring it to you very very
soon
being a gun owner is not just buying a
gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained
you are your gun safe when it's not on
you you want to know it's secure and
accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are a nuisance to
operate as for smart guns while smart
guns are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing sorex
the new generation of gun storage saw
Rex's caliber specifically and has two
modes the first mode is awareness if
someone tries to tamper with your gun
you're immediately alerted
and when you need your gun charging it
will eject syrettes
and chamber a fresh round the second
mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel
szura's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter
these two factors allow you to unlock
your weapon without looking at it even
in the dark you can choose a simple code
or any length code you wish you won't
believe how fast and simple it is until
you try it you can also open zorax from
your phone but you can only lock it by
physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zuhr watchdog the zuhr
watchdog is not a lock but rather a
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with
sore X was invented by veterans of elite
IDF technological and in combat units we
worked on it for two years bringing it
to perfection door x allows you to be
ready aware and safe more than ever
before
join the zuhr revolution own your gun
excuse me
I don't know how to buy this ticket
it's very karaoke near here
yeah well I don't really know where to
start
Rango was probably the coolest cat on
the face of the planet he used to ride
up to work with me on my motorcycle he
used to go to cafes to get hours it was
a pretty cool relationship and
eventually I came across a young no
stuck to a tree saying that they had
found this really beautiful tabby cat
dead on the side of the road I decided
if nobody else had found a way of
tracking the cats and dogs then I was
certainly going to so this is pod like
it's the smallest and lightest GPS
tracker in market has an interchangeable
battery it's waterproof
it has bluetooth but the most important
thing is that this device can be
attached to your animals collar and sync
to your phone allowing you to always
know where your animal is you never have
to worry about losing your pet again
we've spent a lot of time getting the
product design absolutely bang-on the
ergonomic design is really cool with no
sharp edges so it's as comfortable as
possible for the animal the app is a
really slick user experience so it's
both fun and functional to use and we've
squeezed as much as we can out of the
battery life getting up to a week's
usage I don't know you'd be inconsolable
would give us a dog not knowing where
they are or what they're doing or if
they're alive or if they're well he's
that type that tends to just wander and
then we rely on other people to bring
him back but we're always worried that
there'll be a time when we lose in
forever
they're one of the most amazing features
that we've developed is a pet league
which is like a social network for your
animal this is going to allow you to
compare your animals results across the
world so you'll be able to determine
whether you've got the fastest dog in
the park or the most adventurous cat in
the country the Apple so allows you to
set safe zone alerts so you can actually
see when your animal breaches the set
perimeter through an alert on your phone
you know here just he disappears he goes
on adventures it's cool like that just
to be able to see what he's done how
fast each dog ran and then we can
compare them to see which one's maggie's
faster so we're really excited because
we have confirmed orders from some of
the largest pet retailers in the world
we've finalized the design and we're
just about to go into the final stages
of production we really need some help
in production and that's why we'd like
you to support us in this campaign and
make sure that nobody ever has to go
through the pain of losing their animal
again like I did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
