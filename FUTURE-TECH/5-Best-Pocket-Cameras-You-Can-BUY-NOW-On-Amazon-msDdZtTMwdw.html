made
hero five black is the camera that's so
convenient and easy to use you forget
the charges yet it doesn't give up any
of the performance durability or
versatility that go first name is for
purified black is where really
everything comes together if we're
giving people all the tools in one
package they're getting waterproof for
getting ruggedness they're getting image
stabilization voice control that's
nicely played the screen on the back
they're getting the full embodiment of
what is GoPro a big part of making a
GoPro easier to use is eliminating all
of the unnecessary parts you don't have
to think should I use the housing or not
it's waterproof and durable all on its
own they don't have to fumble with the
clear water housing anymore it's just
built right in you can just kick it out
of the box hit the water and go down to
ten meters of snowboarding infamy for
any extra protection the fact that
you'll get such amazing quality video
and audio and never have to worry about
it it's one of the most wonderful things
about
but a lot of times a GoPro is out of
reach
voice control just opens up a whole new
world of possibility for using your
GoPro you just think it say it and do it
GoPro take photo the hero five black
supports seven languages English French
Italian German Spanish Chinese and
Japanese voice control is the easiest
way to control your camera we have made
it so simple to be completely in the
moment of whatever you're doing is all
about making things easier less
management for people it's accurate and
it works and it's going to make sure
that you don't miss those moments so you
could be in video mode and say go for
take a photo it'll capture you can be in
time-lapse mode and tell it to capture a
burst and it'll fire off 30 photos we
want it to be hands-free we want it to
be fun we wanted to be liberating the
world feels very small within a GoPro
and I love that because there's not a
lot to figure out the touchscreen on
pro/5 black makes it so that anybody can
pick up a GoPro and figure out how to
use it without being told
you
hey everyone we are mocha can last year
we came to you with an idea of the
smallest 4k camera your incredible
support brought mocha cam to life to
create a better mocha cam we've
responded to thousands of comments and
have enjoyed all the photos and videos
that you shared online the improvement
ideas and our experience in mocha cam -
mocha 360 has prepared us for this
moment introducing alpha and alpha s the
first wearable camera that provides a
shutter wheel to control the shutter
speed allowing you to set it up to one
to thousands of a second for 32 seconds
freely if you haven't heard of mocha cam
it's the world's smallest 4k camera the
rotatable screen module allows you to
find the best filming angles and double
the battery life a spare battery that
simply snaps down magnetically can
extend your battery life to four hours
for video filming now alpha brings more
surprises here's how we made it even
better focus on Alpha S has an umbrella
image processing and provides 4k 30
frames per second or 1080p 120 frames
per second video features it means you
can get 150 speak full HD through a
motion video sames GoPro Hero 5 with the
1.5 5 micrometers Sony image sensor the
low-light performance has been
significantly improved in addition to
Wi-Fi alpha provides Bluetooth
connection which is more stable and
consumes less power it can turn your
phone into a Bluetooth remote if GPS
information for geo-tagging or show the
trajectory with the built-in G sensor
alpha can get better image stabilization
on video recording alpha has dual status
player so even if there's no screen
module you can show the camera status
clearly the dual mic system provides
stereo recording capability
alpha uses a type C port to connect
Cameron's screen the micro HDMI port
provides a new preview and playback mode
now it's the totally new feature and
most important part the shutter wheel
with the new design buttons in manual
mode you can turn the shutter wheel to
set the shutter speed freely up to 1 mm
of a second or 32 seconds in other words
you can now use mobile cam shooting long
exposure nightsticks
or even to start with more after
applying all these great features alpha
is 20 percent smaller than the previous
generation and 35 percent smaller than
GoPro 0-5 we are also able to offer two
options with time alpha and alpha s
alpha uses the same image processor to
mocha 10 the frame rate is similar to
gopro hero4 and provides all the other
features of alpha s
so please order a mocha cam today and
share it with your friends help us to
make it a reality
maybe
so the coolest thing about Poteau is you
can just stick it anywhere you don't
need mounts you don't need a big selfie
stick you can just stick it up there and
take shots from above or just right in
front and your hands are free to do
whatever photo uses a special micro
suction pad it will work on walls
windows a pole basically on anything and
it's not a tape so you can stick unstick
and just wipe with water to use again oh
that's pretty cool to wash it wet your
finger like this and wipe carefully you
can feel the dirt rolling off let it dry
and you're good to go even better if you
use a blow-dryer a hand dryer all the
grippy features loosen up and the pad
will work good as new for extra
flexibility there's a strong magnet in
there too so that's how photo sticks
