is a better way we wanted a compact yet
comfortable keyboard that improve the
efficiency that's how the ultimate
hacking keyboard was born our major
design principles are high quality and
durability high-end mechanical key
switches and stainless steel parts are
used to ensure an extended lifespan for
our product we engineered a keyboard
that is compact yet strong with the uhk
you increase your productivity by never
leaving the home row to make that
possible
we programmed four different function
layers through these layers you access
all of the features of an ordinary
keyboard but so much more you can even
control the mouse pointer with the
keyboards Mouse player the uhk can be
fully customized with our configurator
application you can create application
specific key maps for your favorite apps
and games make shortcuts macros and
share them with others once saved take
your configurations with you and use the
uhk as a standard USB keyboard without
installing special software the uhk is
compact easy to carry and fits snugly
into a small bag put it on your desk and
you can easily split the keyboard and
position the Habs organ Amelie you'll
quickly find it's a lot more comfortable
than an ordinary keyboard and it's far
more efficient typing coding gaming or
whatever your activity you never have to
leave the home row I'm super stoked the
open hacking keyboard it comes apart you
can put it as far apart as you want
keys are programmable you can snap it
back together and it's nice and portable
and small to keep going to nice
mechanical and clicky or quiet if you
want you can program it to control your
mouse so you're going to have to
take your fingers off the keys and you
can program macros or layouts in there
you want um this is a prototype is that
me it's been awesome so definitely check
out with your pledge we'll be able to
create molds for plastic parts order
electronic components at scale
manufacture custom parts and tooling
help us fund the ultimate hacking
keyboard and be one of the first to
experience this one-of-a-kind product

our children are growing up in a world
where computer literacy is as essential
as reading writing and arithmetic
introducing - and dot their toy robot
but there's so much more than that
they're learning and storytelling
platform that makes computer programming
accessible and fun meet - - can be
programs do non limited number of things
from basic movements to object detection
to complex sequences of instructions and
this is dumb dot can detect when it is
being moved allowing children to invoke
character these robots can detect each
other and accessories can be added to
give them special ability they teach the
basics of computer science and one of
the best ways possible problem solving
through hands-on playtime and our
research shows that that is one of the
best ways for children to learn
- and DAW are designed to be programmed
by children using our touch interface
with music animation and stories as well
as existing languages like scratch and
blockly we try to get them to watch less
TV push them to learn new things but it
wasn't until these robots came out of
the box and our kids except so absorb
programming slides - and is used by
virtually every field art architecture
medicine law learning to program is
really learning problem solved taking
something big and seemingly
incomprehensible breaking it down and
building up a solution and this concept
really applies to virtually anything
learning to program isn't only to become
a computer programmer we want to help
shape our future our future innovators
our future think a future leader
and the future is today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
