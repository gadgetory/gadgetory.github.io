Hawke's Bay New Zealand with a love of
coffee but a frustration with waste
Hayden realized he should design his own
espresso maker they would lower the
environmental and physical cost of
making coffee without compromising on
design and this is where the Newton was
born this is where Ellen comes in a 63
year old craftsman also from the sunny
Hawke's Bay with an extensive history
crafting beautiful pieces of art had a
new he was the man to take his drawings
to to make them come to life together
they work through the prototype stages
fine-tuning the design to what you see
today a beautifully functional espresso
pressed throughout the prototype stages
the Newton was put through a vigorous
testing to ensure it produced high
quality espresso with rich crema and
this is where we come in with Alan and
Hayden focused on the design and the
production we managed the marketing and
the day-to-day running of the business
what you get for backing us today is the
quality handcrafted espresso press the
base of the handle are crafted from
maple and the piston and chamber are
anodized aluminum crafted with style
functionality and purpose in mind the
Newton makes the coffee by pouring
boiling water into the barrels directing
it to flow through the piston by lifting
the lever and then the force on the
lever generates the pressure needed to
push the water through the grinds and
into your cup for a delicious espresso
shot from something that started as a
few images on paper it is now evolved
into the simple elegant design that we
all love to have in our kitchen we are
now super excited to share this with
coffee lovers around the world as soon
as we reach our funding goal we will
begin production right here in Hawke's
Bay please back us today and enjoy a
lifetime of stylish design and great
coffee
it's hard to find time to cook good food
we're all busy usually it's the last
thing on our minds so we made cooking
simple meat mellow the effortless way to
make delicious meals it's kind of like a
slow cooker it uses a technique called
sous-vide cooking which is commonly
found in top restaurants sous-vide is
slow cooking your food to the perfect
temperature to the perfect texture and
to the perfect taste with mellow now you
can cook a five-star restaurant meal
effortlessly without even being there to
cook it so you can make a chicken breast
dinner while you jaw the spare rib
entree while you work even a poached egg
breakfast and while you sleep you begin
by placing ingredients in our specially
designed food safe bags our bags are
self sealing and water won't get in drop
it in mellow and then just specify what
you're cooking and you want it done and
how you'd like it made that's it that's
all you have to do mellow
chills the water so your ingredients
won't spoil while you're away then at
the right time it automatically starts
cooking the key to mellow is cooking
food by surrounding it with water it's
not boiling your food but rather
creating bubbles for water circulation
and controlled heat for the perfect
temperature to cook this makes sure that
your food is never raw or dry never
undercooked or overcooked
mellow always finishes when you tell it
to so when you get home your food is
already done
you can plate your meal right away or
have fun giving it a quick sear for the
perfect finish and that's it you're
ready to dig in have incredible food on
the table no matter what else is on your
plate let Melo help make the memorable
meals you'll share with old friends new
friends or best friends make great food
effortless meat mellow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
