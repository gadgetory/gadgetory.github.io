is a learning tool which means you can
use it to learn how to code
you've probably tried a lot of other
toys that are either boring they break
easily or did it too expensive code your
own light is programmable meaning you
can code or program your code drone
within minutes thanks to our awesome
software and tutorials there are three
ways to program making it easy and fun
to learn how to fly your code wrong
whether you're a kid or even an adult
it's the smartest most beginner friendly
drone for coders of any level but you
can also fly your drone using our
smartphone app it's built with the
best-in-class hardware and material
meaning not only does it fly well but it
can take a few beatings and you can get
optional parts to do more with code
wrong there's no other drone like it get
a head start on learning code with the
drone code your own light
what was it like when you flew aura and
you've had that controller in your hand
and you were flying the drone it was a
lot easier to do I remember my first
time I flew it up and I expected to ask
to be constantly changing the height and
I it feels so different because the
remote controls unless you get really
really used to them you have to be kind
of looking up and down and up and down
at the same time whereas here you know
what your hands doing so you know is
what's happening better than like a
normal drum that I have because I know
the control because I play video games
but it's like I constantly have local
the diameter I'm doing the right thing
so I won't go too high that I lose like
the connection with the drone and that's
one of the biggest difference between
aura and other Thrones is the fact that
you don't need a joystick you have the
control in your hand itself it felt like
you were a lot more in control than
normal joystick drone because you can
control the stability of the drone if
your hand shake it'll move around but it
won't go all over the place where is it
with the controller even if your hands
can be still you can still hit the wrong
switch and it will like slamming into
dollars right Sydney it was really cool
because you were just moving your hand a
little bit and you could control the
don't ooh go everywhere and you didn't
have to worry about how fast you were
going or how
because you can kind of calibrate it get
it up to set yourself and just go
everywhere and it was really really cool
the cono smart was made with you in mind
the simplistic yet modern design
promotes ease of use and complete
control of your comfort in this video
we'll walk you through the basics of
operating your new cono smart thermostat
the first thing you'll want to learn how
to use is the knob which controls all of
cono smarts functionality just place
your fingers on the outside edge of the
knob and turn it clockwise to set a
higher temperature or turn it
counterclockwise to make it lower when
you've reached your desired comfort
level simply press the knob to set the
temperature the knob is also used to
scroll through menu options and features
just press the knob to get to the menu
from there you can turn the knob
clockwise to scroll right or
counterclockwise to scroll left to
select a menu option just press the knob
again to cancel your selection or to go
back to the previous screen just press
and hold the knob for five seconds
your Kona smart on-screen menu is broken
up into five sections system mode fan

and network connection
the system mode option is used to adjust
your system between cool heat and Auto
options the fan mode option is used to
change your fan between on which will
continuously run the fan Auto which will
run the fan automatically when needed
and IAQ which will intermittently cycle
air through your home to keep your air
quality fresh the scheduling icon opens
the scheduling menu in this menu you can
choose to run your schedule or hold a
constant temperature note this icon will
only be visible if you have connected
your thermostat to the network and set a
schedule using the lux app the
installation settings option is used to
modify more advanced features like
temperature swing temperature limits and
localization for more information on
installation settings please visit lux
products comm slash co no manual the
network connection option is used to
connect your cono smart to a Wi-Fi
network you can choose between the on
and off options if you choose on you'll
be asked to choose either an iOS or
Android device to connect check out our
additional videos on connecting to iOS

know to operate the cono smart
this is Sarah she's an office manager
with long hours and big responsibilities
working on a computer all day long my
name is Ryan I'm treating Sarah for
tension headaches and stiffness in the
neck and shoulder stress and bad posture
may have contributed to our problem
she always has a great time here in the
clinic
however the biggest challenge for her is
how long she can stay there relaxed and
home a modern days neck has been
punished every day driving sitting
computers and cell phones my patients
always ask me is there anything I can
use at home so I promised them I'll make
something that's safe portable
maintenance free instruction free and
shareable with family members which
means one size fits most introducing
crest it is designed to duplicate the
manual stimulation safe and natural
filling molded into this beautiful
package while stimulating the key result
area it really improves the circulation
to the head and relieves tension and
stress in part of testing
what's better than giving it to my
favorite massage therapist this is how
to use it wherever whatever rest on
crest for ten minutes or maybe longer
move side to side to get all those spots
I want to be happy and stress-free
therefore stiff neck and shoulders
should be managed breaking so please
invest in the feeling of relief because
we all deserve it take that weight off
your shoulder finally you'll love it
that I can promise
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
