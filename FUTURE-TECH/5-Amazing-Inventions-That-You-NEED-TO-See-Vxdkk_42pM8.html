of the food we eat but we lost 32% of
bee colonies last year there's a
movement of backyard and urban
beekeepers who want to make a difference
and save the bees we created a
technology to help them here's how it
works
we attached a camera to a small but
powerful computer but what's especially
monitor what goes on at a beehive all
day every day we developed an algorithm
to track B flight activity and translate
hours of video to an easy visual
real-time summary we found that healthy
colonies had a unique heartbeat activity
pattern and we can measure that
heartbeat over time not just flight
activity with the signature of the
flight activity gives you a really
interesting window into what's going on
in that colony of that in real time it's
moving our understanding of nature
forward using high-tech
for very low-tech and natural situations
which is very cool it also lets you
share the joy and importance that bees
remotely with other infertile eyes and
hides watches your bees for you all day
every day it helps you see when
something is wrong so you can do

get out of the shower why because I hate
my towels these ones don't really dry me
anymore it's not like Ewing water around
with moist sandpaper in these ones
things like your house fear one seem to
think a little more water first but then
they stay wet and start to smell musty
which means there's bacteria growing and
maybe even fungus of course you can
avoid this little washing and drying
your towels every day and it weighs I'm
glad
my search for a better town I found a
staggering number of options mostly just
variations of the same old town so to
cut through the conclusion I took a
different approach one that redefines
what a towel should be this is beyond
vendek purposeful designs with corks and
waffle weave is definitely different
delivering a multi-layer to its luscious
inside is an exfoliating picture and
drive like job depended on it having
maximum surface area exposed enabled the
couch tried smell fastest which is
important because a dry towel is a clean
bath the palette is great as has
proceeded by me and him and then red and
even him shower time is a daily ritual
for me it's the first yeah even before
coffee why do I care so much about a
towel Oh cuz I'm sick of muscatel that
don't work properly camp and know if you
can focus chairman frustration so this
is my solution okay what trying off
never felt this
Iko flows River is a new generation of
smart clean mobile power it's a portable
lithium-ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy output of almost any store
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
River releases you from the shackles of
an outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging port which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means a good power to iPhone 2 iPad 2
MacBooks a mini-fridge a lantern a drone
batteries a mobile Wi-Fi unit and stereo
speakers all at the same time without
limiting the output on any port with the
storage capacity of 416 watt hours River
gives you more powers than almost any
battery of the time you can jam on your
electric guitar for 20 hours straight or
you can watch a 10 hour marathon of your
favorite TV show by campfire rivers
battery can be recharged in three
different ways
a standard outlet or a car charger can
replenish the battery full capacity in
just eight hours with eco flows portable
solar panels River can be recharged with
absolutely zero carbon emissions in just
12 hours the real-time display allows
you to monitor the battery's current
output power remaining capacity and
charge back being a documentary
filmmaker a lot of my shoots happen
outside a lot of times our locations are
way out in the middle of nowhere first
time I use River I was really surprised
at how much these little units can
accomplish on location everything runs
on batteries we have to set up a DI key
station battery charging station and we
can even run our LEDs when we need extra
lights never have to worry about the
noise and the pollution of a generator
applications for battery power are
endless River isn't just an accessory
it's your power companion for harnessing
clean energy anywhere so you're free to
go everywhere
and by the way this isn't just a concept
river has been tried and tested and as
you can see this entire production has
been lit by River</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
