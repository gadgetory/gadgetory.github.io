display the drawers with a pair
just use the app to tell Giotto what to
draw then sit back and watch as the pen
works its magic turning your pixels into
pen and ink
the uses for Jaws Oh a limitless and
because Giotto is connected you can send
a message to your friends wall from
anywhere in the world imagine some of
the world's best artists and
illustrators delivering are straight to
your wall or simply display information
in style and when you're ready for
something new
Giotto wipes the slate clean
from sending the most important message
of the day to keeping you in the loop
exhibiting a priceless masterpiece to
displaying the things that matter
it seems some things in life are just
better off free
yato story started two years ago when
the those design studio that's these
guys Jim Barney and Carmen came up with
the concept they wanted to connect the
digital world to the real world not
through a screen that's rupan a dink
Giotto has been through loads of
prototypes a hardware incubator software
and electronics development and now it's
ready to go and it's an award winner -
turns out people love Giotto people like
the artist and illustrator Anthony
Burrell enables you to take work from
from screen that is very perfect almost
too perfect and they taste it into the
real world and it gives it a personality
it's not just artists who see the
potential of Giotto here's Jim the ideas
guy it's awesome seeing how jata
inspires people everyone that sees it
all seems to come up with a new thing
they wanted to job people want to make
to-do lists and love notes share
information and we've made sure that it
works with all the apps that they love
including slack Spotify even Amazon
Alexa the notion of being able to create
these these pieces of art live in a real
world space with no screens that's you
know that's that's completely new
there's design studio worked alongside
product design experts and electronics
engineers to hone the nuts and bolts of
Giotto every detail is a thing of beauty
worthy of hanging on your wall
the team have worked closely with
manufacturers based in Shenzhen to
ensure the pricing is realistic and
production is doable so to celebrate the
launch of Giotto on Kickstarter we've
got something special lined up 365 days
of art that means a brand new image from
a top illustrator on your wall every day
for a year we started as a small team
with a good idea put everything in finis
to get it ready to go and we're so close
but it's simply not going to happen to
our Kickstarter so help us make it a
reality so the question is what will you
jot I think we can all agree that we're
living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to order a ride home control the
temperature turn on the lights
- face it we're living in a
technological Wonderland and yet here we
find filter pools forgotten the
combination of his travel lock here's
the current solution to that problem we
live in an era filled with technological
marvels and yet this is what happens
when Phil forgets a lock combination is
that the best we can do no because we
live in an era where the air baltics is
the air bolts is a travel lock you
control with your smartphone it's a lot
the future deserves a lock with
customizable security settings this
airball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth ray well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your lives that's
fine the settings on this airball
require me to went to a password into
the app well maybe your air bolts been
stolen that's fine too because you can
set your air ball to activate an alarm
when it moves too far away from your
phone or you can activate the alarm
manually stop that man it's the Justice
the future deserves hi Bill hi tell them
what happened bill I lost my bag you
lost your we live in a well where I can
use my smartphone to model my sleeping
patterns but bill here can't find his
bag if bill have been using the air bolt
instead of some antique you could have
located it using the air box
crowd-sourced GPS network or if you lose
your phone
well you can still unlock your home
quite logging in from another device
well you can enter a backup button code
using your hand like some kind of
prehistoric man
the air vault has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year by a standard microUSB connector
it's CSA approved so airport security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your Airport you can even share
access to your a vault with your friends
so you'll be able to unlock it from the
other side of the world thanks pal
you're welcome buddy and look how small
it is
seriously look at it it's really small
a boat it's the travel lock we all
deserve a kick starter over the last
year we've worked really hard on
building the air box and we got to say
that we're truly proud of how far we've
come but now we need your help to fund
the last stages of production tooling
raw materials and manufacturing honestly
we've all been there we've all forgotten
the combination to a look the most
frustrating thing ever and losing your
baggage even worse and that's why we
designed the air boat we believe in
innovation like this is long overdue and
it's time we bring luggage lock
technology into the 21st century the air
boat has so many possibilities we're
have been including it with a software
development kit so that you can make
your own features for example imagine
unlocking the airport with your voice or
gamifying it and using it at a scavenger
hunt
we hope you agree and get onboard our
Kickstarter campaign and as a reward for
backing us early we're offering some
awesome deals on the airboat thanks from
all of us here at airboat
