see the mysteries of the universe but
most of them often the most amazing ones
are simply too blurry and faint to our
eye even when using a large telescope
but still we wanted to see them so we
worked to create the IVA scope the
enhanced vision telescope is a new kind
of instrument its power its accuracy can
show you objects millions of light-years
away in all their glorious colors and
details what I saw was this vivid
intensely colored planetarium just like
the photographs you see in books I
thought it was amazing I actually
majored in physics and was really
interested in astronomy when I was at
MIT and really used to look through a
lot of hobby telescopes and this was
some of the best that I've seen
I have always been passionate about
astronomy as I was a teenager I would
lie on the grass for hours at night
looking at all those stars imagining all
those objects I saw in my books I had a
telescope but still I felt
disappointment years later I thought of
an instrument capable of accumulating
light in a unique way
so we could finally see those nebulae
those galaxies all in a matter of
seconds and directly through its lens
that way we could create an incredibly
powerful telescope that is compact so
you can carry it anywhere thanks to its
sensors GPS and its internal map of
millions of stars it can pinpoint and
identify any object in the sky so it is
also easy to control with your
smartphone thus making astronomy easier
to share
but there is more the EVC up experience
not only connects you to the sky it also
connects you to the scientific community
what's really exciting about the you
know stellar project and our partnership
is the ability to leverage the telescope
this could be a very powerful tool for
astronomers who can basically engage
citizen scientists who have this you
know stellar instrument and ask them to
contribute to the research they're doing
what we'd like is a networked system of
cameras the sort of thing that you miss
teller is planning on where we can go
back and search through the raw data
from one or many cameras with thousands
of Eva scopes distributed all around the
planet we'll be able to increase our
knowledge in astronomy be able to study
asteroids comets supernovae and even
this unknown astronomical events with
the Eva scope contributing to science is
simple and entertaining all you need to
do is activate campaign mode on our app
it will allow you to receive observation
requests from scientists directly on
your smartphone
then transfer the coordinates to you
evey scope have the touch of the finger
and harvest data about an event all the
while seeing it happening directly
through VIPs for instance you'll be able
to see and track a near-earth asteroid
while helping its study
well I'm also an animator astronomer and
I have my own 8 inch reflector telescope
which I truly adore but I'm so excited
by the unis stellar instrument and its
ability to do much more in terms of
light gathering this is an opportunity
to look at the sky in in new ways after
three years of development we now have a
fully working prototype that we demoed
all summer but we need a support to go
further
join us and transform astronomy forever

mango introduces the slim snap magnetic
air vent mount the mango air vent mount
comes with easy installation
instructions to metal adhesive plates
and the magnetic air vent mount with its
slim and versatile design the air vent
mount makes mounting your electronic
devices easy to use the mango slim snap
magnetic air vent mount attach one of
the metal mounting plates to the back of
your device between the device in the
case or behind the battery backplate for
the strongest hold for larger devices
attach the metal plate the outside of
the case or directly to the device to
mount the air vent magnet choose between
one of two sized slits on the mount and
slide it all the way onto the air vent
then attach your device with 360 degree
mounting flexibility mounting your
devices at any angle that suits the
drivers needs
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bottom one has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and details to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with a force sensitive 3d
mouse you can control do bot m1 as
precisely as you want no more trying and
guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature
you can input coordinates in the fastest
and most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bot m1 is highly extendable
there are no limits to your imagination
on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger
when it can actually go further or use a
camera for visual with it's fast and
accurate image recognizing algorithm it
can distinguish colors without making
one mistake do bottom one loves
companions they can work seamlessly
together processing paperwork way faster
than humans could ultimately do bottom
one is built to replace manpower and
production line working day and night
non-stop the built-in mapping and path
planning system provides this excellent
mobility providing inventory management
service in your warehouse to be able to
create so much value to bottom one has
been built with extraordinary
performance the perfect calibration of
the high performance DC servomotor
harmonic reducer and kinematic algorithm
has brought out the best of both
strength and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters
maximum payload of up to 1.5 kilograms
angular speed of up to 200 degrees per
second it's also a steady player never
slips up everyone loves creating things
and having a robotic arm is awesome with
do bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
robotic arms everyone can now benefit
from a cost-effective user-friendly
robotic arm technology so when a new
idea hits you do bot m1 will be ready
all you have to do is say yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
