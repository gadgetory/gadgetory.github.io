gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained you are your gun safe when
it's not on you you want to know it's
secure and accessible safes are not
always accessible or easy to open
especially in the dark and locks are a
nuisance to operate as for smart guns
while smart guns are a dangerous concept
taking an unreliable technology and
embedding it into your gun is not a
smart decision our mission is to bring
you the perfect solution introducing
sorex

saw Rex's caliber specific and has two
modes
the first mode is awareness if someone
tries to tamper with your gun you're
immediately alerted and when you need
your gun charging it will eject sorex
and chamber a fresh round the second
mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel
soraa's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark
you can choose a simple code or any
length code you wish you won't believe
how fast and simple it is until you try
it you can also open zorax from your
phone but you can only lock it by
physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth to
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zuhr watchdog the zuhr
watchdog is not a lock but rather
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with sorex was invented by veterans of
elite IDF technological and combat units
