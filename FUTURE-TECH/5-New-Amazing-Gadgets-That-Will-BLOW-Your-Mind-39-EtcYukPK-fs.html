hi this is chef Anton geeks and today
were looking at the Native union switch
a very stylish portable Bluetooth
speaker the switches at the median price
range from bleachy speakers so it's
about 130 pounds from native union comm
it's very sort of cool and looks like a
giant Lego brick but it does the
rubberized surfaces pick up fingerprints
as you can see that those are mine it's
it's small it's very lightweight and it
has a great sound for something like so
dinky it's also very satisfying to use I
love for like playing that large rotary
knob there very simple way of Flash's
it's not just the Bluetooth speaker it
has a very sophisticated microphone so
you can do conference calls and like and
also quite cleverly if you pull up this
flap here lets you charge other devices
from it so if you're out and about and
sort of listening to me that you can
also charge your phone to a giant
battery pack as well as a giant speaker
as well as a giant conference calling
microphone so if you have a need to all
fear those functionalities in one go
well you're in luck anyway we'll take a
look to have it listen we'll take a
listen but you can look at how it
hey i'm dan and these are locks about
three years ago i had a vision of
crafting wooden sunglasses with editor
chopping down a tree and just recently
with my partner tim's help we did just
that
believe it or not these shades are made
entirely from 500 year old wood from the
depths of the Great Lakes these Timbers
sunk during the logging boom but
actually increase in strength will
underwater her covering them gives us
access to some of the most beautiful
old-growth wood on the planet of
preserving our forests no trees are
chopped down in the making of locks
but we didn't stop there we wanted the
strongest and most form-fitting frames
for this ancient wood ten layers of
super-strong old growth wood cross-grain
impressed into amazing Ponder's that
wrap your face for the perfect fit and
it comes in three sizes everybody can
say yes to sustainable style well almost
everyone
we need your help so that we can adapt
our frames to receive prescription
lenses as well we've already spoken with
a large distributor he wants to bring
lock frames to stores across North
America if they're prescription ready
and you're also supporting economic
sustainability we design create build
buy and sell in the same communities as
you because we manufacture in retail in
North America
