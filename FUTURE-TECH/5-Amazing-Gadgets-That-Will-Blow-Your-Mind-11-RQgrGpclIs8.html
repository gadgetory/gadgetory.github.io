me wave my hand please turn on the lamp
every time I see you ahhh oh hey the guy
how much time do I have before I have to
start by meeting thanks big eyes right
I'm leaving a void your eyes ordinary
hey guys if I am screw in the living
room after 12pm please remind me to work
out a time so your workout ok let's
the guys can you help me clean up the
floor please
hey I am your force you
if you see Jenny still asleep in his
room turn on life and say
I I know it's our tuna find a stranger
approaches the front door if I raise my
head like this what is the music the
temperature outside at 45 degree n you
will leave a jacket
I'm always on your side ah so left on
fire you it's time to eat in strike of
the fire
Oh only high end up here
sure I am yours
for you
I am yard
won't you be my
let's start a fire I wanna keep you warm
come on and strike up the quieter open
all the doors oh I'm the flow and high
and I've never been so short I am yours
breathing is the most natural and
important thing we do and every day
almost 3,000 gallons of air fill out
lines air is everywhere where we live
where we work where we sweep but do you
really know what's in the air you
breathe you might think that pollution
is only out of sight but it's the
complete opposite many studies have
proven that indoor air is up to five
times more polluted than outdoor air
this is why we created theory Cleary is
the most amazing natural air purifier
powered by real plan that helps people
in reducing indoor air pollution and it
will be the base design objects you will
have her head on the market right now
there are only traditional electronic
air purifiers mating plastic very ugly
big and bulky and in early work thanks
to filters this is why we thought about
something revolutionary and we created
the perfect synergy between nature
technology and design the hottest cleary
work we designed a smart flowerpots that
amplifies the natural properties of
sense our idea started from a research
of Nazareth they found out it on
success ability to eliminate
classification the problem is that a
single plant isn't very fixers so we
created a technology unit that allows
more air flow through the soil and the
root this is where the filtration
happens we use plants as biofilters root
and soils generate colonies of
microorganism that trap and filter the
toxic agents in year in a natural way
clearing fax filters 93% of toxic agents
immediately it's very silent and has a
very low energy consumption listen fifty
percent other LED bulb you can manage it
with your smartphone and the best thing
is that there are no sources so you
don't have to change them and waste
money what happens inside is not magic
but a cent if expect and we proved us we
did many researchers and
the effectiveness of Cleary at limber
one of the most important research labs
on France and Europe and peanut a
spin-off of the University of Florence
based in Italy Cleary is also probably
an Italian design products we work hard
for years to design it in every detail
we developed multiple sketches and
prototypes to make the designs perfect
we presented it at CES 2016 and had
great success we have a super team with
two brilliant industrial designers and a
great adviser seemed that helpless Italy
has a long tradition of crosman
especially in the ceramic field this
Italian culture is an inspiration for us
we use a ceramic first for the physical
quality but mostly because it's
eco-friendly and it doesn't release any
toxic agents in the year obviously we
also work really hard on a technology
part of our products we came to the
Silicon Valley to make something really
powerful we've developed our technology
working close with engineers and
manufactures in the Silicon Valley to
improve the functionalities of clearing
thanks to our technology unit in our
smartphone app with health and air
quality sensors clear is able to track
the stocks occasions in year and give
you real-time solution and led analysis
of it and also temperature and humidity
monitor Clary lives with you telling
what's wrong maybe allergies sleep
problems productivity asthma it learns
about you and cares about you it works
with Wi-Fi so wherever you are clearly
can give you healthy tips on how to feel
better and tell you something is going
wrong please backup product
mrs. K trimming away with his ostrich
pillow hi We're studio Caiti now we
created the perfect companion to that
pretty much fear for an expressed our
network goods belong this is Jennifer
did you know the power napping increases
productivity by 34% we spend so much
time of work in front of the screen or
in transit and we thought when create
something that helps us nap disconnect
and dream
all you have to do is find a place now
slip on the ostrich pillow and you step
