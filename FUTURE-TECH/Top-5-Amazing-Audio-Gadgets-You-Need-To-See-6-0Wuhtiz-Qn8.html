headphones that understand you it goes
way beyond just playing music then she
is a smart on-the-go device controlled
by your voice and powered by AI
technology
hey Vinci place I croc playing to your
wagon by hello Ocho
with Vinci all you have to do is ask it
is powered by far-field voice
recognition software
hey Vinci what's the weather looking
like tonight clear skies and 85 in
Atlanta Vinci sinks across your
different platforms so that it can
update you on your schedule and
notifications and anticipate your needs
also your usual connecting bus is
running a little behind would you like
me to find an alternative route it's
okay I'll just take an uber of course
calling an uber to King memorial station
estimated arrival time 12 minutes with
Vinci your headphones are now your
personal assistant your search engine
your phone and so much more call from
Brian Campbell thanks Vinci go ahead put
him through hey Brian did you decide on
flowers for the reception okay yeah
that shouldn't be a problem thanks
mm-hmm hey finchy what's up Rodya a
protein is a genus of South African
flowering plants also called sugar
bushes okay Vinci sounds like I need to
visit a specialized flower shop are
there any nearby Patricia's imported
perennials as 3.1 miles away awesome can
you direct me there head east on Pine
Street toward 99 Centennial Avenue
Vinci's location-based services means
that you're receiving relevant local
recommendations without lifting a finger
tip Vinci is the perfect companion it
learns from your heart rate activity and
preferences to better understand and
suggest the perfect song for the moment
hey Vinci
what's my average running speed and
heart rate your average running speed is
5.2 miles per hour heart rate is
currently 110 beats per minute okay
finches localstorage and 3G coverage
means you don't have to carry your phone
it's just you and Vinci on the go how
about I play your workout playlist from
Spotify perfect finches running mode
helps keep you safe by transmitting
external noise over your music
this is the lolly microphone the world's
first digital 3d microphone that plugs
us right into your iPhone as a musician
it's important I can have high quality
audio at a moment's notice
like when we need to record a demo the
second inspiration strikes and I barely
have to think about it because lolly
doesn't need a separate app battery or
memory card it's as simple as plugging
into your iPhone and recording lolly can
also be a great addition to a filmmakers
kit
it'll instantly give you industry
standard 44.1 for 48 kilohertz audio
lolly is designed to be 3d
so no matter how you turn your
smartphone it adjusts the orientation so
that when you listen to it back it
creates an immersive feeling like you're
really there
and with the reversibility of the
Lightning port Raleigh can easily be
used with either cameras but we
understand that you guys are debuting a
new song tonight and for the podcaster a
radio journalist lolis portability means
you can always be ready to record
professional interviews and when you're
going to concerts lolly is a great way
to document the excitement getting crisp
sound even when your front row
record of lolly because great sound
matters
just own a nutshell what is this all
about
so what's special about it yeah
everything look at it it's gorgeous
how do you use it first time you open it
well how do you have you turn it on and
get the music oh so simple to connect
you just literally twist it it's the
only moving function on the actual
device twist it select whether you want
line in or bluetooth pairing up to your
phone and then you're going to get
exploring you'll find the best surface
that you want for you the best surface
for the type of music you listening to
if you place on the back of a window and
you'll hear sound through both sides
bigger the surface you're placing it on
as well the bigger the sound you're
going to recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
going to take home and put on the side
and think it sounds great
you got to show people so the other
feature we've got that's inside there as
well I think it's really quite neat so
if you're in a space like this you could
place two speakers either side you've
got the stereo sound coming out of it
makes it amazing
we've done things really differently I
think for this campaign we want people
to be able to get hold of this product
quickly
