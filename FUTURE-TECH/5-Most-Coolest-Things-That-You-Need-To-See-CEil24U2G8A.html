this is tip tim has a new device a
button with a fingerprint sensor that
turns his hand into a remote control
it's called tap do and it makes Tim's
life a lot easier
hey Tim you're back
Oh who are you hi we're the team behind
tab - a startup company from Germany we
love technology especially technology it
makes our lives easier that's why we've
come up with the solution that lets you
control smart devices and apps the
simple press of a button tap - hi I'm
Robert mcCormick and when my partner's
Jeff Conway Chang and I began
brainstorming our own approach to the
last mile problem for commuters we
agreed that our solution would be guided
by what we called the safe design
principle safe affordable fun and
efficient what we achieved was the
blending of the same kind of lightweight
high output battery you have in your
laptop with a high efficiency hub motor
low drag tires and the simplest lightest
frame we could imagine and the result is
the most practical affordable solution
to commuting short distances yet devised
stand-up electric scooters are fun
that's why you can buy them at the kids
section of your local Walmart but unlike
the Walmart variety the ion smart
scooter is no toy it's a tool for
commuters meticulously designed
instructed of quality components and
materials and built to do the job of
whisking you the last mile quickly
easily and effortlessly and you'll get
to your destination without raising a
sweat relaxed refreshed and ready for
work the ion smart scooter is ideal for
students
urban residences outlined parking lots
and for running errands sightseeing and
just getting around your neighborhood
our goal was create a clean efficient
last-mile solution that was also
affordable we can handle prototypes for
about $1,500 each but to achieve our
goal we need to create mouldings and
purchase equipment to enter into
large-scale production a contribution of
$399 ensures you one of the first ions
marks Cooter's off the line in December
2014 join us we want to change the way
the world commutes when you have one of
your own you will understand support our
Kickstarter campaign glide on
