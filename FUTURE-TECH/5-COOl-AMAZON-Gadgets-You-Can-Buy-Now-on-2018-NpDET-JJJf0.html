when we first launched the 3doodler we
asked the world to imagine a pen that
could literally draw in the air two
years on we've made the world's first 3d
printing pen even better with a new and
improved version that's slimmer lighter
quieter and even easier to use the
3doodler heats then rapidly cools
plastic allowing instant 3d creation and
with no software or computers the
possibilities are limited only by your
imagination we've shipped over a hundred
and thirty thousand first generation
three jewelers and our community has
used them to create amazing things in
jewelry too RC planes fully three doodle
dresses architectural models and even
writing Braille it was because of the
support of this Kickstarter community
that we were able to make the 3doodler
dream a reality to say thank you we've
decided to bring 3doodler 2.0 to you
first completely redesigned from top to
bottom and housed in a sleek aluminum
casing the new 3doodler is the result of
over two years of research and
development all aimed at giving you the
best 3 doodling experience possible the
new 3doodler is also packed with loads
of enhancements making it smoother
sleeker and easier to use than ever
before
we're also releasing exciting new
accessories including the jet pack a
portable power pack that gives you the
freedom to three doodle on-the-go to
help kick-start creativity in the
classroom we've created a special
educational bundle complete with pens
plastic accessories and curricular
materials which you can send to any
school library or makerspace of your
choosing if you can draw write or wave a
finger in the air you can create with
the 3d water our community website has
hundreds of projects and stencils that
you can download for free and it's
filled with how-to videos and images of
inspiring creations from around the
world so when will you get your new
