600 million people who get behind the
wheel of a cars every single day at 75%
of them used a smartphone while driving
hello kick-started my name is Ivan and
today I'm extremely proud to introduce
Hardwick loss it is a simple smartphone
accessory but turns your Smartphone into
a head-up display just like any fighter
jet or luxury car we've been working on
improving safety and comfort of a driver
for three years
we started with a navigation app which
transforms our vision how how cell
phones can be used in cars by now over 1
million drivers have tried our and one
customer even told us it saved his life
other glass was inspired by rally racing
when you are driving 120 miles per hour
all your attachments focus on their own
health look away even for a second is
extremely dangerous put in a head-up
display in the race there is one thing
but we realized regular drivers face all
the same distractions and more using
their smartphones while driving
we put it to the test the two most
common distractions are reading
directions of your phone and checking
your speedometer this causes to drive a
blind for approximately 300 feet on
every mile on a typical 10-mile trip we
are distracted and driving blind for
over half a mile using Hardware glass
this distraction time is reduced to
nearly zero the head-up displays and
cars do exist already but they tend to
be very expensive and usually found only
on luxury vehicles some companies are
developing more affordable devices but
they still cost several hundred dollars
and a stack in the midst of a very long
and complicated development process so
you still cannot buy them today a hard
way we take a simple around let's face
it your smartphone already has
everything you need to project Daytona
Beach bacon bright display GPS internet
answers the only thing is missing is a
special optical glass to providing high
quality reflection of your screen
they are not rain or shine well the only
thing missing is a missing anymore
imagine that you already have had a
display in your car all you need is just
an accessory for your smartphone
imagine all navigation information is in
front of your eyes all the time imagine
music control conference calls or
catching up with your robot friend Siri
there are no limits you can use any app
on any smartphone that supports head-up
display mode now there is no need to
take your hands of the wheel or your
eyes of the road it's a safer and more
comfortable ride what do you think about
that option to just not on my phone
every two seconds
high-end luxury cars that have the
capability if you don't have one of
those kind of cars you know I think it's
great to have how much oh gosh I don't
know it must be some kind of fancy glass
maybe a few hundred dollars actually
only $49 you have she burns my smell
funky I want one that's awesome
that's cool
other glass is a spike in very dear face
and it's not a formula in fact we're
ready manufacturers first there's a
bunch of the devices and get great
feedback from our customers drivers and
marketing experts now it's your turn
Kickstarter help us thank this product
of an ax level and n destructor driving
put it on down and lead Holloway glass
show you their way
hey everyone we are mocha can last year
we came to you with an idea of the
smallest 4k camera your incredible
support brought mocha cam to life to
create a better mocha cam we've
responded to thousands of comments and
have enjoyed all the photos and videos
that you shared online the improvement
ideas and our experience from the mocha
cam to Moka 360 has prepared us for this
moment introducing alpha and alpha s the
first wearable camera that provides a
shutter wheel to control the shutter
speed allowing you to set it up to 1 mm
of a second for 32 seconds freely if you
haven't heard of mocha cam it's the
world's smallest 4k camera the rotatable
screen module allows you to find the
best filming angle and double the
battery life the spare battery that
simply snaps on magnetically can extend
your battery life to 4 hours for video
filming now alpha brings more surprises
here's how he made it even better
mocha cam alpha s has an umbrella image
processor and provides 4k 30 frames per
second or 1080p 120 frames per second
video features it means you can get 150
speed full HD slow-motion video the same
to GoPro Hero 5 with the 1.5 5
micrometers Sony image sensor the
low-light performance has been
significantly improved in addition to
Wi-Fi alpha provides Bluetooth
connection which is more stable and
consumes less power
it can turn your phone into a Bluetooth
promote and get GPS information for
geo-tagging or show the trajectory with
the built in G sensor alpha can get
better image stabilization on video
recording alpha has dual status lights
so even if there's no screen module you
can show the camera status clearly the
dual mic system provides stereo
recording capability alpha uses a type
seed board to connect a camera and
screen the micro HDMI port provides a
new preview and playback mode now it's
the totally new feature and most
important part the shutter wheel with
the new design buttons in manual mode
you can turn the shutter wheel to set
the shutter speed freely up to 1 mm of a
second or 32 seconds in other words you
can now use mocha cam shooting long
exposure night picks or even the stars
what's more after applying all these
great features alpha is 20% smaller than
the previous generation and 35 percent
smaller than GoPro Hero 5 we are also
able to offer two options this time
alpha and alpha s alpha uses the same
image processor - mocha cam the frame
rate is similar to gopro hero4 and
provides all the other features of alpha
s
so please order a mocha pan today and
share it with your friends help us to
make it a reality

hey everyone my name is michael wagon
for some years now I have a problem
every evening and sometimes several
attempts a day I have to put my mobile
devices on charge and what is the most
inconvenient about it is that the
battery goes out when I have a huge
necessity to his one of them I think I'm
not the only one who get bothered by
this problem I'm pretty sure that every
one of you got into this situation when
one of the deserts ran out of battery
the moment we needed it the most you
should not worry about this animal
because I got of that solution the
solution is in hand energy this is your
device of unlimited energy its unlimited
because you can generate it to yourself
and you can generate this energy as much
as you need canned energy preserves
energy inside of itself that's why you
can use it anytime you need it and of
course you can charge your device during
the rotation of intelligent as well and
energy is very easy to use first you
need to tell the ring and let it go then
just give the Dacian goal it may be a
surprise but the author wishes inside
the hand energy device rotates with the
average speed of 5000 tons per minute
that's why your smartphone will be
charged by tenth energy with the same
speed as you charge it from the park
take the antennas device with you of the
time and your energy will be safe no
matter where you are and what you do and
energy is indispensable for the people
living in the areas with limited access
to electrical grid thanks to Kent energy
your energy is in your hands it's one of
the most effective energy generators and
what is more it looks nice
you may choose the antennas a device
according to a taste or style developing
the containers a device we have
performed a huge amount of experiments
created a huge amount of prototypes and
now and energy is finally done and ready
for production and we need your help
- by the way gente energy divides
synchronizes with an F where you can
observe no statistic and also achieve
particular goals doing competitions and
get prizes before the gig starter
campaign we've made a tour around Europe
to support an energy we've shown the
device to people let them take a
closed-loop edit and use it to see what
it's like you may learn about them
freshmen regarding this experience by
yourself you can get more information
about and energy about the tork about
our plans on Kickstarter page on our
website or following the cash tech and
energy we need your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
