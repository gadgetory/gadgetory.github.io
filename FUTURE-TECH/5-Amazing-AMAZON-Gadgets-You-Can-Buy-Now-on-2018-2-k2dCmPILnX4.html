for yourself and you're like the worst
thing about flying is being physically
crunched trying to politely share the
small space between you it can be
awkward especially who gets the armrest
how much of it and for how long since
the average armrest is about two inches
wide attempting to share it equally
seems impossible until now join the
movement to unfold severe skies with
Sora gommi an elegant and innovative
armrest extender inspired by origami the
Japanese art of paper folding ideal for
frequent fliers origami divides and
extends both sides of the airplane
armrest to expand elbow space for both
travellers and create a full physical
separation it's a win win lightweight
and compact stylish and streamlined saw
raqami folds flat like a piece of paper
into your carry-on simply spring it into
shape and secure the winglets over
nearly every airplane armrest to end
in-flight armrest battles once and for
all

love products to make traveling weren't
easy and fun so I had standoffs with
strangers who over the airplane are rust
but as soon as I step on the
origami the moonlights as if there's
this unspoken truce yeah without the war
yeah access is buffer zone right but
there's no weird like elbow to elbow
contact for a stranger
it just makes flying more spacious and
comfortable for everyone so we're going
