smartphone that fits in the palm of your
hand this is jelly the world's smallest
4G smartphone it's hard to imagine a
world without smartphones but with

seven days standby time our goal was to
design a great mini sized smartphone

anything on the market but also supports
4G network we focus on so many details
for a maximum performance while also
going through many design and testing
stages just to ensure that jelly is
reliable and looks awesome for everyone

hand leaving your other hand for other
important things now let's move on to

open up a whole new world of playing
with light the last button is the smart
wheel same as all other controls it's
also fully programmable with the picked
our app that comes with a device you
decide which parameters you want to
control in default mode the smart wheel
