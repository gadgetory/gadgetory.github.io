you
EMU's the brain sensing headband do more
with your mind and more with your life
have you ever wondered what is causing
that slight headache or wooziness that
you feel at the end of your workday or
why your eyes burn when you cross the
street do you wonder if this is going to
cause a long-term problem for you or
your kids air pollution both indoors and
out is a global problem today you can
join us to challenge it this is add mode
to a wearable air quality tracker that
measures real-time air pollution
temperature and humidity it's the most
affordable and most compact air quality
tracker on the market today people don't
realize now what's in the air might
affect our health unless you have asthma
or allergies we don't notice any
immediate impact on our bodies and never
really care about the air around us but
during the day the concentration of
volatile organic compounds carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide indoors may
increase dramatically if the ventilation
is not good enough with admah tube it's
easy to track the pollution around you
and understand what you can do to
breathe better in the big cities we are
often exposed to air pollution outside
too but we are always too busy to pay
attention to it aDNA tube will
immediately alert you about potential
danger so you can prevent negative
health impacts
aDNA tube can sense environmental
changes in real time to help to make the
right choices every day and live
healthier
we have been helping other companies to
invent and develop hardware and software
products for years then we finally
decided that it's time to solve our own
problem we've been working on ACMA tube
for over a year to achieve the most
accurate readings from the sensors craft
it's beautiful and durable titanium body
and create the best user experience from
the data that the Admiral tube detects
now we're ready to share it with you
pre-order your admah tube now and be
smarter about the air that you breathe
more than 40% of our lives are spent in
habit for most of us that time is wasted
the secret to transformation is not to
try harder it's to replace bad habits
with the habits of excellence if you
wanted to transform yourself how would
you start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shock each surge of
voltage trains your brain and weakens
the neural connection until the bad
habit is severed next replace the bad
habit with a positive one reward
yourself when you complete your daily
goal commit to a penalty if you fail the
fear of loss stimulates your basal
ganglia while the chance of reward
motivates your prefrontal cortex in
fewer than 30 days the action becomes a
habit pavlok is the first system
designed to help you build good habits
and break bad ones earn rewards when you
succeed pay the price when you fail and
experience the electric shock that keeps
you on track contribute to the
crowdfunding campaign today hi i'm annie
Satie founder of pavlok now I know that
electric shock sounds crazy but
sometimes crazy works like many
revolutionary ideas ours started off
just as a fun project but it turned into
something much more together with my
co-founder Jim Lynch we set out to
create Pavlov the world's first device
that doesn't just track what you do but
actually changes what you do here you
see pavlok in his wristband for
but at its core hablok is a small module
it's small enough that it can stick
anywhere on your body
now padlock is able to vibrate beef and
even electrically shocked you on command
but what padlock can do is much more
instead of me telling you what padlock
you do let me show you what padlock is
already done hi my name is David
Goldstein I'm hoping to use padlock to
get me into a better exercise routine I
am a cancer survivor I've had heart
attack I was in a wheelchair for a while
nice to have some paralysis in both legs
as you can see I've put on a great deal
of weight and I'm hoping that bad luck
and help me address all of those issues
I am at 65 days at the past 70 woman of
using the padlock system I am down 7
pounds my arms have got noticeably
stronger and my legs are actually the
strongest they've been since I was
paralyzed in 2001 my kids more at the
end of the day it's now just part of who
I am and what I do you see most of us
just don't know what greatness feels
like we assume that we're gonna do what
we've always done but users like David
tell a different story when they begin
to fall back into the old routine
Pavlik jolts them out of it in most
cases their old routine can be replaced
and he was in 30 days people are already
using pavlon to begin writing everyday
to learn new languages to exercise to
journal to begin to form and break
dozens of new habits in fact there's
infinite capabilities thanks to padlocks
open developer API I know firsthand how
powerful small habit changes can be and
I'm excited to share pavlok with the
world
that's where IndieGoGo supporters like
you come in we've built the padlock
prototype we've begun testing on users
now we need your help to begin setting
up manufacturing so we can deliver
pavlok and help it change the habits
that matter most to you
did you know the women are four times
more likely than men to say that recent
sex was unpleasurable in fact studies
have shown that men are twice as likely
to have an orgasm during sex than their
partners we call this the pleasure gap
and we're out to fix it
IVA is the first hands-free strap free
non intrusive control vibrator which a
woman can wear during sex it is unique
design features dynamic wings which tuck
under the labia allowing the vibrator to
stay on top of the clitoris without
getting the way of penetration research
shows the two most important
contributors to women's pleasure and
climax our physical contact like kissing
and touching and control simulation 70%
of women knee control simulation to
orgasm but most vibrators are
distracting or creative barrier during
sex between the partners because even
small hands-free and completely external
it allows you and your partner to keep
the focus on each other the problem with
holding a vibrator during sex is that it
can really get in the way and detract
from the experience this was just not
obtrusive at all it was like as far as
he could tell there was nothing you know
there was nothing in his way I
definitely notice when she's enjoying
herself more and I get a lot of pleasure
out of that I didn't have to think about
holding it down you know I could focus
on my partner and doing stuff with my
partner while also having that sensation
at Dame products our mission is create
phenomenal sex toys
the study of sex has been Alex's
lifelong passion and I'm an established
mechanical engineer who decided if I
want better sex toys I guess I better
make them myself with our powers
combined we think we have a unique
opportunity to bring you an original sex
toys that fit the real needs of women
and the people they have sex with Eva
doesn't work like anything else in the
market so it doesn't look like anything
else we use our fleet of 3d printers to
be able to iterate quickly on form and
get a lot of user feedback to get Eva to
the shape fit and strength that it is
today
Engineering Eva's wings is an
interesting challenge because they have
to be flexible enough to fit a range of
women and arrange positions but also
sturdy enough to hold the vibrator in
place we selected a small motor with a
powerful kick then gave it three very
distinct speeds from gentle to almost
intimidating Eva sits in the right place
the vibration is always comfortable if I
had this product I think I would
probably wear it all the time we believe
that innovative designs commit to better
sex and happier couples that's what
we're so excited to bring you Eva
your support will allow us to order
tooling in our first round of production
any additional funds will enable us to
grow as a company in a brand to bring
you even more awesome products we're
just trying to make the world a happier
place one vagina at a time
