past few years we've become the top
innovators of living decor disrupting
the stagnant industry of dying plants
and dirty aquariums we started out with
a dream just like you to create
something that would rock this world in
2015 you blew us away with your response
to the Eco keep see a beautiful stunning
self-sustaining desktop ecosystem fast
forward a couple years and we launched
the Eco cube air and the Eco cube frame
exclusively on Kickstarter your response
who we want more meet the Eco cube C
plus a beautiful blended mix of our top
three products with one look we know
you'll fall in love with the stylish
functional work of art just fill it with
water plug it in and enjoy never change
filters ever we've shipped thousands of
eco cubes around the world and one thing
became clear everyone asked for
something bigger after three years of
hard work it's finally here
we took the original smaller model made
it bigger and reconsidered every design
element by further optimizing the filter
there's now even more space for your
fish friends previously you can only
grow one plant now you can have up to
five you can also grow nutritious micro
veggies in less than 10 days 100%
guaranteed to grow we've got your back
our grow team is committed to helping
you with your c+ garden the c+ has more
space for fish in plants with the same
attention to detail handmade flame
polished one eco cube at a time
now you can become a fish parent without
ever having to change your filters or
water the eco cubes unique aquaponics
filter uses plants to filter the water
just like nature does in our rivers and
lakes
fish create waste that fertilize the
plants and as the plants grow your
aquarium gets even cleaner this is the
lowest maintenance aquarium period and
it's more affordable than ever
other aquariums and filters cost
hundreds of dollars the Eco cube c plus
is a better product at a fraction of the
cost
liven up your home or office space with
more nature it's designed for everyone
everywhere we believe sustainable
agriculture is the future our mission is
to expand this vision one eco cube at a
time eco cube c plus everything works
together
cleaning the toilet again we invented
technology that cleans the floor cleans
windows trims the lawn washes dishes and
cleans the laundry but only for the
assignment we hate the most there's no
solution until now introducing spin X a
revolutionary toilet cleaning robot that
cleans your toilet bowl and seat
automatically in just 90 seconds spin X
was designed to make your toilet
cleaning experience more efficient at
the touch of a button it makes your
toilet clean and shiny a smart sensor
scans your toilet shape and a smart
robotic arm goes out of a hidden cell
and gets to every spot in the bowl
equipped with a jet of water and soap
the brush rapidly rotates even
underwater dirt and bacteria don't have
a chance you won't need to take care of
anything the brush cleans and dries
itself killing up to 99.99 percent
bacteria
even the seat gets clean soap and water
jets on washing the seat thoroughly
followed by a compressed air drying it
perfectly and when it's all done
Spin X returns back to its elegant and
luxurious look spinach operates on low
power consumption every 30 sessions
charge the battery and add your favorite
soap spin X is suitable for every toilet
even at the office you can continue to
take care of your business instead of
your toilet in save precious time
forget about cleaning the toilet for
ever perfect cleaning has never been
easier spinnings the world's first
automatic toilet cleaning robot we built
an amazing team of engineers and
designers and we created a smart product
that saves time and effort we've
completed the design and themselves the
manufacturers now we are ready to make
the last adjustments and go to
production in order to bring spin x to
families and businesses around the world
we need your support to produce Phoenix
at an industrial scale thank you
you
meet gem meet star too smart solar
lanterns that use wireless technology to
let you easily design dynamic lighting
for any space the luminate smart solar
garden is an interactive Bluetooth
lighting system that integrates
seamlessly into your backyard or patio
powerful performance that's easy to use
with our free app you can remotely
control the brightness and color of your
lanterns to design lighting that's just
right all with just a press of a button
create groups like front porch or
backyard barbecue and control as a group

feet of lighting area with over 75
lumens of bright LED light no need to
worry about the weather the lights are
100% waterproof durable and made to last
with the smart solar garden we wanted to
unite green technology and intelligent
design to empower sustainable living
beyond the grid we've spent years
creating and refining durable solar
lighting solutions for disaster relief
and outdoor adventures through our give
like outlay program more than 50
thousand solar lanterns have gone to
families without electricity with this
Kickstarter for every smart solar garden
pledge we want to give a solar Lantern
to a family in need of a safe
rechargeable light light has a singular
power to draw people together it's about
revealing opportunities warming spaces
and connecting people just as campers
gather around a fire and community and
conversation are drawn to glowing we
want our solar lights to draw together
family and friends and share the power
of light
where that connect this device
noise-canceling headset on the pier
plugs on the go we're gonna try them out
we can still here in New York City right
okay
wait maybe
they're in comparative I can't hear
anything
I
I didn't know anything about the cars
and stuff there's no noise right isn't
that magical do you hear the siren is a
pretty cool feature right yeah
and then can you believe me if I told
you this is under $50
on the dial
and also we tried your phone
what do you think about living in York
City and a visa we use all the tiny goes
here
I've been here for maybe four hours and
I'm ready everyone with how much nicer
Israel
and it's pretty cool that you could be
able to map these and cancel out all the
noise and still be able to talk to
you
mag knowing really is a blend of our
very best thinking and our very best
innovation this is what our pen
represents
in order to create something that is
entirely new it is sometimes best to
start from the very beginning we've
taken inspiration from an extremely
successful product that we launched last
year magnet the world's first
magnetically controlled pencil elements
of our patent-pending magnetic
propulsion technology using the magnet
pencil have been injected into the
design of magnetic the pen but the
mechanism of the pen is far more cryptic
having the inability to fully understand
how it works
soon makes it become magical there is
not a detail on mackovic that doesn't
need to be there there are no visual
distractions no interruptions it is pure
in every sense of the word
most other pennies use invasive as here
all features to their designs to
preventively
but even we changed magnolias center of
mass by a specified offsetting zone
this means that when you place it down
on a table intuitively find it so to
static position it is fascinating to see
how a considered design can give an
inanimate object the sense of
intelligence our company rebar cane was
founded on Kickstarter both myself and
Matthew have a huge amount of experience
in crowdfunding and thanks to our other
trusting backers over 10,000 people are
enjoying our products worldwide today we
have traveled across the world to
collaborate with some of the leading
precision engineering manufacturers even
our packaging has gone through an
obsessive design process it is
completely bespoke magna link is far
more than just a product so much more
than a collection of parts it is an
experience in addition to our meticulous
design process we've recently partnered
with a highly recognized logistics
company this ensures that our high
quality service is continued all the way
through to your doorstep
whether Magno Inc is for yourself a
loved one or as a thoughtful gift it
becomes part of a personality a
lifestyle for a lifetime it is at this
point that we need your help to make
this project in the air
as soon as we have your support we can
begin manufacture and start shipping
magnate to your door thank you for
watching
