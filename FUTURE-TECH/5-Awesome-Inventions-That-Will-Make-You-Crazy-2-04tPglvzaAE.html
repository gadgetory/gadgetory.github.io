a custom app just place your phone on
top and press print a few seconds later
you'll have a beautiful Polaroid photo
of your phone screen snap jet is a slim
portable instant film printer for your
smartphone it's like a tiny photocopying
machine you can bring anywhere the best
thing about snapchat is simplicity all
you need to do is put your phone on top
press one button and you get a flawless
photo it doesn't need any apps wires or
Bluetooth the function with snapchat the
possibilities are endless if you can see
it you can print it imagine a birthday
card with a selfie that was taken 30
seconds ago what about printing a custom
business card at your next meeting
snapchats text is sharp and clear never
be caught with an outdated business card
again and next time instead of running a
giant expensive photo booth for your
special occasion why not use a snapchat
instead snapchat prints on fuji insects
or polaroid 300 films and its innovative
design can support any smartphone polar
i it is near and dear to my heart as a
photographer I was just really excited
about working with instant film again
and I loved that snap that was
incorporating the use of a smartphone
because it's just so convenient to take
photos we wanted something that pushed
the limits of what's possible with
instant film like digital effects
fluorescent ink a pocket video that
doesn't require a single batteries
lenticular film and transparencies that
come to life with an arduino and some
simple leds we're actually really
excited to see what people make with
snapchat and where it's used so the
biggest challenge with snapchat was
creating a really slim device we
designed something that takes what would
normally be a lens space of about 150
millimetres and squash it down into just
one millimeter we reached out to David
welfare and paradigm optics we
specialize in all Palmer optical devices
the fiber-optic array was the main
component of the synaptic and mechanism
making the custom order for snapchat was
challenging because they were material
combinations that we had never done
before it basically required a
reconfiguration of the entire oven to
make it work we did all of our
prototyping in-house we use laser
cutting machining and even a
kick-started 3d printer to produce our
first prototype once we get funding will
have the resources to create our
injection mold tools will be able to
produce our printed circuit boards in
large quantities and we'll be able to
assemble our devices snapchats hardware
and software will all be open source
we're going to release our PCB
schematics our CAD designs and anything
else that a maker would need to hack
reprogram and make it better one day we
envisioned snapchats optical technology
and a printer so slim that it could be
part of a smartphone case snapchat is an
amazing creative tool it's a great way
to connect to preserve memories and it's
really fun by backing snap jet you're
backing the idea that innovation should
be open to everyone and instant film
technology pioneered by the iconic
Polaroid company in 1948 still has a few
surprises in store for us now we really
need your help on Kickstarter to back
our project and make snapchat a reality
and we won't stop until it's in your
hands join us in revolutionising instant
film measurements are integral to our
everyday lives but they can put us into
risky and tricky situations or require
someone else to help gange those lengthy
distances
but here's a change by that pet Shack eh
indeed now you can get out of that
whiskey spot and don't need a helping
hand to determine long decision
new jingling measures and not one but
two directions from one press of a
button you can acquire the left right
and total value at once saving you
precious time and energy on every move
and allowing you to work with greater
efficiency by making new the focal point
also your measurements can be instantly
updated to your smart device with our
sketch application we can design and
plan for any project VH Amy's additional
functions an able you to you use
continuous measuring mode to find the
points
Pythagoras function to reach high
and calculate the area and volume of any
Stan's life made easier vhat by magpie
check you take that extra step so you
don't have to
baby baby baby baby baby
Lucy I'm home welcome home ms please
fill Margaret home now ok I am sending
mock and message this is the game
tonight yes your calendar shows a game
at nine tonight ok there's a spot for me
at his house at eight thirty working
although she's gonna rain no the low
pressure front is passing to the north
of us the door my brothers you made that
movie but there's so much more when I
tell you about her she doesn't just
listen and talk to you we gave her a an
amazing touch screen and an HD camera
that has facial recognition that comes
in very handy when you use your personal
assistant we've spent a lot of time
developing what we believe the best
personal assistant on the market nothing
from sources Lucy is extremely well
connected she has Wi-Fi full cloud
connectivity but also the zigbee bridge
or other tomorrow only life I felt my
place just imagine what we can do and
control your lighting your air
conditioning you're eating the blind
your security camera give your baby
monitors or turn on your competition in
the morning so either so many up
so are designed to you did a great job
is customizable Brandi you can reduce
from beachwood look or a nice states
your frame there's a few choices you'll
see them on the website and it's just
beautiful he reproduced you really
trying that the Christmas system and
that is by helping you with your daily
routine check your counter remind you of
a birthday or an appointment that you
have to take your coats you nappin to
order pizza or make a reservation at
your favorite restaurant Lucy's
everything you can dream up with your
personal moments so not only includes
the a great teacher he can show you
Ricky when you're cooking you can show
your training video something that you
want to learn but she's also really
smart student because she'd remember the
favorite things that you like to order
say you want to assign Jovi's well then
come you order pizzas or that's exactly
what we're going to take so she learns a
lot of things about you J behavior which
makes it even better than your you have
this beautiful frame that you chose and
when you're not using loosely actively
we actually thought to put some
beautiful art in there giving you the
opportunity to connect to your favorite
artists or uploading your own photo
gallery from your smartphone to Lucy to
show that loose engine stalled in
numerous wounds
but can also work together with a loose
to another phone the team behind Lucy
consciously offering you new features
and services and those updates will be
for free forever if you guys are just
excited about having your own personal
assistant as we are then we really
appreciate your back of this project
Thank You Lucy I wish you'd make me a
drink still working on it
