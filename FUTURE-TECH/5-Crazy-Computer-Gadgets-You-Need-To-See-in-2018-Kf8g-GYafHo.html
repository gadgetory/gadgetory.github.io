this is the Aqil serious a the world's
most versatile Windows 10 mini PC ever
created it's a complete desktop PC
equipped with powerful hardware
components for optimal performance wired
and wireless options enable you to
create a comfortable workspace within

as the serious a doesn't require a fan
for cooling the unique switch mode
developed in direct partnership with
Microsoft changes the serious a into an
input device once you connect it to your
screen the aqil sirius a is small enough
to fit into your bag or pocket you don't
even realize you're carrying a complete
computer with you the full HD
touchscreen and integrated battery allow
you to use the device unplugged and
on-the-go

content it's the remote control for all
your smart home devices it's the gateway
to your favorite media it's your gaming
device it's your connection with the

I started my career at Philips in 2007 I
decided to pursue my own dream and start
my first company I thought ah it's
currently the fastest growing art a
company in Europe but I started with
absolutely nothing back home in the
living room local computers was raised
with the same spirit as a phones app
it's a new concept a new venture a team
with a vision about why and how to do
things different everything we do at
Akko is inspired by what I think is the
definition of radical innovation we have
created a product with a unique form
factor and new functionality being able
to present the OCO serious a to you
today is what made me hand in my
contract line years ago I think this
product is disruptive and you will get a
great device to support us and perhaps
even more important is that you will
contribute to a company that has a lot
more ideas about doing things
differently if you two are passionate
about true innovation just like aku then
join us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
