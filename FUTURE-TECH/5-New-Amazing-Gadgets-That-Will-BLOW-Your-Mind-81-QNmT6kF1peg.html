button to keep your items where they
belong and you want to rest the
adventure hoodie holds up conveniently
into a pillow with snaps to secure it in
place and in unfolds just as easily with
your stuff in the zippered or button
pockets it makes getting through the

the oversized hood is lined with extra
soft fabric designed to pull over your
eyes with built in gloves that unfold
out of the cuffs you can stay warm and
cozy with a mini pen pocket you'll
always have something to write with and
