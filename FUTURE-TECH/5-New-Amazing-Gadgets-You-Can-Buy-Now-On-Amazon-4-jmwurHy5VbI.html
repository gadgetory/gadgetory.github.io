hi I'm Alan I'm Justin and we are flux
mom thanks for checking out bold squared
the newest member of the bolt family
since our first project we've gained a
tremendous amount of experience because
of your support it was a huge success
and just like before we're working very
closely with our manufacturer to make
sure that we deliver on time once again
now the prototypes and certifications
are completely finished all that's left
is to secure the funding so that we can
greenlight our factory and begin
production let's make bold squared
happen and thank you for your support
these are activity trackers they help
you become healthier move more lose
weight sleep better you get it this is
also tracker and it helps you become
healthier to accept this a lighter
so what happens when you take the same
principles that help you become more
active and use them to help you quit
smoking you get the equipment the
world's first smart letter it likes your
cigarettes using a heat core and tracks
every time you smoke it shows you how
much you've smoked how long it's been
since your last one it helps you stay on
course to achieve your goals learning
your smoking habits is simple with the
quip adapt you can take a closer look at
your trends and set custom goals to quit
about a year ago my friend asked me how
many cigarettes I spoke that day and I
realized it really wasn't sure sometimes
you light up without even thinking about
it the quick big tracks when you smoke
so you can be mindful and start to cut
out cigarettes one by one if you can
measure it you can manage it visualize
your progress and share it with the
built-in community we're big into the
power of customization so you can even
limit when or how often the lighter
works the quicker can be used alone but
it also plays nicely with others we have
a team of industrial designers that have
created something wonderful so you can
be proud of quitting we also wanted it
to last so we've been living in China
for the last four months working
directly with factories and suppliers
make sure we produce inequality and that
will stick by your side no matter how
long it takes with your support we can
go through large-scale manufacturing and
finalize that we can't wait to get the
equipment into your hands and see how
you'll use it please back us help spread
the word and join our journey
