need
this device will measure both movement
and physiological signals the
combination is likely to be very
important for detecting potentially
life-threatening seizures these sensors
and algorithms were originally developed
here at the MIT Media Lab we learned
that combining the stress data we could
sense from the rest with the activity
data led to the most accurate seizure
detection
we have been working on a medical
quality wearable for many years our III
sensor is being used by the top
physicians and scientists in the world
to acquire clinical quality data for
their studies no other device on the
market today can do anything like this
now we are making embrace so that
everyone can benefit from our technology
we've done a lot of work with a truly
passionate team that believes in this
project many of you have asked for a
device like this new we are also thanks
