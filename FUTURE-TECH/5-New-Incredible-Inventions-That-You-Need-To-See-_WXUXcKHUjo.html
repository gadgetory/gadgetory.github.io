project cubit calculates the dimensions
of the real world with its dual laser to
measure long distances or its built-in
smart wheel to calculate short distances
and irregular objects qubit then brings
those measurements into the
corresponding app along with photos you
have taken of the spaces and objects you
are looking to use to create your vision
this allows you to virtually design your
project with real-world scale and
context it gives you the freedom to
experiment and try many variations
before building you are also able to
share your design with other users as
well as download other designs from a
network of content creators cubit will
guide you to your digitally created
measurements in the real world with
directional arrows with the bullseye
cubit indicates where your coins exist
bringing your digitally created vision
to life in the real world cubit allows
you to go from the real world to digital
and back to the real world without you

introducing Luna the first and only
hardware solution that turns your iPad
into a true wireless second display to
create a workspace that frees you
wherever you go
Luna delivers stunning image quality
with virtually zero lag turning your
iPad into a touch Mac that works over
Wi-Fi Luna sets up in seconds and
instantly works with your existing Wi-Fi
simply plug it into any Mac USB C or
DisplayPort install the Luna app and
you're off and running
no antennas no waiting and no hassles we
developed the Luna because we knew there
was a better solution than relying on
software to turn an iPad into a second
display software apps literally hack
your graphics covered delivering a
glitchy and unreliable picture they
trick your Mac into thinking and
displays attached when effect they get
no benefit of graphics acceleration or
metal GPU support
so unlike software apps Luna harnesses
the raw power of your graphics card
giving you the full benefit of its
graphics acceleration delivering
stunning second monitor
that's 100% wire free in addition to
acting as a second display Luna also
acts as a complete extension to your Mac
allowing you to use it directly from
your iPad with full support using
external keyboards Apple pencil and
Apple touch interactions it literally
allows you to turn your MacBook or iMac
into a touchable device designed and
developed by the creators of Astra pad
the award-winning drawing app used by
major animation studios and product
design firms across the globe Luna
carries the same quality performance
that's
delivered to their tens of thousands of
customers and for those of you who are
artists you compare Luna and aster pad
to take your studio anywhere and create
the ultimate drawing experience Luna so
much more than a second screen this is
gate the first all-in-one smart lock
gate is the first all-in-one system to
conveniently manage who comes in and out
of your home it's your personal doorman
protecting everything you hold most
important and connecting you to your
guests and services it includes a smart
lock with key access that can be
controlled remotely by mobile phone or
computer to a keypad entry system 3 a
motion-activated camera with audio and
doorbell and for a secure Wi-Fi
connection
imagine your kids come home from school
and can not only let themselves in and
even if they forgot that key but you
also get a notification based on their
personal passcode hey guys how's it
going
good got an A+ on laptops all right good
job
your Airbnb guests arrive and receive a
text with a random and secure temporary
passcode that is valid only for the
length of birthday your delivery arrives
you can either let them in remotely Hey
who is it baggage delivery oh great
unlock it for you or if they are one of
our registered service providers they
will automatically receive a one-time
passcode valid for the scheduled
delivery down
your small business is closed but you
still need to get deliveries kay lets
you not only control who comes in but it
also keeps track of each person who
comes to your door and notifies you if
you choose
the challenge of gait was to create a
system within a single easy-to-install
device game was created by a team of
successful engineers who were leading
projects at Sandia National Lab Qualcomm
and Google after two years of
prototyping gate teamed up with the
award-winning design firm bulks clever
to create a product that has not only
functionally robust but beautifully
designed Gate is easy to install secure
and easy to use
gate protect him what's inside and
connecting what's outside security</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
