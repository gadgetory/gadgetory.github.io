at hammer head we asked how do you make
a timeless tool better introducing a bit
holder that allows for true one-handed
operation we put the strongest magnet we
possibly could on the collar of a bit
holder so that you can't even shake a
fastener off now you can climb a ladder
position a fixture and zip in a screw
all while having a free hand the bit
holder can be easily attached to any of
the hammer head impacting bits with a
simple threaded design not only did we
try to make setting a fastener safer and
easier but the bits are made of a bi
metal construction allowing them to
absorb impact since we designed this
tool with a 1/4 of an inch quick
connected college you can change bits
into snap I use it all the time
it's the handiest thing in my cool box
hammer head impact bit kits are offered
in a variety of sizes to fit whatever
project you're trying to tackle don't
just work harder work smarter with the
hammer head impact fit kits
hammer head extend your reach
you
are you trying to get things done
nothing is more frustrating than working
where it's hard to reach or where you
can't see till now meet the cordless
flip out an incredible power driver
it's compact to get in the tight spaces
other drivers can't yet drives with the
same power and torque as much larger
tools but here's a real magic the flip
out you'll always come at your work from
just the right angle flip out delivers
torque and power using a design based on
industrial robots there are three
pivoting joints the top one pivots to
reach into tight spots the middle joint
lets you reach around or over and the
third joint gives you all this
flexibility with 360 degrees of rotation
the result flip out locks into over 380
positions giving you power and tight
spots power in hard-to-reach spots power
where you need it flip out gets the job
done use a drill driver at the wrong
angle and you'll quickly strip screws a
flip out adjust to drive screw straight
on and with the drill driver you just
don't have control for RTA furniture a
flip out to variable speeds which gives
you the touch you need to assemble
furniture quickly flip out runs on a
built-in eight volt max lithium ion
battery you can fully recharge it in
just 45 minutes and even if it sits for
a full year flip out still holds its
charge and maybe the best thing about
the flip out is it only weighs one pound
so whether you're working in
hard-to-reach places on electrical or
plumbing or just ate a powerful driver
around the house flip-out is a tool for
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
