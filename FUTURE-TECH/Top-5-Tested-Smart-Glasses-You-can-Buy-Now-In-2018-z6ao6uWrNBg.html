really good sound to the music very very
clearly as well oh my god it's a
grandfather what is it called this is
some cool listening to music and
answering phone calls are available
jungle panther yep what do you have -
nothing much just hanging out in my
place right now what's up yeah I'll be
right over in a little bit cool later
bone conduction speakers transmit sound
waves to the skull via vibrations
is a many-splendored thing should keep
up to yourself so tell me why
this is how I tell you
you
why do we keep to yourself
who try to sing this telling you
hello I'm the founder of the startup
company Jesus I want to combine VR
glasses with the cycling sports to make
your journey more exciting with since he

natural and sinker
start your journey with cents in one
bright forward with music and your heart
base since in one combines your activity

Mansell to month with a second factor
when a fellow please the menu of the
functions come to us when you slice a
stock sample the menu so to do what you
want with this pattern i bobl my phone
call my music and what you write
integration not where
take your sisters
for granted
we are waiting for you we all stand on
the start line wanting to win the race
and I'm no different but it's believing
you have the tools and the mindset
believing you can get more out of your
body and it's about executing that race
on the day the most exciting feeling in
a race is knowing you've won and you've
broken people and they have given
everything professional triathletes come
and go and you know to say I've actually
earned my living and been a professional
triathlete since 1998 not many people
have had career that long the process
has changed for me as I've got older I
become stronger but maybe slightly less
fast so I need to work on that area
winning these days is very very hard and
you know World Titles Olympic titles are
won and lost by seconds they are won and
lost by marginal gains or a sport that
has evolved at an alarming rate it
attracts the kind of person who wants to
be at the cutting edge of endurance and
that's all aspects the technology side
of it the training side of it and
pushing the human body as far as it can
go to get the best out of your body it's
not just about flogging yourself day in
and day out you need to take care of the
small things we talk a lot about
aerodynamics on the bike every time you
look down you're not very Aero but you
know the fact I can look up where I'm
going and I can stay in that position it
is fantastic when you're doing intervals
hard sessions you know you've got the
data right in front of you I think
you've got to try it you know it's like
anything this is so new there's nothing
out there in the whole world you can get
a million buy computers a million
watches this is the only thing that does
what it does
cos it's really one of those innovations
which comes along once in a while and
that has applications in so many
different fields and so many different
sports we've had really fantastic
feedback from a lot of different sports
a lot of different communities tried to
see was that today I absolutely loved
the idea one of the main problems we do
have in Terron is trying to coordinate
that getting the helmet on and the
sunglasses at the same time I just had
my son he's on because he's in the pool
and I just was gonna go underwater so I
decided to just hold him against my head
and as I went under I noticed that I
could see on the water I just have I
guess they are creative mind and and I
just prototype my own little parts
garage at home and and so these are what
sprung out of my garage you place the
sunglasses on your head and you wear
them in this loose position like so and
by pressing the buttons on the sides you
activate the mechanism which tightens
them around your head and it's even a
watertight seal if you want to use them
underwater</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
