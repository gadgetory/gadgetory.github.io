and co-founder at fuel box
my name is Dan Friedman I'm co-founder
and chief marketing officer of the Oh
boxing
the concepts started with building our
phone charger into the wall then we
realized wait YV tied to the outlet
anymore why not bring the outlet to you
power station is a two-part system
featuring the dock and the boost pack
each component has Universal chargers
that allow you to power any mobile
device the dock includes an additional
USB port a secure resting shelf surge
protected outlets and magnets for
attaching the booth back this mobile
life saver carries over 25 hours of
battery life which is indicated by LED
lights it can also be recharged from any
USB port fuel bucks is better simply
because of the combination of both
stationary power and mobile power on the
go we've been developing fuel locks for
almost three years testing and building
model after model we finally have
something that's gonna make all of our
lives a little bit easier throughout
each rendition we focused on creating a
sleek and ergonomic product while
constantly testing the limits of
durability we're really excited about
the team we've assembled here to fuel
box we're innovative we're hardworking
and the backbone of every great company
are the people working hard playing hard
to bring new products to market well
your traditional everyday charging cords
are easy to lose they don't work for all
your devices it's big and bulky and
something you have to add to your device
if you like what you see please share a
few box with your friends order a power
station and help us get to that next
level you can find products out there
that offer you one or the other
convenience but we're the first product
