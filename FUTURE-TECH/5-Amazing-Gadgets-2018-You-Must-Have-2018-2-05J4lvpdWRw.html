realized wait YV tied to the outlet

featuring the dock and the boost pack
each component has Universal chargers
that allow you to power any mobile
device the dock includes an additional
USB port a secure resting shelf surge
protected outlets and magnets for
attaching the booth back this mobile
life saver carries over 25 hours of
battery life which is indicated by LED
lights it can also be recharged from any
USB port fuel bucks is better simply
because of the combination of both
stationary power and mobile power on the
go we've been developing fuel locks for
almost three years testing and building
model after model we finally have
something that's gonna make all of our
lives a little bit easier throughout
each rendition we focused on creating a
sleek and ergonomic product while
constantly testing the limits of
durability we're really excited about
the team we've assembled here to fuel

to bring new products to market well
your traditional everyday charging cords

something you have to add to your device
