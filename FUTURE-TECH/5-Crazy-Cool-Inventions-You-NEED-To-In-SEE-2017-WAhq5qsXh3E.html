fitness three years ago I developed the
original X bar because I needed a
workout and fitness tool that would fit
my extremely busy lifestyle when we
released the original X bar in 2014 we
were new to Kickstarter and to the
fitness industry with your help our
campaign was a huge success
proving to us that there was a demand
for a product just like what we were
offering since then we've sold almost
ten thousand x bars we're incredibly
happy about that but we're even more
excited that we have had zero returns
that's a true testament to the high
quality we've been striving for since
the beginning
the original x-bar is an awesome piece
of equipment but like with most first
products there's always room for
improvement everybody loved their bars
but we did hear one request over and
over you all wanted a collapsible X bar
for travel so inspired by your feedback
we gave ourselves one simple goal design
the world's most complete and now travel
friendly personal fitness system being
travel friendly man it had to be light
it had to be durable and most
importantly it had to be extremely
versatile so that you could achieve the
workout you want anywhere anytime
our design team went back to the drawing
board and spent nearly a year designing
new concepts and testing prototypes
after almost a year of R&amp;amp;D we feel we've
absolutely nailed it and we are so
excited to introduce the x-bar flight
the world's most versatile and extremely
portable personal fitness system with
the x-bar flight we've streamlined the
bar shape smooth out all the angles and
trimmed all the fat because of your
feedback we've completely redesigned the
docking system and we're proud to
introduce a revolutionary hex connect
system with the docks now being hexagons
you have six different docking angles
for each exercise because the docks are
attached you now have the ability to
transition seamlessly from standing
exercises to floor exercises with ease
with the hex Connect system we'll be
releasing a future line of connecting
components to expand your arsenal of
exercises and make the flight even more
versatile and now with the Quick Center
disconnect it allows you to use your bar
as two independent handles this has
opened up dozens of new exercises like
army crawls fly push-ups and even
lateral raises the flight is so
intuitive that the learning curve is
next to zero trainers and class
instructors love it because people just
get it the second you grab your flight
you instinctively know how to use it
with its new design the flight is the
ultimate travel buddy
there's nothing worse than finding
yourself stuck in a new hotel or a new
city missing another workout the flight
is so versatile that you can now turn
your hotel room into a personal gym in
seconds then at only 18 inches it fits
about anywhere your suitcase your back
seat even your backpack and when
reconnected the flight is incredibly
stable and feels like one solid bar
when we say you can workout anywhere at
any time we really mean it
just imagine the places you'll take
yours
so whether you're a busy mom well you're
always on the road for business or if
you just have no interest in going to
the gym the flight is your solution the
gym is right there in the palm of your
hands whenever you're ready from
beginner to advanced you decide how much
you want to push yourself the X bar
flight is always ready for whatever you
can dish out but all of this means
nothing without your help
we're here because we need your support
and if you pledge to back us I give you
my personal promise to deliver the
life-changing fitness system you've only
dreamt about the world's most functional
personal portable fitness system the X
bar flight thank you for taking the time
to watch our video and we can't wait for
you to take flight with us
being a gun owner is not just buying a
gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained
you are your gun see when it's not on
you you want to know it's secure and
accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are a nuisance to
operate as for smart guns while smart
guns are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing sorex
the new generation of gun storage saw
Rex's caliber specific it has two modes
the first mode is awareness if someone
tries to tamper with your gun you're
immediately alerted
and when you need your gun charging it
will eject syrettes
and chamber a fresh round the second
mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel
szura's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it you can also open zorax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zuhr watchdog the zuhr
watchdog is not a lock but rather a
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with
sar X was invented by veterans of elite
IDF technological and in combat units we
worked on it for two years bringing it
to perfection door x allows you to be
ready aware and safe more than ever
