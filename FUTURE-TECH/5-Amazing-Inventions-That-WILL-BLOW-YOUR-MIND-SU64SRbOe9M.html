display the drawers with a pen just use
the app to tell Giotto what to draw then
sit back and watch as the pen works its
magic turning your pixels into pen and
ink
the uses for Java are limitless and
because Giotto is connected you can send
a message to your friends wall from
anywhere in the world imagine some of
the world's best artists and
illustrators delivering our straight to
your wall or simply display information
in style
and when you're ready for something new
Giotto wipes the slate clean
from sending the most important message
of the day to keeping you in the loop
exhibiting a priceless masterpiece to
displaying the things that matter
it seems some things in life are just
better off screen joso story started two
years ago when the there's design studio
that's these guys Jim Barney and Carmen
came up with the concept they wanted to
connect the digital world to the real
world not through a screen but you can
add ink Giotto has been through loads of
prototypes a hardware incubator software
and electronics development and now it's
ready to go and it's an award winner -
turns out people love Giotto people like
the artist and illustrator Anthony
Burrell it helps you to take work from
from screen that is very perfect almost
too perfect and they taste it into the
real world and it gives it a personality
it's not just artists who see the
potential of Giotto
here's Jim the ideas guy it's awesome
seeing how jata inspires people everyone
that sees it draws seems to come up with
new thing they wanted to job people want
to make to-do lists and love notes share
information and we've made sure that it
works with all the apps that they love
including slack Spotify even Amazon
Alexa the notion of being able to create
these these pieces of art live in a real
world space with no screens that's you
know that's that's completely new there
is design studio worked alongside
product design experts and electronics
engineers to hone the nuts and bolts of
Giotto every detail is a thing of beauty
worthy of hanging on your wall
the team have worked closely with
manufacturers based in Shenzhen to
ensure the pricing is realistic and
production is doable so to celebrate the
launch of Java on Kickstarter we've got
something special lined up 365 days of
art that means a brand new image from a
top illustrator on your wall every day
for a year we started as a small team
with a good idea we've put everything
into this to get it ready to go and
we're so close but it's simply not going
to happen Kickstarter so help us make it
a reality so the question is what will
you job
you
for over two years we've been developing
a product that pushes the technical
boundaries of what's possible and is
revolutionary in both appearance and
functionality meet the oculus onyx the
world's first additively manufactured
three axis camera gimbal the future of
camera motion control
current electronic stabilizers help to
keep cameras stable in shooting video
but they also have many shortcomings
they don't consider camera safety they
are heavy cumbersome and hard to operate
our mission was to stabilize your camera
and the most protective lightweight and
agile package possible allowing you to
unleash your creativity in the most
challenging situations and environments
by Kickstarter together with my brother
Jimmy we're the cofounders of oculus
inspire our love of action sports and
the New Zealand outdoors the Onix needed
to be extremely versatile so it can be
taken on the most wild adventures with
backgrounds and industrial design
mechanical engineering and filmmaking
our complementary skill set has allowed
us to push manufacturing boundaries to
rethink redevelop and redesign what a
camera motion control device can be
creating the ultimate tool for
risk-taking filmmakers
what makes the Onix different the
skeleton the structure has been
additively manufactured using grade five
titanium alloy the high strength to
weight ratio of any metal this gave us
our design freedom to innovate with
incredible complexity in combination
with typology optimization we have
mathematically calculated material out
we know the current internal structures
every gram of weight has been optimized
to provide maximum structural integrity
the onyx is very compact
well that's unique handle geometry that
is very intuitive to operate its weight
inside minute can be used in the most
awkward and difficult situations it can
be passed easily between operators and
when it's time to ever break the gimbal
can be placed without the need for a
stance it maintains a payload weight of
up to two kilos and with our tallest
preset balancing system it genetically
reduces sit-up and rebalancing time a
32-bit control system for the encoder
brushless motors provides optimal image
stabilization performance with a battery
life of up to eight hours it also has
the means to power the camera and other
accessories we've got a great selection
of options available a naked version for
an extremely lightweight setup and the
ultimate protection package with
exciting foreign foam covering the
carbon fiber shells and the handles
along with the polycarbonate dime
our oculus we're developing a team of
engineers filmmakers and business
developers with the same goal in mind
inspire creators to take risks and
unleash their creative vision funds from
us campaign are going directly into
expanding our electrical and software
engineering department and further
developing our printing techniques
tolerances and materials we will only be
producing a limited quantity of units
for our Kickstarter campaign and
shipping an order of our backers we've
been getting some amazing results and we
can't wait to see what our backers will
produce let the Onyx inspire your
creativity with the confidence that you
need create without compromise and back
us today
recent exclusive news has shown that
there is no much barrier to stop private
conversation being bugged
just eating little efforts and
techniques all your privacy will be
exposed to the criminal intention spine
equipment are widely and easily
accessible online data flow spine by
criminal or government is virtually
impossible to prevent the out phone
encrypted earbuds are the first truly
secure and private earbuds for the
smartphone without any compromises your
phone callings and audio messages sent
via text are end-to-end encrypted it
doesn't have interference with mobile
carriers and service provider your
privacy will be assured without phone
encrypted earbuds all your callings are
secured and well protected from the
secret surveillance program the password
used to encrypt telephone calls is a
one-time password encryption key that is
automatically generated by a digital
encryption algorithm in the group
encryption key it destroys - out phone
earbuds by themselves and will not be
stored or recorded by anyone including
yourself in addition to digital
encryption algorithms our phone's
built-in encryption chip will provide
even better security it makes sure your
personal information will not be leaked
out via iMessage whatsapp and major
voice messaging applications the
encrypted message only can be decrypted
by the outbound encrypted earbud without
having to install any encryption add-ons
our phone has two security chips one for
microphone signal encryption and one for
headphone decryption audio encryption
and decryption are achieved by
stimulating the dynamic frequency shift
in the audio signal just by pressing the
encryption button on the earbuds during
a phone call to distort the audio with
background noise out phone encrypted ear
buds
offer uncompromised sound quality with
high five who stick design for clear
phone callings and voice messages the
snug and hanging design offer the most
ergonomic wearing comfort that comes
with no additional pressure to the conch
and ear canal areas the durable outer
shell can effectively avoid the sound
laid out hone is a simple and secure
communicating solution protects you from
secret surveillance in any time at
anywhere if you won't settle for
anything but the best out phone would be
the best for you to wear plug and talk
just that secure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
