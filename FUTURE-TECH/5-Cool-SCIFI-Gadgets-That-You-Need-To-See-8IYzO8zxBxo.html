everything it's amazing it's amazing how
I hear the sound through through yeah so
funny
hello Otto somebody movie yeah oh wow
cool crazy
yeah
you
you
you
you
our world has an ever-increasing thirst
for energy our machines vehicles and
factories all demanded yet most of the
energy we use is wasted over 30 trillion
watt hours of heat per year are wasted
by power plants alone enough to power
the entire world and our environment is
part of the collateral damage over 15
billion batteries are thrown away in
landfills every year at matrix we wanted
to create technology that makes the way
we use energy more efficient and more
intimate we wanted to start with a
problem everyone has experienced
firsthand feeling frustrated when your
electronic device runs out of power when
you need it the most
there hasn't been any innovation to
solve this problem and that God is
excited to solve it using our thermal
electric technology after five years and
several prototypes we're introducing our
first product the matrix power launch
it's a SmartWatch that's powered by you
it works by converting your own body
heat to electric power and the best part
is you never have to charge it the lock
comes alive because it's powered by you
the human body at rest and it's 100
watts I've seen similar to that of an
incandescent light bulb when exercising
that number jumps to one kilowatt
similar to the average power we use in a
home
what's so cool about this watch is that
as you exercise and your skin gets
warmer the power watts generates more
power it's got a unique power meter that
shows how much elecricity your body has
generated right on the face of the wall
we can do some exciting things with this
technology like accurately measure the
amount of calories you burn our
thermoelectric technology measures the
amount of heat you've generated from the
calories you consume it's also packed
with all the features you expect in a
SmartWatch it has sensors to track
growth activity and sleep quality we're
designing changeable watch faces to suit
your mood
we also build micro applications so you
can do more than just tell the time and
of course it thinks with your phone and
your account in the cloud arguing to
running mountaineering trailblazing it
works even better when you're out and
about especially in cold weather things
you never have to charge it or replace
the batteries it's very well sealed and
water-resistant to 50 meters and if you
ever take it off they'll go to sleep and
store all your data when you put it back
on it comes back to life we've done most
of the hard work you have a few thousand
prototypes and a ton of data but we know
it works the power watch has been vetted
and certified by arrow electronics we
brought on Andrea Ponte a world-class
SmartWatch designer our engineering and
manufacturing was headed up by Larry
side from Hong Kong who has helped
numerous wearable companies like Fitbit
50 millions of units
and to ensure it all comes together
we've brought on bow things as our
manufacturing director he has over 20
years of manufacturing experience
bringing products to market now we're
ready to go to market and we're so close
to the finish line your funds will go
towards the final production tooling can
manufacture of the powerwall
join our campaign today so that we can
get the slogs from your hangar
we'd be thrilled to have you on this
journey so that we can harness the
world's wasted
you
population aging truly is the megatrend
of our time no other forces likely to
shape the health of our economy is the
irreversible rate at which the world
population is aging as we age sometimes
simple things can become difficult as we
think about new challenges one can lose
confidence in your ability to be able to
live independently the fundamental
desire that we see in our community is
the need to stay independent as possible
as well as possible and aged as
respectfully as possible the pilot is an
opportunity for us to deploy the Smart
Watch in a setting where seniors are
residing and allowing them to be able to
better control their home environment
with each one of our users they get
Samsung gear s2 as well as a smart
things for homes system so we bring
those to their home combine them using
our software platform so that they can
control the devices on a daily basis so
sensors lights blocks to be able to be
controlled just using hand gestures that
are very simply need to alert and on top
of that they're able to communicate with
their care providers in the morning or
in times of needs but also be monitored
on a daily basis in real-time to
determine what their well-being is I
think it will really help us and keep
people in their places they're living
now and we all want to stay where we are
living now I believe the technology turn
your bedroom light off and on you can
turn the outside lights on and off for
security purposes lock or unlock the
front door turn your temperature up and
down at first without having to get up
and go over and doing it I can see where
it's so useful that it's a beyond
imagination
Smart Watch itself has an ability to
send out a predefined text message on an
SOS whereby your family your friends
maybe even your caregivers get that
alert that says hey I'm in trouble I
don't worry as much about Bill because
of something with Haffner and she's got
this watch on and she'll be able to
contact people much of the care that's
provided can only be done by humans but
at the same time technology can be
helpful in terms of monitoring
connecting patients with doctors
connecting older adults with their loved
ones to ensure that they're well taken
care of and they're staying active and
independent home connectivity needs the
connectedness which then ultimately
leads to greater engagement with one's
health the feeling of security belonging
which will ultimately the better
outcomes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
