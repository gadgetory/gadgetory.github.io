hi my name is Eric I'm a passionate kite
surfer engineer and the CEO of Revell
the Revell Arc is the world's smartest
4k action camera so white is our cameras
so smart well we've built in four
different sensors into this camera that
measure elevation rotation speed
magnetic north as well as other motion
to limit trees
we use it for electronic image
stabilization which takes out all the
bumps and jitters from your video but
beyond that we've built in a secondary
stabilization system which has a motor
built into the back of the camera which
keeps it always level to the horizon no
matter what you're doing including if
you mount the camera on a hubcap of back
think of it as a gimbal a camera and
more combined into one compact camera
which is waterproof and you can mount
anywhere you're not gonna mount this
anywhere this means you can kite loop
barrel roll and even backflip while the
rebel art keeps your footage stable and
level to the horizon this has never been
possible before with any other camera or
a gimbal system so what else do we do
with all this information we capture all
kinds of live data including how fast
you were going
how much airtime you got even how many
g-forces you pulled on top of all that
you can connect external sensors like a
heart rate monitor to measure your
excitement when things get a little
crazy
the final piece of the puzzle is our
sensory AI which analyzes the data
associated with your footage and makes
intelligent decisions it then determines
your most exciting moments and
automatically creates a shareable video
without hours of physical editing or
even a computer at revel we believe that
life was made for adventuring not
editing we want to make it as easy as
possible for you to shoot edit and share
your best moments instantly we can't
wait to see what you will be able to
create with the Revel art thank you
you
