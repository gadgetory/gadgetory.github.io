hi I'm Shawn and I'm Ryan we've had tons
of amazing feedback for our backers and
over the past year we've been working on
new ways to improve the effectiveness of
our lobster material and with the
addition of the newly developed hybrid
lock stone we've done just that
kickstart is a perfect place to try out
our new concepts and develop the ideas
with thousands of like-minded
individuals nightfall is one of those
special projects that was born from this
amazing worldwide collaboration that's
only possible thanks to the Kickstarter
community the nightfall range is almost
complete but with your help we need to
raise just one thousand pounds to go
towards tooling and castings for related
designs so far we've had six successful
campaigns on Kickstarter and we pride
ourselves on delivering on time for
every single one of those projects
however we couldn't do what we love
without your support every single pledge
goes towards crafting our unique and
build products so please help realize
our latest project together we can bring
nightfall to life thanks for watching
just own a nutshell what is this all
about
so what's special about it yeah
everything look at it it's gorgeous
how do you use it first time you open it
well how do you have you turn it on and
get the music oh so simple to connect
you just literally twist it it's the
only moving function on the actual
device
twist it select whether you want line in
or bluetooth pairing up to your phone
and then you're going to get exploring
you'll find the best surface that you
want for you the best surface for the
type of music you're listening to if you
place it on the back of a window and
you'll hear sound through both sides
bigger the surface you're placing it on
as well the bigger the sound you're
going to recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
going to take home and put on the side
and think it sounds great
you've got to show people so the other
feature we've got that's inside there as
well that I think it's really quite neat
so if you're in a space like this you
could place two speakers either side
you've got the stereo sound coming out
of it makes it amazing
we've done things really differently I
think for this campaign we want people
