easily notice creations that are crafted
with precision and perfection their
design connects intimately with our
feelings and body contour thus catering
for our desire and behavior among these
creations many are technological
innovations to our regret some of these
creations are fading out
one of them is MagSafe after
considerable time and effort in research
and development we resolved to resurrect
MagSafe a genius design by Steve Jobs
but we don't stop there we adapt
magazine to the functionality of modern
gadgets
making it the only design on the market
that encapsulates three technologies
MagSafe USBC
and Thunderbolt 3
this means with only one connector and
one port it can provide superfast data
transfer and high resolution video
happens italy captures the comfort
brought by magazine at the same time
retaining the benefits of USBC and
Thunderbolt 3 for all your USB C devices
also on the team is a renowned
manufacturer whose expertise was
recognized in many other successful
Kickstarter projects such as pebble time
and Dropcam they help us ensure quality
and feasibility so why do we call
ourselves magazine maxi stands for magic
continues it is our aspiration to bring
back the magic of Steve Jobs
and to continue his dedication in
empathetic and human focused designs we
hope to take our next step with you
support us in breathing new life in
MagSafe claim your discounted price by
clicking back this project make your
pledge now and we will see you on the
other side
with the iPhone 7 the headphone jack
became a thing of the past but what
happened to your old headphone will you
throw them out to keep with the time
club is the affordable solution to make
your wired connections wireless whether
headphone for home and car stereo make a
wireless connection to the latest
smartphone technology use your headphone
exactly the same length Club is
compatible with all existing button
controls such as volume take calls and
more equipped with maybe TX yes our chip
club offers clear CD quality sound and
five hours continuous battery just
enough for your daily routine carry plug
in your pocket where does the neck man
or clip it as needed Club in go wireless
with slot
hi I'm David and I'm Thomas we're two
product designers from the north of
England and the creative leader
sketching and visualizing is critical to
our everyday lives which is why we find
the iPad pro with Apple pencil to be
such amazing products using the Apple
pencil on the go is where we encountered
a furnace problem in the beginning we
made do with carrying the pencil and its
accessories loose in a backpack what was
missing was one secure place for
everything the second issue we faced was
the sketching position owning the smart
Keyboard means you can have the tablet
flat at your desk or almost completely
upright what was needed was that truly
comfortable low angle we knew that both
of these problems could be solved with
one simple product say hello to Lena an
iPad pro and Apple pencil companion
through months of design prototyping and
testing with Aranda what we feel is a
complete solution Nina
apps are the protective case for the
Apple pencil holding the lightning
adapter and up to four spare nibs using
the pencil itself the nibs are removed
with ease when the lid slides back into
transforms into a stomach for the iPad
pro holding the tablet at a comfortable
10 degree angle for creating your
artwork and contact Nina is made from
only four components the hard shells are
made from an engineering polymer
ensuring a high-quality scratch
resistant case the top and base are made
from a soft touch polymer grip from the
iPod to the care so that exact code to
the desk this creates a secure worth
it's not on all of this and Mina is
still only 22 millimeters high her
compact size fits easily into any bug
that is perfect for on the go Nina has
been brought to life using our skills
from designers but now we need your help
to make her reality your pledges will
tear Petula from the first production
run to bring Nina t'market
waste when gulped by mass production
accelerating consumption and rampant
materialism products are designed to
become obsolete then discarded for the
next big thing for the policing of
natural resources at astonishing rates
or public polluters and trash into their
value
developments and sustainability are
promising but they're not happening fast
enough and the solutions are still too
expensive and inaccessible what if we
can make a machines last longer run more
efficiently and self-improve instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we see today
what if we had solution here and now
that's our mission at try vertex we're
tackling the problem of waste by
creating the first of its kind
nanoparticles that actually repair
machines or increasing performance and
efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came up with a small
solution to this big problem turbotech
nanoparticles has two faces one designs
are one less like the sticky side
reinforces and strengthens or the
slippery side reduces friction just like
carbon selling to diamonds in the mantle
of the earth TurboTax self-aligned to a
diamond like lattice structure under the
heat and pressure the engine unlike
other protective coatings this process
actually reverses engine wear particle
by particle restores it to a path of a
new condition for initial focus was to
make lubricants papers come on mania
nanomaterials we worked on one unique
outlier reduced friction dramatically
down to super lubricity level with the
help of national labs and research
agencies we understood the mechanism and
developed proprietary production process
after years of research and rigorous
testing to a proud to introduce
car boss a safe and green additive for
your car by improves gas mileage boost
horsepower and extend the life of your
engine car boss comes in a small
recyclable applicator that you inject
into the oil fill of your car
as you drive turbotech nanoparticles are
forged into a diamond like armor around
engine components rejuvenating our daily
driver to become more efficient than
when it was new
a third of the gas that you put in your
car is wasted on engine fiction with 612
million cars on the road that waste adds
up running on car boss will use less
fuel reduce pollution and leave a
smaller carbon footprint we're ready to
go to market and we need your help back
our Kickstarter and be the first to
adopt a revolutionary technology will
make our world more efficient more
powerful and more sustainable car bombs
by tribo tanks
my name is Carl English and I'm the
founder of forged illumination I've been
working on prototypes for a few months
now
and I'm really excited to present to you
remove I matched Damascus steel ring
with a glowing inner band
I've always been in love with Damascus
steel and I know many others like myself
who love the idea of a Damascus ring
I've never considered a practical choice
when it comes to affordability after
working with a local forge of working
with a material myself I've developed an
efficient method of producing Damascus
steel rings at scale these rings
normally retail for upwards of $1000
this is where you come in I need your
help to garner the raw materials and
tools needed to really produce these
rings at scale check out the rewards
below and pledge whatever you can thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
