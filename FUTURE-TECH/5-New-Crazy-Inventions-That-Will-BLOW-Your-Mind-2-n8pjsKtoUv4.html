here's how to order
you
this is the cue ball it's a hard rubber
reaction ball with a moderately erratic
bounce that means if I bounce it to
waist height it'll deflect up to 18
inches horizontally forces me to watch
and react to each and every bounce but
it's not too erratic I don't have to
chase it all over the room so I can
bounce the ball really quickly faster I
go the more challenging it is but it
also keeps me at the best of my ability
and keeps my brain fully focused my mind
wanders I'm going to drop this ball
there are two core elements or exercises
to be done using the cue ball the first
is called bouncing catch you take one or
two cue balls and you bounce them to
waist height alternating hands as you go
you try to go as fast as you can you
count how many bounces you can do in 60
seconds to keep track of how you're
progressing it trains I hand
coordination vision and reaction time
the faster the better the next exercise
trains peripheral vision if you think
about it the center of our vision the
one we use to read with is really quite
small everything else is peripheral
vision so we can train that we expand
our visual awareness there's very little
on the market that will do that but the
cue ball does it really fast and
efficiently and that this is how it
works you do the same exercise again but
this time instead of watching the balls
as you bounce them you fix your focus on
a point on the ground and you bounce the
cue balls around that fix point they're
erratic and they're bouncing and they're
small you have to track it with your
peripheral vision and catch it with your
hands you know increase your confidence
and the ability to do that and as you do
it faster and more your brain will
automate that skill so you don't have to
think about it anymore you will just
react and you'll react quickly the cue
ball adapts to any one skill level you
can go slow or you can go fast it'll
work with children as young as five
years old
all the way to the elderly it'll make
driving your car a better experience
you'll be able to see more of what's
going on around you if you're an athlete
you'll be able to see hit and catch
better if you're a student or an adult
you'll just simply get better at eye
hand coordination you'll see better and
your reaction times will become much
faster by some cue balls and try these
exercises you'll be amazed at the
results follow me on Facebook follow me
on Twitter there's lots more information
