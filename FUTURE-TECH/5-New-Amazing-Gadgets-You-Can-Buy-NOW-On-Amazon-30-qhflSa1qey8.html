what if it was simple to use a regular
pen and paper notebook while saving
everything in the cloud perfectly
organized the way you want and what if
after you saved your notes in the cloud
and filled your paper notebook you could
just erase it with the push of a button
and use it again that's not magic
that's the rocket book ways notebook
with the wave notebook and the rocket
book app you instantly blast your notes
into the cloud using your mobile device
in a fraction of a second rocket book
machine vision scans enhances and send
each page to the specific destination
they belong on the cloud services you
already use each wave notebook page has
seven symbols set up the rocket book app
to assign each symbol to a location
within Dropbox Google Docs Evernote
OneNote or simply to your email inbox
let's see how Jake has his set up he
marked the diamond symbol and the rocket
book app sends the notes to his customer
meetings notes in Evernote when he's
brainstorming he marks the star symbol
which he decided are for the notes to
belong in his ideas folder in Google
Docs now that your notes are in the
cloud when your notebook is filled
there's no need to go buy another book
or let use notebooks clutter your life
here's how you can reuse your wave
notebook multiple times with the mere

friction pilot pens available in many
office supply stores and Amazon com
friction pilot Hank turns clear under
heat and the wave notebook is specially
designed to be microwave safe that means
you can clear your entire wave notebook
in your microwave in the same amount of
time
it takes to make a cup of tea when our
specially designed thermal logo on the
cover turns from blue to white your wave
notebook has been cleared and is ready
to be reused and with your notes in the
cloud an empty notebook has endless
possibilities
the utility of the cloud and the joy of
pen and paper
that's rocket books
hey everyone we are mocha can last year
we came to you with an idea of the
smallest 4k camera your incredible
support brought mocha cam to life to
create a better mocha cam we've
responded to thousands of comments and
have enjoyed all the photos and videos
that you shared online the improvement
ideas and our experience in a mocha cam
- mocha 360 has prepared us for this
moment introducing alpha and alpha X the
first wearable camera that provides a
shutter wheel to control the shutter
speed allows you to set it up to 1 mm of
a second or 32 seconds freely if you
haven't heard of mocha cam it's the
world's smallest 4k camera the rotatable
screen module allows you to find the
best filming angles and double the
battery life the spare battery that
simply snaps down magnetically can
extend your battery life to 4 hours for
video filming now alpha brings more
surprises here's how we made it even
better
mocha can alpha s has an umbrella Image
Processor
and provides 4k 30 frames per second or
1080p 120 frames per second video
features it means you can get 150 speed
Full HD
slow motion video sames GoPro Hero 5 get
the 1 point 5 5 micrometers Sony image
sensor the low-light performance has
been significantly improved in addition
to Wi-Fi alpha provides Bluetooth
connection which is more stable and
consumes less power they can turn your
phone into a Bluetooth promote and get
GPS information for geo-tagging or show
the trajectory
with the built-in g-sensor alpha can get
better image stabilization on video
recording alpha has dual status players
so even if there's no screen module it
can show the camera status clearly the
dual mics which can provide stereo
recording capabilities alpha uses a type
C port to connect to Cameron's screen
the micro HDMI port provides a new
preview and playback mode now it's the
totally new feature and most important
part this shutter wheel with the new
design buttons in manual mode you can
turn the shutter wheel to set the
shutter speed freely up to 1 mm of a
second or 32 seconds in other words you
can now use mobile cam shooting long
exposure night things or even the Stars
but more after applying all these great
features alpha is 20% smaller than the
previous generation and 35 percent
smaller than GoPro Bureau 5 we're also
able to offer two options this time
alpha and alpha s alpha uses the same
image processor Tomoka can the framerate
is similar to gopro hero forge and
provides all the other features of alpha
s
the please order a mocha Pam today and
share it with your friends help us to
make it hurry up
