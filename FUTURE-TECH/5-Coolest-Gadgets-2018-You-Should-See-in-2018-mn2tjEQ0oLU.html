liked this video pledge on the right and
share it with your friends
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bottom one has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and details to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via
our app on PC or smartphone with a force
sensitive 3d mouse you can control do
bot m1 as precisely as you want no more
trying and guessing on a confusing
software with its hand whole teaching
feature you can input coordinates in the
fastest and most intuitive way do bottom
one is programmable via the integrated
api's you can use official or self-built
developing environment or use this
visualized programming interface making
things a lot easier but we don't stop
here do bot m1 is highly extendable
there are no limits to your imagination
on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger when it can actually go
further or use a camera for visual with
it's fast and accurate image recognizing
algorithm it can distinguish colors
without making one mistake do bottom one
loves companions they can work
seamlessly together processing paperwork
way faster than humans could ultimately
do bottom one is built to replace
manpower and production line working day
and night non-stop the built-in mapping
and path planning system provides this
excellent mobility providing inventory
management service in your warehouse to
be able to create so much value to
bottom one has been built with
extraordinary performance the perfect
calibration of the high performance DC
servomotor
harmonic reducer and kinematic algorithm
has brought out the best of both
strength and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters
maximum payload of up to 1.5 kilograms
angular speed of up to 200 degrees per
second it's also a steady player never
slips up
everyone loves creating things and
having a robotic arm is awesome with do
bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
robotic arms everyone can now benefit
from a cost-effective user-friendly
robotic arm technology so when a new
idea hits you do bot m1 will be ready
all you have to do is say yes
your pocket is one of the most
revolutionary cameras ever made but how
do you turn amateur footage into a
cinematic masterpiece
the answer is movement introducing
emotion it's a fully automatic slider
that lets you do Hollywood style camera
moves at the push of a button it has
custom modes for any situation and it
works with all smartphones GoPros and
mirrorless cameras it comes with 15 inch
rails that can be extended to double the
size yet it easily breaks down to fit in
your bag using an integrated panning
mechanism it automatically creates a
parallax movement as it slides it's
great for products on interviews or
anytime you want a cinematic look
reverse the camera and the parallax
becomes a panning slide giving you a 36
degree wider viewing angle than regular
sliders for vloggers in motion lets you
forget about the camera and focus on
your content using our motion tracking
algorithms face following intelligently
keeps you in frame as you move around
and with the live streaming inside the
app building a following is easier than
ever before for photographers in motion
lets you create motion time lapses right
on your phone just customize your
settings in the app and hit start
the motion unit can also be removed for
flawless panoramic shots or panning
time-lapses for night shots time lapses
capture more light and maximize your
video quality after the shoot select one
of the many presets
then via cloud computing your files will
be color graded automatically for action
sports there's motion trigger using two
Bluetooth sensors you can set up a
trigger for subjects that are up to 30
feet away when activated in motion can
start recording immediately or give you
some lead time for a smoother transition
in motion was built five filmmakers for
filmmakers you can build a full rig
thanks to its three-quarter inch
mounting points and it even has a
built-in USB fast charging port in the
app you have full control of the camera
and slider to create the exact look you
want from a slow track that reveals a
key plot detail to slow cushions for
dramatic effect in motion gives you a
cinematic shot every time hiking
standard I am so Alec and my team and I
need your support to bring in motion to
the market we're a diverse team with
backgrounds in software engineering
mechanical design and manufacturing but
what unites all is a huge passion for
photography with in motion everyone will
be able to create hollywood-style shots
just with their smartphone so please
back our campaign today and help us
bring this dream to reality
wait scam is placed in our intimate
living space however it gets in our way
sometimes
so we usually place it in unnoticeable
place even if it has pretty design and

kids Heights but this may cause
uncomfortable unsaved problems you may
also deteriorate design of they're
pretty homes even so you can't possibly
put hospital equipment in your home grow
track is a stand and display time
bringing IOT body measurement device
it measures height and weight it also
provides data management and growth
management solutions it is a very smart
IOT product
how about managing your weight with grow
check it uses its app services connected
to smartphones and
to conveniently manage measure date and
share them with your trainers and
friends
plus it lets you easily measure height
of your lovely kid
he uses its laser sensors and height
measuring bar to get precise
measurements
it compares my kids with their own aged
friends to display their growth status
in percentage it periodically analyzes
the date to provide solutions on any
abnormality check grow check apps and
care more about your kids growth
