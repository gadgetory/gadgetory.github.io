robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bottom one has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and details to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated

board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via
our app on PC or smartphone with a force
sensitive 3d mouse you can control do
bot m1 as precisely as you want no more
trying and guessing on a confusing
software with its hand whole teaching
feature you can input coordinates in the
fastest and most intuitive way do bottom
one is programmable via the integrated
api's you can use official or self-built
developing environment or use this
visualized programming interface making
things a lot easier but we don't stop
here do bot m1 is highly extendable
there are no limits to your imagination
on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger when it can actually go
further or use a camera for visual with
it's fast and accurate image recognizing
algorithm it can distinguish colors
without making one mistake do bottom one
loves companions they can work
seamlessly together processing paperwork
way faster than humans could ultimately
do bottom one is built to replace
manpower and production line working day
and night non-stop the built-in mapping
and path planning system provides this
excellent mobility providing inventory
management service in your warehouse to
be able to create so much value to
bottom one has been built with
extraordinary performance the perfect
calibration of the high performance DC
servomotor
harmonic reducer and kinematic algorithm
has brought out the best of both
strength and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters
maximum payload of up to 1.5 kilograms
angular speed of up to 200 degrees per
second it's also a steady player never
slips up
everyone loves creating things and
having a robotic arm is awesome with do
bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
robotic arms everyone can now benefit
from a cost-effective user-friendly
robotic arm technology so when a new
idea hits you do bot m1 will be ready
all you have to do is say yes
your pocket is one of the most
revolutionary cameras ever made but how
do you turn amateur footage into a
cinematic masterpiece
the answer is movement introducing

size yet it easily breaks down to fit in
your bag using an integrated panning
mechanism it automatically creates a
parallax movement as it slides it's
great for products on interviews or
anytime you want a cinematic look

photography with in motion everyone will
be able to create hollywood-style shots
just with their smartphone so please
back our campaign today and help us
bring this dream to reality
wait scam is placed in our intimate
living space however it gets in our way
sometimes
