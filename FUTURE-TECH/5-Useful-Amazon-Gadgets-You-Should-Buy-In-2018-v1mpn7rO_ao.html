and behind me we've got one of our
travel displays it's one of the displays
we had out at SHOT Show this year as
well as the great American outdoor show
in Pennsylvania you already know we've
got some of the fastest access firearm
storage on the market I'm gonna prove
that point right now with our magnetic
keys one on each side we've got access
to our table or in here go ahead and
close it up
locks it right back up that's our 12 42
we've been doing that now for about a
year very fast access but what we're
really excited about is a new product
for this year it's our RFID model so
initially it's going to be on the 8:25
8:12 the 1420 and the 1450 product line
and it works just like this you take
your RFID key place it right up top and
the shelf opens right up now like I said
this is our display we've had this thing
to shot show we've had it out to the
great American outdoors show and we have
literally opened and closed this
particular 8 25 thousands and thousands
of times some of the additional features
of the RFID system is that you're able
to actually program multiple products to
the same key card and you're also able
to program multiple key cards to one
product so if you wanted to be able to
give out keys to two or three different
people to have access to your home
defense weapons you're able to do that
or if you want to be able to unlock four
different products in four different
parts of your home you're able to do
that as well so that's one of the really
neat things about the rfid technology
another thing is you can see it this
form is a key card you could put it in
your wallet you can carry around with
you everywhere you go
or in the case of this book we have one
just stow it away right inside that lets
you open it right up something that's
real close by right on the shelf now you
can hear it's actually chiming if you
leave your product open for too long it
will let you know that you've left it
unlocked it's a safety feature it's also
able to be disengaged and you can turn
that off
that's our new RFID 825 come check out
these awesome products and the rest of
our line at tactical walls comm take
care and God bless
I love my Clifford I love my good foot
the Mavic pro is not just a new drone
it's a whole new type of drone we merged
power and smart features making it easy
for everyone to fly and create beautiful
images the toughest challenge for us was
to find the sweet spots between form and
function when engineering the folding
arms we wanted to save as much space as
possible we really wanted to make it
quick to unfold and leave enough room
for the powerful processors and system
system this took several attempts and
many many prototypes
in one of our earlier prototypes arms
took up way too much space when folded
almost two-thirds of the entire volume
combined with the space that we needed
for the internals
this meant the Mavic was much larger
than we wanted and another attempt the
Amazonia took up half the volume but
there's a lot of wasted space in between
body and arms eventually we solved this
problem and creates an easy flick to
unfold mechanism seem from above the
Phenom sit flush against the body when
folded we carved out two indents at the
rear of the airframe to fit the motors
saving additional space the rear arms
fold out in a three-dimensional motion
and snap in a place in one sweep with
this design you can have your maverick
Pro unfolded in under five seconds
powerful components generate a lot of
heat especially when they're placed
close together so for the first time
ever on a DJI drone we integrated a heat
sink at the base made from magnesium
aluminum alloy and a centrifugal fan
behind the gimbal
the fan pulls in air from the front of
the aircraft and channels it across the
heatsink anticipating heat we wouldn't
go through all this trouble without
making sure you have a great camera we
spent thousands of hours trying to
reengineering shrink the stabilization
technology found in our phantom series
one of the major challenges we ran into
when making a stabilized camera this
small was a stiffness of the electrical
wires the mechanics the structure and
the brushless motors had to be
specifically engineered to take this
into account plus it's the first DJ
camera that's able to rotate 90 degrees
for portrait shots we also wanted a
remote controller for the maverick pro
that would feel natural and familiar in
people's hands so they would be more
confident when they fly that's how we
came up with a small controller that
expands with a pair of grips these grips
also clamp your phone keeping all of
your controls in easy reach the Maverick
pro concentrates some of our most
advanced technologies into one compact
body it's an incredible tool to turn
everyday moments into fantastic art
wherever you go
there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product it would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution bring in the gym to you the
platform is strong the posts are spaced
evenly apart on both sides so you can
simulate any exercise movement and
quickly adjust difficulty the base is
made wide enough to stand comfortably
during your workout and we even added a
layer of non-slip material to assure you
stay in place the bands were customized
for this concept and can handle any
height
there's even cloth in the bands to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
slide providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
uppers
we added accessories to simulate even
more solutions such as handles that will
add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor can
increase the workout the body boss is
lightweight made of high-grade injection
molding and capable of handling hundreds
of pounds of force the underside has
non-slip feet for safe use on any
surface the adjustable posts make for
easy storage starting from day one you
can choose your color green pink you can
choose your package and choose how you
want to follow workouts live replay
program all on your own but by backing
this IndieGoGo today you can get it for
a fraction of that price empowering
people just like you to reach their
goals body boss bringing the gym to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
