using a tape measure just got easier
with the introduction of the e tape 16
it solves a problem virtually everyone
has measuring mistakes and it's actually
educational and fun to use the e tape 16
takes the human error out of measuring
by giving you an accurate digital
measurement every time with the ability
to recall your measurements at any time
as you lengthen the tape measure blade
you immediately see ye tape 16 is
different and not your ordinary tape
measure it takes the guesswork out of
measuring with the large digital display
one can see and read the measurement
clearly with the touch of the inch
centimeter button it allows you to read
the measurement displayed in inches feet
fractions decimals and even converts
from standard to metric and back not
only does it measure easily and
accurately but it has several other
useful functions when taking a
measurement you can use the standard
blade lock or use the digital hold
button the large display makes your
measurement easy to use and easy to
remember and recall with a touch of a
button the inside-outside function
allows you to measure to the front of
the tape measure or to the back and
calculates the extra width
no more needing to bend your blade when
backed into a corner when you need to
hang a picture or find the center of a
measurement press this centerline button
and it will calculate it for you
whenever someone sees the e tape digital
tape measure for the first time their
initial reactions are that is cool it
makes total sense and I want one thus
the digital tape measure was born since
its origin the e tape is proven useful
in a multitude of settings the e tape 16
is a unique and durable tool that
provides data in a more simple reliable
and accurate way for any job whether at
home or work the rugged and durable
Etape 16 digital tape measure will
ensure your measurements are accurate
every time here's to measuring once and
cutting once until next time
we have many goals in life from managing
stress to increasing fitness we want to
be healthier and perform better we work
hard and track progress because we know
that we can best improve that which we
measure but in order to make real
progress on all of these goals we need
to more deeply understand the true state
of our body and mind hi I'm Jason Moore
health coach and founder of the top
rated elite HR via and I'm excited to
introduce the courses the course sense
measures heart rate variability also
called HR v HR V is a deeper and more
comprehensive biomarker than something
like steps or heart rate it's kind of
like the check engine light for your
entire body in mind heart rate
variability examines the tiny
imperceptible changes and patterns
between heartbeats our advanced
algorithms analyze these precise times
between heartbeats and detects activity
from the nervous system which actually
controls processes like energy
regulation digestion mood and the
response to stress the course sent slips
directly onto a finger and connects via
bluetooth with any heart rate
variability app so you can capture an
HIV measurement in as little as 2 5
minutes each day that could be first
thing in the morning while waiting for
your morning coffee or even for live
biofeedback during much needed
meditation with this simple daily
check-in the elite HRV app guides you in
optimizing your nutrition training
recovery sleep stress and more heart
rate variability plays a key role in
tracking the progress of my patients
today they come into my facility to get
their HRV readings but because core
sense is so easy to use my patients can
now track their HRV at home this will
help me to regularly check their
progress adjust the treatment plan and
speed up their journey to better health
and well-being with core sense an HRV
our mission has been to help people
tackle their goals whatever they may be
and improve their lives but without the
discomfort and inconvenience of chest
straps and adhesives over the years we
heard from so many of our hundred
thousand-plus app users that's why we
partnered with experts and innovate
and sensor technology to come up with
the course sense from the ground up it
has a rechargeable battery that can go
up to six months on a single charge it
has a flexible design that will
comfortably fit fingers of all sizes and
shapes the core sense doesn't come with
any buttons it is intelligent and will
automatically power on when you insert
your finger then it'll detect your pulse
and connect to the HIV app accuracy and
sensitivity are really important to us
you really need accuracy in order to
measure valid and useful HIV that's why
we designed the course ins with medical
grade sensors that are comparable to a
five lead ECG it has built in an
advanced signal algorithm to help detect
arrhythmia the topic heartbeats and even
false beats attributed to signal noise
you take a two minute HIV reading in the
morning and instantly see your results
which we call our morning readiness
gauge the gauge gives you a green yellow
or red indicator of how able you are to
handle stress on any given day you can
also tag your reading with things like
alcohol consumption your mood exercise
or sleep to gain a deeper understanding
of those items that most impact you as
you make changes in your lifestyle or in
your exercise plan after years of
research development prototyping and
rigorous testing we're ready to bring
Corson's to you the Kickstarter
community we simply need the initial
capital to complete tooling and start
full-scale manufacturing support our
Kickstarter to receive your own corsets
and in just two minutes a day start
making vastly better decisions for your
health performance stress and resilience
Thank You Kickstarter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
