Nana leaf is saying let there be light
at CES 2018 specifically color changing
LED light panels that you'll put up all
over your walls now these are the second
wall panels that nana leaf is done
they've done triangular Aurora light
panels or just called nano leaf light
panels now these are the new kind of
second gen versions they add in touch
controls that you can touch the panels
and see a ripple effect across them or
adjust the brightness or turn them on
and off you can also been in great them
with Alexa and Siri and the Google
assistant just like you could before and
you can control up to a thousand panels
on a single base station before it was
just 30 that's a big improvement the
idea is to scale this all over people's
walls all over nightclub walls all sorts
of imaginable setups they sync to music
they can do things with pift
they can do all sorts of cool smart home
integrations with sunrise and sunset
effects and natalie distressing that
these new square panels are very much in
the early stages they're still
prototypes still working out the kinks
figuring out exactly how the final
product is going to look they're not
going to have these crosses you can kind
of see on each panel they're still
finalizing the design and figuring out
how to diffuse the light evenly across
the panel so it might look a little
different at launch later this year also
new at CES we've got the Natalie for
moat
and this is going to be a $50 remote
control for the nano leaf panels you can
get this spring you just rotate the side
of this 12 sided dodecahedron shaped
remote to the top and whatever preset
you just signed to that side will come
alive on the panels that you've got
installed the interesting thing here is
that it's also an apple homekit gadget
we'll be keeping an eye on nano leaf has
the year rolls on and once the panels
are finalized and available well get
them up in the scene that smart home and
test them out for you so stay tuned
