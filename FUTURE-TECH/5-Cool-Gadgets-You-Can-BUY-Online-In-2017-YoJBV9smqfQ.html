so pure it's liberating everything in
between the lines is striking I'm free
but only and that's why I come back to
your voice it's almost like a rush when
I hear it
the connection is so clear a service
kind of scary I usually so close yet so
far away everything control a spoon
close and I feel alive and full of
passion sensations of bitter swings and
would it be crazy to call it magic
because it's like them they're there
with you that's when I realized never
actually alone
Oh
oh hello I'm Sean and this is charge
ranked the world's coolest pen
it's a stylus for your devices a screen
cleaner an external 16 gigabyte flash
memory drive and a power bank phone
charger with a built-in universal plug
to charge all iPhone and micro USB
devices including Android phones that's
right one charging tip for all your
devices have I been charging around all
these years yet yes you have and now
it's time for you to charge right
everyone needs extra battery for their
phones of bluetooth headphones and other
gadgets and if you're like me you
probably have multiple power banks that
all require different cables for
different devices a brand new
state-of-the-art universal smart phone
tip allows you to plug charge right into
any iPhone lightning port or any micro
USB device including Android phones and
all with the same Universal smart phone
tip with the same set yet with the same
tip no adaptors needed
no no adapters needed here's how it
works
to charge it just plug the mail you at
the end into any USB port and a flashing
blue light will indicate its project
once it's fully charged it will change
to solid loop to charge your phone just
plug the smart phone tip into your
device tank upside down for iPhone or
pen clip side up for Android phones and
you're set you can use your phone while
it's charging and proud right holds it's
full charge for over a month so charge
it anywhere and use it everywhere it's

choice right is available in two
versions the standard version includes a
ballpoint pen stylus screen cleaner and
a one thousand milliamp hour battery or
the charge right plus which includes all
the same features of the standard except
for a 650 milliamp hour battery and a 16
gigabyte flash memory drive built in our
designs are done and we produce the
first thousand units that are ready to
be shipped out now that's right all our
early bird backers who order the first
500 pieces of Star Trek and 500 pieces
correct us will get the order shipped
out immediately we've put our last
dollars and our heart and soul into
ensuring an amazing product and prompt
delivery to all our backers but we need
your support to reach our goal and to
help the world charge right this is John
he is an experienced motorcycle rider
john knows that safety is important
which is why he at least wears this and
this and of course this but what if you
could prevent an accent altogether
well that's Jane hi Jane and this is
break free
just like John she too is an experienced
rider and she's all about safety
she knows that being visible at all
times is the key it's a smart LED light
that does sophisticated things unlike
your motorcycle taillight break free is
at eye level so Falls drivers can finish
it'll grow brighter to alert drivers
around you when you're slowing down no
matter how breaking down shifting or
engine brake turn it on and it stays on
no need to connect it with wires or use
an app and that's what Jane and riders
really care about being seen to prevent
an accident in the first place whether
you're this this this or even this kind
of rider you'll still want this this
bridges the gap between safety and style
this is break free a smarter way to be
seen I've been writing for the past 10
years and I loved every second of it I
also have a wife and two beautiful
daughters
so my safety is always my top priority
shortly after I graduated college I got
the opportunity to apprentice under a
successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur
while working on one of his new ideas at
autonomous brake light cars I quickly
realized this is the perfect product for
motorcycle riders so break free we're
trying to use advanced manufacturing
techniques from companies like a DMV MOU
and bring those to the consumer market
to deliver a safety product that is like
no other one of the biggest hurdles for
the design process was trying to make
our unit fit on as many helmets as
possible and the way we did this is we
took as many houses we could get and we
3d scan the back of them and what we're
trying to get at is a shape that it's
going to work for as mayhem as possible
and also maximize the surface area of
the light because the surface area life
is obviously important and how much you
can see them products that have been on
the market already are all mounted takes
on a vehicle that works well and can
detect acceleration but as soon as the
the head of the rider starts moving a
lot of these devices give false readings
what's special about the break free
device is that we can detect
deceleration in the direction of travel
even though the head of the writer where
the light is mounted may move sideways
and tilt forward the end goal at break
free is to increase safety for riders we
do that in two ways first create a
device that people will want to wear and
the second make something that works one
of the most important aspects of our
safety is our visibility and it's also
one of those things that's most
neglected currently in the market
there's some high vis gear that's
neither in a helmet or a vest or in
pants and to me I mean it's definitely a
step in the right direction but they're
a static piece they're not going to
really get the attention they're not
going to really capture kind of a semi
glazed driver if you will what's nice
about this product is it illuminates and
flashes so it's something that is
dynamic it definitely can make a
difference between saving a life break
free is something that's really unique
never seen anything like it before cars
have a triangle of life these days
modern cars the two taillights the light
that's up in the back window
motorcyclists taillights are generally
small and they're designing them to look
even cooler and smaller and they become
even harder to see the brake tree brings
a light that is going to be noticeable
by drivers up into their basic field of
vision this is why briefly needs
exist BreakFree is bridging the gap
between style and safety I dedicated the
last two years of my life
get break free to where it is today and
this is where we need your help now we
need the toy to manufacture our first
large border we get break free into the
hands of riders everywhere thank you we
love Apple but we also feel limited in
its possibilities but now we give you
the freedom of full connectivity with
other devices instead of buying more and
more accessories you can do anything
simply with do box do box has multiple
ports to connect an internet cable flash
drives hard drives keyboard mouse
printers TVs monitors or speakers you
can use do box everywhere as affordable
Wi-Fi router to charge your iPhone or
iPad from USB connect flash drives or
hard drives to access your files
use a trackpad with your iPad use it as
a wireless external storage for your
files
supports audio and video streaming from
your device
play video games and presentations
through HDMI and there is one more thing
it can even charge your Apple watch do
box is the missing part that complements
your devices do it with do box if you
