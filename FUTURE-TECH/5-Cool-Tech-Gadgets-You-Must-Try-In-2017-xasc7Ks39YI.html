hey guys I just wanted to tell a little
bit about the story of gamer reality and
update on what's been going on so we
started off developing kinetic devices
for mobile apps and we developed
controllers for AR VR and we saw what
Pokemon go was doing and how it was
revolutionized in the gaming industry
and that's what we're all about
so we wanted to jump on board and take
advantage of that opportunity and seek
out a partnership with them and we got
our meeting with Nintendo and it was
awesome
and we're not done pursuing that and
we're going to very much so continue
going after that partnership and we're
so glad that you guys have all decided
to partner with us that if you've
already purchased a ball we're actually
going to throw in a gamer reality
viewing set for AR gaming and this is
also a product that we're going to be
releasing for sales as well in the
future and but just to say thank you if
you've already partnered with us we're
going to give you one for free and we're
actually going to open source our
developer kits now for free so if you're
a game developer and you are interested
in a RV our kinetic device gaming and
then you can actually build out a game
that will pair it to our device on our
open source API we believe that this is
going to revolutionize gaming and open
up a whole new realm of possibilities
for new games to be developed and
invented and the possibilities are
endless so we're so excited with what's
happening and if you are a game
developer then reach out to us message

an update if you're interested in
getting our developer kits so thank you
guys very much and we're excited about
where this is going this is only the
beginning thanks

your smartphone to instantly remind you
