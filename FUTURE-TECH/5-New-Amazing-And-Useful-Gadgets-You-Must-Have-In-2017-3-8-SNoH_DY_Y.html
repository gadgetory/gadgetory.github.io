radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's

guys had an air selfie with them they
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air awesome
what about the two explorers they select
the classic flying mode from the three
options available control air selfie
through the app by holding the phone
horizontally and take both memorable
photos and videos and what would have
happened at the barbecue enough with the
squeezing just select the selfie mode
use only two buttons to find the right
distance to shoot and take a great
picture
what about an indoor location whatever
it may be a party at somebody's house
for a night out in a club there are no
issues but their selfie flies easily
it's simple to control and very safe and
once you shoot a great picture don't
keep it to yourself
it's so easy to share it right from your
