we have many goals in life from managing
stress to increasing fitness we want to
be healthier and perform better we work
hard and track progress because we know
that we can best improve that which we
measure but in order to make real
progress on all of these goals we need
to more deeply understand the true state
of our body and mind hi I'm Jason Moore
health coach and founder of the top
rated elite HR via and I'm excited to
introduce the course since the core
sense measures heart rate variability
also called HR v HR V is a deeper and
more comprehensive biomarker than
something like steps or heart rate it's
kind of like the check engine light for
your entire body in mind heart rate
variability examines the tiny
imperceptible changes and patterns
between heartbeats our advanced
algorithms analyze these precise times
between heartbeats and detects activity
from the nervous system which actually
controls processes like energy
regulation digestion mood and the
response to stress the course scent
slips directly onto a finger and
connects via bluetooth with any heart
rate variability out so you can capture
an HIV measurement in as little as two
five minutes each day that could be
first thing in the morning while waiting
for your morning coffee or even for live
biofeedback during much-needed
meditation with this simple daily
check-in the elite HR V app guides you
in optimizing your nutrition training
recovery sleep stress and more heart
rate variability plays a key role in
tracking the progress of my patients
today they come into my facility to get
their HR V readings but because course
sense is so easy to use my patients can
now track their HR v at home this will
help me to regularly check their
progress adjust the treatment plan and
speed up their journey to better health
and well-being with course sense an HR
be our mission has been to help people
tackle their goals whatever they may be
and improve their lives but without the
discomfort and inconvenience of chest
straps and adhesives over the years we
heard from so many of our hundred
thousand-plus app users that's why we
partnered with expert
and innovators and sensor technology to
come up with the core sense from the
ground up it has a rechargeable battery
that can go up to six months on a single
charge it has a flexible design that
will comfortably fit fingers of all
sizes and shapes the core sense doesn't
come with any buttons it is intelligent
and will automatically power on when you
insert your finger then it will detect
your pulse and connect to the HIV app
accuracy and sensitivity are really
important to us you really need accuracy
in order to measure valid and useful HIV
that's why we designed the course ins
with medical grade sensors that are
comparable to a five lead ECG it has
built in an advanced signal algorithm to
help detect arrhythmia atopic heartbeats
and even false beats attributed to
signal noise you take a two minute HIV
reading in the morning and instantly see
your results which we call our morning
readiness gauge the gauge gives you a
green yellow or red indicator of how
able you are to handle stress on any
given day you can also tag your reading
with things like alcohol consumption
your mood exercise or sleep to gain a
deeper understanding of those items that
most impact you as you make changes in
your lifestyle or in your exercise plan
after years of research development
prototyping and rigorous testing we're
ready to bring Corson's to you the
Kickstarter community we simply need the
initial capital to complete tooling and
start full-scale manufacturing support
our Kickstarter to receive your own
corsets and in just two minutes a day
start making vastly better decisions for
your health performance stress and
resilience Thank You Kickstarter
