me find my stuff easily I'm sure it's in
the office
thank you hi I'm Jesse and I'm Bishan
and we are the creators and visionaries
behind the hit ponds the underarm shield
for as long as I can remember I've been
a sweater I tried everything to deal
with it
acupuncture hypnosis voodoo
military-grade deodorant down from
Mexico
I even had a girl buy me panty liners
just put my armpits for big meetings at
work whooping so hard oh you'll be doing
these we're trying we're trying to do a
film here at that Oh from the top so one
day I was in the bathroom trying all my
panty liners when I had an idea a pad
designed for your armpits so I called my
buddy vision we created a prototype and
boom
pip Hans was born there for men and
women simply peel up the backing press
the pad firmly on the inside of your
garment and be confident because you
were protected from sweat all day a few
short months later we've got our website
up we've got this beautiful office base
behind us but most importantly we've got
a business model and it actually works
it's a monthly subscription service so
you never need to worry about running
out little did we know solving the world
sweating problems is actually kind of
expensive and that's why we're here we
need to ask for your support to help
prove that the world is ready for pit
ponds if we reach our minimum goal we'll
have a sustainable business and more
importantly we will make sweat scenes a
thing of the past yeah and if we exceed
our goal we'll be able to try out
different product lines with new sizes
sense and maybe even pit ponds with
eco-friendly deodorant and my dad can
get back to retirement uh but if we
don't reach our goal you're gonna keep
seeing guys like me in the bathroom
wearing women's panties liners thanks
for your support guys we really
appreciate it thank you
every day women wear bras and there are
thousands of colors and styles to choose
from but at vitally where we want to
make them more functional than ever this
is vitally the world's first fashionable
comfortable smart bra that helps you
live a well-balanced life stress begins
in the body before it reaches the mind
but by the time we realize it it's too
late and we already feel its effects
vitally detects these early signs by
monitoring your breath posture and HRV
and it's sensors are made of fabric so
they have all the accuracy of
traditional sensors while being much
more comfortable for all-day wear HRV is
a key physiological indicator of stress
when vitally notices your HRV getting
low it gently reminds you to take a deep
breath vitally then coaches you to
breathe in sync with your heart's
natural rhythm doing this stops your
body's unconscious reaction to stress
before it starts and this breathing
technique can also be used proactively
but deeper focus or relaxation for me
it's interesting to be wearing a bra and
looking at emails and seeing how my
heart is reacting to just having to
filter through emails with this bra I'm
able to monitor my stress and do things
that can allow me to reduce stress
throughout the days and really know what
my triggers are so that I can change my
day as I'm noticing the patterns but
good breathing is impossible without
good posture vitally can sense your body
slouching and will softly remind you to
straighten up better posture is proven
to lead to better focus and confidence
with vitally maintaining it is as simple
as getting dressed and vitally doesn't
need your smartphone to work so you can
stay balanced anywhere like a great
coach vitally make senior progress
simple the Wellness score is a
combination of everything vitally
measures personalized to your goals
everything you do changes in real-time
so whether it's a morning yoga routine
or an afternoon meditation you can see
the exact before and after effects so
recently I've been trying to do a lot of
meditation and this bra has really
helped me in terms of giving me feedback
for my improvements every single time I
have a session and it's just out of
motivation to keep doing what I'm doing
there's actual progress vitally comes in
to classic colors as a front zipper or
back clasp for easy access and it's
sweat wicking and supportive design lets
you move worryfree my first impression
is that it's so comfortable I love that
all the seams are really smooth and
amazingly comfortable I just worked out
of it it's easy to take on it's easy to
take off and easy to move in so I love
it so whether you're at home in the
office or on the map vitally is the bra
for every woman
hearts or your head or should you just
let your bra listen to your heart for
you and take your head out of the
equation entirely I'm Jen Marcum I'm
buzz60 Japanese lingerie branch for true
love how do any of us know what true
love is and how does this bra know well
the company claims a sensor and one of
the bra cups sends heart rate data to a
smartphone app via bluetooth if the app
concludes the heart rate falls in the
true love zone which is very dubiously
described as somewhere below jogging but
above eating spicy food it sends a
signal to the bra and an unhooks
automatically not in the true love zone
bra stays on but until when some poor
woman is trapped in the same bra she
can't wash and as digging into her skin
forever until the right guy comes along
as if being single isn't hard enough the
company bills the bra as a way to
protect women from unwanted advantage
but I'm pretty sure they already have
some much more effective technologies
for that we're sorry your call cannot be
completed as dialed from the phone you
are using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
