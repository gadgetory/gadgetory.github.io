a thermometer it helps women who are
ready to get pregnant or not it does
bolt how can it do both
it takes your lowest body temperature
every morning and then it syncs it
automatically to your phone tracking
where you are in your fertility cycle
this little vein can do all that
the thermometer knows when you're
ovulating which makes getting pregnant
or not getting pregnant a little easier

me PMS alert actually it can and the
thermometer can help you know if your
periods gonna be early or late and you

is green too super busy our hi the date
is blue chances of pregnancy or love
but how accurate is the thermometer the
thermometers readings are accurate so if
they want hundredths of a degree it is
not like too much accuracy why don't we
just use a regular thermometer wait more
than a thermometer the thermometer can
detect the smallest variation in your
fertility cycle so we can finally be in
control of our data and our body
 a thermometer help us get
pregnant just vomiter works for me and

with active 5 breathing is the most
natural and important thing we do and
every day almost 3000 gallons of air
fill our lungs air is everywhere
where we work where we sleep but do you
really know what's in the air you
breathe you might think that pollution
is only on the side but it's the
complete opposite many studies have
proved that indoor air is up to five
times more polluted than outdoor air
this is why we created theory Clery is
the most amazing natural air purifier
powered by real plants that helps people
in reducing indoor air pollution and it
will be the best design object you will
have ever have on the market right now
there are only traditional electronic
air purifiers made in plastic very ugly
big and bulky and in early where thanks
to filters this is why we thought about
something revolutionary and we created
the perfect synergy between nature
technology and design so how does Clery
work
we designed a smart flower pot that
amplifies the natural properties of fans
our idea started from a research of NASA
they found out that some plants have got
ability to eliminate toxication
the problem is that a single plant isn't
that effective so we created a
technology unit that allows more air
flow through the soil and the roots this
is where the filtration happens we use
plants as biofilters roots and soil
generate colonies of microorganism that
trap and filter the toxic agents in year
in a natural way clear in fact filters
93% of toxic agents immediately
it's very silent and has a very low
energy consumption less than 50% of an
LED bulb you can manage it with your
smartphone and the best thing is that
there are no filters so you don't have
to change them in waste money what
happens inside is not magic but a
scientific fact and we proved it we did
many researchers and prove the
effectiveness of Clery at limber one of
the most important research labs on
plants in Europe and peanut a spin-off
of the University of Florence based in
Italy Cleary is also proudly an Italian
design product we work hard for a year
to design it in every
we developed multiple sketches and
prototypes to make the design perfect we
presented it at CES 2016 and had great
success we have a super team with two
brilliant industrial designers and a
great advisory team that helps us Italy
has a long tradition of craftsmen
especially in the ceramic field this
Italian culture is an inspiration for us
we use a ceramic first for the statical
quality but mostly because it's
eco-friendly and it doesn't release any
toxic agents in the air obviously we
also work really hard on the technology
part of our product we came to the
Silicon Valley to make something really
powerful with developed our technology
working close with engineers and
manufacturers in the Silicon Valley to
improve the functionalities of cleary
thanks to our technology unit in our
smartphone app with health and air
quality sensors clear is able to track
the toxic agent in the air and give you
real-time pollution intelligence
analytics of it and also temperature and
humidity monitor Clarey
lives with you telling what's wrong
maybe allergies sleep problem
productivity asthma it learns about you
and cares about you
it works with Wi-Fi so wherever you are
Clara can give you healthy tips on how
to feel better and tell you if something
is going wrong please back our product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
