hi I'm Shawn and I'm Frank and this is
echo echo is a revolutionary new audio
device that enables your existing
headphones or speakers to receive
wireless Wi-Fi on yo from any source
each user simply takes a battery-powered
sound puck from the base station and
plugs in any pair of headphones the
result instant - T wireless audio for
the whole travel most wireless headphone
systems are bulky and expensive and
often designed for only one user we
designed echo because we believe
everyone should be able to use their
headphones or speakers to enjoy a
phenomenal wireless listening experience
echo is specifically designed to
accommodate multiple users up to four or
more can listen together at the same
time it's built in Wi-Fi technology
delivers high quality ultra-low latency
sound for a real-time listening
experience it's perfect for movies music
gaming and more echo delivers a highly
customized listening experience that's
designed to fit each user's preference
each sound puck has individual volume
controls while the smart mobile app
controls equalizer settings streaming
settings and more it even has parental
controls like volume limiting to help
ensure safe listening for kids
we designed echo because we wanted to
create a high quality social wireless
listening experience that our expensive
wireless headphones simply couldn't
provide we wanted something powerful
enough to create an audiophile grade
listening experience it's simple enough
for the whole family to enjoy something
that untether is you that allows you
more freedom and better range in
Bluetooth or RF
and when we couldn't find it we decided
to build it over the past year our
in-house team is prototype 2 working
proof-of-concept created an elegant
beautiful industrial design and laid out
a development roadmap for finishing the
consumer ready device we've teamed up
with world-class designers and engineers
and lineup suppliers and manufacturing
partners capable of producing Ecco to
our high standards we designed Ecco to
complement your existing entertainment
accessories Ecco offers each user
individual control over their own
listening experience it was thoughtfully
designed to look great in any setting
now we're turning to Kickstarter to make
Ecco a reality for everyone by joining
us and backing this project you'll be
the first in the world to enjoy Ecco we

you not only control who comes in but it

team of successful engineers who were
leading projects at Sandia National Lab
Qualcomm and Google after two years of
prototyping gate teamed up with the
award-winning design firm box clever to
create a product that has not only
