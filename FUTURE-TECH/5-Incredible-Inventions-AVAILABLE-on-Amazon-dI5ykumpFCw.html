first electronic candle lighter powered
by our patent-pending our glider
technology when we first set out to
design a new CAD lighter
we started by reinventing everything you
know about candle letters today from its
design to how it works even replacing
the traditional flame simply press a
point and light lighting canvas will
never be the same
unlike an open flame that can reach
extreme temperatures as it rises our
patent-pending
art letter technology creates a super
high intensity electric arc that focuses
of energy only on the tip and because
it's flameless it can be used in any
direction without any flare-ups and
light so perfectly every time
why settle for hardened use disposable
candle lighters when you can have a
rechargeable lighter designed to be seen
always Within Reach
always charged and always ready thanks
for watching
hey Apple watch users have you ever
wanted a charging case with a built-in
battery while we're making one it's
called Amber check it out
first insert and twine your Apple watch
charging cable around the spool
then place it back in amber next use the
shell to cover up the spool then amber
is ready to use at night charge your
Apple watch and amber
during the day put amber in your bag in
case you need it
amber can be used any time in any place
to charge your Apple watch even while
walking
Amber's design shows the same style with
Apple products
amber can charge your iPhone use amber
to charge your watch while taking a
break and grabbing a copy
or use amber to charge your Apple watch
while driving sometimes we all just want
to get away on the weekend for an
outdoor adventure don't forget to bring
amber with you when you go camping amber
comes with its own app you can get
notifications when your watch has been
fully charged amber comes in multiple
colors amber can charge your Apple watch
up to eight times using amber is safe we
have already completed a working
prototype and now need your support for
the next stage of production we hope
that Apple watch users from around the
world will support Amber thank you
everyone loves outdoor activities but
with all that fun comes all that cleanup
that's why I created the rinse kit it's
like having a hose to go my name is
Chris Crawford and after countless hours
of developing I've created something
that is truly revolutionary rinse kit is
super easy to use to fill it simply
attach the Quick Connect adapter to any
sink or hose bib turn on the water it
will fill in 30 seconds attach the
nozzle and it's ready to go
there's no pumping or batteries required
it uses no moving parts and it will hold
the water pressure for months ok so
right now you're probably asking
yourself how in the heck does this thing
work inside the rinse kit there's a
sealed chamber when you connect it to a
hose bib the water pressure from your
home simply compresses the air in the
chamber the best part about this design
is that it essentially uses the air as a
spring there's nothing to wear out we
specifically designed the rinse kit to
be easy to carry and travel with it
holds 2 gallons of water which will
spray for over five minutes on the
center setting and for over 30 minutes
on the mist setting the lid detaches so
you can clean up and change on it you
can also use it as a cutting board or to
sit on as you rinse off your feet rinse
kit is BPA free so it's safe to drink
out of
and it's extremely durable you really
can't hurt this thing
throughout the years mankind has pursued
their outdoor passions and has suffered
unnecessarily we've always felt that the
rinse kit could be the ultimate portable
shower if it could make its own hot
water but our early attempts to heat the
water and the rinse kit were a little
impractical finally we figured it out we
developed a heating probe that drops
into the tank and runs off every
chargeable battery it quickly heats the
water in the tank to a nice comfortable
shower temperature
I even included a Smart USB port for
charging your devices we've had some
help from friends and family but we're
essentially still a startup company we
need your support to help develop the
engineering tooling and production on
this game-changing heater accessory by
backing us on Kickstarter I promise that
you're going to be one of the first
people to receive this ultimate heated
portable shower system and I'm
absolutely sure that the rinse kit will
make your life easier when it's time to
clean up
no more excuses it's time to get outside
and have some fun thanks so much for

support us with one of the options below
