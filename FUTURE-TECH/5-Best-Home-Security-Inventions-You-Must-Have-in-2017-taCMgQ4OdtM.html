is important to all of us getting your
house broken into sucks it's not just
stuff that you lose but because your
home feels violated what you want to
keep it from happening in the first
place that's why we created Coonan help
you prevent break-ins
this is Cunha Cunha is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you
you can see and talk to them on your
smartphone hey could you leave the
package out front we're a little bit
it's best way to actively prevent
break-ins most burglaries are crimes of
opportunity the burglars were actually
knocking on your door to see if you're
home and when they realize you're not
home they'll attempt to enter your house
keeping them outside is the most
important thing you can do and koona
allows you to do you can deter burglars
by talking to them or setting off
color's alarm yeah no thanks don't leave
and all this happens when they're still
outside before they even try to break it
making your home safer it shouldn't be a
chore for one of these you have to climb
in the Attic
run wires drill holes it's a pain and
it's not cheap that's why we built kuna
into an outdoor light just replace your
old light fixture and use your existing
wiring connect to another Wi-Fi and
you're done it'll take 15 minutes do we
want Kona to look good no matter where
it is so we're making it in three
different styles to match your house you
can put kuna anywhere front door back
door even the garage to wash your car oh
and your light gets smarter too you can
control it with the kuna app turn it on
turn it off set a schedule or just let
it turn on automatically when it gets
dark or when there's a person you only
want to get alerts that matter
kuna ignores trees and small animals and
it recognizes people's behaviors so if
you don't want to know every time your
spouse goes out jogging
you can tell Kona to alert you only for
visitors waiting at the door and it'll
learn and get smarter over time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones or the
delivery guy Kona will always let you
know and if it's someone bad now you can
do something about it gonna stop
break-ins or they
to the gun
