conversions there are three teaspoons in
a tablespoon a computer remind me to get
my winter clothes out of storage other
voice assistants can use your
conversations to sell your data and send
you ads Mycroft never sells your data or

hey but it doesn't work with this he can
help with that our open source community
is expanding the capability of the mark
to supporting things like Roku and other
devices mycroft private custom open
hello I'm Joshua Montgomery the CEO of
Mycroft AI in 2015 we launched the
world's first open-source voice
assistant right here on Kickstarter in
July we delivered the mark 1 to backers
in 56 countries and 38 states the
software that we built for the mark 1
now runs anywhere you can download and
run it on the linux desktop or the
Raspberry Pi this is the first step
towards our larger goal an artificial
intelligence that runs anywhere and
interacts exactly like a person an AI
that understands context can communicate
naturally and hold a complete
conversation with our second Kickstarter
we're looking to expand the community
and work with them to build software
that allows you to voice enable anything
software that's customizable and lets
you rename the assistant and change its
personality and appearance to fit you
the mark 2 uses an advanced microphone
array so it can hear at long distances
even when music is bright we've also
added a screen so you can see things
like calendar entries timers even
security camera feeds to bring the mark
2 to life we need your help we need to
invest in tooling optimize our design
for manufacturing and continue to
improve the software that's why we're
asking for your support we need you to
help us bring an open transparent
privacy minded intelligent personal
assistant provider you can begin helping
us now by going to voice my crafty eye
and donating your voice installing my
craft on your Raspberry Pi or backing
our Kickstarter today introducing the UV
shoe sanitizer an innovative versatile
product that will clean up the smelliest
most odor plague German fests and shoes
in your closet
the problem with dirty shoes is simple
they think not only that they are
perfect for trapping bacteria and germs
not a pretty combination germs and
bacteria lead to infections and wherever
there are shoes you are bound to find
the perfect environment for germs to
drive and most people don't realize that
a dark damp shoe is where toenail
fungus starts growing so we set out to
solve this problem once and for all to
create a product that would eliminate
the bacteria odors and germs naturally
and safely we wanted it to be easy to
use safe effective portable rechargeable
versatile and yes we wanted it to look
cool too and this is what came out of
our research and design the UV pro shoe
senate Iser let me explain UVC is the
shortest wavelength of ultraviolet
radiation which kills microorganisms the
UV shoe sanitizer is equipped with the
UV seed lamp that also produces ozone
you see the light might not reach all
the areas of the shoe but the ozone will
which will ensure that 99.9% of the
germs are killed so the UV shoe
sanitizer is able to kill up to 99.99%
of germs and allergens it eliminates
viruses odor causing bacteria and mold
without chemicals or irritants it has
been lab tested and proven to be
efficient and easy to use the sleek and
compact design allows for use with shoes
of all sizes and fits in hard-to-reach
spots easily
the UV pro shoe sanitizer has three
different modes sport elite for delicate
leather shoes and normal mode for
everyday use but that's not all the UV
shoe sanitizer is very versatile for
example you can use it on gloves or a
purse the compact size means that you
can take it wherever you go to the gym
the office or weigh on business the last
thing you want to do is to have to find
a plug when you're in a place where now
it's just not convenient so the UV shoe
sanitizer features a special
rechargeable battery that only takes 40
minutes to recharge and will give you
two to three complete cycles now that's
convenient you're going to want to have
more than one of these around whether
you're an athlete a construction worker
a fashion designer or office worker we
believe you'll love the UV shoe
sanitizer the lamp in this sanitizer is
guaranteed to provide 10,000 hours of
normal use get yours and never have to
worry about shoe odor again thanks for
checking in with us we hope you'll love
our product and we can really use your
support and bring in this to market
thanks for watching when people say the
sky's the limit we asked why stop there
