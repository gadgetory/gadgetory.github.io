but the downside of them is their
battery which means to get charged a so
charging the devices with all these
cables create the huge mess wherever
they get charged and it looks terrible

aluminum in many ways I tried to design

ports on the back this gives you the
ability to charge any USB based device

into the power some micro suction tapes
at the bottom of every dark providing a
solid and secure stand that allows to
dock and undock your device with just
one hand with its compact design dark it
is also remarkably portable which is
great for traveling with CNC machining
every piece gets made very precisely the
finish process starts with sanding the
wood with medium grade sandpaper
going up to the finest grade to get that
really smooth sir
protective boot and get the rich natural
patina matte oil based on natural
materials gets applied rubbed into the

made in Switzerland in a shop that gets
especially set up for mass production
I'm pretty excited about it and I hope
you are too
if so I need your help to bring this
product to life so thanks for the time
watching the video and they really
appreciate you support
today we're gonna be taking a look at
the sellin EXR SX v10 - speaker among
all the ultra portable speakers on the
market they usually suffer one common
problem which is bass because of the
form factor physically is pretty
impossible for the speakers to create a
lot of low Lien's
well Sony recently released is XP tan
which probably is the upgrade of the x11
and the biggest selling point of the
speaker is extra bass which printed very
clearly on the box but unfortunately the
XP 10 does not mean expectation here's
my pros and cons as usual let's start
with a bet the bass actually distort
badly a higher volume or bass heavy
tracks not only that it sounds extremely
artificial there's pretty much no
low-end below 100 Hertz all the basis
this thing provides this heavily
processed the speaker does not feel
premium in the hand the silicon rubber
coating seems flimsy and does not have
that quality look for sure on top of
that it's really easy to attract dirt
and dust assess the bass the mid and
treble it's also not very clear finally
in case you don't want that bass feature
there is no button to turn off the extra
bass feature like other Sony speakers do
offer and here's a couple pros the
speaker does support NFC like usual Sony
product which is always a nice feature
pairing the speaker should be fairly
easy to do the strap is definitely a
nice feature not only you can use the
strap to hang speaker it also double up
as a stand so you can use the speaker
horizontally which projects sound right
in your face okay so here are some
sample of the sony
for casual use if you keep the volley
around mid it actually sounds okay the
kiss does provoke your bass compared
with all the ultra portable speakers out
there this is good for one person use
but for a small party it's not gonna do
the job in conclusion I cannot recommend
this SRS XP 10 at this time the extra
base is very artificial and you pretty
much cannot use the speaker a higher
volume it is very disappointing but
hopefully we're one step closer to for a
full range out for portable speaker in
the future thanks for watching like
comments and subscribe as usual and I'll
see you in the next one the force the
force is what gives a Jedi is power

hey my name is Robert Morrison and I am
the founder of axis drones and today I
have with me the wallet drone
while at drone is the world's smallest
quadcopter it fits inside of the
controller itself which is the size of a
wallet fits perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size of the small size of it but it flew
longer than just about any other copter
you
the wallet drone is available in four
unique colors blue green yellow and
orange get yours today on IndieGoGo for
a simple contribution and we'll deliver
one right to your pocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
