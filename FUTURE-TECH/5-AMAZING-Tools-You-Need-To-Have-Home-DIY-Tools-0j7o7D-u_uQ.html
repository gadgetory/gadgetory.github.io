multi-tool has been the go-to solution
for a lot of different problems in so
many different places on the trail
between here and over there
in a bass boat on Lake Minnetonka here
in the kitchen right under there and
starting today that includes some of the
places we haven't been able to go gate
72 row 12 seat a introducing tread the
first multi-tool that lets you be the
one who gets it done anywhere tread is
25 hard-working tools you wear on your
wrist
including Phillips and flathead
screwdrivers techs and box wrenches even
a cutting hook and a bottle opener so
regardless of the job the right tool is
always at hand tread features 11
interchangeable links each crafted from
injection molded 17 for stainless steel
there's an optional Swiss made timepiece
water resistant to 200 meters with a
shock resistant sapphire crystal and it
all comes with a choice of two rugged
finishes
tread the go to go anywhere - from
leather the original American multi-tool
my name is Benny product developer and
founder of the EB Tool Company we use
tools to make tools me and my father
spent seven years developing a quick
gripper uses patented technology to
convert pulling force into gripping
force anytime you get a nail or a staple
that needs to come out it's always a
paint hammer uses a conventional cloth a
lot of nail much like the cat's paw it's
on the back of the quick Ripper
basically coming around the head and
then pulling the nail out that way the
quick Ripper it's got that cat's paw but
it's also got these jaws they don't pull
just about anything you can get in those
be it screws staples nails whatever you
actually get a lot more leverage with a
quick Ripper more force up top more of
it is translated into pulling force
because of the way it's designed so as
you're pulling it out it's gripping
harder and harder and harder the harder
you pull the harder it grips and it
makes just about anything come out
staples are pain to get out with a
conventional hammer because it can only
grab one side at a time the quick grip
is wide jaws can grab both sides of the
staple at once pulling the whole thing
out in one fluid motion no matter where
it's at nothing else pulls a nail in the
corner out but the quick rip or does the
jaws will pull out what conventional
forks won't ever come close to because
it can actually get right into a corner
and pull those nail screws and staples
out things like long nails right now
conventional hammer can't get a nail
past a certain point the quick Ripper
allows you to take a second bite at that
nail and pull it all the way through
pretty much no matter how long the nail
is you can get it out with the quick
grip it doesn't matter if the nail is
mangled if it's headless in fact it's
got enough gripping force that it can
actually grab the pointed end of the
nail pull it right through a board it
doesn't matter if the head is there or
not the quick gripper helps save you
money in several different ways
it replaces a lot of tools that you
wouldn't normally have to carry around
things like locking pliers a large
crowbar a hammer they replace it several
tools at once so you don't have to hunt
for another tool when the one you have
won't do the job does the quick grip or
does amol it can actually help you
repurpose wood you can take old boards
off of a deck pull all the nails out no
matter how embedded that head is you
just grab the whole thing pull it
through in one fluid motion reuse all
those boards and works great for trim
because trim always uses those little
tiny Brad's that are pain to get out
because you can't pound them through
where they Bend we can just grab them
from the back side pull them right
through and you can reuse that trim it
saves everybody time and money
no matter what their project the quick
Ripper was designed to be used by
everybody from professionals down to
your home hobbyist who's just got a
small project that they need to do the
quick Ripper is great for everyone from
the professional construction worker
down to your home hobbyist who just has
a project here and there makes a great
gift and it'll make every job that much
easier

hey I'm Nate bar creator of the pocket
monkey here today to tell you about my
latest creation wild card the pocket
knife needs to a halt it's an essential
tool but it's bulky it's one more thing
to remember in the morning and it easily
falls out of your pocket and is lost I
wanted something better
I asked why not put a pocket knife in my
wallet it'd be easier to carry and
harder to lose so I set out to design a
knife that be as thin as possible and
the result is wild card it's only two
millimeters thick
only slightly thicker than a credit card
I was able to do this by reimagining the
blade pivot most knives have a pin
pressed through a hole wildcard has a
pivot unlike anything in the world
I call it fly off technology the three
wings of the pivot allow the knife blade
to remain rigid to the body a necessity
when wielding a sharp tool for safety
I designed the blade to lock open and to
lock closed the blade tucks neatly under
two blade guards and it angles only on
one side so users can't accidentally cut
themselves when carrying a closed knife
and here's the best part about this
design the blade is detachable I
designed this with the forgetful
traveler in mind when you go through TSA
with your traditional knife on you you
lose your knife but with wild card you
only lose your blade and on our website
you can replace it for only a few
dollars with pocket monkey I used a
monkey to represent the personality of
the tool with wild card I kept that
trend going wild card as a wolf cut out
that doubles as a bottle of them the
wolf embodies the nature of the tool
agile yet
I wanted to pack as much functionality
as possible into wildcard
many people misuse knives in place of
other tools like screwdrivers and pry
bars harming themselves of break into
nine so I added these tools to the night
I always wanted to challenge convention
because of that I spent the last six
months trying to reinvent how this
product is manufactured every
manufacturer I talked with was hesitant
to produce such an aggressive design the
solution I kept hearing was take this to
China but that isn't something that I'm
willing to do I want to create products
that embody the American spirit of
innovation and my solution was to create
a manufacturing facility in Maine now we
control every aspect of production from
laser cutting to packaging and shipping
so we can manufacture the
highest-quality product while creating
jobs in our community
help us make wildcard a reality and help
us continue the American spirit of
innovation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
