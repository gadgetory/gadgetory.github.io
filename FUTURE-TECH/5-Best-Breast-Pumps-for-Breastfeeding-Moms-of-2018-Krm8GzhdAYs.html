babies the best start in life and has
many benefits for mum at lansinoh we
understand that as natural as
breastfeeding is sometimes mum can use a
little help
that's why we've spent over thirty years
developing innovative breastfeeding
support products to ensure breastfeeding
success like our new manual breast pump
which has been specially designed for
occasional use at home or away meaning
there's always breast milk on hand
whenever you're away from baby or when
Dad wants to enjoy a little bonding time
to the lansinoh manual breast pump has
fewer parts so it's simple to put
together and easy to clean and it has
two phases which simulate baby's natural
sucking pattern letdown enabling a
shallow rapid pumping rhythm to initiate
milk flow and expression facilitating
slower deeper pumping for improved milk
flow
the pumps comfort fit breast cushions to
ensure ideal suction and the most
comfortable fit while the ergonomic easy
Express handle enables you to control
suction and speed for the most efficient
milk flow and effortless pumping it's
also discreet compact and lightweight so
it's great for when you're on the go
the lansinoh manual breast pump helps
you to continue breastfeeding for as
long as you and your baby wish manual
breast pump from lansinoh helping moms
breastfeed longer
being a mom is not easy especially if
you're breastfeeding and managing a
career today I'd like to make it easier
for you
this is Anya she's the reason I'm making
this video I can't stop working because
I like living in a house and having food
on the table but I don't want to
compromise my daughter's well-being as
well so I don't want to stop
breastfeeding whether I'm at home or an
important meeting
that's why milk pumping machines were
invented so that someone else my husband
for example could fidget but there's one
huge problem most of them suck only up
to 60% of the milk because their suction
cups are designed like this does this
look like it imitates the section of a
baby I don't have enough milk for the
bottle after Anna is finished eating my
body doesn't accelerate the milk
production because 40% of the milk is
still left inside my breasts so my body
thinks there's too much milk inside my
breasts and reduces the milk production
sometimes Anya gets hungry and mad and
I'm frustrated because I can't do
anything to help her I looked for a
pumping machine that would pump 100% of
my milk but I couldn't find one
after hours of research I came up with a
way to make the existing pumping
machines better I met up with a genius
engineer who has already designed more
than 30 patents and challenged him to
design one for me
six months later meet Annabella
Annabella is a pumping machine that
draws close to 100% of mothers milk
because it actually simulates the baby's
sucking motion this spherical part under
the main opening contains a mechanism
which imitate the baby's tongue and the
upper part enables power and Gryff
adjustment just like a real muscle
system it has a unique patent-pending
mechanism which makes you feel like a
real baby is sucking the milk the pace
and the intensity can be adjusted it's
user-friendly washable quiet and small
you can charge it and easily take it
with you we made sure that the
production process is also simple to
make Anabella affordable our concept has
been validated by breastfeeding experts
as well as a respected pediatrician it
solved the problems I was experiencing
as a first-time breastfeeding mother it
has one part that needs to be washed and
it's designed to connect with almost any
bottle type battery allows you to pump
several times before needing to charge
it again we are currently developing an
app which will monitor the amount of
milk thought and recommend the optimal
pace and intensity of the process we
need your support to introduce this
product to the market millions of moms
are waiting for an innovative product
like the Annabella your financial
support will help us start production in
the future we will take a nabilla to
retail companies in order to distribute
worldwide we hope you're excited as we
are about the Annabella even a small
contribution will help us get to the
finish line that much sooner if you have
followers on Facebook or any other
social media please share this video

by doing so
