each of us uses every day we want in a
while if I could keep up with our busy
lives and enhance them instead of hinder
them that's why we created the elemental
wallet
here's the story of the elemental wallet
it all started when a friend get Sydney
a minimalist wallet which all the fell
apart six months later I was frustrated
I wanted a minimum of this wallet that
was built to last more functional and
more aesthetically pleasing that's why I
created my own the first wallet was
stainless steel it was heavy had sharp
edges and the o-rings had a tendency to
pop off its improve the functionality
somewhat but the aesthetics were still
terrible the next wallet was CNC
machined out of aluminum and the
aesthetics were greatly improved the
functionality was also improved except
this wallet had to have at least three
cards to function and was very expensive
to manufacture finally for the Elemental
wallet
we chose solid carbon fiber this
material isn't cheap but we have
experienced machining it and know how to
do it cost effectively and hold one to
25 cards which slide in easily
accommodates additional cash cards or
keys and has a built in bottle opener
solid carbon fiber they can not protect
your cards light enough to carry
anywhere Kickstarter we love our wallets
and we know you will too but to make
them affordable we need your support
take a look at our pledges and don't
forget to share us with your friends and
family thank you
