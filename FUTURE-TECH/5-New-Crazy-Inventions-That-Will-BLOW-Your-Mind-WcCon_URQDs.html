go and do whatever I do so I created the
adventure hoodie which is ready for any
adventure that life throws at you

forest or in the urban jungle and
everything this hoodie can do you'll
wonder how you live it without it
introducing the adventure hoodie which
is being praised for style innovations

adventure hoodie is the only travel
clothing you need USA Today describes it

Planet declares it the perfect accessory
for busy travellers and men's gear calls
it stylish and exceedingly comfortable

places to put everything you need for
anything life throws at you whether
you're going across town or on a camping
trip or on a trip around the world

you want to bring with you each pocket
and the adventure hoodie has a zipper or
button to keep your items where they
belong and you want to rest the

into a pillow with snaps to secure it in
place and in it folds just as easily
with your stuff in the zippered or
button pockets it makes getting through
the airport a snap you can tune out the
world with easy access to your music and
the oversized hood is lined with extra
soft fabric designed to pull over your
eyes with built in gloves that unfold
out of the cuffs you can stay warm and
cozy with a mini Pen pocket you'll
always have something to write with and
so will everyone around you the lined
hood converts to the softest pillow on
the planet there are underarm vents but
if things get too warm pull up the
ventilation zipper so you can cool off
without having to take off your hoodie
when you get to where you're going

innovations that you'll wonder how you
lived without like our original neoprene
koozie pocket which holds your beverage
and keeps it cold and a bottle opener

takes a turn there's a sunglass holder
and for safety there are reflective
elements in the front and on the back

adventure hoodie and has all the

story I'm an architect
and my story began with my grandfather
he was a blacksmith nature was his
primary obsession and inspiration he
often asks us how I felt at his father's
feeling being one with nature in his
daily routine of work as I felt back on
all the nights when my grandfather
crafted the blades for his kitchen
knives I began to create a handle to
match one that isn't like the many of
this retrosynthetic but his rifle would
what began as a sketch turned into a
passion because sometimes innovations
require perfect conditions and timing
I found my true passion InDesign who
finally I created a complete knife I
call skid skid combines the traditional
and the modern as good as
environmentally sound stylistically pure
and elegant adapted for the needs and
challenges of modern uses drip forms and
adjusts to the hands economically the
wood is hardened and tempered but isn't
inferior to the natural wood surface
high carbon content coupled with
exceptional alloying that's the blade
sharp and long-lasting body of the
handle is more at Janak than typical
synthetic handles
thanks to tannic acid produced for
hardwood which has antibacterial
properties my grandfather taught me that
all organic raw materials were a gift no
matter how far society progresses
creating skid took me back into the past
but also a giant step towards the future

hi and welcome to Urbo today we're going
to be taking a look at our keyring
charger this is a great way to charge or
sync your mobile devices this particular
one is designed for Apple devices so it
has a USB connector on one side and a
lightning connector on the other side
but I'm going to show you this product
in action here so you can see what
really makes it unique and that is of
course on my key ring
so I'll just zoom in so you can get a
little closer look so what I really like
about this product is that it's firstly
it's ultra small it's not going to
tangle and it has a magnetic loop so
that it can easily close with a positive
lock there and it's also very easy to
remove from the keyring now I know that
personally I often lose my lightning
cables but I never lose my keys so by
combining the two I'm sure that I'm
always able to charge and sync my mobile
device on the go it's available in four
different colors as you can see and you
can buy them individually as well it
outputs 5 volts 1.5 amps that's just a
standard charging voltage and amperage
and of course it's available in a micro
USB connector for your Android devices
it doesn't have to go on a keyring it
could definitely go on something else I
actually have a backpack with me today
just to give you an example of what it
looks like you know on another here we
go here here it is on a backpack easy to
put on easy to take off and very hard to
lose once again this is the ER bow
keyring charger and it's for your mobile
devices Apple or Android and thank you
