I think we can all agree that we're
living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to order a ride home control the
temperature turn on the lights a verdict
face it we're living in a technological
Wonderland and yet here we find Phil
Phil's forgotten the combination of his
travel log is the current solution to
that problem
we live in an era filled with
technological marvels and yet this is
what happens when Phil forgets a lot
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air baltics is the air bolts has a
travel lock you control it with your
smartphone it's a lot the future
deserves a lock with customizable
security settings this airball opens
whenever my phone is within bluetooth
right well maybe you don't trust anyone
in your lives that's fine the settings
on this airball require me to enter a
password into the app well maybe you're
a bolts been stolen that's fine too
because you can sit your air bomb to
activate an alarm when it moves too far
away from your phone or you can activate
the alarm manually stop that man it's
the Justice the future deserves hi Bill
hi
tell them what happened bill I lost my
bag you lost your we live in a world
where I can use my smartphone to one of
my sleeping patterns but bill here can't
find his bag if bill have been using the
air bolt instead of some antique you
could have located it using the air box
crowd-sourced GPS networks what if you
lose your phone well you can still
unlock your air ball by logging in from
another device well you can enter our
backup button code using your hand like
some kind of prehistoric man
the air vault has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year by a standard microUSB connector
it's CSA approved so airport security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your airport you can even share
access to your a vault with your friends
so you'll be able to unlock it from the
other side of the world thanks pal
you're welcome buddy and look how small
it is seriously look at it it's really
small
a volt it's the travel lock we all
deserve a kick starter over the last
year we've worked really hard on
building the air box and we got to say
that we're truly proud of how far we've
come but now we need your help to fund
the last stages of production tooling
raw materials and manufacturing honestly
we've all been there we've all forgotten
the combination to a look the most
frustrating thing ever and losing your
baggage even worse and that's why we
designed the air boat we believe in
innovation like this is long overdue and
it's time we bring luggage lock
technology into the 21st century the air
boat has so many possibilities we're
have been including it with a software
development kit so that you can make
your own features for example imagine
unlocking the airport with your voice or
gamifying it and using it at a scavenger
hunt
we hope you agree and get onboard our
Kickstarter campaign and as a reward for
backing us early we're offering some
awesome deals on the airboat thanks from
all of us here at airboat
