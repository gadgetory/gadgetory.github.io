all time the feeling you get when you
hit that perfect shot or kick serve down
the line is indescribable perfecting
these shots takes countless hours of
practice and with that comes the
inevitable chore of picking up hundreds
of tennis balls scattered all over the
courts players and coaches everywhere
know the frustration and tediousness
that goes into collecting balls during a
practice session and this is why we
invented ten ibattz Tanabata is the
world's first robotic ball collector ten
upon perfectly integrates computer
vision and artificial intelligence to
detect tennis balls on the court and
collect them from players
you can let Canabalt work autonomously
using the station that easily attaches
to the net boost or use tena bots have
the customized bear in the court the
device will clear Santa bot easily syncs
to your phone and even your Apple watch
to make activation quick and seamless
the app also keeps track of how many
balls are collected during a session and
how often you practice so feel free to
brag to your friends about how you're
stepping up your game while never having
to pick up another tennis ball Tana
bought was designed with convenience and
mind the removable bucket holds up to 80
balls unless you easily continue your
hittin session after tena bot has
cleared the court the battery takes only
90 minutes to charge and runs for four
to five hours it's portable design lets
you pick up ten Abad and wheel it on and
off the court
just like a suitcase and when you're
done ten ibattz compact size makes it
easy to fit in the trunk of your car so
instead of picking up balls players can
relax hydrate or just keep playing we
have created multiple prototypes of
Hannibal and perform thousands of tests
to come up with the perfect training
partner we tally bus patented design and
advanced algorithms we can make tennis
more convenient for players at all
levels whether you're hitting with a
ball machine
volleying with a friend or giving a
lesson 10 Abad helps you get the most
out of your time on the court our dream
is to get more people playing tennis
having fun and improving their shops
with a forehand backhand or a kick sir
we have a great product an amazing team
and we can't wait to put it in a vault
in your hands but we need your help
in order to start manufacturing shipping
worldwide you need a large enough order
together you can kick-start this
revolutionary project and take the
tedious out of things
in the 21st century you've got to marvel
at mini-pc advanced technology compared
with a regular laptop you'll find many
advantages from our new mini PC you can
carry me comfortably in your handbag or
pocket without experiencing any back
pain our mean mini PC is ideal for
traveling shopping fast note-taking
presentations and completing your urgent
projects anyway hi my name is Leo me
offers the same functionality and
performance as a laptop and tablet now
you may be worried about its cost in
fact it's much cheaper than a laptop and
a tablet
moreover me even consumes less battery
energy and generates less heat let me
show you our me mini PC it's only 5
inches and made out of aluminium both
Windows 10 and android 5.1 OS is
pre-installed and you can switch between
the two of them it has 8 gigabytes of
RAM and the internal storage is a 128
gigabyte SSD even though you're doing a
lot of things it's still smooth this is
a touchscreen it has an HD resolution of
1280 by 720 pixels letting you interact
quickly when you're on the go alright
let me play a video to check out the
sound quality and functionality
performance of course you may think you
have smartphones but this was a larger
display
sometimes if I get an urgent project I
can continue and finish my work while
I'm enchanted
I'll open a word document type something
now
here you'll see audio output HDMI to USB
slots Gigabit Ethernet DC 5 volt input
on this side USB see two more USB ports
one of which is USB 3.0 and a TF card
slot inside is the juban Wi-Fi antenna
and on the front stereo speakers and the
home button it comes with a stylish
stand cover and keyboard and two extra
pockets so you can take a keyboard or
mini pc review individually with the me
mini pc you can replace a tablet and a
laptop with a single device that fits
right in your pocket
diamond star Alexa shoulder living room
we love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go they help us plan our
day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us
they even support our work day but all
these fun functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quit charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Q simply wrap it into this
tuck away slot and you're good to go
how really does the cube work well it's
a simple concept just plug your cube
into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down hi my name
is question as every busy person I was
often on the road and almost every day
my phone was running out of the battery
in the afternoon instead of messy wires
and power bank I wanted to have only one
small device that can replace the number
of home accessories I have to carry
everything when we started to think
about the cube
at the existing technology on the map
and we quickly noticed that most of the
available devices were not complete and
lucky was a friend
together with Pierre our head designer
we developed the cube we went through
several prototypes to find the best
design thank you a designer this
elegance compact and practical it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a small in
cool design with a significant battery
capacity it was something that had never
been done but we made it and we're so
proud and excited to bring it to you
cube is the world's first compact and
lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sink and quick charging
cable
you'll also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
simply put it's an amazing piece of
technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world so
get yours now and be one of the first
few boulders
you
for several days last year my home city
of Seoul had a worst airport in the
world and we stayed inside where
sometimes the air was even worse
my team was already working on probable
indoor air quality monitor but this
inspired us to make one that's even
better
that's how we created Piko Piko combines
numerous sensors into one tiny I mean
really tiny packs that attaches to your
smartphone it includes your laser base
the particle sensors for measuring
cancer closing p.m. can and PM 2.5
finders sensors for carbon dioxide and
VOCs on hygrometer for measuring
humidity we even threw in our
thermometer for to measure we made it
our smartphone connected device so you
can measure and track everything through
the app pickle is our most related
promise production we have fully tested
our prototype with half front and an
Institute of Technology we finalize
design and we lined up great factory now
we just need heard from in the global
trackers like you to help us bring
people to the world
oh yeah if you curious about our
technology we have details on everything
on our IndieGoGo page
