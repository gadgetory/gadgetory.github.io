wanted a charging case with a built-in
battery while we're making one it's
called Amber check it out
first insert and twine your Apple watch
charging cable around the spool
then place it back in amber next use the
shell to cover up the spool then amber
is ready to use at night charge your
Apple watch and amber
during the day put amber in your bag in
case you need it
amber can be used any time in any place
to charge your Apple watch even while
walking
Amber's design shows the same style with
Apple products
amber can charge your iPhone use amber
to charge your watch while taking a
break and grabbing a copy or use amber
to charge your Apple watch while driving
sometimes we all just want to get away
on the weekend for an outdoor adventure

when you go camping amber comes with its
own app you can get notifications when
your watch has been fully charged amber
comes in multiple colors
amber can charge your Apple watch up to
eight times using amber is safe we have
already completed a working prototype
and now need your support for the next
stage of production we hope that Apple
watch users from around the world will
support amber thank you
phones have evolved so much over the
past 15 years there's one problem
they're too big for our hands in fact in
the US alone a phone breaks every two
seconds costing us time money and
sometimes even our dignity that's why we
created loopy the first case with the
loop to stop the drop the first thing
you'll notice about being in the loop is
how secure and in control it feels loopy
literally makes it hard to drop the
phone
these phones are so big and slippery
they're impossible to use one-handed
they seem to put all the most used
buttons and the hardest roof spots both
loopy reaching your whole screen is a
breeze even with the iPhone 6 plus
using your phone with loopy is truly a
one-handed experience and who isn't
always carrying a million things at once
the multicast is a lifesaver
simply flip grab and go you don't
realize how nice having an extra hand is
until you're in the loop loopy is the
perfect running buddy all of your apps
and music conveniently in your hand
no more frustrating hard to reach
armbands your phone has an awesome
camera pictures even in crazy places
you've never imagined pulling out your
phone before this is called cosenza a
device that works as a kind of mobile
phone kissing that has been presented at
the conference on love and sex with
robots
the idea is to be able to send kisses
from a distance that we can actually
feel in our skin thanks to the haptic
technology in fact the device is part of
a project by researcher ma yan Jiang who
has aimed to help solve problems
inherent in long-distance relationships
with this unique product that offers
effective communication of deep emotions
and of intimacy through a multi
sensorial experience of communication on
the Internet the description is somewhat
grandiloquent but the truth is that the
solution is unique the cradles docks in
which the iPhones are inserted we do not
know if it works with other smartphones
count in the lower part with a small
silicone pad the two people who
communicate via FaceTime or Skype have
the option to send a kiss not only with
text or emoticons but also physically
all you have to do is to kiss that pad
which will cause the kissing pressure
pattern to be recorded so that the
person receiving the kiss can place the
pad on the cheek or lips on the other
side and can feel the same pressure
transmitted through small activators
that reproduce that pattern the
cassandra' is intended not only for
human beings but as a possible way to
explore the man-machine relationships of
the future
the experiments that will be carried out
will also make this development try to
pass the Turing test so that a receiver
of the kiss tries to decide if the one
who has kissed him at a distance is a
human or a machine that imitated the
pattern of a human kiss your mobile
phone's ability to take sharp pictures
has changed photography forever after
all the best camera is the camera you
have on you at all times but mobile
lenses still do have some shortcomings
for example taking extreme close-up
pictures or what's called macro
photography take Billy who is trying to
capture a picture of a praying mantis
for science class he can get an okay
shot but he is unable to get the
magnified close-up masterpiece he wants
to impress his teacher and classmates
well there's good news easy macro can
turn any mobile camera into a macro
camera in seconds easy macros unique
patented design makes it simple to use
and supports any mobile device out there
easy macro is used by doctors
particularly eye and skin specialists
around the world
easy macro is frequently featured in
youth science programs and let's not
forget easy macro has helped thousands
of people wow their friends on Instagram
order your easy macro today this is air
bar air bar brings touch to your new or
existing PC by projecting an invisible
light field over the screen and what's
good about light is that it responds to
pretty much anything so you can swipe
with your gloves or long fingernails
pinch with your chopsticks scroll while
you're cooking or why not use a
paintbrush you get the idea with air bar
you get touch gestures when you need
them it's easy to attach it's sleek it
won't drain your battery and you can
unplug it when you want - best of all
there's no manual no installation it's
plug and touch it just works
air bar plug and touch when you need it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
