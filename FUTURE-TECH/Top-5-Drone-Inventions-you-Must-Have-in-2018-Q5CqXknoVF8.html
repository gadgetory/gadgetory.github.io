first fully portable 4k flying camera
lots of watch of decent quality video
but they all forced to make the same
frustrating choice tiny toy model digit
only stabilization forces your
compromise on video quality flight time
and win performance or heavy duty model
the big bulky carrying case I mean we
want to go hiking with this until now
you need a dangerous open blades in
order get good one performance but a
hard tough fun with a big flying
lawnmower nearby
ever try that an open bladed model at
one recommend it that's where we built
the safest pork a fly-in camera it fits
in the smallest backpack so you can take
it anywhere capture the moments that
important to you the best camera is
always the one you have with you at 500
grams it's less a 20-minute flight time
and packs the gimbals stabilized 4k
camera we made a flying camera for
capturing the best stories and
adventures the best stories usually have
people in them and people sometimes make
mistakes that would have been a bloody
mess with any other flying camera out
there wealthy messes are any fun we
think flying camera should be fun flying
snap with your smartphone means you
always have your controller with you the
smarts of your smartphone lets us make a
lot of the hard things easy like one of
those dramatic shots when the camera
pulls back and orbits around you we've
worked with a team of directors and
videographers to define those amazing
cinematic shots and make it easy for you
to recreate them without being a
professional director
snap knows exactly where you are which
lets it automatically track you fly
around you and come back to you snap
works with iOS and Android phones to
stick dsm controllers or bluetooth game
controllers whatever suits your style or
you cannot pilot snap at all and let it
do the work for you it's amazing to have
the freedom to see anything and anyone
any perspective any time without having
to think or worry just have fun and this
is just a start
we've got modules coming for obstacle
avoidance wildly fast flight speed and
unlimited range with a cellular modem we
spent over two years for can extremely
talented team of engineers designers and
programmers developing the technology to
make this possible we want to show the
world just how easy a mind-blowing
aerial video can be snap is ready for
pre-order now we can't wait to see what
you're gonna do with it
drone racing is first person view client
will first drone pilot sees what the
drone sees as it twice controlling the
aircraft the multi it can be sporty
phrasing at race drag of freestyle if
you pull the notion and enjoy the
freedom of flight drone racing became in
a new entertainment and sports effect in
the growing community building aeration
drone is always a compromise between
high strength long way this typical
recent drone design is based on
lightweight and strong material carbon
fiber here elite is an open frame made
of number of weld carbon fiber details
connected with bolts and nuts obviously
open electronic components are affected
by Renoir and built water drops such a
setup can be easily broken down during
collision crash - water a drone pilot
often has to bring two or more drones to
the races and spend a lot of time
repairing our understanding these
shortcomings we are making a new step to
the future of race and road design the
name of the step is Nimbus the basic
idea behind it for weight and high
strength comes from features of a shell
a structural element of geometry the
thickness is very small compared a
further dimension the first prototype
was made in January 2016 after extensive
flight tests 20 units were delivered two
pylons
feedback was collected and used in this
release version we make the frame for
Nimbus drone with a special technology
on in a carbon fiber from the inside in
the cavity mold with special blood which
is pressurized to fare as a result we
are getting similar structure and a
fundamental increase of strength keep in
a very long way it is very efficient use
of carbon fiber projects all electronic
components of drone camera and battery
are placed in there and close body and
protected from when fire
now we can enjoy your flight even more
about fear of time and money consuming
areas not wasting time waiting for
replacement parts or just annoying
clinging nimble drone has extremes then
of course it will not teach you to fly
but it will give you much more
confidence and flying aerodynamics it
can be ignored when we are talking about
flying at high speeds
Nimbus drone has streamlined form and
very good aerodynamic properties Nimbus
drone will be available as frame only or
in ready to fly package with the fastest
flight controller well-proven
electronic components and powerful
motors our campaign is aimed to response
or establishment of specialized high
quality production of full carbon fiber
forms we are starting with our first
product Nimbus drone which will be ready
for shipments in March 2017 if you are
interested to push racing drone design
to a new level or you are looking for
new ideas please let us know and support
our project
you
our ray is more than just a fishing
drone
it's a powerful underwater photography
and video platform
power Ray is an intelligent underwater
robot designed to let you see the world

at 98 feet and has three operational
lobes for beginners experienced pilots
and professionals for underwater
photography use power Ray's powerful 4k
UHD camera with a wide-angle lens it can

observing to enjoy the freedom of
swimming underwater without jumping in
the gesture-based VR goggles you
hands-free control and provides you a
stunning fpv underwater experience in
addition you can utilize power array for
underwater exploration a nice issue
put the controller in your hand and
discover what else power Rea can do
