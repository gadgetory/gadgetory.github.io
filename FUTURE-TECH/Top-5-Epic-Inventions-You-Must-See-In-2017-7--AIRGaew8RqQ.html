first fully portable 4k flying camera
lots of Quach a decent quality video but
they all forced to make the same
frustrating choice tiny toy model
digital-only stabilization forces you
compromise on video quality flight time
and wind performance or heavy duty model
the big bulky carrying case I mean we
want to go hiking with this until now
you need a dangerous open blades in
order to get good one performance but
the hard tough fought with a big flying
lawnmower
never try that with an open bladed model
I won recommend it that's where we built
the safest 4k fly on camera it fits in
the smallest backpack so you can take it
anywhere capture the moments get
important to you the best camera is
always the one you have with you at 500
grams it's a 20-minute flight time and
packs a gimbal stabilized 4k camera we
made a flying camera for capturing the
best stories of adventures the best
stories usually have people in them and
people sometimes make mistakes that
would have been a bloody mess with any
other flying camera out there they
messes are any fun we think flying
camera should be fun flying snap with
your smartphone means you always have
your controller with you the smarts of
your smartphone lets us make a lot of
the hard things easy like one of those
dramatic shots when the camera pulls
back and orbits around you we've worked
with a team of directors and
videographers to define those amazing
cinematic shots and make it easy for you
to recreate them without being a
professional director
snap knows exactly where you are which
lets it automatically track you fly
around you and come back to you snap
works with iOS and Android phones to
stick dsm controllers or bluetooth game
controllers whatever suits your style or
you cannot pilot snap at all and let it
do the work for you it's amazing to have
the freedom to see anything and anyone
any perspective any time without having
to think or worry just have fun and this
is just a start
we've got modules coming for obstacle
avoidance wildly fast flight speed and
unlimited range with a cellular modem we
spent over two years working an
extremely talented team of engineers
designers and programmers developing the
technology to make this possible we want
to show the world just how easy a
mind-blowing aerial video can be snap is
ready for pre-order now we can't wait to
see what you're gonna do with it
be there without beating there
introducing Spiricom to the only
360-degree video camera that captures
everything around you for a lifelike
playback with six lenses inside a
stunningly small design spirit cam 2
delivers uncompromising 4k spherical
videos put it on a stick on its extended
arms or just hold it in the palm of your
hand to enjoy automatically stitched
videos on your VR headset smartphone or
tablet
we've designed spirit camp 2 to be
unlike anything else out there but to
get it out there we need your help back
us on Kickstarter so we can put the best
spherical VR ready video camera in your
hands
say hello to Giotto the connected
display the drawers with a pen just use
the app to tell Giotto what to draw then
sit back and watch as the pen works its
magic turning your pixels into pen and
ink
the uses for joso are limitless and

from sending the most important message
of the days to keeping you in the loop
it's exhibiting a priceless masterpiece
to displaying the things that matter it
seems some things in life are just
better off free Joe so story started two
years ago when there is design studio
that's these guys Jim Barney and Carmen
came up with the concept they wanted to
connect the digital world to the real
world not through a screen that's rupan
and ink Giotto has been through loads of
prototypes a hardware incubator software
and electronics development and now it's
ready to go and it's an award winner -
turns out people love Giotto people like
the artist and illustrator Anthony
Burrell it helps you to take work from
them from screen that it's very perfect
almost too perfect and they taste it
into the real world and it gives it a
personality it's not just artists who
see the potential of Giotto here's Jim
the ideas guy it's awesome seeing how
jata inspires people everyone that sees
it draws seems to come up with new thing
they wanted to job people want to make
to-do lists and love notes share
information and we've made sure that it
works with all the apps that they love
including slap Spotify even Amazon Alexa
the notion of being able to create these
these pieces of art live in a real world
space with no screens that's you know
that's that's completely new
there is design studio worked alongside
product design experts and electronics
engineers to hone the nuts and bolts of
Giotto every detail is a thing of beauty
worthy of hanging on your wall the team
have worked closely with manufacturers
based in Shenzhen to ensure the pricing
is realistic and production is doable so
to celebrate the launch of Giotto on
Kickstarter we've got something special
lined up 365 days of art that means a
brand new image from a top illustrator
on your wall every day for a year we
started as a small team with a good idea
we've put everything in finis to get it
ready to go and we're so close and it's
simply not going to happen to our
Kickstarter so help us make it a reality
so the question is what will you jot

hello my name is Ryan Hyde I'm the
inventor of the gun box I'd like to
introduce you today to the gun box
Sentinel
when I grew up we grew up around
firearms that were part of who we were
we'd use it as a tool to keep animals
out of the livestock or to scare off the
occasional suitor that would come to
date my sisters we invented the gun box
to protect families and keep families
safe it brings back a part of who I am
as a family and part of my heritage
why stash your tactical rifle or home
defense shotgun in a closet or basement
safe far from where you might need it
the gun box Sentinel the newest addition
to our groundbreaking gun box lineup
allows you to bring your gun out of
hiding into safe quick accessible
storage sentinels sleek contemporary
look invites you to put it in the living
room bedroom work or home office
anywhere you might need to get to your
gun quickly in true gun box fashion
Sentinel is very different from anything
else on the market
it's a tough pressure form zero weld
alloy container with dual diecast
interlocking hinges and redundant servo
controlled interlocking latches this
allows Sentinel to achieve the highest
levels of security possible in an openly
displayed container if the high-tech
enclosure and the electronic bells and
whistles aren't enough Sentinel is a
standalone - speaker system allowing you
to stream music from your smartphone
Sentinel is secure tough looks great and
sounds fantastic
like all done box products Sentinel can
be opened in seconds with a touch of a
finger the wave of a key card or fob or
with the tap of a finger via the
smartphone app Sentinel can easily be
secured to the floor and comes with an
audible motion and tamper alarm that
will sound if it's bumped or move

not like anything else on the market
join us on IndieGoGo and help us
continue to bring forth products that
will allow us to protect our families
and have quick and easy access in a
situation where we may need them the
most
here at bloody technological innovations
we are currently developing a wearable
smartphone in the form of a glove our
main aim is to push the boundaries of
wearable telecommunications and move
into a new area of a fully wearable
world people who are into sports or any
other physical activities often struggle
to carry and use their smartphone in its
fullest usable capacity glove these
aimed at people who engage in sports and
other demanding activities whatever the
situation glove D is right for you both
founders are sparring athletes and faced
a major problem while exercising the
difficulty to use and carry their
smartphones smartwatches and fitness
trackers did not work efficiently for
them
the reason these devices must be paired
with an existing smartphone while
operating them multiple issues can arise
no feasible way to initiate a call or
send a text message take videos or
photos or even be able to use popular
applications on a small SmartWatch
display and that's how glove D was born
a wearable smartphone in the form of a
glove can do so much more than just a
regular one we strongly believe that
glove D will exponentially increase the
quality of our lives not only in sports
but also in other activities of our
daily routine glove D is not just a
product it's a platform aiming to close
the gap in emerging technologies in
Internet of Things
