hours ago we launched the revolutionary
device pyro we condensed it into a
smaller more compact version and along
the way we've added crazy features I'm
happy to introduce you to hi Romy one of
the big advantages of pyro mini is
actually the size right with this half

possibilities of this thing are
literally endless you can put it under a
threat of cards and fire from that I did
inside a card box hide it behind your
iPhone behind objects in your house it's
so small you can take a credit card out
of your wallet and hide it underneath
your credit so we've been jamming out
with this thing all week rossini and the
things we've been coming up with our

personally get upwards of six hundred
shots before I have to recharge it

plugs into the remote which gives you
upwards of 30 feet of range you can be
