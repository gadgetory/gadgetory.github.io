prevented when you drive a car you put
your seatbelt on when you ride a bike
you put on your helmet but how do you

heavy currents or when there's poor
circulation or cramps anytime you're on
the water even if you're just relaxing

we like kenji because it's small doesn't
get in your way when you're trying to
paddle out a lot of times when you're
surfing there's not a lifeguard anywhere
near so this gives you a little bit more
sense of security
Kinji can stay inflated for over 48
hours it includes a compass as well as a
whistle for signaling help in case of
emergency having knowledge with your
judgement the first steps and water
