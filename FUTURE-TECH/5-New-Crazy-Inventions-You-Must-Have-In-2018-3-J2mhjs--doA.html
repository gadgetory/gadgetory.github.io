the air bubble is the first proven
technology that effectively removes more
than 95% of both nitrogen dioxide and
particles from inside a car it's now
well known that air pollution affects
our health especially those living in
cities however what most people aren't
aware of is just how bad the air in your
car can be nitrogen dioxide levels
primarily from diesel emissions inside
your car cabin can be 10 times over the
w-h-o limit sitting in a vehicle with
your windows up in traffic is not the
safe haven you might think that it is
that's why we've created the air bubble
the first proven technology of its kind
that removes all elements of air
pollution including nitrogen dioxide
from inside a car cabin the air bubble
is optimized to protect drivers and
their families in polluted cities at
professional drivers who spend hours on
the road designed to fit on the back of
the car headrest the air bubble works by
drawing polluted air circulating inside
the car into the unit before our
proprietary filtration technology
removes gases particles
bacteria dust and odors clean air is
then released back to the driver and
passengers in the most efficient way
possible using advanced air flow
dynamics what we breathe matters an a
lab some missions reduce people's
exposure to air pollution like most
parents and poise conscious to avoid the
high levels of air pollution found on
busy roads what I hadn't realized is the
levels of harmful nitrogen dioxide can
be even higher inside our cars our
research is a real wake-up call as I
realize the impact this could have on
the house my son and of other children
at air labs knowing we had the only
proven technology to effectively remove
nitrogen dioxide I knew it was our duty
without the air bubble giving people the
power to protect themselves and their
families the air bubble has been
designed by our team of atmospheric
chemists and airflow engineers at air
labs in our research laboratory here in
Copenhagen it uses our proprietary
filtration technology developed over the
past decade at air labs we specialize in
creating clean air zones for people the
technology inside the air bubble has
proven itself inside of clean air bus
shelters and in a clean air bench
commissioned by Transport for London
during the past year we have focused on
creating a clean air zone inside of a
car and on making the air bubble a
reality we have manufacturers lined up
and with your help we can start
protecting people with the air bubble
early next well we're really excited to
be launching the a bubble and today
we're asking for your support so you can
start making a real difference to
people's lives
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
