smartphone products are both very
expensive and difficult to set up that's
why we created post hook is a platform
that connects any radiofrequency enabled
device in your home to the Internet with
these $5 RF outlets you can already add
remote control to any device in your
home but they only work within range of
the remote and with basic
functionalities connecting a new device
is incredibly simple just think your
devices remote with the hook app now I
can control that device from anywhere in
the world
hook is compatible with IFTTT which can
be used to schedule operations of
routine tasks like turning on your
holiday lights sunset
or turning your entire room into an
alarm clock Luke's capabilities are
limited only by your imagination you can
create rules that flash your lights when
your bus is nearby notify you pick an
appliance with less towing
or turn off your router if your daughter
is watching too much Netflix
wait wait wait come back oh no look it's
powered by spark io and will be provided
with an open API so anyone can develop
their book and help expand this
capability and the best part you only
need one hook for your entire home
regardless of how many devices you are
connecting so we've been working for
over a year now trying to develop this
technology and then get it into a
packaged device that users going to like
them and we like ourselves so we started
off with a big board set of electronics
we added Wi-Fi compatibility we added a
USB hub so we could power through USB
and then we started adding things like
radio chips that we had to make sure
didn't interfere with each other and
then the trick is trying to get that
thing smaller get it more compact to get
it into the right package so we made
multiple 3d printed designs each time we
print something fit the electronics into
it put it on a board look at it and
figure out not only can pop these chips
off with the moving this way we can read
opt it we could solder it's smaller we
can get free more compact and then the
end we really came down to a product
that it feels nice looks good
prototype that we're really proud to
ship hey Kickstarter where the team
behind cook we have been working really
hard for a little year to make coke a
reality we've got a great product and
we're very excited to bring it to market
but we need your help with your funding
we can get our molds in our
manufacturing process dialed in and get
hooked to production as excited as via
Backus Shanna's and defensible coop so
join us in our journey to bring
affordable home automation to everyone
security isn't about a siren everyone
ignores security is about people it's
about knowing who should and shouldn't
