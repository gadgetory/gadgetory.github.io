and it's the first of its kind they'll
let you control all of this from your
phone trainer bot lets you pick a
setting that's perfect for you beginners
can practice two four hands and slow
easy shots just choose a location spin
type and a slow interval as you improve
trainer block rows with you you can
create a sequence that involves multiple
shots like forehand and backhand
and for advanced players Printrbot
becomes unpredictable you can make
issues randomly and maximum speed in
close games there's no feeling like
hitting that epic shot those moments are
rare but they don't have to be because
