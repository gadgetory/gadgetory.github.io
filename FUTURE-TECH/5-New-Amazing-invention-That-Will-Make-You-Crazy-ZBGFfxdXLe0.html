Oh
here I'd love a technological innovation
we are currently developing a wearable
smartphones in the form of a glove our
main aim is to push the boundaries of
wearable telecommunications and move
into a new area of a fully wearable
world people who are into sports or any
other physical activities often struggle
to carry and use their smartphone is
full of usable capacity glove these
aimed at people who engage in sports and
other demanding activities whatever the
situation glove D is right for you both
founders are sparring athletes and faced
a major problem while exercising the
difficulty to use and carry their
smartphone smartwatches and fitness
trackers did not work efficiently for
them the reason these devices must be
paired with an existing smartphone while
operating them multiple issues can arise
no feasible way to initiate a call or
send a text message take videos or
photos or even be able to use popular
applications on a small SmartWatch
display and that pill of Z was born a
wearable smartphone in the form of a
glove can do so much more than just a
regular one we strongly believe that
glove you will exponentially increase
the quality of our lives not only in
sports but also other activities of our
daily routines glovesy is not just a
product it's the platform aiming to
close a gap in emerging technologies in
Internet of Things

people don't want to training because
it's boring and tedious but we are
professional dancers and martial artists
and movement junkies and we want people
to love movement as much as we do there
are a bazillion fitness trackers already
on the market pedometers distance
trackers but there's nothing really out
there that analyzes correct form like
complex movements and atomic bands lets
you do that because us form equals
function and now you can link to a whole
gaming platform that teaches you to pop
and lock you do shaolin kung foo you can
learn how stance we want to be the
duolingo of Luke atomic bands are smart
bluetooth gaming advanced Bluetooth
motion tracking single or multiplayer
options no standing in front of a camera
and most of all these fans teach you
real skills the LED lights an o LED
screen make it as fun as pinball on your
wrist all in a cool yin-yang design
which come together like a temple of
doom horrible so putting them back
together the charge feels cool and so
the players to learn real skills in the
app platform has actually created the
first-ever royalty payment system for
movement artists soap operas can pop
whoosh you guys can punch and flip house
answers can shuffle and make money from
their art this gaming platform actually
supports the arts we now have working
prototypes and designs are ready to
start manufacturing and production but
we need your help to bring atomic bands
to life
atomic bands turbocharged smart

tipped favorite toy when you first turn
it on get pretty excited the first
game tip about the play is space ship

smartphone best when he can properly see
the IR sensors on the ball and chip
