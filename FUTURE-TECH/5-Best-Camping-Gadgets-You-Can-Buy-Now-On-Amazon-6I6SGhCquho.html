innovative design lets you fold this off
flat while remaining completely
assembled using no extra tools it's slim
size when folded
makes it simple to store in a pack or a
gear bag without threat of loss parts
apply the sturdy blade to cut through
larger diameter wood its structure lets
you work with the full length of the
blade for the most efficient use of your
energy replace the standard 12-inch
blade easily when needed
the saws grippy rubber handle stays
firmly in your hand as you go this is
the free skate camp we took the lumen
roll to the next level and adds color
full of new features to give you total
control of your lighting experience
we've added a free button controller and
a wireless remote to manage your colors
brightness and a variety of color
changing modes powered by USB the 5 foot
long lumen real color is portable and
can add a splash of color to any
environment it's also waterproof and
comes with magnets quick boot straps and
a lantern bag giving you the flexibility
to use it anyway
we are solo stove we make lightweight
super efficient camping stoves that run
on the natural resources around you like
twigs and sticks in 2011 we created the
original solo stove a 9-ounce super
efficient backpacking stoves that can
boil a pot of water with literally a
handful of sticks we also created a
number of accessories to go along with
it we have been blown away by all the
positive response people all around the
world love the solo stove the solo stove
is a great stove for one or two people
but we had a lot of customers asking us
for a larger stove so in 2013 we created
the solo stove tightenin a larger solo
stove that can be used for you and your
friends still our customers wanted an
even larger solo stove we heard your
requests and that's why we're creating
our largest stove yet the solo stove
campfire the campfire uses the same
design and technology as the original
patented solo stove but it's bigger
don't worry though it's still super
efficient and weighs only 2 pounds it's
made out of premium stainless steel and
our one-piece construction ensures
durability and quality the campfire is a
perfect stove that your entire group of
friends or whole family can enjoy at the
same time we wanted to bring that
campfire experience and excitement to
all of you who just want a simple and
easy campfire whether it's at a campsite
or in your backyard it's designed with a
double wall which allows air flow
through the bottom holes of the stove to
channel air to the bottom of the fire
and up between the walls of the scope
this preheated air feeding back into the
fire through the smaller holes at the
top of the stove causes a secondary burn
this allows the fire to burn more
complete which results in a more
efficient fire with very little smoke a
more efficient burn also means you'll
use much less wood compared to an open
campfire we are running this Kickstarter
campaign because we need your help our
factory is ready our tooling is done and
our prototypes have been tested
we now need your help to cover the costs
of our first production run if we meet
our goal of $20,000 we will be able to
bring you solo soap campfire this
and it will allow us to continue
building new and better products we have
awesome rewards at all levels including
a custom cooking set just for the solace
of campfire the cooking set comes with
two stainless steel pots which the
Phyllis's campfire can nest in for easy
packing and storage it also includes a
compact aluminum tripod for cooking
soups and stews become a backer and be
the first to experience the solo stove
campfire from the solo stove team to you

stove to all outdoor lovers
