yeah well I don't really know where to
start
Rango was probably the coolest cat on
the face of the planet he used to ride
up to work with me on my motorcycle he
used to go to cafes together I was it
was a pretty cool relationship and
eventually I came across a young no
stuck to a tree saying that they had
found this really beautiful tabby cat
dead on the side of the road I decided
if nobody else had found a way of
tracking cats and dogs then I was
certainly going to so this is pod like
it's the smallest and lightest GPS
tracker in the market has an
interchangeable battery it's waterproof
it has bluetooth but the most important
thing is that this device can be
attached to your animals collar and sync
to your phone allowing you to always
know where your animal is you never have
to worry about losing your pet again
we've spent a lot of time getting the
product design absolutely bang-on the
ergonomic design is really cool with no
sharp edges so it's as comfortable as
possible for the animal the app is a
really slick user experience so it's
both fun and functional to use and we've
squeezed as much as we can out of the
battery life getting up to a week's
usage I don't know you'd be inconsolable
if you lost a dog not knowing where they
are or what they're doing or if they're
alive or well he's that type that tends
to just wander and then we rely on other
people to bring him back but we're
always worried that there'll be a time
when we lose in forever
they're one of the most amazing features
that we've developed is a pet League
which is like a social network for your
animal this is going to allow you to
compare your animals results across the
world so you'll be able to determine
whether you've got the fastest dog in
the park or the most adventurous cat in
the country the app also allows you to
set safe zone alerts so you can actually
see when your animal breaches the set
perimeter through an alert on your phone
you know here just he disappears you
guys on adventures it's cool like that
just to be able to see what he's done
how fast each dog ran and then we can
compare them to see which one's maggie's
faster so we're really excited because
we have confirmed orders from some of
the largest pet retailers in the world
we've finalized the design and we're
just about to go into the final stages
of production we really need some help
in production and that's why we'd like
you to support us in this campaign and
make sure that nobody ever has to go
through the pain of losing their animal
again like I did
buckshot is a small water-resistant
camera they can stick to any surface
glass wood and even marvel the tangible
surface next workshop able to hide an
environment that should never suppress
in life fog shot would take a picture
every 15 seconds automatically the best
thing is to pay back our supporters
pocket is only thirty nine dollars on
Kickstarter
