Urban X is all about fun recreation
freedom and accessibility our dream is
to kick start the bike revolution and
make cycling popular again you can be
part of it together
let's make it happen just wanted to drop
by the world hearing control knobs is a
solid and patent-pending design that
evolves around the concept of a
revolutionary volume adjustment system
with step one you can hear everything
crystal-clear at full volume
step two is perfect for slightly noisy
environments step three has a
state-of-the-art acoustic music filter
with step four you can totally isolate
yourself from your environment hearing
damage is irreversible
nops takes care of your ears
nops is developed by a young startup
company based in Amsterdam
two of them Gwen and Quintin already
have a successful ear protection company
called Thunder plugs which are sold in a
whopping 26 countries worldwide
the other creative masterminds are Arjen
and Richard who had cutting-edge
innovation and design into the mix
together they form the creative backbone
of not an analogue adjustable hearing
solution that is adaptable to every
situation from concert to exam from
festival to construction work notes will
be available in various colors and trims
to perfectly suit your own
style knots control your volume
keeping our home safe is important to
all of us getting your house broken into
sucks it's not just the stuff that you
lose but because your home feels
violated what you want is to keep it
from happening in the first place that's
why we created Cunha help you prevent
break-ins
this is Cunha Cunha is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you so you can see and talk to
them on your smartphone hey could you
leave the package out front a little bit
it's the best way to actively prevent
break-ins most burglaries are crimes of
opportunity the burglars were actually
knock on your door to see if you're home
and when they realize you're not home
they'll attempt to enter your house
keeping them outside is the most
important thing you can do and koona
allows you to do that you can deter
burglars by talking to them or setting
off Kona's alarm yeah no thanks they'll
leave and all this happens when they're
still outside
before they even try to break it making
your home safer shouldn't be a chore for
one of these you have to climb in the
Attic run wires drill holes it's a pain
and it's not cheap that's why we built
Cunha into an outdoor light just replace
your old light fixture it and use your
existing wiring connect to another Wi-Fi
and you're done it'll take 15 minutes
and we want Kona to look good no matter
where it is so we're making it in three
different styles to match your house and
you can put kuna anywhere front door
back door even the garage to watch your
car oh and your light gets smarter too
you can control it with the Cunha app
turn it on turn it off set a schedule or
just let it turn on automatically when
it gets dark when there's a person you
only want to get alerts that matter
Cunha ignores trees and small animals
and it recognizes people's behaviors so
if you don't want to know every time
your spouse goes out jogging
you can tell kuna da alert you only for
visitors waiting at the door
and it'll learn and get smarter over
time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones or the
delivery guy Kona will always let you
know and if it's someone bad now you can
do something about it kuna stop
break-ins before they happen
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
