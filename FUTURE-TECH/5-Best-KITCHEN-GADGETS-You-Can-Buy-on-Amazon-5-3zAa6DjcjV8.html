bolo is a true innovation combining two
of humanity's most important inventions
to date the knife and the wheels
creating a one-of-a-kind rolling knife
your perfect kitchen accessory bolo
makes preparing your meals faster and
easier
the engineered circular blade coupled
with bolos sturdy construction allows
you to achieve chef quality precision in
your cutting and bollo easily tackles
many of the jobs your other knives can't
do the ergonomic handles make bolo more
functional and more comfortable than
your regular kitchen knives as a chef a
product designer and a housewares
manufacturer I've worked with them
studied knives for over 30 years and I
find they all have one common deficiency
the angle of the blade and the grip on
the handle puts too much stress on your
wrist and hands Bowl changes all of that
by placing the force of your hand
directly above the blade you get better
precision cutting while relieving your
hand and wrist from unnatural movements
the result perfectly cut food each and
every time fast and easy and the special
blade break even turns bolo into a
chopper and cleaning bolo could not be
easier just open at both ends remove the
blade and rinse
the

temperature and bake the way for just
golden perfection in only three to four
minutes it's done remove your wafer and
wrap around the Judah's shaper to make
some classic cones send back to the
plate to make another but you don't have
to stop there try tracing them over an
upturned cup or pressing inside a
cupcake pan to make edible bowls for
Sunday's use a cookie cutter to create
thread for ice cream sandwiches and cut
into quarters for beautiful races to top
off any ice cream sundae so let your
creativity flow and why not finish off
