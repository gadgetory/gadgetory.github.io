it's a whole new type of drone we merged
power and smart features making it easy
for everyone to fly and create beautiful
images the toughest challenge for us was
to find the sweet spot between form and
function when engineering the folding
arms we wanted to save as much space as
possible
we really wanted to make it quick to
unfold and leave enough room for the
powerful processors and system system
this took several attempts and many many
prototypes
in one of our earlier prototypes the
arms took up way too much space when
folded almost two-thirds of the entire
volume combined with the space that we
needed for the internals
this meant the Mavic was much larger
than we wanted and another attempt the
amazonian took up half the volume but
there's a lot of wasted space in between
body and arms eventually we solved this
problem and creates an easy flick to
unfold mechanism seam from above the
Phenom sit flush against the body when
folded we carved out two indents at the
rear of the airframe to fit the motors
saving additional space the rear arms
fold out in a three dimensional motion
and snap into place in one sweep with
this design you can have your Maverick
Pro unfolded in under five seconds
powerful components generate a lot of
heat especially when they're placed
close together so for the first time
ever on a DJI drone we integrated a heat
sink at the base made from magnesium
aluminium alloy and a centrifugal fan
behind the gimbal
the fan pulls in air from the front of
the aircraft and shuttles it across to
heatsink dissipating heat we wouldn't go
through all this trouble without making
sure you have a great camera we spent
thousands of hours trying to region air
and shrink the stabilization technology
found in our phantom series one of the
major challenges we ran into when making
a stabilized camera this small was a
stiffness of the electrical wires the
mechanics the structure and the
brushless motors had to be specifically
engineered to take this into account
plus it's the first DJ camera that's
able to rotate 90 degrees for portrait
shots we also wanted a remote controller
for the Maverick Pro that would feel
natural and familiar in people's hands
so they would be more confident when
they fly that's how we came up with a
small controller that expands with a
pair of grips these grips also clamp
your phone keeping all of your controls
in easy reach the Maverick pro
concentrates some of our most advanced
technologies into one compact body it's
an incredible tool to turn everyday
moments into fantastic art wherever you
go
who's America's top robots and their own
maple streaming video keeps us in on the
action those on the approach and in
position did that just come from needles
mouth bounce bodies on the move okay
gonna count labels on control it's safe
to say we have a clear winner me bow
