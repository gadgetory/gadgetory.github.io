photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range and a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot
we built a better way
today's DSLR and mirrorless cameras have
amazing optics and sensors but they do
very little to actually help you take a
good photo
finding the right settings involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created Arsenal the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
arsenal find seven take the best photo
possible Arsenal's AI searches thousands
of images in its database to suggest
good settings next it fine Tunes the
suggestions by analyzing 18 different
factors Arsenal uses state of the art
machine learning to help you take a
great photo in any condition
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo stacking with
Arsenal you can do this in second
capture all the details and scenes with
high dynamic range get everything in
sharp focus and create long exposures
without buying expensive filters using
these advanced techniques Arsenal lets
you go beyond the limitations of your
camera's sensor lens for times when you
want complete control you can wirelessly
adjust manual settings see a live
preview and trigger the shutter all from
up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone and finally
Arsenal makes it easy to capture
stunning time lapses
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing light giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your technique with Arsenal
Arsenal is already being tested in the
field now I need your help to ramp up
production by supporting our campaign
stay you can be one of the first to get
Arsenal we've got exclusive rewards for
our early backers and some awesome
stretch goals in the works I'm really
excited about the photos I've been
getting with Arsenal I can't wait to
share it with you and see all the
amazing photos you'll create
from a very young age I got interested
in plants my dad was a botanist so he
wrote a lot about plants and worked in a
botanical garden and as a kid I would
look at plants and and see them as like
mini universes and there's so much we
don't know about plants about a year ago
I began exploring these concepts of
levitating plants and what's so cool
about magnetism is a force that we we
can't see but we can feel we're
levitating the plant from the ground in
midair and rotating so that it gets
sunlight from all different directions
the idea of a plant not needing soil to
grow really fascinates me and that's
when I got interested in air plants air
plants are plants that grow from the air
they don't require any soil they they
literally take particles from the air
and get nutrients from them I wanted to
create an experience for people in their
homes where they can enjoy plants but in
a new way house plants don't always have
to be the same
and what happens if I levitate this
planet in the air will it grow
differently will grow more who knows
maybe we're gonna discover a new way of
growing plants
you
tres is an action sports tracker it's a
small little device the size of a
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and you mount
your snowboard your surfboard your
wakeboard whatever and tells you how
fast you're going how many waves you've
cut how many calories you burn for
skiing and snowboarding it'll tell you
things like air time how high you're
jumping which lifts you were on a bunch
of other things but basically it
measures your activity
tres will also Auto edit video footage
for you so if you're taking video with a
GoPro or a Sony or a Canon you can
actually put the video into our auto
editor and it'll edit out all the
highlights for you as well as color
correct and overlay your stats all
automatically
definitely some of the differences
between you know some of the other
gadgets that are out there would be that
it's physically mounted audio surfboards
there's nothing that's in your arm or
you know any kind of odd you know stat
that can be thrown in there it's
something that's going to be as close to
the water as possible and so you're
going to get you know the closest
results and if so easy is kind of stick
it on your board and I just like to
trace it and you're good to go
