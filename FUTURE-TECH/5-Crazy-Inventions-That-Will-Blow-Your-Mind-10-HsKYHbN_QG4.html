show but these one-of-a-kind designer
dresses started as a liquid and came
from a cam the liquid fabric is a
suspension of polymers glass additives
and five it if the new technology called
fabric ham and it's the result of an
unexpected 10-year chemistry detour for
fashion designer menil Torres clothe
myself became is Kayla because is in
fashion woman's work I'm a doctor in
woman's work my nails Eureka moment came
from another famous break and product
basically I was a friend's wedding and
she was all over the spray with big
Philistine material and I thought one
cannot create using the technology of
Australian public a me and that will be
an instant nonwoven fabric and
everything is started from the head he
took those principles and created fabric
am mixing tiny natural and synthetic
fibers with liquid polymers inside an
aerosol cans it turns into a nonwoven
fabric and goes on like a second skin
especially when it gets in contact with
the air it's a living on into this
instant nonwoven material it starts as
pure chemistry but in the hands of a
designer transforms into art while so
it feels like a bracing morning air you
would say work fun it takes like suppose
like that's the type bother you feel
very secure and it basically and it's
quite quite quite comfortable feeling
rather than I suppose having a body will
you be dying in the corset it's quite
liberating in the way it can be removed
washed and re worn or if you prefer just
dissolve it and start over fashion is
only the tip of the liquid fabric
iceberg change up the recipe and it
could be a medical marvel one of the
main characteristics of be able to have
a liquid fabric contain an inertial is
that make this material totally
sterilized so that you have great
advantages to be able to be a boon
dressing also an instant bandage another
big element is that it you can add
nanotechnology even drugs merry seems to
be able to have an instant such as
example a next internship or how about
spring a new chair into a business then
be able to use the specific material of
a cast to be able to create for nature
or sitting with interior designers even
on a life you know they to be able to
have a hard life and again the material
is totally non flammable but now even
figures that the same liquid fabric that
makes it toward dress could clean up an
oil spill it works very well with Mina's
changes to be able to expect on large
scale that could be on the sea on a
large lake of which they have a problem
of a village and then basically it will
be a good way to control the spillage so
that you know you have this public that
is floating is absorbing as we can see
the oil and also it will be very easy to
clean it off afterwards with so many
possibilities you think spray on fabric
could rev
Lucian eyes the 21st century the way the
sewing needle did for modern
civilization one of the big technologies
is the sewing needle the way that's why
I exist because we managed to you know
join you know the fairs and be able to
start to weave and on and on so that you
know we could keep the clothes you know
to prevent us from the Coleman I'm
thinking that the aerosol can is a new
way to create new instance sterilized
fabrics that I don't know who knows it
could be the new favor of our future
generations that's a pretty tall order
but my nails immediate plan is to take
fabric and way beyond the catwalk the
thing for me will be to be able to see
the display on fabric use on the medical
wall in the automotive industry in the
fashion industry it will be so fun
nowadays almost everything is code
encrypted your phone your iPad your
Wi-Fi your suitcase the door of your
building and of course your credit card
has a digit code for sure it's better to
be safe by the way how safe is your
wallet in your own home for example have
you ever realized you were missing some
cash or is it safe in your own bedroom
your credit card number never ended up
on the internet without your consent at
the office are you really sure nobody
can sneak in your wallet and violate
your privacy then we realized there was
one item that we don't secure enough our
wallets this is why we created and are
proud to present the many safe wallet
the first code encrypted pocket-sized
vault including a locking system with a
thousand different combination
possibilities and a choose your own
system it's amazing how much progress
has been made in terms of tracking
systems
lately that's why we propose the option
to embed your wallet with a tracking
system to ensure you never lose it again
it's also guarded with RFID blocking
technology your contactless cards will
be kept safe and protected from
electronic pickpockets the lock is made
out of metal for maximum reliability it
is extremely handy thanks to its fan
shape interior giving easy access to all
your cards which are stored and well
sorted it can hold US dollars and euros
and fit up to 12 cards we've been
working on this idea for the past two
years with professional engineers to
reinvent and develop the locking system
to adapt it to a wallet it's very light
and strong thanks to its conception and
high quality materials we've also been
working with the designer Erik virtus
and his design agency in Paris to make
this wallet aesthetically beautiful and
practical in its use so if you think
this is a great product for yourself
your friends or relatives we would love
to have you on board as a backer and
don't forget better to be safe
treasured photos used to have a special
place in our homes we took the time to
frame them and display them proudly but
today we share hundreds of photos a year
on emails and social networks our most
meaningful family photos can get lost in
the north we wanted to create an easy
way to surprise our loved ones with
photos especially now that we live far
away and don't see them nearly as
possible so we wondered could we create
a device that let us take pictures on
our phones and beam them in into our mom
or dad's living room months of work
later were thrilled to launch skylight a
new way to delight your family with soda
check out how it works step one find a
special moment to capture step to take a
photo and send it to your unique
skylight email address step 3 just a few
seconds later your photo appears on your
loved ones highlights but of them having
to lift a finger he just made mom's day
the best part is that everyone in your
family can send photos to mom skylight
and if other loved ones have skylights
do you can send your photo to as many of
them as you want hi I'm Ben hi I'm mommy
I'm free catalog and I'm Michael we all
met his graduate student here at Harvard
and have been working at the Harvard
Innovation Lab to develop skyla we felt
guilty for not sharing photos often
enough with our family members far away
and we wanted to build something really
special for them so we spent the last
year developing skylight to be an
awesome new way to surprise our families
with photos skylight is effortless
peeves it takes less than 60 seconds to
set up he just connected to Wi-Fi in one
simple step from there sending a photo
to skylight is as easy as sending email
and photos arriving 60 seconds or less
the touchscreen makes it easy to swipe
through photos and if you love a
particular photo just tap the heart
button and Pilate sends an email to
thanks December we made our first 40
skylights at hand in the common room
aboard of our dorm and they sold out in
less than three days since then we've
spent nine months getting ready to take
skylight to the next level but to do
that we need your help we've lined up a
world-class manufacturing partner in
shenzhen china and all we needed to fund
me to start of our production line we
are a team of hardware engineers and
product managers who are passionate
about creating simple transformative
from similar products we would love your
help in green sky light into the world
and are excited to give you guys our
backers a skylight of your own to share
with your local we think skylight can
become the new family photo the place
where treasured photos live inside our
homes thank you so much for your support
we could not be more excited to kind of
food
today everything is becoming mobile we
live in a world that people are
constantly on the go and I running their
tourists everywhere but there's one
office tool that is still stuck behind
it hasn't changed in the past decade and
is in mobile we're talking about the
printer we looked at printers today and
we saw big bulky Boston with a printed
inside moving from left to right then we
thought why not just take this printed
out and put it on a robot when you first
started thinking about creating the
printer the most important thing fast
was that it should be small we knew we
had to utilize every single inch we
wanted the pocket-sized printer that can
print on any size of paper precise
images young people can take it
everywhere and musics not owning the
office or at home the printers covers
made of polycarbonate with a glossy
finish we have two options one is in
Mars legs to the other expand my I
started working on the mechanical
configuration how to look inside and how
to consider the motor is so it will be
as small as possible and as accurate as
much we had to keep it smooth everything
was designed prior to building on
computer we have initial mechanical
prototype we have our initial code as
about 10 x 10 x 8 centimeters our
initial prototype is aimed for grayscale
images and text the prototype aims were
printing a page on under a minute we are
using a special Buddhist protocol which
allows us to be able to print from any
device it means that no drivers will be
needed to print on a regular a for paper
if you have multiple pages it will hold
and it will tell you to change of it
we started working on this project at
our college basically at the convergence
or initial challenge we receive the
initial funding and the help and
guidance of the college's professors in
order to work on this we've been working
hard and we built several prototypes for
the robot and we have a design for
manufacturing proto fact all designed
out now we need your support so we can
start ordering and working on the
smaller and stronger custom-made part in
order to make this robot even smaller
and make this incredible device in
reality thank you for your support
