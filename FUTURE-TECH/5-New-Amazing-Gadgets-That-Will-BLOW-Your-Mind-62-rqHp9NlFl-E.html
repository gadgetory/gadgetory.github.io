lucky gnomes hi Kickstarter I'm Avril
over the past year me and my partner
John have been working hard to bring you
ding a beautiful simple smart doorbell
for your home the idea is a simple one
when you press the doorbell button you
hear a chime in your home like a normal
doorbell but you also receive a call to
your smartphone allowing you to talk
with the person at the front door from
wherever you are in the world
whether you rent your flat out on Airbnb
you're out of earshot in the garden or
even on holiday you carry your doorbell
wherever you go is right there in your
pocket you'll never miss your door again
currently doorbells are unloved and
forgotten objects they don't work with
how we lead our busy lives that we
control through our smartphones we want
to fix this for you you should control
ding - our smartphone app this allows
you to set the kind of time you have
look at caller history and even set some
quiet time when you don't want to wake
up the household we've worked for over a
decade in the design and technology
industries and design is really
important to us we don't want to make
just another plastic box that sits in
the corner of your room we want to make
ding something really special that
complements your home rather than
distract him from it who did spend a lot
of time trying to find the right finish
and color for ding whether it was for
the chime which had to feel really it
belong inside the home so we made it
really friendly and warm using the
fabric for example though both haven't
really changed in 50 years it's about
moving a kind of doorbell from something
that you only able to interact with when
you're in the home to actually something
that you can use from anywhere we've had
some great support in developing ding
from both the UK Design Council and from
John Lewis a leading department store in
the UK from a John Lewis perspective
it's the perfect product you know we are
really excited about new innovation
coming our way and given the kind of the
big boom that we're seeing around smart
home we think this place perfect it's
that trend
we believe ding will change the way
people think about smart homes making it
more about the home and less about the
tech inside with our manufacturing
partners we're almost ready for
production so if you want to be one of
the first to own ding check out our page
below
there's several rewards feed to choose
from including ordering your very own
ding we hope you're all as excited about
ding as we are and we're looking forward
to bringing it to you very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
