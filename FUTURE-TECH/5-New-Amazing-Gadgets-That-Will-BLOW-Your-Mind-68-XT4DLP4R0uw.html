feed our cats inspired by nature based
in science loved by cats the noble
feeding systems
I'm veterinarian dr. Liz bales did you
know that how your cats eat is just as
important as what your cats eat that's
why I invented an enlightened and
natural way to feed your cats that keeps
them both happy and healthy I call it
the no bowl feeding system with the no
bowl feeding system you get five no
bowls a trainer and a portion filler
once trained use the dry food you're
feeding now portioned into each of the
five no bowls and hide them your hungry
cat will find each one eat the entire
portion then rest until hunger
stimulates your cat to go hunting again
and don't forget to pick up that old
bowl because you won't be needing it
anymore
is your cat lazy obese waking you up at
night scarfing and barfing destroying
your furniture of killing wildlife these
problems can start because you feed them
from a bowl when you lose the bowl and
let your cats hunt you decrease anxiety
improve portion control eliminate scarf
and barf increase exercise and your cat
returns to a healthy weight your cat
stays active and entertained while
you're at work and is happy hunting
while you're sleeping we designed our
product using cutting-edge techniques
putting a premium on safety and ensuring
that your cat will be happy and healthy
then we ran an extensive trial with a
devoted group of households including
multi cat single cat with cats young and
old the noble feeding system is ready
but we need your help help us reach our
Kickstarter goal so we can bring the
noble feeding system to your cat and
every cat
the nimble urban is a human-powered
scooter with a front-loading cargo rack
that helps you easily carry your stuff
over short distances hello I'm Alex
co-founder of nimble scooters two years
ago we launched our first cargo scooter
the nimble classic we got a lot of great
feedback on it but people were telling
us that they wanted something a little
smaller lighter and more versatile so we
designed the nimble urban it's a brand
new way to get around your neighborhood
or use on the job when you need to carry
something
it comes with custom-made bungee straps
so they can use it with all sorts of
containers boxes or your own baskets we
designed the nimble urban so that
anybody can ride it easily it's very
stable has an incredibly smooth ride
people who have never ridden kick
scooters before hop on and find it
really easy to steer even with 50 pounds
of cargo on it we even made it so you
can attach any standard bicycle
saddlebag or accessories what's cool is
that you can take it with you wherever
you go you can ride right into a store
and use it as a shopping cart in office
buildings elevators which means you can
keep an eye on the scooter and your
cargo at all times it folds in half so
if you have a small apartment or want to
bring it in a car you can store it
easily what I love about being able to
put all of your things on the nimble
Evan is that it really takes the load
off of your back and shoulders we don't
realize how much weight we often carry
from bags and things on a daily basis
but it's a lot scooting with the nimble
urban makes me feel lighter and happier
the linkage steering system connects the
front wheel and the steering column
allowing you to make sharp turn safely
even with a cargo loop that's what makes
our screen
we want to help people get out there be
more active and interact with the
community life is busy we all have
places to go things to get the nimble
urban can help you do those things more
efficiently so you have more time to
enjoy life
we truly believe the nimble urban can
make a difference in their life building
cargo scooters that help people carry
the things they care about is our
passion join our adventure hop on the
ride and please support us in any way
you can right here right now

the hurricane 9 is the world's coolest
new fetch toy it's time to reinvent your
game of fetch with this 100-plus foot
gravity-defying flying ring launcher dog
owners already loved the hurricane eye
hi this is my dog Sharkey and these are
your average dog toys frisbees no
interest trick it's bone
as soon as I become outlook he goes
crazy oh he doesn't want to take the
ball he just want to taste the frisbee
the hurricane 9 ring launcher built to
give your dog maximum exercise in just a
fraction of the time it's made from
durable
evie a foam which is built to withstand
the sharpest teeth you don't have to
replace the rings after just one game of
fetch forget about those slobbery tennis
balls
the hurricane 9 works indoors it floats
and yeah you could take it to the dog
park all dogs love the hurricane 9 even
if your dogs not typically the type to
chase a tennis ball within months after
launch the hurricane 9 was already
featured on the news and it was selected
as a top 5 must-have toy at the San
Diego pet expo did I mention it was
invented by rocket scientists
hi I'm John Hunter co-inventor of the
hurricane 9 I work at high speed
airplanes Solar airplanes and now the
world's most bodacious dog toys and one
day I was working on a sporty good that
would fly a really long ways based on an
airplane wing like this taking
everything wrapped into a circle and
flies the country mile I took it to my
daughter's house and just for fun I
tried it in front of her dog Amos and he
was went crazy so I immediately realized
after about 20 more shots that Amos
really liked this thing
we had a great dog toy in our hands here
we go dogs here are the nameks 101 while
we've been teaching dogs we've been
talking to dog trainers too something
really great about this toy is that I
also float so if you have an active dog
who likes the water would be a great
idea as well
like most of us Emma's owner is a busy
person and so she doesn't get that daily
exercise a study show is proven to make
a healthy happy pub and so she's left a
dream of that blissfully exhausting game
of fetch
after just two launches your dog has
already run the length of a whole
football field and it's easy to use you
just load the ring pull it back and
release and to use it inside just pull
it back part of the way and if you're
feeling old-fashioned just throw it
without the launcher you go tiger it
also doubles as a great training egg
the hurricane 9 comes with three rings
with six rings or with six rings sold
separately
the hurricane nine is now for sale at
hurricane 9.com so your dog could be
flying through the air with a better
workout a better toy and a lot more fun
for two years today and share us with
your other dog owning friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
