to turn your home into a smart home you
can effectively take any product and
turn it into a smart product plug it
right in to the two smart outlets

wink app you'll be able to quickly turn
each one of these products on and off
right from your smartphone if you see
that you forgot to turn your lamp off

it off you can schedule things to turn
on and off on there as well so say you
have a lamp plugged into it by midnight

just take the form of a regular outlet
it takes the form of one of the most
inventive power strips in the world
everyone's had the problem of their
adapter being too large to fit within a
standard palster

by allowing the power strip to bend and
move those adapters out of the way of
one another it flexes so you could fit
all of your power bricks and all the
different appliances right into your
power strip now it's just a hell of a
lot smaller whose power genius was
