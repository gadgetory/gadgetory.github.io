can just stick it anywhere you don't
need mounts you don't need a big selfie
stick you can just stick it up there and
take shots from above or just right in
front and your hands are free to do
whatever koto uses a special micro
suction pad it'll work on walls windows
a pole basically on anything and it's
not a tape so you can stick unstick and
just wipe with water to use again oh
that's pretty cool to wash it wet your
finger like this and wipe carefully you
can feel the dirt rolling off let it dry
and you're good to go even better if you
use a blow dryer a hand dryer all the
grippy features loosen up and the pad
will work good as new for extra
flexibility there's a strong magnet in
there too so that's how Poteau sticks

I'd like to introduce you to a pair of
completely different wireless headphones
that integrate music calls and
information so naturally into your
senses you'll hardly notice they're
there you never have to take them off
because they don't affect your natural
hearing when they're not switched on
giving you the ability to listen to
music make calls and much more with
on-demand voice commands and unlike
other he Robles the battery life is
measured not in hours but days this is
what we think wireless headphones should
be this is high
we think the biggest problems with
headphones are that they block your
natural hearing and you have to carry
them with you putting them on and taking
them off when all you really want is
just to be able to make a call or listen
to music we've solved this problem with
a completely new type of virtually
invisible earbud which combines high
quality speakers for sparkling travels
and vibrating elements for rich deep
bass this means you get amazing sound
that augments your natural hearing but
when high isn't playing anything you
don't even notice it's there plus the
fact that we've put all the supporting
electronics behind your ear means that
we've managed to cram in five times the
battery power of other leading he rebels
so you can listen day after day before
recharging all day where means that you
can check the weather monitor your well
being set reminders or search the web
with voice commands and most importantly
expand your ability to enjoy music and
conversation with anyone any time
without ever having to take your phone
out of your pocket plus we're working on
loads more features like being able to
record and share your audio experiences
or listen to music together wirelessly
we think hi will change the way you
think about personal audio we've
partnered with award-winning product
development consult cpdt
we bring world-renowned design and
manufacturing experience and crowd
funded projects to global brands to help
us bring this revolutionary product to
you please back this project so we can
complete the final factory ready design
I start making and shipping hi to you so
you can experience what wireless
headphones can really be thank you
you
thanks for your purchase at the no key
padlock to help you get the most out of
your lock I'd like to highlight some of
its key features it's the smartest
padlock out there and just like the name
implies it requires no key to open it
instead of using traditional keys or
combinations this lock opens using a
Bluetooth enabled device such as your
smartphone tablet or even an Apple watch
the no key works in conjunction with our
no key app which is found on Apple
Android and Windows devices the app not
only allows access to the lock via
Bluetooth but also lets the user invite
guests to have shared access to the lock
by sending them virtual keys in addition
to that the app will keep a history of
the lock so the user can monitor who
accessed their lock and even see where
and when that access took place being
able to track what's going on with your
lock and then make adjustments remotely
not only brings convenience to security
but it also adds a new level of control
which is what makes the no key the
perfect choice for locking your
possessions hello there I'm John McAfee
bound to the McAfee Antivirus company
since leaving the company I've become
part of a bigger and better things this
is my new product every key this is my
phone I have to type a password into it
a hundred times a day but with this I
never have to type another password
again and it's not just the key to my
phone or my laptop this is not just the
key to my online accounts or the key to
my car or the key to my house it's my
everything I am the man who's obsessed
with security and so is every key
nothing is more secure and if I lose it
I can remotely freeze it show me another
key that can do that so it's your choice
all of this or just one everything
welcome
to the revolution of access control
welcome to every German it's my knee
best friend I love my high this is
called the H eye massager or high
massager it was originally developed to
help women with post c-section pain it
was effective at relieving that
discomfort but it had an unexpected side
effect without direct genital
stimulation women claim to have
experienced some of the most intense
orgasms ever so you can keep it during
our research we found that learning a
few key skills can dramatically improve
the quality of life for couples other
researchers have found similar
conclusions in fact a recent study of
over 8,000 people found those who
enjoyed their lives most consistently
had two characteristics while some would
think it would be wealth or fame that
actually had nothing to do with it the
happiest people basically got enough
sleep and had a great sex life I just
really wanted to Reese Park things
between us but nothing seemed to work
and they were doing research on intimacy
with couples and they had this product
called hi and an online intimacy program
hi I'm dr. Steve Magee and I'm doctor
Wendy Meade you
we're clinical sexologist and the
founders of women a couples wellness we
discovered the method behind hi
accidentally in 2009 since then we've
worked with several thousand people
testing and refining
with high I can get a great all-over
body massage with my clothes on and then
decide from there if I want to keep
going which usually I do some of the
guys were talking about hi at work and
making fun of me saying I was going to
become obsolete but the truth is when I
take care of her she just wants me more
and now the guys are asking me where
they can get one too but they can't
borrow ours
oh my god it feels so good
well
yeah well where's my Valentina yeah I
know me too I don't smell down holy crap
that's one thing out for high not only
provides an amazing experience for
yourself and your partner it's also part
of an easy to learn system that will
revolutionize your sex life
we've been having lately have been when
she's been using this device it's been
miss her going crazy and just can't take
it anymore and it's been amazing it
really hasn't brought that that fiery
spark back in with our sex life that we
needed I have never had anything that
relaxed me and it made me feel so good
so fast I got this because I thought it
would make things more interesting for
the women I date and it does I feel like
one if he exercises my soulmate again

single our goal is to help you become an
amazing lover we've been featured in
prevention Reader's Digest women's
health Redbook the doctors in many other
media outlets we're doing for women's
