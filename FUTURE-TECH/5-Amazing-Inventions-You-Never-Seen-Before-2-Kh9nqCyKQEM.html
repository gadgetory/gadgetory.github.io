hey there this is Alice itachi today I'm
going to show you our new type C power
meter what this will do is measure power
input or power output to your type C
device I'll show you how it works here
so I've got my power bank and my type C
cable
so what I'm going to do is connect the
type-c cable to the power meter and then
plug it into my macbook pro you'll see
this the tachi logo come up here and on
this readout it will measure the voltage
and volts the current and amps as well
as the current over time in milliampere
that's flowing into the macbook pro now
let's change modes and we'll show you
how to measure output power so I'll grab
my sitaji hub over here plug this into
the power meter then plug my power meter
into the macbook then I grab my iPhone
and plug this in to the hub you'll be
able to see on the screen of the power
meter that arrow has changed directions
so it's measuring output power now so
again it'll give you the same the
voltage the current as well as the
milliamp hours so this device is really
useful for testing your accessories and
peripherals to make sure that they're
operating at their advertised
specifications this will let you weed
out if you have any counterfeit products
or any products that aren't functioning
as they should as well as showing you if
you're charging your type C device such
as the MacBook Pro will show you how
many milliamp hours have charged over
time as well as showing the drain how
many milliamp hours have left the
MacBook Pro to charge the icon so yes
that's our new type C power meter hope
you guys liked it let me know in the
comments if you have any questions and
check us out on our website the touch
net as well as Facebook Twitter and
Instagram thanks enough a good day
two years ago we pitched an idea not
just a 3d printer
not just a milling machine
not just the 3d scanner
but a new way to make things when we
introduce the top dozen one year ago who
wanted to push the envelope on personal
fabrication and 3d printing today we're
ready to make another step forward in
the collection introducing fab totem
prism
you
fab totem prism is a new sterile
lithography 3d printing technology it's
an affordable yet high-quality solution
that works without expensive optics
prints small details on a huge printing
volume
get ready print unprecedented design
freedom and choose among different
materials and technologies it's time to
think bigger personal fabrication will
change the way things are designed in
may we have the skills and the ingenuity
needed to fulfill this vision support
this project together we can make it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
