kram a long time ago your cables would
fall to the ground
every day you would struggle to get them
back but one day your struggle ended you
met the maus magnetics organization
system this abducted accessory elegantly
holds your cables right where you want
them it has a micro suction base to keep
it from sliding off the desk it also
comes with some metal cable ties just in
case some of your cables doesn't have
enough mathematicians for the month so
no more cable man enjoying our demise
does with a month and always have your
cables ready when you need them you can
use it on your desk nice dance wall and
pretty much in or out you have cables

over comm today we're going to be taking
a look at our keyring charger this is a
great way to charge or sync your mobile
devices this particular one is designed
for Apple devices so it has a USB
connector on one side and a lightning
connector on the other side but I'm
going to show you this product in action
here so you can see what really makes it
unique and that is of course on my key
ring
so I'll just zoom in so you can get a
little closer look so what I really like
about this product is that it's firstly
it's ultra small it's not going to
tangle and it has a magnetic loop so
that it can easily close with a positive
lock there and it's also very easy to
remove from the keyring now I know that
personally I often lose my lightning
cables but I never lose my keys so by
combining the two I'm sure that I'm
always able to charge and sync my mobile
device on the go it's available in four
different colors as you can see and you
can buy them individually as well it
outputs 5 volts 1.5 amps that's standard
charging voltage and amperage and of
course it's available in a micro USB
connector for your Android devices
it doesn't have to go on a keyring it
could definitely go on something else I
actually have a backpack with me today
just to give you an example of what it
looks like you know on another here we
go here here is on a backpack easy to
put on easy to take off and very hard to
lose once again this is the ER bow
keyring charger and it's for your mobile
devices Apple or Android and thank you
for watching
