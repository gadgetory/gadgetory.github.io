expose for race day showing off the new
shift watchband way edge gear
the showroom floor to get a sense of how
people are reacting so that the new
watch band so you're wearing the new
shift watch band by edge gear what does
the difference feel like what do you
think wearing it I like it because I can
just see everything in my normal range
of motion probably fine yeah totally
comfortable I don't even know what's on
I kind of like how this is just here on
my thumb kind of forget that it's there
it is cool to just look down and see it
much easier it's it's Aries the viewing
angle is much improved like I can just
look down and it's right there it's
facing up at me it still lights up the
screen when I move my arm during cycling
when you're in a narrow position the
watch is over here so you're kind of
turning your wrist a lot for cycling and
running I think it really pretty
comfortable have a long-sleeve shirt on
yes they're like lift it up to look at
your watch this is kind of cool I know
when I have my son toe on that when
you're riding you have to actually get
one hand off and look at your watch you
put it on got it easy and this is really
easy more than 40% of our lives are
spent in habit for most of us that time
is wasted the secret to transformation
is not to try harder it's to replace bad
habits with the habits of excellence if
you wanted to transform yourself how
would you start first identify the
habits that hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shock each surge of
voltage trains your brain and weakens
the neural connection until the bad
habit is severed next replace the bad
habit with a positive one reward
yourself when you complete your daily
goal commit to a penalty if you fail the
fear of loss stimulates your basal
ganglia while the chance of reward
motivates your prefrontal cortex in
fewer than 30 days the action becomes
habit pavlok is the first system
designed to help you build good habits
and break bad ones earn rewards when you
succeed pay the price when you fail and
experience the electric shock that keeps
you on track contribute to the
crowdfunding campaign today hi I'm Annie
Satie founder of pavlok now I know that
electric shock sounds crazy but
sometimes crazy works like many
revolutionary ideas ours started off
just as a fun project but it turned into
something much more together with my
co-founder Jim Lynch we set out to
create Pavlov the world's first device
that doesn't just track what you do but
actually changes what you do here you
see pavlok in its wristband form but at
its core hablok is a small module it's
small enough that it can stick anywhere
on your body
now padlock is able to vibrate beep and
even electrically shocked you on command
but what padlock can do is much more
instead of me telling you what I'd like
and you let me show you what padlock is
already done
hi my name is David Goldstein I'm hoping
to use padlock to get me into a better
exercise routine I am a cancer survivor
I've had heart attack I was in a
wheelchair for a while and I still have
some paralysis in both legs as you can
see I've put on a great deal of weight
and I'm hoping that bad luck can help me
address all of those issues I am at 65
days at the past 70 woman of using the
padlock system I am down 7 pounds my
arms have got noticeably stronger and my
legs are actually the Strongs they've
been since I was paralyzed in 2001
go play my kids more at the end of the
day it's now just part of who I am and
what I do you see most of us just don't
know what greatness feels like we assume
that we're gonna do what we've always
done but users like David tell a
different story
when they begin to fall back into the
old routine Pavlov Schultz them out of
it in most cases their old routine can
be replaced if he was in 30 days people
are already using Pavlov to begin
writing everyday to learn new languages
to exercise to journal to begin to form
and break dozens of new habits in fact
there's infinite capabilities thanks to
padlocks open developer API I know
firsthand how powerful small habit
changes can be and I'm excited to share
Pavlov with the world
that's where IndieGoGo supporters like
you come in we built the padlock
prototype we'd begun testing on users
now we need your help begin setting up
manufacturing so we can deliver pavlok
and help it change the habits that
matter most to you

you
double the spirals and double the fun
with the oXXO handheld two blade
spiralizer with this spiralizer you can
create pasta like dishes curly fries
that you can bake or even garnishes the
spiralizer features two stainless-steel
color-coded blades with an open blade
design Green for 1/8 inch spaghetti
curls and orange for 1/4 inch fettuccine
spirals it has a non-slip grip for
comfort and a food holder to protect
hands when in use that doubles as a
cover for safe storage to begin twist to
remove both blades and food holder from
the spiralizer select the blade you want
to use and twist to secure onto the
non-slip body cut the ends of the fruit
or vegetables so they're flat and even
and place the flat end against the blade
apply pressure while twisting the
vegetable clockwise to get long uniform
spirals spiralizing works best when the
produce is straight and at least one and
a half inches in diameter that the
produce is longer than six inches just
cut it in half if it isn't naturally
straight cut it into straight sections
when you start to reach the end of the
fruit or vegetable use the food holder
for safety to keep your fingers away
from the sharp blade a few twists later
you have a plate of delicious and
healthy vegetable noodles that you can
dress up however you'd like the
spiralizer comes apart for easy cleaning
is dishwasher safe and locks together
for storage here's a good tip use your
spiralizer to make dicing vegetables
quicker and easier by using an ox
apparent knife to cut your veggie
noodles after spiralizing
hey guys I'm Jeff hi guys I'm Helmut
I think it's amazing how many people had
the same experience with their earbuds
it definitely is you know in your blood
problem you know they're falling out you
can tell people are kind of pushing them
back in or they're uncomfortable they
make your ears tender so we needed to
create a solution in that solution is it
your hooks when you're running you know
outside or when you're working out in
the gym you want something's gonna stay
with you as an active person you want to
achieve that focus where you can push
yourself to a limit that you've never
been before and why be distracted by an
earbud when you don't have to be and we
don't want you to think that this is
only for athletes this problem of
earbuds falling out is so common so what
we've created with ear hooks is a
universal attachment that connects to
almost all in-ear circular earbuds that
increases their fit increases their
comfort as far as design goes we really
looked at every piece of your hook and
you can see we've got a shark fin design
on the top here which we call the tip
this piece is what disperses a lot of
the weight of the actual earbud you see
you've got the elastic tire here which
stretches on and off we've did a lot of
testing we relentlessly tweaked and
changed the design we prototyped over 20
different ear hooks throughout the
process the testing ranged from running
cycling swimming surfing we really tried
to do everything we could to make sure
that these ear hooks could endure and
with every environment that they would
ever see we were very thoughtful in our
design process each step of the way
we've redesigned and we've reproduced
and we've retested and we know now that
we have a product that is passing all
those tests with flying colors the same
way athletes push themselves to be great
at what they do
we've pushed ourselves to make your
hooks great at what they do
right now your hooks are something that
not too many people know about but the
people that do know about it have had a
great response we want to share this
product with the world and we can only
do that with your help we're hoping this
will be a collaboration we're hoping to
learn more about our product from all of
you when I hear some stories from you
guys and you know really make this a
great product together when you talk
about listening to music it makes you
want to move and with your hooks you
finally can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
