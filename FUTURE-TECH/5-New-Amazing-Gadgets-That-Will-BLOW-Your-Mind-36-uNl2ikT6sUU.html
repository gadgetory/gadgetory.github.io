breath vitally then coaches you to
breathe in sync with your hearts natural
rhythm it's doing this stops your body's
unconscious reaction to stress before it
starts and this breathing technique can
also be used to proactively but deeper
focus or relaxation for me it's
interesting to be wearing the bra and
looking at emails and seeing how my
heart is reacting to just having to
filter through emails with this bra I'm
able to monitor my stress and do things
that can allow me to reduce stress
throughout the days and really know what
my triggers are so that I can change my
day as I'm noticing the patterns but
good breathing is impossible without
good posture mythili can sense your body

straighten up better posture is proven
to lead to better focus and confidence

hi dick are you in front of your webcam
right now most people use their webcam
for social innovative features such as
Skype and FaceTime but did you know that
people with much different intentions
may be using your webcam to more and
more reports warned us about such
occurrences bringing the importance of
covering your webcam to an all-time high
so you want to cover your webpage but
why does it have to be ugly and
impractical
we designed a sleek and simple gadget
that is leaving the practical teams get
enough to close your laptop cell
removing it and complement the design of
your device introducing the slide slide
webcam cover a beautiful gadget that's
better than a paper clip and made of
durable stainless steel you can
effortlessly slide it open and close
where we please and it is remarkably
easy to install on your laptop desktop
and tablet our webcam cover will make
web cam spying impossible so whether
you're in a business meeting discussing
classified files or in the comfort of
your own home using the patient device
you can feel safe the spy slide webcam
cover is the most elegant and practical
way to cover your webcam thank you for
watching our video the red stars
direction and therefore we need your
support please expect some IndieGoGo so
we can provide you with the most elegant
flexible velcome cover
life is about human connection our
strongest bonds are with family but you
can't always be there with them and
calling doesn't give you that same
feeling there are a lot of things you
enjoy doing together and you can't see
through a call so we made Omni the robot
that makes these things possible even if
you live miles away
omni's in like a phone call or ordinary
video chat they're there in the robot
you have the control to move and look
around and this frees up the other side
from having to scoff and answer a call
you can just join in no matter what
they're doing no more phone tag or
scheduling a call like a meeting our
testers are using Omni to do awesome
stuff like cook together hang out for a
barbecue or even watch a whole movie
together it's the stuff they never do
with Skype or FaceTime because it's just
way too cumbersome and the coolest part
is that none of this was planned out of
time as soon as they got the bot these
experiences just happen naturally we
want to make a home robot that's not
just a toy but something built to last
can be truly useful week after week our
design philosophy has two main parts and
the first is the maximise of the human
connection so omni's made to be human
height to give you that most natural
view of the world people on the other
side can look straight at you talk to
you just like normal we really wanted to
enhance present a feeling that someone's
there with you so we designed Omni with
a moving neck and a seamless control
interface we call motion map the neck
may seem subtle but we thought it really
makes the experience
or engage a lot more human so the second
part of our design philosophy is to
minimize all hassle because nothing
should get in the way of the Omni
experience setup is simple unfold
connect to Wi-Fi and call in with just
one click
there's no software install we also made
on these super quiet so you can hang out
for a long time without bugging anyone
and if you need to move it around it's
like you can take upstairs move it out
in the patio or pull it up into your car
you don't to worry about keeping it
charged when you're finished press one
button to auto dock Omni is different
right down to its materials and how we
make it resource sustainable bamboo when
we use sudden anodized aluminum another
cool thing is we use additive
manufacturing to build omni in a
scalable and efficient way we're doing
it all in-house to keep it lean that
means less risk
you've already been shipping omni to
test users around the world for over a
year
we're also back there's like you tired
of campaigns over-promising and
under-delivering so that's why we waited
to launch our campaign until now after
two years and nine generations of
prototypes we're super passionate about
bringing families closer and with your
support we can bring the omni experience
to everyone join our campaign and enjoy
omni with your own family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
