and when quarters only give you a few
minutes times can be tough add an
expensive parking ticket on top of that
and you're gonna have a bad day how
great would it be if our phones could
help us avoid things like this a where
car is a free app for iOS and Android
devices that makes your smartphone

need is this device just put it in your
glove box

approach drive and leave the car when
you approach your car a where car will
even show Google Maps on the lockscreen
for single swipe launch
if you're in a hurry a where car can
easily find where your last parts you
don't have to do anything it happens
automatically if you're parked in a
metered spot a where car automatically
asks you to enter the amount of time
that you paid for plus when you're too
far to walk back to your car before the
time is up
we have alerts you
a $10 investment to avoid expensive
parking tickets makes a lot of sense did
you leave the garage open
did you let the dog out
did you put the groceries away
neatness cam you can set it up and
connect it to Wi-Fi in less than a
minute

talk back Henry
bad boy
it lets you see once the lights go out
so you can take care of the things that
go bump in the night
and with a nest aware subscription you
can even go back in time to save the
moments you want to remember nest can
keep an eye on what matters to you from
anywhere

keeping our home safe is important to
all of us getting your house broken into
sucks it's not just the stuff that you
lose but because your home feels
violated what you want is to keep it
from happening in the first place
that's why we created Cunha help you
prevent break-ins
this is Cunha Cunha is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you so you can see and talk to
them on your smartphone hey could you
leave the package out front we're a
little busy it's the best way to
actively prevent break-ins most
burglaries are crimes of opportunity the
burglars were actually knock on your
door to see if you're home and when they
realize you're not home they'll attempt
to enter your house keeping them outside
is the most important thing you can do
and koona allows you to do that
you can deter burglars by talking to
them or setting off Cunha's alarm yeah
no thanks
they'll leave and all this happens when
they're still outside before they even
try to break it making your home safer
it shouldn't be a chore for one of these
you have to climb in the Attic run wires
drill holes it's a pain and it's not
cheap that's why we built Kuna into an
outdoor light just replace your old
light fixture and use your existing
wiring connector no to Wi-Fi and you're
done
it'll take 15 minutes do we want Kuna to
look good no matter where it is so we're
making it in three different styles to
match your house you can put Kuna
anywhere front door back door even the
garage to watch your car oh and your
light gets smarter too you can control
it with the Kuna app turn it on turn it
off set a schedule or just let it turn
on automatically when it gets dark or
when there's a person you only want to
get alerts that matter Kuna ignores
trees and small animals and it
recognizes people's behaviors so if you
don't want to know every time your
spouse goes out jogging
you can tell Kuna to alert you only for
visitors waiting at the door and it'll
learn and get smarter over time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones or the
delivery guy Clini will always let you
know and if it's someone bad now you can
do something about it kuna stop
break-ins before they happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
