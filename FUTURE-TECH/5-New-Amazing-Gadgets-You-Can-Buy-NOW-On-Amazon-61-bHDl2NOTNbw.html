how we all see electronically think
about how you see visual information
when you're not in the same locations
that's the device you know typically
it's a narrow view and a normal lens
will give you 50 to 80 degrees
perhaps 90 and that's been a constraint
for a long time pretty much since video
was invented pana cast changes all that
one advantage with our surveys or with
our integration for Microsoft Skype for
business is that in addition to sending
it to everyone we give each person
simultaneous individual control without
interfering with each other so that
makes it a very unique and a very
personal experience and helps people
communicate and engage much more
effectively another key features for the
panelists to camera is the USB plug and
play and majority of the people are used
to using a powerful cameras which are
USB interface among other things that we
wanted to achieve with panic as to was a
4k resolution which we've named
panoramic 4k is 30 40 pixels horizontal
and 1080 pixels vertical our camera
provides ultra wide field of view that
fills up to 1080p displays with a single
panoramic frame when a cache to camera
can be used as a regular webcam or as an
enhanced panoramic camera when used with
Skype for business and now you have the
capability to stream a very high
resolution
video the remote party when we study box
method ten months ago we had a desire to
bring the panoramic view to the masses
if you think of having a camera design
that is based on the single lens single
optics and then puts the optics in the
single housing so their complexity
becomes exponentially more severe so it
formers had to be achieve high quality
and manufacture ability while also being
aesthetically desirable one of the
things that I've been very interested in
the last three years is building a
global classroom that experience is
being significantly enhanced by our use
of panna cotta
cameras that give remote students the
ability to join and contribute to class
in a much more meaningful way we think
one of the great use cases for the panic
has to will be for companies that have a
lot of huddle rooms or small conference
rooms that will hold a number of people
from two to maybe even twenty upgrade
your campus with panic has two
you see amazing isn't it this is the air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
micro and ultralight it comes with it's
very own device for storage and charging
with an easy one-hand control from its
own where did the idea come from
well I'll show you look at this what an
epic day out a bonafide selfie time as
they say just need to squeeze a teeny
bit no oh never mind ah more manageable
group just two guys actually they want
to take a selfie to remember this
wonderful place well I guess they can
just describe the view to their friends
back home right okay one more try this
time a good old barbecue outside on a
sunny day with lots of friends let's try
the selfie stick strategy
still can't fit everybody in annoying
situations am i right
we've all been there buddy that's how
air selfie was born a perfect team
gathered together working in London
Milan and Shanghai to combine micro
flying technologies ultralight HD
cameras within flight stability systems
air selfie can travel in a 20 meter
radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's
only 52 grams and it slots into its
phone cover and recharges so what if the
guys had an air selfie with them they
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air awesome what about the two explorers
they select the classic flying mode from
the three options available control air
selfie through the app by holding the
phone horizontally and take both
memorable photos and videos and what
would have happened at the barbecue
enough with the squeezing
just select the selfie mode use only two
buttons to find the right distance to
shoot and take a great picture what
about an indoor location whatever it may
be a party at somebody's house or a
night out in a club there are no issues
there selfie fly's easily it's simple to
control and very safe and once you shoot
a great picture don't keep it to
yourself it's so easy to share it right
from your phone as easy as grabbing the
air selfie safely while it's still
hovering in the air so this is air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
ready to explore new perspectives let's
take a look at its technical features
Powerbank inside its own custom phone
cover a battery that charges itself in
only 30 minutes 5 megapixel HD video
camera to shoot social media optimized
images sophisticated sensors and its own
Wi-Fi control unit in flight stability
systems to hover autonomously the
smallest and most powerful brushless
motors it's safe to grab while it's
still hovering and of course its own 4
gigabyte microSD memory ultralight with
a solid italian-designed case compact an
easy to carry with you anywhere you go
