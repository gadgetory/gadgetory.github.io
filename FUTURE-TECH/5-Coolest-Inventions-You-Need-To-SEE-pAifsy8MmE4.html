mechanical pencil but it actually has a
lot of interesting engineering to solve
one frustrating thing broken led hi I'm
David and this is a Z Radel guard the
unbreakable led pencil so let's look at
this pencil in action during typical
operation it works and feels like any
normal mechanical pencil but if you're a
heavy writer who applies too much
pressure on your led tip that's where
the del Guard protective mechanism kicks
in to prevent the light from breaking
but let's take a closer look
pressing down firmly on the lead at an
angle and you'll see the sleeve tip
extend out to protect the lead or if you
press down vertically on the lid it will
Auto retract inside again protecting the
lead from breaking it's a combination of
these two mechanisms that makes it
almost impossible to break the lid no
matter how much pressure I put on it
opening up the pencil gives us a better
idea on how it works this is a chuck
it's the part of the pencil that
dispenses and holds the lead in place
and makes that clicking noise when you
press on the cap but what's special in
this case is the suspension of the Chuck
on this pencil the chuck is held in
place by a spring that allows it to move
around freely from the rest of the
pencil with enough pressure the spring
will compress and push deeper inside the
case but it also has a lot of
flexibility to bend off access from the
rest of the body when you press down on
the lead at an angle
the next part to look at is the sleeve
or the guard of the lead pencil and this
part is designed to extend oh and shield
the load when you press down on it at an
angle the sleeve is held in place by a
spring but when you pull it out you can
see that the sleeve isn't cylindrical
but instead curved like a spinning top
so when you apply a perpendicular force
to the sleeve the curved shape causes it
to extend out and shield the lead from
breaking this dual spring design makes
it almost impossible to break the lead
on your pencil from pressure alone but
it does have some limitations the del
dart pencil comes with the warning let
me break when retracting
more than three times or using softer
lead and this makes sense because the
guard system is only designed to extend
out so far so any part of the lead that
extends past the range of the guard just
can't be protected so that's the zebra
Dell guard mechanical pencil a pretty
cool feat of engineering to solve the
problem of lead breaking for
heavy-handed writers but if you don't
have this issue of breaking your light
it feels like any normal lightweight
mechanical pencil in that case maybe
check out the unique area toga another
pretty nifty piece of pencil engineering
but hope you guys enjoyed this one you
know what to do and I'll see you in the
next video
lift was inspired by the design of Apple
MacBook MacBooks are innovative slim
sleek and designed to use anywhere as
you go however we noticed that even
though users are still bound to the
old-time accessories they are not able
to use mac books everywhere solely and
freely that is why we finally propose an
innovative way of interacting with your
macbook throughout the day the lift lift
provides you adjust Wilhite flexible
mobility and stylish protection turn
your macbook into a comfortable
workstation at any time anywhere and
express your personality by giving your
macbook a new look using different
covers early we have perfectly
prototypes for macbook pro and will
experience manufacturers ready to start
production process however in order to
make it happen we need your help please
back us up to bring this project to life
this is the snap cam l.e it's a small
wearable Full HD camera with built-in
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth making it the
perfect companion for your smart device
and the app is free to download Ellie
stands for limited edition so there
aren't many available to get one while
you can now let me show you what it's
all about power up by tapping this
button and the camera instantly springs
to life you'll see the light is green
this means the camera is in standard
photo mode when you then tap the capture
button the Ellie will instantly shoot a
stunning 8 megapixel photo if you push
and hold the capture button the camera
will continue to shoot in burst mode up
to 30 photos in 3 seconds this means you
can go through and pick out the best
photo later if I press this button again
this means that the camera is in
time-lapse mode now when you tap the
capture button the Ellie will continue
to shoot photos at intervals you set
within the app so one photo every second
or up to one a minute until you press
the capture button to stop the photo
shooting
now if I press this button once more it
will turn red and the video record mode
will be activated when I hit the capture
button the le will start recording in
full HD at 30 frames per second 60
frames per second can be achieved when I
set a camera to film at 7:20 the camera
has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built in so
you can connect to your smartphone to
access all your great photos and videos
to upload to social networks plus you
can also change the camera settings as
you go the snap family takes microSD
cards up to 32 gig and can be charged
and synced using a USB once fully charge
the camera remain on standby for seven
days and record Full HD video
continuously for two hours the snap
family comes with two different clips
you can attach one to your clothing or
one to your tripod or selfie stick so
that is the iron snap cam le find out
