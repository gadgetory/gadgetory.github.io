hi I'm Shawn and I'm Frank and this is
echo
eko is a revolutionary new audio device
that enables your existing headphones or
speakers to receive wireless Wi-Fi or
from any source each user simply takes a
battery-powered sound pop from the base
station and plugs in any pair of
headphones the result instant - T
wireless audio for the whole panel most
wireless headphone systems are bulky and
expensive and often designed for only
one user we designed echo because we
believe everyone should be able to use
their headphones or speakers to enjoy a
phenomenal wireless listening experience
echo is specifically designed to
accommodate multiple users up to four or
more can listen together at the same
time its built-in Wi-Fi technology
delivers high quality ultra-low latency
sound for a real-time listening
experience it's perfect for movies music
gaming and more echo delivers a highly
customized listening experience that's
designed to fit each user's preference
each sound talk has individual volume
controls while the smart mobile app
controls equalizer settings streaming
settings and more
it even has parental controls like
volume limiting to help ensure safe
listening for kids
we designed echo because we wanted to
create a high quality social wireless
listing experience that our expensive
wireless headphones simply couldn't
provide we wanted something powerful
enough to create an audiophile grade
listening experience that's simple
enough for the whole family to enjoy
something that untether is you that
allows you more freedom and better range
in Bluetooth or RF
and when we couldn't find it we decided
to build it over the past year our
in-house team was prototyped and working
proof of concept created an elegant
beautiful industrial design and laid out
a development roadmap for finishing a
consumer ready device we've teamed up
with world-class designers and engineers
and lineup suppliers and manufacturing
partners capable of producing EKKO to
our high standards we designed EKKO to
complement your existing entertainment
accessories EKKO offers each user
individual control of their own
listening experience it was thoughtfully
designed to look great in any setting
now we're turning to Kickstarter to make
EKKO a reality for everyone by joining
us and backing this project you'll be
the first in the world to enjoy EKKO
we thank you for your support and we're
excited to bring you an amazing product

tres is an action sports tracker it's a
small little device the size of a
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and you mount
your snowboard your surfboard you'll
weight forward whatever and tells you
how fast you're going how many waves
you've got how many calories you've
burned for skiing snowboarding it'll
tell you things like air time how high
you're jumping which lifts you were on a
bunch of other things so basically it
measures your activity
you
tres will also Auto edit video footage
for you so if you're taking video with a
GoPro or Sony or Canon you can actually
put the video into our auto editor and
it'll edit out all the highlights for
you as well as color correct and overlay
your stats all automatically
definitely some of the differences
between you know some of the other
guests that are out there would be that
it's physically imagined on your
surfboards there's nothing that's in
your arm or any kind of odd you know
static can be thrown if there's
something that's going to be as close to
the water as possible and so you're
going to get you know the closest result
and if so easy is kind of stick it on
your board and I just love the case
there then you're good to go
that's the sound of your phone
connecting to a charger it's the sound
of relief knowing you are still
connected to the world connecting and
disconnecting your phone from a charger
should be a simple seamless task but it
isn't we've all been there frustrated at
our cables for any number of reasons
despite key looks it's becoming smaller
they haven't evolved to become any
easier to connect until now presenting
the future of USB cables ASAP Connect
featuring rare-earth neodymium magnets
with 18 karat gold plating ASAP connect
will change the way you interact with
your USB devices forever
featuring the world's first reversible
cable on both the phone end and charge
rent it works by inserting the tip to
the phone and the cable magnetizes onto
the tip instantly meaning you can
effortlessly connect when you only have
one hand free or in a hurry to head out
or even in the dark
you no longer have to worry about your
devices getting damaged ASAP Connect
even helps you retrieve your phone from
hard-to-reach places
we've designed to test one for micro USB
devices such as Android phones mini
cameras and speakers the other is for
Apple products we've removed the
weakness of your traditional Apple
Lightning connector tip which snaps off
easily by combining the tip and base
into one piece we call this the alpha
connector one of the engineering hurdles
in designing a SAP Connect was its
compact size by condensing the
technology down to the size of a
fingertip we're able to make sure that
it's compatible with all phone cases in
creating a new standard for USB cables
we have performed the most stringent
quality control tests combined with
superior material to really challenge
the users expectations of what a
state-of-the-art USB cable should be
we've spent the past two years working
closely with one of the world's largest
USB cable manufacturers we're a team of
disruptors from Sydney to LA we believe
that users should be the creators of
products not large corporations seeking
profit over practicality we've created
the final prototypes and delivered
samples to dozens of major tech
publications worldwide through your help
combined with the magic of IndieGoGo we
hope to bring a SAP connect to life and
unleash the future of USB cables today
