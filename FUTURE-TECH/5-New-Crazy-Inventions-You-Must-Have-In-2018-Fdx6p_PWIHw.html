immersive near eye display with
see-through capability that uses your
smartphone to project panoramic IMAX
like imagery add up to five times a
resolution of VR viewers
providing you a personal theater
experience anytime and anywhere
compatible with most modern smartphones
simply slide your phone into expanse
connect an optional controller or air
mouse and immerse yourself in your
favorite movies shows and apps in
stunning resolution hi I'm will founder
of expanse as a gamer I love the idea of
3d hands-on fully immersive
virtual-reality like the rift revived
but there just isn't enough good content
out for these devices and it'll take a
while before there is so with that in
mind I set to work designing a VR device
that would transform the way we use non
VR content like playing video games or
binge watching your favorite movies or
TV shows anyone who's watched a movie in
a gear VR or a rift knows how immersive
it is to watch a video in a life-size
virtual theater the current VR devices
just don't have the resolution needed
for movies and games why is that
well nageire VR each eye sees a separate
roundish image which uses less than half
from the screen worse the standard
rectangular a Spectre issue for videos
in most non VR content has to fit within
gear VR square aspect ratio wasting
another half of the pixels this is why
gear VR content is pixelated and suffers
from the so called screen door effect
there just aren't enough pixels but with
expanse each eye can see all of the
displays pixels providing up to 3.6
million pixels per eye almost twice the
resolution of a 1080p TV and five times
more than a movie in gear VR or a rift
but resolution is only half the battle
immersion also requires field of view
other near eye displays are described as
looking like say a 50-inch TV of eight
feet as you can see here this gives you
about a thirty degree
you'll review for comparison behind it
is a 10-foot projector screen which
provides a 64 degree field of view and
here is expanse and almost twice the
resolution and over 90 degrees field of
view this means you can catch your
favorite movie show or sports game on an
IMAX sized screen in full resolution
anywhere in your house or on the go
expanse uses your phone so you can
stream your content anywhere you can get
a cellular or Wi-Fi connection
we've also sourced a full HD display
cartridge that slides into expanse and
connects to your favorite HDMI device
and we're currently working on a 4k
AMOLED cartridge which would provide a
4k theater experience at 10% the cost of
a similar TV but this is only the
beginning
expenses head tracking and see-through
capability allow you to use it in new
and exciting ways with it's stunning
resolution expanse is the single best
way to experience new and immersive 360
content spans doesn't suffer from
pixelation or the so called screen door
effect which can ruin immersion drone
enthusiasts can watch a high-definition
real-time feed from their drones camera
overlaid on the real world letting you
pilot your drones while simultaneously
getting a first-person view of the
flight from the cockpit and gopro heroes
can show off their most recent
adventures the way they were meant to be
seen while HDR photography enthusiasts
can see their photos on-site in wide
field of view right when they take up
expanse also offers new and exciting
challenges for software developers to
begin making the first wave of apps that
utilize our unique see-through design
whether it's a heads-up display of GPS
or an augmented reality pet your
imagination set the limit for what
expanse can do we've been through
countless product design and prototype
iterations we finally arrived at a
design that is comfortable functional
and stylish we have production quotes
from multiple manufacturers including a
handful that are capable of moulding
encoding our unique
and should be ready to start production
in 12 weeks we're extremely excited to
share expansion the Kickstarter
community so please support us and help
make expanse a reality what's been
missing of course is the interface
between the real world and the simulated
world that really felt like it was
messing with my senses and taking me
somewhere else but the thing that
science fiction never shows us is the
set of tools the infrastructure that
gets us there PC based virtual reality
is incredible the graphics are amazing
but it's the positional tracking that
really immerses you but what if you
didn't need a PC Bridge is a new headset
designed specifically for the iPhone
with an onboard structure sensor Bridge
unlocks full inside-out positional
tracking no high end PC no markers and
no external cameras unlike existing
mobile VR where all you can do is look
around with bridge you'll be free to
actually move bridge even brings the
real world into view automatically
helping you avoid obstacles bridge comes
with a unity plug-in so you can easily
upgrade your projects with these new
capabilities plus you can still use
existing iPhone VR apps and rotation
only mode but we didn't stop with
virtual reality bridge can actually
sense the world around you and we use
this to enable something unprecedented
full mixed reality all on an iPhone
with bridge you could visualize new
furniture practice keeping a garden
create a portal to anywhere in the world
or bring the world to you
you can experience the virtual and the
real at the same time in a way the
bridges the essential gap between the
augmented reality of the past ten years
and the mixed reality experience of the
next step to make all of this possible
on the iPhone we had to create a
completely new software engine for
mobile mixed reality we call it bridge
engine we engineered bridge engine from
the ground up to run in real-time
completely on device with no external
processing immersive mixed reality
requires a wide view of the world so we
designed a custom glass lens that
doubles the iPhones field of view bridge
engine fuses this view with 3d sensor
data displaying a unique image to each
of your eyes bridge engine is capable of
powering amazing creations like Brigitte
our curious little robot companion
Brigitte can already do some incredible
things like navigate around obstacles
play fetch
and even interact with real objects
will collaborate with the developer
community to teach Bridget more about
the world in fact we're making Bridget's
high-level functions open source and
developers can use them in their own
projects Bridget the little robot popped
up and she kind of walked around a
footstool and and it's something that's
really hard to do I think most people
probably don't realize that just for the
ability to move form from point A to
point B you need to know what the map
looks like you're on you aware of your
obstacles so we can navigate around
these things and I was I was just
shocked that it worked so well the first
ideas for bridge were sketched in 2014
and we've been obsessing over the
details ever since
for example we chose to use lightweight
anodized aluminum for precision
alignment of the objects we developed a
magnetic system that holds bridge
securely shut yet is easily opened and
we designed a bike helmet inspired
ratchet to easily adjust fit while
simultaneously improving weight
distribution the dust rolls on is good
the optical design is good certainly
your camera is magic the bridge headset
felt like it was a product 5-10 years
into its evolution join us get a bridge
headset our limited Explorer edition for
developers is being assembled now and
will ship in a matter of days here's
what you'll get a bridge headset
complete with structure sensor a
Bluetooth controller access to bridge
engine and our unity plugin and of
course Bridget
at occipital we've always wanted to help
shape the future of computing bridge is
part of our effort to do just that and
it builds on everything we've done to
date we hope you'll join us on the
frontier of the strange and fantastic
new world
well yeah I have a closing statement I
won't 1 how soon can I get it
presents this is often touted as a holy
grail of virtual reality but what is
presence his presence just feeling like
you're in another world well no I think
that's the bare minimum for me true
presence is about being a part of this
other world being aware of it as it is a
view
I'm Lachlan Wilson CTO and co-founder of
Furth and we are presenting to you the
world's first consumer eye tracking
virtual reality had not displayed one of
the keys to this is our eyes
communication for the first time got
your characters will perceive your gaze
how about you lock eyes with a monster
stare them down
well how about share a moment of eye
contact with a fellow hero a heroine
before they dive into peril gaze our
natural human reaction will become a
trigger for modern storytelling and
expand the possibilities of interactive
cinema too even in the field of
healthcare we enabled a boy with
muscular dystrophy to play music with
his eyes and a 90 year old grandmother
used our systems remotely attempter
grandson's wedding by a robot when she
could not control aim with your eyes
accurately and faster than with any
other controller this could give you a
killer edge in intense action games Ally
tracking works with the speed of thought
both can enable a magical UI experience
where the information you're looking for
is in front of your eyes before you even
know it
depth-of-field a key to presence is a
sense of immersion by rendering
realistic depth of field in the fovea
regions and appropriately blurring the
periphery when Soviet rendering is
properly adopted in the future it would
be possible to focus the GPU power where
the user is looking greatly reducing the
overall power required to render a scene
with no perceptible reduction in quality
we build a specialized state-of-the-art
eye tracking solution into a solid VR
hardware platform that boasts 42% more
pixels the current mainstream PC
headsets we back all this off with our
own compositing SDK and open VR and os
VR support to leverage existing content
and ensure developers don't waste their
time developing for a closed ecosystem
as a firm developer you will have access
to potentially up to 25 million users
per month at 7,000 internet cafes across
Japan and Korea that are using our head
mount display on their high-end pcs we
have finally finished something that
everyone here at firm is proud of and we
are getting ready to ship our first lot
to Kickstarter backers and then to you
VR developers around the world
interested in creating new experiences
let's push the boundaries of what is
possible but our reality as paeonia
together all the air for Epoque calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
