and more turn words into actions by
asking Alexa to order stuff and make

games jokes and trivia choose from
thousands of skills in the Alexa app
you'll be amazed at what you can see
here and do with Garmin speak plus with
Amazon Alexa
hello again are you ready to have some
fun with the voice 1 first of all in
order to get Alexis attention you have
to start with the wake word Alexa okay
let's try something Alexa play some
Motown Alexa seven your voice one can be
placed anywhere in the home it's handy
to have it in the dining room or in the
kitchen especially when you're cooking
that roast checking and you don't want
to forget about it Alexa set a timer for
ten minutes so you might be wondering
why the voice one comes with a remote
control if it's voice-activated
let me show you why Alexa play some 90s
garage a nexus 10
so as you can see the speaker is pretty
powerful if the volume is above 7 then
Alexa might be able to hear you no
matter how loud you shout so if included
the remote so you don't have to get up
and turn the volume down if needed you
can also tell by looking at the KS logo
here if the light is on it won't hear
you if the light is flashing it will
hear you you may have to shout a bit and
if the light is off it will definitely
hear you ok so moving on Alexa set an
alarm for 6:30 a.m. alarm set for 6:30
a.m. tomorrow
Alexa add by dogfood to my to-do list
I added my dog food to your to-do list
have a go yourself or some of the
phrases on the things to try page on
your Quick Start Guide these are just a
handful of the thousands of commands
available that Alexa is capable of next
up will walk you through how you can
listen to music on The Voice one using
the different modes and the available
music services
hey there I'm Belle the AI home
assistant how can I serve you

Kristen for a school prom net view Belle

next visit
HD camera and night vision offers life
camera and motion detection straight to
your phone 24/7 keeping you safe and
capturing those special moments in a
family's life net view bail working for
your family home security done smart
with our new neato d7 cat and I get
along much better because we don't have
to worry about who's gonna get in
trouble I still get to be me and express
myself without having to deal with the
consequences that come with that with me
tour d7 they use their voice to schedule
cleanings so they come back to a freshly
vacuumed home and it's nothing but love
man it's crazy how this one thing
completely eliminated all that dog fur
and if there's an area that's off-limits
it's easy to teach the d7 where not to
go
nito uses lasers to map and navigate
multiple rooms then tells you exactly
where it's cleaned so whenever I feel
like chewing shoes tearing up the paper
towels or the cat litter
dude you eat my cat litter we both
consider ourselves fairly domesticated
but there are just some instincts we
won't ever be able to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
