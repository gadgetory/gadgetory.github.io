comes to feeding a baby I know that I
have my own challenges with
breastfeeding what I really liked about
baby nests is it's simple I put the
capsule in the Machine and press a
button just one button I was surprised
to find out

nutrition is what makes baby nests the
next generation baby formula
the kind cosy is the safe fast and
beautifully simple way to warm breast
milk formula or food in any container
cozy has an integrated water reservoir
the integrated reservoir and the cosy
helps eliminate those late-night trips
to the sink with the cozy the process is
simple reach into the fridge grab a
bottle and stick it in the cozy and set
the time when the timer is set the water
in the reservoir is warmed and pumped
into the chamber circulating around the
container and flowing back into the
reservoir through the overflow drain and
the timer runs out
cozy shuts off and water it drains from
the chamber eliminating any risk of
overheating the water in the cosy is the
same temperature as warm tap water so it
eliminates the risk of hot spots when
your child has a fever the anxiety is
real fortunately we have some help

comfortable patch that goes under the
arm that sends a continuous temperature
reading to an app on your phone so when
your child comes down with a fever you
don't have to wake them up to take this

work done without having to follow your
child around with a thermometer you can
make a note on this chart whenever you
give him medicine so you can see how his
fever responses and know when to give
him his next dose at the push of a
button you can send his chart to your
pediatrician best of all you can set
alerts if it gets too hot you'll get a
notification and you can react quickly
