going to talk about the blast the blast
is a cyclo safety air horn that can warn
motorists of your presence while you're
riding on the road because let's face it
sometimes a bell just isn't enough
the blast puts out a hundred and fifty
decibels of sound that means it's loud
vary about how loud let me show you
the blast easily goes on and off your
bike through a quick-release system you
can take it off very quickly so you
don't have to worry about it being
stolen the blast can be refilled by any
regular bicycle pump the volume of the
sound can be controlled by the knob on
the side
so that's a biologic blast because
sometimes a bell just isn't enough
biking is great but it can also be risky
especially in the dark when other road
users often don't see you properly and
the hand signal usually means waving a
black slaves against light hi
Kickstarter this is exactly what
inspired a group of biking enthusiasts
to develop blinker grips an entirely new
way for bikers to be seen in the dark
when our team at small innovations first
started the project we had a clear goal
to improve safety for bikers in the dark
our guiding principle was to make
blinker grips easy to activate and fit
all standard handlebars so anyone could
use them increased visibility means at
all for safety but that's not always
cops other old users should also be able
to see your intentions it was clear that
the end of the handlebar was the most
visible place for an extra light and the
most intuitive location for an immediate
nevertheless the placement brought some
challenges since our solution had to
endure both bumps and weather that's why
blinker grips our splash pool and the
tip is made of soft material which
absorbs the forces of any impact so you
can freely leave your bicycle outside
regardless of the weather and you don't
have to worry about your bike volley we
have been working on the project for
ages now improving even the smallest
detail after many nights of working and
testing and countless broken prototypes
later we have finally finished our
design bicycle indicator with amazing
battery life merged with beautifully
curved ergonomic grip and it's even easy
to use
see the work is not done we have already
made the tools but we need your help to
purchase the materials in bulk and even
more importantly in getting our grips
out in the world for everyone to see
that there is a new way to illuminate
your ride so please help us make biking
just a little bit safer for everyone
thanks
you

I was working block away from where I
lived so it didn't make sense to start a
car so my friends would always say why
you ride your bike and I would say I
don't have one next thing I know I got a
bike and my life has changed because the
energy that connects to a bicycle and
movement and achievement and all the
other things just brought me out of this
place
it was really two dudes sitting around
we're kind of falling out of love with
Detroit you know I just moved back from
South Beach Miami Mike was working for
like doing odds and ends and we just
needed something to break us out of our
regular mold
it wasn't about starting this massive
movement it was about how can we
reconnect with the city that we love on
the very first snow roll I think three
people showed up I mean we didn't hit
numbers of over ten until probably year
and a half we hadn't brought 300 people
together before it so when we hit 300
that was when I really was like okay
what's going on here because up until
that moment we knew everybody that was
coming on the ride but when you start
hitting numbers over that you start
realizing that people that you don't
even know I bring in masses and that was
the first time I thought this might be
out of our control
two years ago I came to my first little
role here in Detroit and it's absolutely
one of the most unique fun exciting bike
events I've ever been a part of so you
know what the new line of lights and
everything it just made sense to come
here
been apart of slow-roll for four years
slow means to me just basically every
walk of life getting together getting on
a bike and going for the same bike ride
new people having a great time while
riding exercising
Iowa's joke at the first four years we
ran from the cops because every corner
we just pulled up and with
let's go let's go let's go we didn't
have that relationship and that's what I
think it's been awesome is that the
city's really bought in now yeah we're
about mics but now I get phone calls
about community activism how can I get
water to Flint you know so it's not just
this this thing that seems so simple
which is I ride a bike
it's what's the bigger picture to always
we've worked very hard to have people
understand that we don't own this thing
no one owns this so if you want this to
last and be something you're proud of
get rid of everything that you came here
with you came here and you're a group of
people that group is now slower but in
that moment do you can't deny what this
thing has done man for the city of
Detroit medical there's never been a
time in my life where I've never felt
like I shouldn't be here the only time
I've ever left it so I can get the
skills to come back here and be stronger
as long as I've been alive I've been at
a truth
okay come from an idea is awareness the
awareness that you can make change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
