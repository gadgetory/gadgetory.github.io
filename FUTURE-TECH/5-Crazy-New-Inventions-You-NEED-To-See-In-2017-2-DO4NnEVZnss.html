all of us getting your house broken into
sucks it's not just the stuff that you
lose but because your home feels
violated what you want is to keep it
from happening in the first place that's
why we created Cunha help you prevent
break-ins
this is Cunha Cunha is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you so you can see and talk to
them on your smartphone hey could you
leave the package out front a little bit
it's the best way to actively prevent
break-ins most burglaries are crimes of
opportunity the burglars were actually
knock on your door to see if you're home
and when they realize you're not home
they'll attempt to enter your house
keeping them outside is the most
important thing you can do and koona
allows you to do that
you can deter burglars by talking to
them or setting off Kona's alarm yeah no
thanks they'll leave and all this
happens when they're still outside
before they even try to break it making
your home safer shouldn't be a chore for
one of these you have to climb in the
Attic run wires drill holes it's a pain
and it's not cheap that's why we built
Cunha into an outdoor light just replace
your old light fixture it and use your
existing wiring connector uno to Wi-Fi
and you're done it'll take 15 minutes
and we want Cunha to look good no matter
where it is so we're making it in three
different styles to match your house you
can put Cunha anyway front door back
door even the garage to watch your car
oh and your light gets smarter too you
can control it with the Cunha app turn
it on turn it off set a schedule or just
let it turn on automatically when it
gets dark or when there's a person you
only want to get alerts that matter
Cunha ignores trees and small animals
and it recognizes people's behaviors so
you don't want to know every time your
spouse goes out jogging
you can tell Cunha to alert you only for
visitors waiting at the door and it'll
learn and get smarter over time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones or the
delivery guy Kona will always let you
know and if it's someone bad now you can
do something about it kuna stop
break-ins or they have

roboticist and founder of rock paper
robot the design and engineering firm
out of Brooklyn we make kinetic
furniture
what's kinetic furniture well it's
basically the core that moves like these
levitating tables for this bouncing one
or our lay this alley chair inspired by
our experience living and working in New
York see this is our office but this is
our office the city inspires us informs
us and acts as a constant reminder of
the diversity of people and problems
that we have to consider when we design
plus the responsibility we feel to not
create Morris come see what we mean
the Olli chair retracts to two inches so
it's ideal for small spaces
at flat packs for transport and we all
know how important that is it's
lightweight so it's easy to move around
Dahle chair has a built-in lumbar
support so it's super comfy after a long
day on your feet and because the chair
body is made out of aluminum and the
default amber is made out of teeth it's
great for outdoor environments and
because we're fans of personal
expression Olli is customizable the
tambour the flexible slanted seat part
is interchangeable so you can swap it
out to suit your style and just for our
Kickstarter backers we're offering some
limited edition finishes for your chairs
including an awesome silkscreen by our
talented friend Wiz be no extra space no
problem store your holly chair on the
wall like a work of art and of course
the chair is perfect for home too
Holly can be your primary seating or
accommodate your space for extra guests
so storing the chair might seem like
sleight of hand manufacturing it doesn't
take magic it takes money that's where
you come in by supporting our
Kickstarter campaign you'll be the first
to get your butts on the Ahly chairs at
far lower than the expected retail price

manufacturing company that's wool
