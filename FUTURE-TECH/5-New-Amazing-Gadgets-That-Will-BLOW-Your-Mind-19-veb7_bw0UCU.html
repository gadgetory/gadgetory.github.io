is your drinking water safe we can study
the found water contamination is a much
more serious issue than previously
thought and governments around the world
that fail
imagine how we interact with the world
but today we just mostly poke at the
screen fingers and hands are incredible
why are we so limited introducing vela
an innovative device that instantly
turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
vela will make your life more convenient
use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination and you only need
one valid device to control multiple
devices or applications you can use our
presets like letters to read your own
gestures according to your preference
simply assign gestures through different
scenarios and switch between them just
by moving your hands our human hand is
fantastic they can not only field but
also manipulate things in a versatile
way the Korean smartphone technologies
are just putting everything into small
tiny screen which highly limits and
constraint the interactive areas of our
hands Vela works on any surface so you
can clip it anywhere you like or even
design your own control pad unlike other
devices Vela gives you tracking and
multiple text to action features so you
are not limited to just one action but
if different patterns to assign for
different actions it is super easy to
use and really works for everyone if you
are a developer you can try new ideas
and figure out different customized
applications with our well-designed API
to track the human gestures Vela uses a
special sonar technology that is
nowadays widely used in military cars
and drones it transmits signal pulses
collects the reflective energy from your
finger and then translates it into the
performed action our team has been
focused on sensing
for couple of years we are passionate
about making to us which is just human
needs by amplifying human capabilities
turning any surface around you into a
remote control enables many potential
possibilities in our daily lives we have
been seeing lots of products in the
market but we have not found any of them
capable to track and to recognize with
high probability with Wella attracts
your finger with the finest precision
and transform it in the customized
action weller
