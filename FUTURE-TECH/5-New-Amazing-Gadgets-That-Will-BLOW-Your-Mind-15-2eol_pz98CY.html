samsung galaxy s 8 the new Infiniti
display gives you an incredible full
screen experience yet fits comfortably
in your hand we created it by
reorganizing the phone's interior making
components smaller without sacrificing
performance and embedding the home
button under the screen
we created a beautifully curved edge
display and also erase the best to give
you more space for the things that
matter creating a level of immersion you
see and feel even games and movies are
completely different with the infinity
displays cinematics full screen
experience and a bigger screen gives you
the room to multitask seamlessly
the galaxy s eight also presents a whole
new way to interact with your phone like
6p excuse that's it a screen effect of
the J Bixby gets smarter and more
intuitive with every use and if you find
something you like 60 analyzes it and
provides information without having to
type a single word

so you'll have the right content just
when you need it
vix Pete also gives you information on
what you're looking at and will
recommend places to go

galaxy SI and si plus we introduce to
you the you gold watch we rely heavily
on technology to keep us connected and
productive in our daily lives and a dead
phone battery could be costly the you've
old watch is our way of solving this
problem in a way that also helps
preserve the environment the watch is
equipped with a solar panel that
possibly captures energy from the Sun
that energy is then stored inside a
removable compact power reserve under
ideal light conditions watches power
reserve can reach its full capacity
within a day low battery just pull out
the power reserve from the watch and
start charging your mobile device we are
also including a wireless charging dock
if you need to start your day with a
full charge simply place the watch on
the dock and it will fully charged in
under 45 minutes to save energy the dock
only uses power when a device is placed
on it and automatically turns off when
it reaches full charge our aim with the
you've old watch was to create a simple
yet highly functional object it's
minimal lines and analog interface makes
it an easy fit for any wardrobe it is
meant to be a comfortable and personal
everyday companion that supports our
values as well as our mobile lives we
chose a mechanical watch instead of
digital because it would draw less power
while providing precise time the watch
hands have a minimal width to maximize
the performance of the solar panel which
covers the entire face of the watch it
is also covered with a thin sheet of
anti reflective mineral glass to further
enhance the solar capacity
the power reserve combines a custom
circuit that handles the electrical flow
of the watch with a high-density
lithium-ion battery the reserve has an
integrated lightning port for Apple
devices or micro USB B and C for android
devices it could even go entirely
wireless the charging wire stays inside
the power reserve so it's virtually
impossible to forget or lose it at the
bottom sits the wireless receiver for
inductive charging through the included
dock it all fits in a durable aluminum
body and on top of that we filled the
band with batteries to add more capacity
allowing a second charge after the power
reserve has been used to achieve this
addition we develop the custom hinge
that lets current go back and forth
within the body of the you gold watch
today we need your support to bring this
project to life and together step into a
sustainable and accessible future we
love technology technology is rotting on
a perspective in our lives but have we
ever wondered what's coming up next and
how would it change our lives
