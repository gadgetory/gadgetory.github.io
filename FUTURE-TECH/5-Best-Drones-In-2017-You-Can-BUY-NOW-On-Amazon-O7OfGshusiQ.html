it's a whole new type of drone we merged
power and smart features making it easy
for everyone to fly and create beautiful
images the toughest challenge for us was
to find the sweet spot between form and
function when engineering the folding
arms we wanted to save as much space as
possible
we really wanted to make it quick to
unfold and leave enough room for the
powerful processors and system systems
this took several attempts and many many
prototypes
in one of our earlier prototypes the
arms took up way too much space when
folded almost two-thirds of the entire
volume combined with the space that we
needed for the internals this meant the
Maverick was much larger than we wanted
and another attempt the amazonian took
up half the volume but there's a lot of
wasted space in between body and arms
eventually we solve this problem and
create an easy click to unfold mechanism
seem from above the thin arms that flush
against the body when folded we called
out to indent at the rear of the
airframe to fit the motives saving
additional speed the rear arms pulled
out in a three-dimensional motion it's
not been a place in one suite with this
design you can have your magic Pro
unfolded in under five seconds powerful
components generate a lot of heat
especially when they're placed close
together so for the first time ever on
the DJI drone we've integrated the heat
sing of the bass lead for magnesium
aluminium a line and a centrifugal fan
behind the gimbal
fan pulls in air from the front of the
aircraft and channels it across the
heatsink participating heat we wouldn't
go through all this trouble without
making sure you have a great camera we
spent thousands of hours trying to
re-engineer and shrink the stabilization
technology found in our phantom series
one of the major challenges we ran into
when making a stabilized camera this
small with a stiffness of the electrical
wires the mechanics the structure and
the brushless motors had to be
specifically engineered to take this
into account plus it's the first eji
camera that's able to rotate 90 degrees
for portrait shots we also wanted a
remote controller from a magnetic probe
that would feel natural and familiar in
people's hands so they would be more
confident when they fly that's how we
came up with a small controller that
expands with a pair of grips these grips
also have your phone keeping all of your
controls in easy reach
the Mavic Pro concentrates some of our
most advanced technologies into one
compact body it's an incredible tool to
turn everyday moments into fantastic art
wherever you go
I'm Derek I'm passionate about going and
I've meant managable wanna fly drones
upon them really hard to control I want
to help because I feel that they're
making out to the fun of arrow filming
that's why we came out with the idea of
ghost this is a traditional remote
controller it has many switches enough
which can be very hard to master
one bad move let me take can be very
expensive
most of the joints also require
assembling but not everyone has a time
or skill to do that ghost comes
preassembled and is ready to fly right
out of the box our app makes it super
easy to pilot simply tap unlock then
take off and ghost will rise and hover
now tap a spot on the map and ghost will
fly there immediately to get it back
just hit return and ghost will take the
shortest route back to its takeoff point
press land and ghost will descend and
land gently for advanced control half
cover to make ghost hold the current
spot and enter the micro control mode
here you can adjust ghosts Direction
speed camera angles and more not only is
ghost user-friendly it's designed with
quality parts
and as great features and performance
what's really cool about the go stuff
this customizability with respect to the
hardware and software one project that
I'm working on is mounting this RP lidar
unit from Lebowski on-the-go strip
giving it the ability to sense it's
around with the data from the lidar
the ghosts will be able to detect
obstacles like trees and buildings and
adjust its flight path if necessary
I'm also really looking forward to
developing those steps DK which includes
libraries for both Java and c-sharp I
also see some awesome integration
possibilities with input devices like
Gleek motion bio and my own device pack
one of my passions is to travel and
taking photos of the worlds around me I
always have wanted to own an affordable
drone that then give me great images and
videos from the sky the ghost with
gimbal in combination with my GoPro
works really well I have created amazing
photos and videos that could not have
made before as an amateur photographer
and that's really great
what's great about the ghost is that
super easy to fly I am excited to be one
of the first users of the ghost what I
like about ghosts it's so easy to fly
the control is really simple and I can
do it all on my phone I don't have to
worry anymore about the control and I
can just focus on what I see the ghost
team members come from both the US and
China and have a very diverse background
now we're in stop here we want to make
those examples of everyone I help people
create amazing aerial views we have
finalized the design and now we need
your support to take those to mass
production and bring the clock down tap
now and let's make out the words easier
to fly arrow filming job available to
everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
