you're breastfeeding and managing a
career today I'd like to make it easier
for you
this is Anya she's the reason I'm making
this video I can't stop working because
I like living in a house and having food
on the table but I don't want to
compromise my daughter's well-being as
well so I don't want to stop
breastfeeding whether I'm at home or in
an important meeting
that's why milk pumping machines were
invented so that someone else my husband
for example could fidget but there's one
huge problem most of them suck only up
to 60% of the milk because they're
suction cups are designed like this does
this look like it imitates the section
of a baby I don't have enough milk for
the bottle after Anna is finished eating
my body doesn't accelerate the milk
production because 40% of the milk is
still left inside my breasts so my body
thinks there's too much milk inside my
breasts and reduces the milk production
sometimes Anya gets hungry and mad and
I'm frustrated because I can't do
anything to help her I looked for a
pumping machine that would pump 100% of
my milk but I couldn't find one
after hours of research I came up with a
way to make the existing pumping
machines better I met up with a genius
engineer who has already designed more
than 30 patents and challenged him to
design one for me
six months later meet Annabella
Annabella is a pumping machine that
draws close to 100% of mothers milk
because it actually simulates the baby's
sucking motion this spherical part under
the main opening contains a mechanism
which imitate the baby's tongue and the
upper part enables power and Gryff
adjustment just like a real muscle
system it has a unique patent-pending
mechanism which makes you feel like a
real baby is sucking the milk the pace
and the intensity can be adjusted it's
user-friendly washable quiet and small
you can charge it and easily take it
with you we made sure that the
production process is also simple to
make Anabella affordable our concept has
been validated by breastfeeding experts
as well as a respected pediatrician it
solved the problems I was experiencing
as a first-time breastfeeding mother it
has one part that needs to be washed and
it's designed to connect with almost any
bottle type the battery allows you to
pump several times before needing to
charge it again we are currently
developing an app which will monitor the
amount of milk thought and recommend the
optimal pace and intensity of the
process we need your support to
introduce this product to the market
millions of moms are waiting for an
innovative product like the Annabella
your financial support will help us
start production in the future we will
take Annabella to retail companies in
order to distribute worldwide we hope
you're excited as we are about the
Annabella even a small contribution will
help us get to the finish line that much
sooner if you have followers on Facebook
or any other social media please share
this video think of all the moms you'll
be helping by doing so
you
the first thing I think about when being
a new parent is you know you come home
from the hospital and you feel this this
full weight of responsibility I remember
my son Ashton was born looking at him
and just like making this promise me to
him like I'm gonna be there for you I'm
gonna do everything I can to make sure
that you're happy and you're safe and
you're healthy and outlet really
believes in building technology that
helps parents do that we launched MARSOC
one a little over a year ago since then
we've had almost a hundred thousand
people who have used the device but as
excited as we are about that we're even
more excited to launch smart talk to
it's MARSOC to is a complete rewrite of
our previous version that enhances
everything we wish we could have done
the first time around we met with
several users to find out exactly what
their needs were and we went through
prototype after prototype and iteration
after iteration to make sure that the
baby's needs were in mind so what we did
was we came up with a universal design
that had been used on either foot as
well as we made a new breathable toe so
that all three sock sizes have the most
comfort and breathability for your baby
we're also excited because it has this
new comfort mechanism so that no matter
how tight or loose the sock is it'll
always be in the right spot as we dove
into the data one of the immediate
improvements that needed to make was to
drastically improve Bluetooth range we
went all the way down to the hardware
and decided to spend our own RF design
it allowed us to get an antenna that
matched perfectly for our application
additionally we were able to add a low
noise amplifier to the base station
which essentially made it so that the
base station had better ears and then we
added a 3d antenna essentially this
antenna just got a lot bigger kind of
lot stronger so that we could get a lot
more range we're seeing on average
customers will experience a 10 to 12 X
Bluetooth range improvement depending on
their environment to put that in
perspective with some parents they
couldn't go more than 10 feet with their
with the very first stock meaning it had
to be right outside the baby's window or
the baby had to be right in your same
room with you now we've had people that
are able to have homes where the baby is
three levels above where you sleep and
it's still connected I've been using it
in my home for the last five months
we've been testing and you know I just
love that the the range from the sock to
the base station has increased that
makes it more usable for my wife and I
because it means the base station can
now actually be on our nightstand and
and that allows me to wake up at night
and just glance at the base station know
everything's okay the outlet smart sock
enables parents to have that reactive
nature to monitoring and you can
actually get insights from the data that
will help you be a more proactive graph
after using the smart sock 1 the smart
talk - is
an incredibly different experience we're
really excited for parents to use the
new smarts onto the new smart sock - is
gonna revolutionize the way we're able
to care for infants oh we love them so
much we'd do anything for our kids
outlets mission really is to enable
parents with technology it allows them
to be there to be more in tune with what
their baby needs and we believe that
smart sock to nod takes that to the next
level and really allows parents to to
feel completely empowered in the home
you
hello IndieGoGo can you imagine your
life with an extra hand that pops out
for you whenever you need it oh no not a
real hand imagine an extra mechanical
hand that gives you a hand and upgrades
your lifestyle
an extra hand that improves your daily
chores while raising your baby
and finally let you enjoy the good stuff
meat shy and naughty too serious
inventors by daylight and tired parents
by night for the past two years shy and
naughty developed their own extra hand
with the assistance of top engineers and
designers after several prototypes they
managed to create what they were hoping
for the introducing the new me new me
the new me new me is a unique device
that attaches to every surface and
pushes the baby's cart back and forth
this action simulates the environment of
the fetus inside the womb and keeps it
calm the new me new me has a USB port
that can charge all kinds of smartphones
and tablets it has some spectacular
melodies an elegant klipse design with
internal silicone surface and unique
blocking for easy and safe grip the
clips can move 360 degrees
shy and naughty are ready for mass
production
so please do help them with a generous
hand and they will give you back their
extra hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
