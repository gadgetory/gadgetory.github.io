day a day of balance and wellness we
nourish our body with healthy foods we
physically stretch our bodies in hopes
of stretching our minds everything we do
goes back to our well being but there is
one piece we often tend to neglect from
the wellness puzzle introducing turbo a
simple and effective addition to your
daily routine before the 19th century
toilets were non-existent people used to
squat to release two thirds of the world
actually still do and for good reason as
we adopted the toilet into our lives we
unknowingly added tension and straining
during bowel movements studies have
shown us the perpendicular posture
brought on by the toilet creates a kink
in the colon which makes it difficult to
go it also makes us susceptible to a
number of other health issues by
elevating your feet that kink disappears
your muscles are able to relax and your
colon is open for quick and efficient
release and that's why we invented turbo
turbo is an elegant yet affordable
solution that makes a great addition to
any bathroom it's sleek design allows
for flexibility and comfort the unique
ramp design makes using turbo easier for
any person of any size the lower toe
area allows you to easily load your feet
then you can position your feet forward
or backward on the ramp to adjust to a
squat that's just right for you and with
turbo squatting is only the beginning
turbo comes with interchangeable massage
rollers to further increase your comfort
on the toilet not only does it feel good
but it can help with constipation too
your feet have pressure points that can
stimulate your colon when it's time
Oh massaging with turbo also helps with
blood circulation which can improve your
energy levels to get you through the day
we have come a long way and we are
almost there the only thing missing is
your support
you
this is only Tomy is a smart
rechargeable nightlight that you can
control with your phone or tablet it's
the only smart nightlight that offers 16
million color options precise light
dimming custom programmable timers and a
motion activated sensor oh did we
mention it's portable Oh me has a safer
chargeable battery that lasts up to
eight hours finally a modern nightlight
that looks great and offers
functionality that you actually want
Tommy is way more than just a nightlight
hi my name is Mitch I'm a product
designer for a company called human
scope last year the team and I have been
working on something called
Oh me only is a smart rechargeable
nightlight we ran a campaign on
Kickstarter last year and it did really
well now we're about to enter production
and we've teamed up with IndieGoGo to
offer in demand so we can sell it at a
discounted rate one last time we've
designed only to be safe and portable so
we've incorporated these folding prongs
on the back but you can place it on a
flat surface only has a built-in
rechargeable batteries but it's not a
dangerous lipo battery it's an iron
phosphate which is very stable and it
won't catch fire as a nightlight the old
means battery will last up to ten hours
or you can crank the output and use it
as accent lighting for three hours the
great thing about omie is Bluetooth
enabled so it works with our iOS and
Android apps that we provide with the
app you can dim or brighten the light
you can choose between over sixty
million color options you can enable
motion detection and you can set it to
turn on for five seconds of ten or
however long you want you can also
program up to eight smart timers for
only the smart timers allow you to turn
the light off or dim it down at a
certain time or you can turn the light
on or have it change color at a
different time we've also gone above and
beyond with the aesthetics of the design
we've incorporated this elegant aluminum
bezel which can be used to turn the
light on or dim it or turn it off
completely
I'm really excited about what we
accomplished in the last year I know it
took a little longer than expected but
we think we have a great product we
can't wait to start shipping it to you
you
the first motorized expansion technology
system enabling truly portable speakers
that can fit your pocket and play
amazing high-quality audio and
innovative coin systems with a
repositional at uses allows you to
attach bump-out to any surface
imaginable to ensure you can kick the
party off at a moment's notice
bump-out is a true feat in engineering
we worked with some of the top audio
product specialists in the world to
design our proprietary expansion
technology bump-out combines a full
range driver passive radiator and
powerful battery into the smallest cabin
possible with a push of the button the
internal acoustic chamber activates the
passive radiators generating rich sounds
and bay steps pumps pump outcomes with
multiple coins that feature patinated
heaps of technology they can be removed
repositioned and adhere to any smooth
surface over and over again even your
smartphone
