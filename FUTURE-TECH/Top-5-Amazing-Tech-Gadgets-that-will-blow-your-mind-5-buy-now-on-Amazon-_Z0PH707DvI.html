to all of it it's easy how do we know
because we've made it easy at DJ I we
created the flying camera as you know it
and there's a good chance that the drone
videos you've seen online were shot with
one of our cameras this time we started
small but you can dream big we created
your first personal throne but we're
still squeezing in big power it
automatically follows you or whatever
you want without a bracelet or trackers
avoid obstacles and come packed with a
fork a stabilized camera 27 minutes
flight time and a whole lot more this is
the DJI gavickpro and this is the DJI
mavic flow unfolded to make it this
small we have to rip out a ton of cool
stuff right now it's got 24 high
performance computing pores dual
satellite connectivity and all new
transmission systems with a 4.3 mile
range for vision sensors and more sound
complicated it's not it's easy the mavic
knows where it takes off from where it
is in the air where it's going and what
is capturing
when you take off the mavic uses two
vision sensors and connects with up to
20 satellite also it can remember your
location this means the mavic knows
where home is so it can return by itself
precision landing technology means it
can land almost exactly where you took
off at the touch of a button as you fly
satellite systems keep track of you
working in harmony with all four vision
sensors telling it what's below and
what's in front whether you are flying
beside a cliff in a forest or even
indoors just like you maddox teas and
things that means it can avoid the
things in its path from trees to wall
any good flying camera deep
stabilization the maddox expertly
miniaturized gimbal each the entire
camera steady unlike electronic
stabilization we use every pixel from
the tensor and you don't have the weight
of a bulky add on camera shooting an
epic tracking shot of a friend is easy
active track technology mean it just
takes a few taps not just one kind of
tracking shot either it's got spotlight
profile and trait or you tap line to tap
and fly
terrain follow mode keeps the mavic at a
height you define as the ground right so
you can focus on your shot not your hike
everything can be controlled using a
gamepad size controller you can keep in
your pocket it opens up to clamp around
your phone and has been custom
engineered to give you more feedback and
more accuracy you will always feel in
control if you don't want to bother with
the controller fly using virtual
joystick right from your phone over
Wi-Fi whether you fly with the remote
controller or just your phone active
track modes are ready to make you shoot
like a pro want to be on camera not
behind it it just takes a wave and a
gesture then there's the new DJ I gotta
strap these on to really feel like
you're flying combine them with sport
mode to get your pulse-pumping while you
fly at an incredible 40 miles per hour
once you've got your shot edit
everything together the DJI go and share
or even stream your flight live to
Facebook or YouTube inspiration can
strike from the smallest thing a sketch
a feeling and experience the mavic has
been designed for you to take it anyway
ready at a moment's notice whenever
inspiration strikes you to create
something truly great

stuff again mint no loss all found
control everything when you're a kid
learning and playing always seemed to be
on opposite side but we believe we can
change that meets fear of spark ignition
the playful robot that makes programming
fun and offers challenges for every
skill level
spark began as a local meetup group
where we talked kids how to code a year
later we lost the series of free lessons
enabling students and teachers to
discover all that's possible with the
sphere of all now as we face the future
where coating will be as important as
reading and writing we want to give
everyone the opportunity to learn the
language of tomorrow in the box you'll
find Spiro spark addition and induction
charger the few other handy tools to
help you get creative the ball itself
comes packed with all the same sensors
and electronics Bureau two point oh but
unlike scarrow two point O is white show
we've encased spark addition and clear
polycarbonate bringing you closer to the
robotic action get started by
downloading the spark app and connecting
to your ball via bluetooth if you knew
the coding learn some basic principles
by first exploring the sample program
then set off to create your very own
using drag-and-drop commands like roll
spin flip and color change at any time
you can even access the actual code
behind the block and get a sense of how
text based programming operates if you
need a break from coding turn you to buy
sideways to just drive or tap on the
communities have to see what others are
creating park edition is also compatible
with all of the other games and apps
already available for spero we have big
plans for spark addition to be sure to
check for updates it's time to break the
rules about learning the fire up your
imagination and begin exploring robotics
programming and so much more
