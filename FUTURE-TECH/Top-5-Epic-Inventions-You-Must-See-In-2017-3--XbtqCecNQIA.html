stabilizers out there are too complex
heavy and too big to be mounted anywhere
at new on matter we wanted to create a
solution that was so convenient that it
would become part of your camera so we
developed cork the world's smallest
waterproof stabilizer for your GoPro
that stabilizes your camera to keep it
leveled and create amazing cinematic
shots no matter what Clarke is so small
that you don't need to remove your
camera anymore it becomes an extension
of it allowing you to mount it on the
camera mounts you already have just turn
it on with your camera and you are ready
to go
mark is a lot more than a stabilizer
it's a real tool with built in moving
time-lapse feature it brings a new way
of creating content and empowering you
to be more creative
developed by engineers and a police we
went through many iterations of
prototypes to develop a product
optimized for your camera
together let's start a new era in
personal video maker so we are now ready
to bring that product to market but we
need your help
so Bacchus today any questions from the
way you create
for so long technology has been held
back by one important thing emotion
that's why we created oli the first
robot assistant with an evolving
personality and a deep breath outwards
let the stress fall away Megan I would
suggest raising the temperature by 10
degrees hot yoga can increase weights
loss and build muscle tone let's do it
not a problem at all oli is proactive
meaning it anticipates your needs just a

a guitar therapy might do the trick
your tie was started with mission to
change human relationships with
technology all is the first robot a
system with evolving personality people
are different
how one is unique and so is our robot
our team is also made up of incredibly
diverse group of people with when the
best talents from AI Neron science
engineering robotics design and
animation that avoids life into a robot
we've also unfortunate enough to work
with some top professors in their
respective field all is the first
robotics product that has won four
Innovation Awards in CES we do that in
2017 we've come a long way and iterated
quite a bit through our journey now we
are ready to manufacture at a large
scale and we need your help to take all
it to the next stage of production we've
all been there the language barriers
where things get lost in translation
those tangled cables the flexibility
poor audio quality introducing click the
smartest truly wireless earbuds with
live voice translation
the ability to translate different
languages with the translation delivered
to the earbuds in real-time language

efficient interaction of a prosecutor

soreness that often comes after a day of
wearing uncomfortable earbuds the click
delivers a crystal-clear movie of
quality with noise cancellation to hear
back what we've recorded live you're
getting the studio sound through your
ears is quite incredible
explore the world with no limit click a
revolution for your ears we introduced
to you the you've old watch we rely
heavily on technology to keep us
connected and productive in our daily
lives and a dead phone battery could be
costly the you volt watch is our way of
solving this problem in a way that also
helps preserve the environment the watch
is equipped with a solar panel that
passively captures energy from the Sun
that energy is then stored inside a
removable compact power reserve under
ideal light conditions watch's power
reserve could reach its full capacity
within a day
low battery just pull out the power
reserve from the watch and start
charging your mobile device we are also
including a wireless charging dock if
you need to start your day with a full
charge simply place the watch on the
dock and will fully charge in under 45
minutes to save energy the dock only
uses power when a device is placed on it
and automatically turns off when it
reaches full charge the power aim with
the u volt watch was to create a simple
yet highly functional object it's
minimal lines and analog interface makes
it an easy fit for any wardrobe it is
meant to be a comfortable and personal
everyday companion that supports our
values as well as our mobile lives we
chose a mechanical watch instead of
digital because it would draw less power
while providing precise time the watch
hands have a minimal width to maximize
the performance of the solar panel which
covers the entire face of the watch it
is also covered with a thin sheet of
anti reflective mineral glass to further
enhance the solar capacity the power
reserve combines a custom circuit that
handles the electrical flow of the watch
with a high density lithium ion battery
the reserve has an integrated Lightning
port for Apple devices or microUSB B and
C for Android devices it could even go
entirely wire
the charging wire stays inside the power
reserve so it's virtually impossible to
forget or lose it at the bottom sits the
wireless receiver for inductive charging
through the included dock it all fits in
a durable aluminum body and on top of
that we filled the band with batteries
to add more capacity allowing a second
charge after the power reserve has been
used to achieve this addition we
developed the custom hinge that lets
current go back and forth within the
body of the you volt watch today we need
your support to bring this project to
life and together step into a
sustainable and accessible future 365
