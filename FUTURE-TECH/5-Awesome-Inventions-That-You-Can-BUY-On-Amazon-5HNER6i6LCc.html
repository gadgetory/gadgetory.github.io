the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product it would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution bringing the gym to you
the platform is strong the posts are
spaced evenly apart on both sides so you
can simulate any exercise movement and
quickly just difficulty the base is made
wide enough to stand comfortably during
your workout and we even added a layer
of non-slip material to assure you stay
in place the bands were customized for
this concept and can handle any height
there's even cloth in the band's to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add vans to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort
the ends of the bar spend a full 360
degrees and are shaped to avoid the
clips from slide providing you the most
natural feel possible through all of
your exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
levels we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight padding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor can
increase the workout the body boss is
lightweight made of high-grade injection
molding and capable of handling hundreds
of pounds of force the underside has
non-slip feet for safe use on any
surface the adjustable posts make for
easy storage starting from day one you

physically stretch our bodies in hopes
of stretching our minds everything we do
goes back to our well being but there is
one piece we often tend to neglect from
the wellness puzzle introducing turbo a
simple and effective addition to your
daily routine before the 19th century
toilets were non-existent people used to
squat to release two thirds of the world
actually still do and for good reason as
we adopted the toilet into our lives we
unknowingly added tension and straining
during bowel movements
studies have shown us the perpendicular
posture brought on by the toilet creates
a kink in the colon which makes it
difficult to go it also makes us
susceptible to a number of other health
issues by elevating your feet that kink
disappears your muscles are able to
relax and your colon is open for quick
and efficient release and that's why we
invented turbo turbo is an elegant yet
affordable solution that makes a great
addition to any bathroom it's sleek
design allows for flexibility and
comfort the unique ramp design makes
using turbo easier for any person of any
size the lower toe area allows you to
easily load your feet then you can
position your feet forward or backward
on the ramp to adjust to a squat that's
just right for you and with turbo
squatting is only the beginning
turbo comes with interchangeable massage
rollers to further increase your comfort
on the toilet not only does it feel good
but it can help with constipation too
your feet have pressure points that can
stimulate your colon when it's time to
massaging with turbo also helps with
blood circulation which can improve your
energy levels to get you through the day
we have come a long way and we are
almost there the only thing missing is
your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
