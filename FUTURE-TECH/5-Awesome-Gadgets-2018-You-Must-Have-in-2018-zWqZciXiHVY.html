tennis is one of the greatest sports of
all time the feeling you get when you
hit that perfect shot or kick serve down
the line
is indescribable perfecting these shots
takes countless hours of practice and
with that comes the inevitable chore of
picking up hundreds of tennis balls
scattered all over the court players and
coaches everywhere know the frustration
and tediousness that goes into
collecting balls during a practice
session and this is why we invented tena
Bonds Tanabata is the world's first
robotic ball collector tena bot

track of how many balls are collected
during a session and how often you
practice so feel free to brag to your
friends about how you're stepping up
your game while never having to pick up

designed with convenience in mind

easily continue your hittin session

portable design lets you pick up ten
Abad and wheel it on and off the court
just like a suitcase and when you're
done tena vod's compact size makes it
easy to fit in the trunk of your car so

hi i'm ryan and i'm elias we are part of
the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it cleans to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we've come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travelers wanting an easy way
to wash clothes while on the go it's
also simple to use you simply place it
in water add some soap turn on the
built-in timer and walk away 30 minutes
later your clothes are cleaner than ever
before
sonic Stoke is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close sonic soak is your solution
