hi my name is Stefan and today I would
like to introduce you to the LED table
I started to work on his project four
years ago since then it became so much
more and I'm very exciting to be able to
bring his project to Kickstarter
facility table is a very simple
comfortable however
to us awesome and GFX there are 150 LED
pixels in there so that you can display
colourful animations from either the
community or your own animations yes
because you can courage on animations
using our free online emitter and upload
the animations to your table
you can view all of the available
animations on the led table that come
this table would be nothing without the
games and you can use your smartphone as
a gamepad in fact we have the poem snake
stacking game jumping game and modern
anything we got a couple of very cool
drinking games
you can easily control the table using
the Android app it's really quick twos
are running off the table changing the
brightness the orientation can control
the animations and play all of the games
of the Ellie's table
actually one of the best thing about
this led table is the simplicity so
there is no need for DIY skills no need
for computer programming skills
basically you just plug in the table and
you're good to go and if you liked this
project please share it with your family
and parents if you don't have some fun
you can head to the animation editor and
the led table don't come finally to have
any feedback or comments let me know so
we can improve the table thank you
I'm here she from MIT media we are
studying about how to represent
informations in Milan we are presenting
transform is completely new form of a
dynamic physical and digital computation
of material picture is intangible it has
to do anything with the body only you
have candles a machine being mediated by
a remote control like mass touchscreen
you notice my hands they've started
activities so that we decided to
physically embody
computational information make my
initial mission tangible by coupling
with physical materials and underline
competition however physical portion is
religious and shy they can dance they
don't transform picture you can make
dance by writing called imagine this is
equivalent of the invention of the new
media the painting music plastic in
computer graphics
when movie was invented there's no
context no to the application but now
it's brought up in a very interesting
manner
so think about transform as a new media
to the image possibilities but
fundamental difference is recurrently so
here's a challenge to all the creator
and artist what will you do with this we
present all the new possibility is
nobody ever thought about imagine then
viewers or readers have to say create
then is fun so hope many people will see
then think about difference is not end
but there's something beyond that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
