clamping up a true 90-degree corner used
to be one of the tougher things we have
to do in woodworking the Bessie angle
clamps make that job a whole bunch
easier whether you're gluing up a true
90 degree miter joint a 90 degree butt
joint even one with two different
thicknesses of wood or even a t joint
like we have when building sashes or
cabinets the Ben C angle clamps make the
job easy and accurate we can use two
different wood thicknesses because both
of the jaws pivot on the shaft this lets
them compensate for the varying wood
thicknesses yet still remains squared of
each other
clamping force is applied by turning a
large diameter and very familiar Bessie
handle that handle turns the galvanized
steel shaft that has the Acme thread
formed into it the Acme thread applies
pressure quickly but evenly with very
little effort the fixed and movable jaws
have holes in them for using the Bessie
table clamps these clamps let you secure
the Bessie angle clamp to the work
surface and frees up both hands for
putting the wood in having both
hands-free makes it much easier to get
the wood installed in the clamp
correctly the openings in a drawers make
it easy to do T joints but they make it
possible to install fasteners while the
wood is clamped up if you need it for
that job as I have come to expect from
all things Bessie their angle clamps are
very well made and work exactly as
Bessie describes quality construction
and ease of use mean - Bessie angle
clamps will make building accurate
corners much easier now and well into
the future
