the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it clings to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we'd come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travellers wanting an easy
way to wash clothes while on the go it's
also simple to use you simply place it
water add some soap turn on the built-in
timer and walk away minutes later your
clothes are cleaner than ever before
sonic Stoke is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close sonic soak is your solution
sonic soap is ready to be shipped just
after our campaign ends we just need you
to help make it happen which means you
can have a cleaner almost anything and
practically no time once we end this
campaign successfully so please help us
bring sonic soap to mass production and
experience clean like never before

at Planet computers we are passionate
about typing writing being productive
creating on-the-go since the
introduction of touchscreen mobile
phones and tablets we feel that it is
very difficult to type on these types of
devices we decided to reinvent the palm
sized keyboard mobile device that will
benefit many who miss using the keyboard
on the move from ryoga's and creatives
that need to constantly write
professionals who need to read and write
email create and edit documents and
spreadsheets hi I'm Martin relief it I'm
a founder of the air 4 which is a
london-based design consultancy and we
in the past have made a reputation from
designing a lot of handheld electronic
equipment including scion PDAs
in PDAs our personal digital assistants
bizarrely they've sort of dropped out of
fashion we have always been strong
proponents for this kind of device we
feel it's time to bring it to the market
again because so many people they say
why isn't there a product like this now
planet computers introduces the Gemini a
modern clamshell based mobile device
with a palm-sized keyboard fully
integrated into the device
it's sleek metal clamshell design both
protects the device and beautifully
tucks away the palm-sized QWERTY
keyboard and screen when closed
it fits into a pocket roughly the same
as today's mobile fame when open the
innovative clamshell also acts as a
support of the device the ultra wide 5.7
inch high-res touchscreen provides ample
space for creating on the go the full
tactile keyboard is recognized as the
world's smallest keyboard for finger
touch typing Gemini has a powerful 10
core processor a graphics coprocessor
and 64 gigabytes of storage it is fully
equipped with 4G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
enabling both data communications and
mobile phone holes it is designed to run
the latest Android OS and all your
favorite apps as well as Linux with a
dual boot option all below 400 grams of
weight the double sized battery provides

every once in a while a revolutionary
product comes along that changes
everything
I'd like you to meet the bubble here
it all started five years ago when I was
working for a company called immersive
media at that time they were working
with Google to create what is now known
as Street View a problem in the market
that I saw was that spherical technology
was only being used for mapping we could
probably use it for some other things
like panoramic photos and filmmaking and
interactive videos we decided upon
ourselves to make something special the
bubble cam doesn't just capture photos
or videos but also streamed live video
we want to make this technology
affordable small so it's portable and
available to everything people are
accustomed to shooting panoramas with
their mobile phones there's a problem
with that
it's inherently at a sync with the
bubble can you press the button once and
boom you've got your photos your video
and you pop it in our software you can
look all around it's amazing we've
designed the camera in a tetrahedral
orientation to ensure there are no blind
spots because each camera overlaps the
joining camera no other camera that
we've seen on the market is able to
handle that as well as put it in a form
factor that's the size of a baseball
that's light portable and easy to bring
around with you in any environment that
you want to record with bubbles
patent-pending tetrahedral design you'll
get 14 megapixel photos h.264 video
capturing 1080p at 15 frames per second
and 720p at 30 frames per second Wi-Fi
live-streaming a microSD slot and USB
streaming I really think people are
gonna want to buy the bubble camera just
because of its ability to shoot in many
different directions
the fact is it takes in all views in
real time whether it be security and
surveillance action sports gaming Real
Estate's teleconferencing I really do
think the opportunities are
with bubbles SDK and API our goal is to
allow people to experiment and explore
with this new technology and we've seen
it used in music videos before with the
Black Eyed Peas
Beck we've seen it commercially used for
IKEA and Budweiser one of the most
exciting things that I'm looking forward
to is seeing how filmmakers are going to
be using 360 video it's a whole new way
to shoot things and create interactive
experiences and a new way of telling
stories body mind change is a is a
co-production between TIFF and the CFC
Media Lab we can start to figure out
what we can do with it and I'm really
excited about the installation work the
video work the interactive work that you
can do a technology like this we've
designed the bubble cam to be ready and
available to everyone you're gonna have
to make a choice sometimes you want that
straight on shot that one angle but
they're gonna be moments where you want
to see everything with your help we're
gonna make 360 degrees of your world
available at any time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
