unit noticed military assistance command
Vietnam studies an observations group or
Mac V Saud carries a unique combat knife
into the jungle on covert missions years
later in 1986 that knife inspires a
young designer to bounce on paying
tribute to that special ops unit with
its very first knife what begins as a
single commemorative model soon becomes
a full line of innovative tools

the CRKT foresight a tactical knife
that's big heavy duty and built for
professional use
today at CRKT we are taking a look at
the Lukas Burnley design squid this is a
beautiful little knife designed as an
EDC folder it is smaller compact Lukas
designed it as kind of like the knife
version of a compact pistol you can see
some of those lines and different feel
there it is a smaller knife but I've
been carrying one for two weeks and I
really enjoy it really love it here are
some of the specs on it the overall
length on it is 5.7 inches the blade
length is 2.1 inches so it's under that
3 magic number there so you can carry it
in places where three inch blades over
three inch blades are illegal sea squid
Burnley design on the one side it's got
an ambidextrous thumb stud for easy left
or right-handed opening I like the
jimping on the spine there the closing
on this knife it is a frame lock you can
see just push it over there
and pull the blade down to close it I
love the black stone wash so basically
we put a black coating on there and then
tumble it with a bunch of stones to give
it that look and feel the pocket clip is
deep carry tip up carry only here's a
shot of it in my pocket to give an idea
of how it rides here's a shot of it in
my hand now some people might complain
this is a small knife it's gonna be good
for smaller hands at the same time
though there is a lanyard hole there so
you can attach your own lanyard put a
skull bead or whatever bead on there and
it's gonna give you a lot more real
estate there in the hand comes in a
satin version as well
satin stone wash I should say they're
fun to flick and just play with again a
smaller knife the weight on it is 3.4
ounces the handles are stainless steel
designed by Lucas Burnley in New Mexico
let me show you one shot of it against
this ruler right here to give you an
idea of how big it is very great knife
for EDC everyday carry and just a great
little pocket knife designed by Lucas
Burnley thanks for watching and thanks
for carrying CRKT
