engineering and design an ultra portable
device that stretches the boundaries of
what's possible for a drone this size to
do this we had to reimagine the most
efficient design possible each and every
aspect has been refined and optimized
from its radical foldable design down to
every line and polished curve
the result is a powerfully creative tool
in a dramatically reduced form factor
the Maverick heir has a presence that
oozes style and geometric elegance arms
and propellers sit flush against its
slender aerodynamic frame it is the most
portable drone to house a 3-axis
mechanical in protected by the chassis
the newly designed gimbal system is
suspended from a set of dampeners in a
three-dimensional formation which
dramatically reduces vibration for
steadier shots for greater stability in
flight we've developed a new dual hinge
design for the arms the foldable landing
gears are positioned on the tips of the
arms hidden inside our omnidirectional
antennas that are purposely placed away
from the body to provide more extensive
signal coverage for optimal transmission
pneumatic air has seven onboard cameras
that are reinforced by guru magnesium
alloy brackets offering a more robust
framework for better performance
processing data from this many sensors
allows the Maverick air to read the
environment with a greater attention to
detail providing better obstacle
avoidance and more accurate real-time
positioning for a drone this small and
this powerful heat dissipation needs to
be handled efficiently air is drawn in
from behind the gimbal and through the
heatsink with excess heat expelled from
vents on the back to achieve such an
intricate of bulb design we had to be
meticulous about our manufacturing
process going to such extremes was the
only
to deliver a product that met our high
quality standards in both form and
function
as an unrivaled piece of engineering the
Maverick air is a new milestone of
flight performance functionality and
design an ultra portable smart drone
that is bound to turn people's
imaginations into reality
you've waited all day for the best light
you've waited for just the right moment
the typhoon h+ gives you the confidence
to capture the best shots you've ever
taken with this aerial camera
professional-grade features are
accessible at any skill level capture
incredible imagery with a large aperture
one-inch sensor camera capable of 20
megapixel stills and 4k footage at 60
frames per second typhoon H+ comes
equipped with intel realsense technology
a sophisticated collision avoidance
system that detects obstacles and
intelligently navigates around this
aerial camera is powered by a newly
redesigned android based st 16
controller which includes a large high
brightness 7-inch integrated display
leading its category in stable flight
and quiet operation the large six rotor
airframe is extremely stable in winds up
to 30 miles per hour and is 40 percent
quieter than previous hex models capture
those perfect moments with the all-new
typhoon h plus
what do you need for incredible aerial
imaging a brilliant camera an aircraft
you can trust and the intelligence to
make every shot cinematic the new
phantom 4 Pro has all this and much more
The Phantom 4 pro camera has an F 2.8
apertures mechanical shutter and large
one-inch sensor coming together to make
brighter more detailed imagery record
cinematic 4k video at higher bit rates
with more advanced compression and a
wider dynamic range 4k 60 frames per
second recording gives you stunning
detailed slow-motion aerial video the
phantom 4 pro is as adept at stills as
it is with video capturing every detail
at 20 megapixels its mechanical shutter
eliminates rolling shutter bending grab
the perfect moment using burst mode
all of this makes the phantom4 pro the
most advanced aerial camera ever found
in the Phantom series The Phantom 4 pro
is now a huge step forward I'm taking
photos of the lava when it's darker out
and the glow of the lavas coming off of
it the image sensor that's in this
camera now is 1 inch sensor 20
megapixels that extra dynamic range
allows me to really get everything into
one shot in the landscape that's
extremely important see your shot
clearly even in direct sunlight with the
new ultra bright 5.5 inch monitor that's
more than twice as bright as most
tablets inside is DJI light bridge
technology it automatically detects
interference and switches from two point
four to five point eight gigahertz
transmission and takeoff cutting through
the noise for more reliability the
built-in monitor on the phantom core pro
is so bright I'm actually able to see in
direct sunlight and that's really
allowing me to compose my shot and get
what I really want to capture active
Trek has now been expanded with three
new intelligent flight modes profile
tracks your subject horizontally from
any side spotlight locks the camera on a
subject while you fly in almost any
direction circle swings 360 degrees
around the subject
Tapp fly has also been improved adding
reverse tap fly making it perfect for
aerial selfies flying The Phantom 4 Pro
is even more worryfree a set of rear
visual sensors has been added to
existing forward and downward sensors
combined with new infrared obstacle
sensors on its sides the Phantom 4 Pro
has five directions of sensing if image
signal is lost it returns home while
dynamically avoiding obstacles and even
flies back along its original flight
path until signal is regained every
minute in the air counts the new
high-capacity battery flight time has
been increased to 30 minutes when it
comes to speed the Phantom 4 Pro is ten
miles per hour faster with full support
of its obstacle sensing systems
with it's stunning camera 1 inch sensor
ultra bright monitor obstacle sensing
and intelligence the phantom 4 pro
brings professional quality aerial
imaging and flight capabilities to more
pilots around the world
