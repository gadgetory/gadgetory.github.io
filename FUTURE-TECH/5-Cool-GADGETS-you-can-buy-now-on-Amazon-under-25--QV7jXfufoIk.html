you
hello my name is water I'm being held
prisoner inside this disposable plastic
bottle just like you are I used to run
freely through your faucet drinking
fountains until big companies came up
with the greatest marketing scheme ever
sticking in a bottle slap on a fancy
label and sell me back to you for a huge
profit seriously
hi I'm Eric and I'm Paul and were the
creators of core water we started core
years ago because we were tired of being
held hostage to bottled water it's
become an irrational but necessary evil
for all of us when were on the go right
like I was at the airport the other day
couldn't find a water fountain so I had
to buy a four dollar bottle of water
it's the same story when I'm at a hotel
ball game or the gym but what if
together we could end the excuse of
bottled water once and for all we asked
ourselves the same question how could we
match the convenience taste and style of
bottled water we spent over 18 months
developing our prototype and I think
we've come up with something truly
revolutionary it's called the Corps Nava
the Nava is a reusable water bottle with
its own filter it looks cool it's easy
to drink from and it allows you to have
clean great tasting water right from the
tap
I admit it I'm obsessed with design of
this water laws
we chose to make our filter out of
coconut shells that are converted into
activated carbon now activated carbon
has been used for thousands of years to
purify water a lot of filters though are
made from coal which can contain heavy
metals coconut it's not only safer it's
a renewable resource
to make it really easy to break the
bottled water habit we're going to
create a filter subscription program
right on our website you'll get the
filters delivered to your door when you
need them so you won't have to worry
about going to get replacements our
filter lasts for about three months or
40 gallons of water so that's 300
plastic bottles that aren't going into a
landfill that aren't even being
manufactured and trucked around the
planet and you'll be saving yourself
about $400 with most bottles the
mouthpiece and drinking experience is a
complete afterthought
with the nava we strive to create an
amazing ergonomic spout that feels great
on your lips a lot of filter bottles
require you to either squeeze the bottle
to force the water through the filter or
you have to suck through the spout like
a Hoover vacuum our breakthrough was to
create something we call easy flow which
gives an amazing drinking experience
easy flow is an optimization between the
coconut carbon filter and the housing
such that it gives you incredible
tasting water but with great flow if
we've done our job right and I think we
have with the core nava all the hours of
engineering and technology that's gone
into this bottle is invisible and
they're just left with an incredible
experience with just about every other
bottle we looked at the mouthpiece is
exposed to germs and dirt so our
solution is this push button cap that
protects the mouthpiece it opens with
one hand has a cool ergonomic handle and
you'll never lose your cap because it's
attached to the Bob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
