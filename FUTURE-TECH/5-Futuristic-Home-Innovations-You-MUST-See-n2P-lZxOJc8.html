technology has changed over the past 20
years these days were looking for quick
solutions to solve our problems and ways

production and begin shipping the
soberer coffee table to your living room
we believe that so bro is a future of
furniture because it makes living a
connected life more convenient please
back us today
and help make this server a coffee table
a reality
what is a perfect chair to you inspired
by the concept of multifunctional design
we present you spin sex each spin sex
consists of 61 elements and carries up
to a hundred and sixty kilograms
allowing you to build well anything you
want a shame launch a bench or maybe an
armchair it has never been easier to
design a chair all you have to do is
slide one element onto another and
simply by turning the elements around
you can change the shell the secret of
this creative design lies in the shape
of the element as you can see and this
is actually really smart there's a long
side and a short side this allows you to
create by the record surface or straight
surface spin Texas made a 100%
recyclable innovative material unlike
traditional plastic it is earth friendly
and very strong so use it everywhere and
with everyone inside or outside with
your friends family or even kids the
spin Tex kids version is both in
entertainment and a great educational
tool you can play with colors sizes and
forms have fun and develop your
creativity spin Tex also comes with the
latest interactive app imagine that you
can find all possible manuals or
virtually build your own designs and
even
how strong they are build something
amazing and get it named after you with
the Sprint exam it's impossible the
value of Sprint X is that you can
constantly refresh the living space
without wasting any time and money
during this crowdfunding campaign we
offer you an amazing piece of furniture
for a very special price with your
support we will be able to set up the
manufacturing process and share the idea
of spin Tech's worldwide
this is curved Velux the smart
nightstand that makes your life easier
you can play the perfect track for your
mood and always keep your devices
wirelessly charged thanks to a sunrise
alarm curve Velux will wake you up at
the right moment in a very natural way
also you can lock with a single tab of
the drawer like this keep your stuff
safe meanwhile her Velux will watch your
step late at night literally
discover a world of possibilities and
start living in your connected home now
tell me what is your nightstand done for
you lately hey guys I'm Jonathan and I'm
Chris and this is charger and together
we designed this increase help reduce
pet anxiety like many pet owners my dog
charger is part of the family
charger gets extremely anxious and
afraid whenever I'm out of the house the
only thing that terrifies them more in
separation is this fear thunder
fireworks this was heartbreaking to
watch as I can only imagine how he felt
after trying every option available with
no relief I decided to come up with my
own solution I teamed up with my partner
Chris plus his PhD in robotics we
started by researching what causes
anxiety and dogs howl dogs sense and
feel things differently than we do and
how they naturally seek comfort during
times of anxiety the design was inspired
by combining several different remedies
through our research this solution came
down to several factors vibration
dampening noise cancelling and making a
comfortable home for the dog after years
of research we built the first prototype
in 2014 and the results were amazing
charger instantly tiptoes news and great
seeing how much calmer charger was
during thunderstorms I realized we were
onto something big we designed a Zen
crate with a built-in proximity sensor
which tells the crate when it's occupied
once the sensors are triggered the crate
activates a unique playlist of soothing
music and sounds which have been shown
through scientific research to reduce
anxiety and fear related stress and dogs
understanding like humans each dog also
has its own personality we want to make
sure the playlist was adjustable to the
dogs likes and dislikes
since dogs can't provide feedback like
we do on our music apps we have
developed an algorithm that looks for
trends in the dog's behavior which adds
an delete songs to specifically
customize a playlist just for them one
of the best features of this end crate
is that it comes ready to transmit data
through Wi-Fi it can let the owner note
through a text message or email when the
dog enters or leaves the crate
and the a dull Wi-Fi camera gives the
owner the ability to see their dog when
they're not him the zinc ray has been
designed with simplicity of mind as it
does not require a single tool to
assemble with each piece engineered to
snap or slide together the entire
assembly process takes less than five
finally we wanted to build a smart crate
as attractive for the dog as it was for
the owner so we focused the design on
being aesthetically pleasing the
physical look of the zen crate invites
owners to place it within any style of
home and it'll blend in as a stylist
piece of furniture hi my name is jasmine
and this is my son rocket living in
Miami is very crazy schedule that I have
rocket gets major anxiety when I leave
he's crying he's scratching the door
down and after getting this egg crate I
noticed the change in his behavior he's
more calm he doesn't cry as much she
doesn't worry as much so I feel
confident when I have to go make a run
or something happens I didn't get called
in to work that he'll be safe when he's
hearing her be comfortable most
importantly my name is Dennis woohoo
Thea I am the CEO for a canine
specialist dog training in South Florida
my 25 years doing this over 9,000 dogs
and I've gotten a good 25-30 percent of
dogs that have all these issues anxiety
issues therefore the light under trees
are free of thunder taking out my 25
years of experience I would highly
recommend the st. crate for your dogs in
order for us to make this possible we
need the support in collaboration of
other pet owners we've assembled a
number of prototypes and sent them to
beta testers all around the world we've
taken their feedback and we've
incorporated them into the latest design
now we're ready to start manufacturing
our goal is to raise $80,000 and start
manufacturing this end crate with our
partners your support will help bring
comfort and relief to millions of pets
and their owners thank you everyone for
your support we are dreamers
we are extraordinary we are innovators
we are leaders the future doesn't just
happen it is created by those with the
vision to change the world
sleep we spend winter for our life
sleeping with our media and many of us
wish we got married yeah technology
which has transformed so many of our
behaviors has done very little to
improve the way we sleep some would
argue that technology has been worsening
sleep I can stand for I fidelity canopy
and will change this way of thinking
back in 2008 I can become the world's
first smart bed ever conceived
we believe it represented an icon in the
industry this first success give us the
motivation to go back to work and
concentrate all our efforts for the past
years developing a new account that is
much better in every way
while designing a can bed I was thinking
about what kind of experience we could
create in order to reach people lives
this experience is the driving force
behind the design of the product and it
comes to life thanks to technology we
named it our bed I can because it's
design suggests a new interpretation of
the classic canopy creating the ultimate
comfort zone around bed and expanding it
to a new concept of cocoon the new icon
is much more than a bed combined with an
entertainment system I can is the first
bed integrated platform based on
open-source software every feature can
be tailored to individual habits because
few things are more personal than the
bed environment people working on
Advanced Research in sleep technology
will find I can to be a great hardware
and software framework for the
development of new sleep related
applications the new again
is also easier intuitive to use and will
be provided with amazing new features
like voice control and the health
monitoring application your idea of
birth relation dreams and entertainment
will never be the same
