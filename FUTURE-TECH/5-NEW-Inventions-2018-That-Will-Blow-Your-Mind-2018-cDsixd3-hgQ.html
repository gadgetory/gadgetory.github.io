there's you today
week
just begun the best is yet to come
beautiful
you
this is the Echo smartpen from
Livescribe it's a computer in a pen and
it works like this the smart pen starts
recording everything you write in here
write notes during a meeting or lecture
draw diagrams mark important information
to replay just top your notes and
high-quality audio plays back from that
exact moment you can jump forward or go
back to notes from days months even
years ago the Echo smartpen connects to
your PC or Mac computer by USB cable to
transfer your notes and audio to
Livescribe desktop after the transfer
your digital notes and audio come to
life as an interactive document called a
pen cast pen casts allow you to hear see
and relive your notes exactly as they
were recorded to search your handwritten
notes type in any word Livescribe
desktop searches for every place that
word appears in your writing stay
organized with custom notebooks by
combining pages from different notebooks
notes can be transcribed into typed text
by downloading an app that sold
separately you can even share your notes
and audio as an interactive PDF
accessible by anyone with the latest
Adobe Reader the Echo smartpen it's time
your notes worked for you
this is Google home it has this feature
called voice ID which is really just a
fancy way of saying this thing knows the
difference between your voice and other
people's voices so if you say hey Google
call mom okay
calling mom it'll call your mom not just
anyone's mom
because that would be weird I mean
imagine if this thing was just calling
random people's moms I don't think
people would really like that feature
this is Jeff and this is his exercise
routine
he works hard to build up his cardio and
muscle he also wants to lose weight but
it takes energy and time to burn away
the pounds Jeff would stay in the gym
and continue to fight for weight loss
results but he needs to get to work
imagine if you could take your weight
loss regime with you to the office and
burn calories all day now there is a
revolutionary technology that allows you
to do just that
introducing the thin ice fast a slick
wearable embedded with cooling
technology that forces your body to burn
extra calories when I first got this
idea I had this bolt of realization that
this could be a game-changer in the
weight loss industry the thin ice fest
is comfortable and lightweight and will
help you shed pounds even as you sleep
the vest can even wait until you are in
deep sleep before activating so the
technology won't make you cold it will
just make you thinner the thin ice fest
is also discreet enough to be worn under
regular clothing so you can use it
anytime day or night
go to bed how does the thin ice vest
help produce calorie burning using cold
temperatures the body responds by
revving up and burning fat to keep your
blood warm the process is called
cold temperature thermogenesis that's
what really ingenious solution anything
that I could just wear day to day that
would help me lose weight would be an
absolute asset there are certain people
out there that we all love to hate and
these are the people who can eat
whatever they'd like to and not gain any
weight and what this product is actually
able to do is give you those
characteristics by speeding up your
metabolism
I'm a gamer so having a cheat code is
something I'm all about another
innovative part of the thin ice system
is the Bluetooth connected mobile app it
allows you to adjust the temperature of
the technology to your comfort levels
you can also track the calories you're
burning second-by-second and if you want
to take things to the next level
the app will recommend special diet and
exercise routines to help you lose
weight like a champ thin ice is getting
ready to ship out its 1.0 version this
quarter but the 2.0 version of the
technology will be sleeker have a longer
battery life and can be taught to
respond to your body temperature so it
can keep you comfortably cool or in a
weight loss zone as the environment or
your body changes then ice need your
generous support to put this
revolutionary technology into your hands
in exchange for that support you'll be
among the first to receive the thin ice
system this comes with the thin ice vest
the mobile app the e-book a body
sculpting cream and a transdermal
caffeinate bracelet to keep your energy
high and your appetite at bay the only
thing I really got left is uh where do I
buy one of these the thin ice system is
the most advanced and effortless weight
loss system on the planet all we need
now is you then ice the coolest way to
lose weight
this is the free skate camp song the
innovative design lets you fold this off
flat while remaining completely
assembled using no extra tools it's slim
size when folded

gear bag without threat of loss parts
apply the sturdy blade to cut through
larger diameter wood its structure lets
you work with the full length of the
blade for the most efficient use of your
energy replace the standard 12-inch
blade easily when needed
