you date her tonight Richard I was
introducing not the world's adjustable
here in control don't like what you hear
turn it down
want to hear more panawe available
another knob is a solid and
patent-pending design that evolves
around the concept of a revolutionary
volume adjustment system with step one
you can hear everything crystal-clear at
full volume
step two is perfect to slightly noisy
environment
step three has a state-of-the-art
acoustic music filter with step four
you can totally isolate yourself from
your environment hearing damage is
irreversible not takes care of your is
not as developed by a young startup
government based in Amsterdam two of
them kuennen Quinten already have a
successful ear protection company called
Thunder plug which is sold in a whopping
26 countries worldwide the other
creative masterminds are Arjen and
Richard who add cutting-edge innovation
and design into the mix together they
form the created backbone of not an
analog adjustable hearing solution that
is adaptable to every situation from
concert to exam from festival to
construction work notes will be
available in various colors and trims
could perfectly suit your own style not
control your volume
you
wait what is this thing this is called I
spend hand-finished it is a substitute
for these habits that we get used to in
our daily life it helps stress relief
and makes you focus currently we find
these good qualities winners are very
expensive in the market while the cheap
ones has very poor quality so we want to
make a high quality hand spinner that is
affordable by most of us the I spin
spinner is made of 18 colorful oring 10
CNC machined brass parts and one high
quality bearing the 6th green o-rings in
the middle is illuminated because of the
high quality bearing we use the spinner
is super quiet and the spinning time can
be up to 3 to 5 minutes it also makes
the spinner well balanced at your hand
so that you can play the trick with the
I spin spinner easily it takes us three
months for the research and sampling now
we get everything ready and need your
help to reduce the mass production cost
and bring the fantastic hand center in
front of you miss Mike nice a bit of a
party starters let's put it that way
that's what he's been doing for the past
20 years and he is becoming pretty damn
good at it
well I wish this story was all fun and
games but sometimes you got to take
action to preserve your body Mike's ears
are paying the price whenever he is
DJing and producing he feels fatigue
pain and loss of sensitivity but not
anymore now you use this be but a
pleasant let sound in and keeps noise
out ha what is this D but thing you ask
D but is what saved Mike from imminent
silence and can save a lot of other
people featuring a slider that allows
you to adjust to the amount of decibels
you want to filter out D bud gives you a
clearer crisper and safer music
experience what's the difference between
D but and a regular ear plug you might
ask well here's some scientific
explanation
your ear is designed to naturally boost
frequencies around 2 to 4 Q alerts like
human speech most ear plugs simply fill
out your ear canal to block sound
problem is that they alter your years
resonance frequency causing muffled
unclear hearing as a result with D bus
you can speak feel listen mood do
exactly what you're used to do our
acoustic mesh is designed to reduce
volume evenly for all frequencies
throughout the spectrum while the
acoustic or mechanically enhances
frequencies in the range of human speech
z bus simply brings you clear safe sound
for Mike this was a decision that
dramatically changed the quality of his
life with a simple slide and he is
telling all his friends about it breathe
slide this to pitch down the high notes
of joyful children can't still be able
to talk to the parents ed and tall slide
this to tone down machine noise and keep
the creative juices flowing and slide
the jet so she can hear herself think at
the agency and still be aware of the
latest gossip
Samuel slides it to maintain sanity and
focus and make every chance of small
talk a prolific dialogue after years of
research prototyping and testing we
achieved a sleek design plug with
minimum visual impact perfect fix and
250
this means crisper clearer hearing with
reduced volume every time we're ear labs
and our mission is to bring you a better
and safer listening experience no matter
who you are or what you do back us on
Kickstarter and help us make a
difference for millions of people around
the world debug let's sound in keeps
noise out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
