specializes in adjustable height heels
bringing convenience flexibility and
practicality to the everyday woman we
women love our heels and it's easy to
see why they elongate our legs and
enhance the femininity of our gear but
we've also developed a love-hate
relationship with them the sharp pains
aches and cramps but why do they have to
be this way women shouldn't have to
suffer to look and feel amazing this
motivated us to change the conventional
heel we wanted to create something that
could bring you through your busiest day
and still look great at that dinner
party Gina's heels are able to transform
from a 2cm to a 9 cm heel these Heights
were selected after an online poll of
over 10,000 women which found these to
be the most comfortable and practical
Hugh Heights for walking switching from
high to low can be done in a matter of
seconds giving your feet a break
whenever you feel like it
our heels are made from napa leather
which is known for his luxurious feel
softness and durability this also means
you won't need to bring into our heels
and for the extra comfort with
integrated additional cushioning
throughout the heel so that you won't
have to purchase additional padding
designed for everyday wear our
prototypes were subjected to a
four-month long testing period to ensure
that every Hill continues to provide
comfort remains durable even after being
exposed to the elements our heels come
in two styles a plastic and bus stop
pump and send us for more casual look
switching the heel is easy just release
the catch push the heel up and click the
lock to store the heel release the catch
pull the heel down and wait for the
click being able to share this modern
design with every woman and making their
life that much easier is what we want to
achieve visit our Kickstarter page for
more information
here's the secret every day a woman
chooses her underwear based on three
things
looks comfort and function sometimes you
need underwear for being active
sometimes you need underwear for your
period other times you just want to feel
comfortable sexy
the reasons are endless so I thought to
myself what if we created a patty that
does it all and it's all that you ever
need women began wearing bloomers for
outdoor activities over a hundred years
ago yet underwear hasn't changed much in
function ever since but women have and
that's why blooms purvey was born my
name is Sarah Coronado founder and
inventor of blooms purvey I'm the
co-owner of Silicon Valley's top yoga
studio and founder of Lotus premium
denim my first successful Kickstarter
backed project I'm obsessed design and
function and I believe in innovation
that serves a much bigger purpose blooms
purvey is the next step in the underwear
evolution so what makes it the perfect
penny it's it's versatile as a woman who
wearing the secret is in its three
patent-pending features first
it has two catchable sides make you
changing easy and convenient have you
ever wanted to change out of your
underwear without getting completely
undressed like after a tough workout or
from an unexpected emergency
now you can blooms purvey literally
allows you to change anytime anywhere
our metal clasps are restless and
resistant to salt water and chlorine
they're secure durable and so
comfortable hey guys it's a crafty
prepper you know you're a prepper when
you get a go girl for Christmas my mom
got it for me and she got her one too if
you haven't ever heard of it it's a it's
a little silicone cup that girls can
hold against themselves and pee standing
up I mean little girl hasn't dreamed of
peeing standing up your whole life right
like I was a kid a little I kneeled on
the toilet seat face in the
tank trying to pee in the toilet and it
ran down my legs everything else so when
I saw this I thought it was really
awesome
but this little tube just fits in my
purse and it's got a little baggie you
can put it in after you've used it so
you can take it home and wash it it's
got a little piece of toilet paper which
I never used but it just looks kind of
shabby but this is what it looks like
it's a little silicone Cup and you have
to hold it you have to hold it like this
like with a finger thumb up here and
your finger down here and just hold it
up to your parts and then pee and I
guess if you had you know really really
had to go you could overfill the cup but
I never had that problem and I tried
like this is kind of awkward pushing
really hard to see if I could get it to
squirt it out faster but it just doesn't
cause it's just so fun oh but I tried it
anyway anyhow I'm not gonna show you
I'll pour some water in it and show you
if I can do all this at the same time
show you like how fast it comes out
anyway so you think you can do it much
and it doesn't go very far out so you
still gotta kind of spread your feet
apart I'm making arrests spread your
feet apart so you don't splash your toes
but because it's silicone you can pretty
much shake it pretty good and there's
not any water or appie left on it anyway
so then you just dry it really good and
you fold it you fold it flat like this
and roll it back up in the papers and
stick it back in the tube when you're
done anyway here's the idea you can put
it back in your backpack and keep going
so it's really great for hiking or
camping because nobody likes to squat in
the woods trust me and it would be great
to have in your bug out bag so if you
were on the go you could just you know
hee-ha shake it off and keep going
alright I think you should get one if
you don't have one ladies it's really
awesome take care guys it's one of the
most unique designs out there in terms
of you know choice to be used during sex
toys to be kind of enhancements to sex I
feel like the idea of it you know
fitting where it does is absolute genius
if I had this product I think I would
probably wear it all the time having
something that hands-free that you can
use during sex
it's not gonna be distracting it's just
gonna add a little bit to the experience
I think that's a really good product I
find some toys very frustrating just
because of the amount of real estate
that they take up and the whole point of
intimacy is to be close to another
person and not to you know have a giant
wall of plastic and buttons in between
you and that person
no problem with holding a vibrator
during sex is that it can really get in
the way and detract from the experience
it definitely enhanced the experience
you know just being able to focus
completely on my partner and not having
to focus on like holding a toy or
adjusting a toy I also think there is
something a little bit weird for some
guys about having another dick in the
mix when you're having sex this was just
not obtrusive at all it was like as far
as he could tell there was nothing you
know there was nothing in his way he
didn't feel like I was intrusive at all
he wasn't like oh my gosh this thing is
taking over her sex life like what are
you doing like it just it was a minor
enhancement and not something that
over the bedroom I definitely notice
when she's enjoying herself more and I
get a lot of pleasure out of that I
thought that the vibrations were
surprisingly strong for such a small
device and that was really impressive
the placement is genius like its spot-on
eva sits in the right place the
vibration is always comfortable there's
you know even if the toy does reposition
itself there's not a chance that it's
not gonna be pleasurable so there are
some positions where it didn't stay in
place perfectly
but using one finger is not really a
huge taxing thing and it doesn't really
take you out of the moment it wasn't
falling down it wasn't moving up it was
you know occasionally it would pop out
but that wasn't a big deal you just pop
it back in it gives women a lot more
power in their sexuality I could focus
on my partner and doing stuff with my
partner while also having that sensation
I definitely felt like it made me more
engaged in my own experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
