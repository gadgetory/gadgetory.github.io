accessible by anyone with the latest
Adobe Reader the Echo smartpen it's time
your notes worked for you
the keyboard pocketknife module has a
slip joint deployment mechanism the 2.2
inch cutting blade that's always there
for everyday cutting tasks all keyport
modules have the same metal baseplate
that mount your module to the keyboard
slide 3.0 and the keyboard pivot to
install the module on your keyboard
slide 3.0 remove one of the side plates
align the metal feet on your module the
cavities on the side of your slide
always maintain pressure in the middle
of your module as you slide it forward
replace the end cap and you're all set
to install the module on your keyboard
pivot orient the front of the module
with the front of the pivot insert the
metal feet on the module into the
cavities in the chassis of your pivot
always maintain pressure in the middle
of your module while sliding it forward
until you hear a click to remove the
module you will need to use a pointed
tool such as a small screwdriver pen or
allen wrench to release the module you
will be depressing the middle snap tab
with the tool and sliding the module
towards the back of the pivots at the
same time rotate your keys to expose the
middle snap tab and you will see the
small dimple hold your pivot exactly as
shown with your thumb on the back near
the links and your finger on the front
of the module with slight pressure so as
you depress the snap tab with your tool
you can maintain control of the module
while sliding it forward let's try that
one more time
you can stack another module on top of
the pocketknife module exactly the same
way you would add a module to the pivot
to remove the module you'll need to use
a common thumbtack and a non-slip
surface such as this rubber coaster push
the module forward and insert the
thumbtack into the cavity at a slight
angle as shown as you depress the lower
snap tab with attack the module will
release thanks for watching
you
