like the process of playing the electric
guitar was in fact there were things I
just couldn't do easily from playing
wherever I wanted to getting going with
effects and recording right when I felt
inspired four years ago I set out on a
journey to create a more compelling
guitar playing experience well our team
has done it and now we're ready to bring
it to you meet the jams act the world's
first attachable guitar amp and also the
first integrates seamlessly with your
smartphone our priorities would create
the best all-around guitar playing
experience possible prioritizing the
absolute best tone at practice volumes
and complete and total portability the
jam stack allows you to play the
electric guitar anywhere by leveraging
the awesome power of your smart phone
and super lightweight speaker technology
in the past acoustic instruments were
the ultimate and portability being the
only real option for travel or playing
outside the jam stacks 10 watts of power
easily outperforms acoustic guitars and
hand drops you can be a unique part to
any outdoor jam session in fact your
guitar and your amplifier can fit easily
in the same case as well as being
uncompromising the portable it's also
the fastest way to play the electric
guitar with layered effects at any price
point James Tec snaps on to the back of
any standard electric guitar body using
the existing strap but unless you have
something like a blind Vee the jam stack
can be attached with one hand and under
three seconds we designed the James
stack to work with all major smartphones
including iOS Android and Windows phones
as well as the iPod touch we have the
opportunity to free the electric guitar
and bring it out into the world in a way
that has never been possible before we
just need your help to make it a reality
I created the jam stack because being an
electric guitar player was part of who I
was
now I'm thrilled I can carry that with
me anyway
don't you just hate it when your phone
runs out of juice when you're on that
important call or trying to get
directions say hello to Koki
go keys battery is capable of charging
your phone for up to two hours
keep it on your keyring for easy access
then use it to boost your phone on the
go to charge it plug it into any USB
port on your laptop in your car or right
into an outlet when you need to give
your phone a full charge you can use it
as a USB cable
goki charges itself while your phone is
charging and it can sync your data too
we also included flash Memphis
to store videos pictures music and files
the USB 3.0 feature allows much faster
file transfer now your keys are
connected to your phone through
bluetooth whenever you lose them use the
go key app on your phone to locate the
signal and then make your go key ring so
you can find

goki will make it ring
if you lose your keys go keys GPS app
helps you locate them use goatee as a
camera remote and let it snap a picture
for
goki lives on your keychain and it will
always be different when you need
I travel a lot I I think I was out of
town 200 days last year I take a lot of
short trips I never want to check bags I
never want to wait that the carousel I
try as much as possible as I know a lot
of people do to travel just with carry
on carry on just wasn't good enough the
bag was impossible you couldn't walk
with the bag over anything other than
just a perfectly flat surface and the
world is not perfectly flat we all
travel as commuters we travel more often
on shorter trips like many others I
realized that something was missing a
new type of traveler was evolving this
new traveler was not being taken care of
by any part of the industry this is
where taro comes in
the first thing I realized was that we
would need a large diameter wheel to
meet the needs of today's commuters and
travelers what our big wheels good for
for one they put the center of gravity
closer to the rotation axis and that
makes the bag fell dramatically lighter
these large access wheels strengthen the
sides of the bag and they're so slim
that they won't take any additional
space from the interior of the bag and
they run over everything after endless
hours of throwing and modeling I finally
got my dream wheel a game-changing
technology the wheel was done but the
bag wasn't quite there yet more winning
features needed to be added to make zero
the best possible bag for commuters we
gathered a talented team of designers
and together we begun to develop and
design learn more features that have
made zero even more durable economic and
functional we began work on a carrying
companion that would make international
airline standards we designed different
compartments one to all your personal
items and one to keep your work items
like your 15-inch laptop and an easy
access pocket for carry-on liquids we
developed a very long strong economic
handle instead of weighing every bag
down with features someone might not
need we developed an optional electronic
module it includes a proximity detector
location tracker 2 USB ports
international power outlet for your
laptop and a battery strong enough to
charge your smartphone up to 10
step-by-step we created our dream bag a
bag that's unbelievably maneuverable and
tough without added weight a bag with
all-terrain wheels and features to help
you comfortably get to where you're
going regardless of where that is
this is the first really disruptive bag
that has come to market in 25 years
turning ideas to reality is an expensive
process we've completed the design and
have sourced the manufacturers and we
are ready to make the toolings and go to
production in order to bring two euros
to commuters and travelers around the
world we need your support to produce
zero at an industrial scale I'm Nikolas
Marshall and I'm from Denmark the corner
of the world that has given us hands
Christian Andersen and Lego I believe
it's never been more important that kids
have the opportunity to exercise their
creativity imagination can take you
anywhere you just have to believe your
own ideas are fantastic luckily I wasn't
the only one feeling that way so it
seemed up with a bunch of nothing's and
possible people to create wait for it
the world's first online candy printer

show you how it works
the interactive experience is where it
all starts in the Kuban eyes again you

print your candy at home your fame and
fortune will grow along with the pub

market and the friends you make in candy
Navion well I'm never going to let my
kids produce their own candy you say I
hear you and I see where you're coming
from but don't worry what we're trying
to do with the Cuban isin is to turn the
tables on candy consumption as we know
it by making candy creative and fun
we're actually teaching kids and their
parents that the rush of innovation is
way more satisfying than the rush of
sugar the Cuba NASA is all about quality
quality ingredients

Bacchus by choosing one of the many
different perks right down here

to capture our memories we use it to get
through our day we use it to connect
