would tell me do you enjoy a nice glass
of wine I think you might and so you
know that as good as wine is when you
open a bottle it only tastes that way
for about a day but now with cuvee
because cuvee has a super smart bottling
and
fencing system that keeps oxygen from
touching the wine this is what you order
and this is how you pour it the screen
tells you what you're drinking tells you
how much there is left to drink shows
you the story of the wine lets you rate
the wine and even order more hey guys
what are we drinking well I was gonna
open a red I've been craving a
Chardonnay
possi now that's a problem what are you
gonna do open two bottles well I've read
it's fine no it's fine no with cuvee you
can have that Chardonnay you're craving
knock yourself out
or both take it apart the rest of us not
so much with cuvee you can choose
between hundreds of varietals styles and
vineyards in order from the cuvette
online store or even from the bottle
this means you can keep more wines
around and not worry about wastage
oxygen never gets into this bottle so
every glass you pour will taste amazing
for up to 30 days
drink what you want always fresh one
glass at a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
