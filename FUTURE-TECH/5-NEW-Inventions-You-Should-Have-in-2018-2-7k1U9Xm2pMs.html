introducing Luna the first and only
hardware solution that turns your iPad
into a true wireless second display to
create a workspace that frees you
wherever you go
Luna delivers stunning image quality
with virtually zero lag turning your
iPad into a touch Mac that works over
Wi-Fi Luna sets up in seconds and
instantly works with your existing Wi-Fi
simply plug it into any Mac USB C or
DisplayPort install the Luna app and
you're off and running
no antennas no waiting and no hassles we
developed the Lua because we knew there
was a better solution than relying on
software to turn an iPad into a second
display software apps literally hack
your graphics card
delivering a glitchy and unreliable
picture they trick your Mac into
thinking and displays attached when in
fact they get no benefit of graphics
acceleration or metal GPU support
so unlike software apps Luna harnesses
the raw power of your graphics card
giving you the full benefit of its
graphics acceleration delivering
stunning second monitor that's 100% wire
free in addition to acting as a second
display Luna also acts as a complete
extension near Mac allowing you to use
it directly from your iPad with full
support using external keyboards Apple
pencil and Apple touch interactions it
literally allows you to turn your
MacBook or iMac into a touchable device
designed and developed by the creators
of Astro pad the award-winning drawing
app used by major animation studios and
product design firms across the globe
Luna carries the same quality and
performance that
and delivered to their tens of thousands
of customers and for those of you who
are artists you compare Luna and aster
pad to take your studio anywhere and
create the ultimate drawing experience
Luna so much more than a second screen
keeping our home safe is important to
all of us getting your house broken into
sucks it's not just the stuff that you
lose but because your home feels
violated what you want is to keep it
from happening in the first place that's
why we created Cunha help you prevent
break-ins
this is Cunha Cunha is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you so you can see and talk to
them on your smartphone hey could you
leave the package out front
we're a little busy it's the best way to
actively prevent break-ins most
burglaries are crimes of opportunity the
burglars were actually knock on your
door to see if you're home and when they
realize you're not home they'll attempt
to enter your house keeping them outside
is the most important thing you can do
and koona allows you to do that
you can deter burglars by talking to
them or setting off kunas alarm yeah no
thanks
they'll leave and all this happens when
they're still outside before they even
try to break it making your home safer
shouldn't be a chore for one of these
you have to climb in the Attic run wires
drill holes it's a pain and it's not
cheap that's why we built Kuna into an
outdoor light just replace your old
light fixture it and use your existing
wiring connector no to Wi-Fi and you're
done it'll take 15 minutes and we want
Kona to look good no matter where it is
so we're making it in three different
styles to match your house you can put
Kuna anywhere front door back door even
the garage to watch your car oh and your
light gets smarter too you can control
it with the Kuna app turn it on turn it
off set a schedule or just let it turn
on automatically when it gets dark or
when there's a person you only want to
get alerts that matter Kuna ignores
trees and small animals and it
recognizes people's behaviors so if you
don't want to know every time your
spouse goes out jogging
you can tell Kuna dollar you only for
visitors waiting at the door and it'll
learn and get smarter over time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones or the
delivery guy Kona will always let you
know and if it's someone bad now you can
do something about it
kuna stop break-ins before they happen
