what if you could measure anything just
by walking this is Moser one it can
measure as far as a 1,000 foot tape
measure measure through walls and
obstacles as if they weren't there
measure winding cable lines or tracks
measure angles and curves calculate the
area of a room volume for storage or a
shipping package get the right game
Klein for your decade or stairwell
photos find the right horizontal level
and distance for your poster frames
measure circular objects cylinders even
irregular shapes all with one handle
just need to move it from one point to
the other pin you're done other
measuring tools fail when there's too
much light the wrong surface or if the
space prevents them because it doesn't
use lasers or a camera Moser one isn't
restricted by light or space use it
anywhere anytime no matter the
circumstance Moser one is waterproof
dustproof and shockproof
your recordings are immediately saved in
the app which is already being sold in
the App Store the app also turns your
phone into a rudimentary Moser device
and already has 70,000 downloads and a
solid 4 star rating from users so how
does it work Moser one uses an advanced
technology called motion measuring
motion measuring is the same technology
used in rocket guidance systems to
accurately track the movement and
locations of Rockets in 3d space using
gyros accelerometers and magnetometers
Moser one plots its three-dimensional
position in any space to measure
distance angle level and much more Moser
is the first motion measure device ever
made for consumer use it puts the same
technology found in rockets in the palm
of your hand so what are you waiting for
back our campaign now and step into the
future of measuring with Moser one
you
measurements are integral to our
everyday lives but they can put us into
risky and tricky situations or require
someone else to help gange those lengthy
distances but here's a change by back by
tech eh indeed
now you can get out of that risky spot
and don't eat a helping hand to
determine long distances
vhat measures and not one but two
directions from one press of a button
you can acquire the left-right and tonal
value at once saving you precious time
and energy on every move and allowing
you to work with greater efficiency by
making you the focal point also your
measurements can be instantly updated to
your smart device with our sketch
application where you can design and
plan for any projects VHA knees
additional functions enable you to use
continuous measuring mode to find the
midpoints
pythagoras function to reach heights
and calculate the area and volume of
instance life made easier
vhat by magpie check we take that extra
step so you don't have two measuring
tapes help us measure distances and the
dimensions of different objects but a
measuring tape doesn't work in every
situation why isn't there a single tool
that lets us measure everything now
there is introducing beigel the smart
tape measure bagel lets you measure just
about anything at home and at work
bagel has three different modes string
mode wheel mode and remote mode string
mode is great for measuring straight
lines curves and around corners wheel
mode lets you measure irregular or odd
shaped objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice
descriptions just take your measurement
push the Save button and then tag a
voice memo to it dog the future ADA when
you're done bangle will send your
measurements to bagels mobile app via
bluetooth this mobile application lets
you review your saved measurements and
share them with your friends bagel is
precise it uses our patented technology
to make sure you always get an accurate
measurement also bagel has an
easy-to-read digital display that's
viewable in most lighting conditions in
the past few years
also some measuring devices have become
smarter and made our lives easier it's
math skills
smart thermometers and even smart
watches but when it comes to measuring
size we still use a Cape measure which
is more than a century old
why don't you innovate the way we
measure size so we created bagel a smart
tape measure we put a lot of effort into
creating bagel our team worked night and
day to make the best quality product
with a spendable design we have our
final prototype that is ready for mass
production now we need your help to
deliver this amazing product to everyone
please help us bring this bagel to life
thank you
science matters
bagel

makes total sense and I want one thus
the digital tape measure was born since
its origin the e tape is proven useful

indirectly making measuring simple and
easy measuring tasks that were once next
to impossible are suddenly made
effortless three days or is sleek
compact and comes with its own
drawstring pouch making it easy and
convenient to have with you wherever you
go use three days or to measure objects
as well as spaces with a click of a
button switch to indirect mode to
measure the distance between two points
after measuring record the measurement
take a photo and add either text notes
or a voice memo it will automatically
store on your iPhone for future
reference and you can easily share the
information with others with three days
or it's no pen no paper no ladder no
problem
and for the professional there are more
features with three days or pro to help
you work more efficiently manage
