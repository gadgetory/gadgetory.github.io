challenge and we are proud to bring Robo
main alive now we want to bring mobile

hollow tour is one of the hololens
launch experiences it's a travel
experience that makes you feel like
you've been transported to a place and
feel like you're really there it's a
crazy goal feel like you're really there
what does that even mean like how could
you ever possibly achieve that we were
able to take video and blend it with
some 3d geometry near the user so you
can get up out of your chair and
experience the world around you as you
go the fact that's untethered you can
actually walk around the room you can
turn around there are no wires to be in
your way and that's not something that
you just can't get on another device my
favorite moment in Rome is when you
travel back in time in the Colosseum and
watch a gladiator fight from the
perspective of the Emperor that's a
really cool way to connect with history
that you can't even get even when you're
there the app developer side of this it
is very approachable a lot of your
design stems from a user's natural
behavior for the users head is the
virtual camera the user turns their head
where they want and that drive the
virtual camera that controls what
they're seeing so finding ways to use
body movements that match in what your
app is doing that's really the challenge
with the sound because we have a very
accurate understanding where the users
head is in space we can localize those
sounds and make them feel like you're
actually in the real world in exactly
the same way that we do with Holograms
the sound source feels like it's coming
from that location I feel like it taps
into these sort of underlying
subconscious behaviors you know you can
sort of start localizing things just by
sounding like oh it sounds like it's
right up there
as long as you focus on building
experiences that bring these Holograms
into your real world it doesn't really
matter precisely what they are about as
long as you're building human-centered
experiences pilot or showing you what
this device can do and I hope that it's
an inspiration for people that want to
build their own app with a mixed reality
device the real key is that ability to
navigate the physical space very
comfortably well at the same time
occupying this immersive virtual space
it still feels like magic
you
so I
yes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
