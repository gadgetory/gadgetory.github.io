watercraft that promises a legendary
ride above the surface
that changes you forever introducing
Robo Ming your personal robot fellow
featuring a cool sleek design innovative
technology and advanced motion sensor
functionality Robo Ming is not just a
robot to play with it's a buddy that is
there when you need them it was our goal
to create not only a robot to play but
also friend something that you will find
useful and in the same time brings a lot
of fun
Robo Ming has a built-in module that can
scan and recognize rooms so you can play
around with different voice commands
telling Robo main where to go
did you it comes with a lot of features
can recognize its masters voice and will
come when you call avoiding obstacles
along the way
the Robo Ming fellow can give you
different emotional responses by its
movements and lights for example agree
or happy it can use its innovative
camera and motion sensor technology to
take photos
always the helpful companion your
roaming fellow can carry small objects
or play with your pets even when you are
not there monitor what is going on in
your house when you are not at home for
better security it can detect movement
you can always get a live view about
what is happening in your house or in
your office row bombing fellow can
communicate wirelessly via Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth a real conversation piece
roaming fellow will be a hit in your
office as this helpful friend will carry
items from desk to desk
if the battery is running low it will
automatically return to its home
charging spot
it took us a lot of efforts in the last
year to develop all our ideas into what
we've got now working on the visual
design and the technical features have
been a big challenge and we are proud to
bring robomen alive now we want to bring
Robo mean fellow out to this work and
meet a lot of new friends so please
support us and a noble fellow well serve
you soon
hallo tor is one of the hololens launch
experiences it's a travel experience
that makes you feel like you've been
transported to a place and feel like
you're really there it's a crazy goal
feel like you're really there what does
that even mean like how could you ever
possibly achieve that we were able to
take video and blend it with some 3d
geometry near the user so you can get up
out of your chair and experience the
world around you as you go the fact
that's untethered you can actually walk
on the room you can turn around there
are no wires to be in your way and
that's just something that you just
can't get on another device my favorite
moment in Rome is when you travel back
in time in the Coliseum and watch a
gladiator fight from the perspective of
the Emperor that's a really cool way to
connect with history that you can't even
get even when you're there the app
developer side of this it is very
approachable a lot of your design stems
from a user's natural behavior when the
users head is the virtual camera the
user turns their head where they want
and that drives the virtual camera that
controls what they're seeing and so
finding ways to use body movements
that match what your app is doing that's
really the challenge with the sound
because we have a very accurate
understanding of where the users head is
in space we can localize those sounds
and make them feel like they're actually
in the real world in exactly the same
way that we do with Holograms the sound
source feels like it's coming from that
location I feel like it taps into these
sort of underlying subconscious
behaviors you know you can sort of start
localizing things just by sound you like
oh it sounds like it's right up there as
long as you focus on building
experiences that bring these Holograms
into your real world it doesn't really
matter
precisely what they're about as long as
you're building human centered
experiences holla tor is showing you
what this device can do and I hope that
it's an inspiration for people that want
to build their own apps with a mixed
reality device the real key is that
ability to navigate the physical space
very comfortably well at the same time
occupying this immersive virtual space
it still feels like magic
so
