our art with the world the pen is one of
the first tools we learn to use as a
child so creating with a pen is second
nature to us current smart pens on the
market are expensive this bothered us
for a very long time so we created the

that works on all iPads sold after 2010
and all for the price of five cups of
coffee the solar pen is a paid agent

electronic parts it's equipped with all
the features of a smart pen without the
need for batteries or bluetooth the
tangle free cable simply plugs into the
earphone jack it creates a solid link
between your sonar pen and ipad let your
creative energy seamlessly flow from
your fingertips to your iPad cables come
in a range of colors for every style
we've made sure that the sonar pen is
one of the most socially responsible
smart pens on the market the only part
you will ever have to replace is a tiny
plastic tip the solar pen is portable
and for our backers each pen comes with
a magnetic holder that attaches to your
iPad so you won't have to hunt for your
solar pen in your bag we have spent two
years developing the technology and we
are very excited to get the solar pen
into mass production by backing this
project your contributions will go to
the initial production costs
