but we know who you are your super mom
whenever your mom sense kicks in
plug into your children's health with a
kinsa smart thermometer connect it
directly to your phone and in about 10
seconds you can measure the temperature
of even the stormiest kid you can easily
monitor symptoms and medications for
each member of your family you can also
see what's going around the neighborhood
simple accurate and fast
the FDA cleared kinsa smart thermometer
will keep track of all the superheroes
in your house even you the pocket tripod
is an entirely new concept it redefines
conventional standards for Portability
and functionality it's the world's first
iPhone stand that can transform from the
shape of a credit card to that of a
fully articulating stand which is able
to just iPhone continuously to any angle
in both portrait and landscape
the iPhone unlike any other smartphone
has a constant cross section all
throughout its edge on both sides that
means that you could place your iPhone
inside the cutout of the pocket tripod
and any direction both on landscape and
in portrait which in combination with a
90 degree sweep of the pocket tripod
gives the user a full 360 degrees of
angle adjustments
adjusting the angle of your iPhone with
a pocket tripod is just as you'd
naturally expect it to be like on a
full-size photography tripod all you
need to do is to swivel your iPhone to
the intended tilt angle and it stays in
that position having full control and
how your iPhone is oriented gives you
access to a whole new set of options
you'll find yourself using familiar
functionalities of your iPhone and
completely new and creative ways and the
quality and precision of the results
you'd get will amaze you the pocket
tripod being as thin as only a couple of
credit cards stacked on top will always
be there when you need it and you'll be
surprised by how often you'd end up
using it in everyday unexpected
situations making those tasks so much
more convenient to do using a stand that
gives you full control on the angle of
your iPhone means that it can adjust
your frame to get that perfect shot
every time instead of being limited by a
preset angle one of the best things
about the pocket tripod is that unlike
almost any other portable stand it
actually lifts rifle off to services
place on keeping it safe from accidents
the pocket tripod is an assembly of six
parts and each of these parts have
dozens of complex love features that
allow the pocket tripod to transform
from one shape to another we developed a
really cool app available for free and
lapse so for anyway two inches to the
downloaded that has an interactive 3d
model of a pocket tripod in it to give
you a virtual hands-on experience with a
pocket tripod it even has a section
where you can pick colors for the pocket
tripod that you think might look good
and suggested to us for future
productions
hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hideaway the bottle you'll always
reach for because it's always within
reach so as a freelance product designer
I'm traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I could solve myself you know
once I had a solution for business
travel I realized this had great
application my personal life especially
in the outdoors going backpacking or
just on hikes I could bring water with
me and when the bottle was empty it it
collapses and goes away and takes no
extra space in my pack yeah it fits an
active lifestyle weather in the winter
when you're skiing and you can fill up
the hideaway in the lodge or in the
summer when you're backpacking or hiking
it collapses in your backpack and takes
no extra space no one loves buying
disposable water bottles it's it's
merely out of convenience and the
Hideaway makes a reusable bottle more
convenient in fact in some places
disposable water bottles are being
banned so we're all gonna move towards
the reusable water bottle model and
that's why I feel like this is kind of
the next generation and hydration this
gives you an option to have a water
bottle all the time without having to
throw anything away the hideaway bottle
comes in two sizes 21 ounce and 12 ounce
which is great for kids and both are
watertight I'm really excited to share
the Hideaway bottle with with the world
and Kickstarter is an amazing
opportunity to do that to be able to
show you the backers what this is all
about so please check out the rewards we
need to raise a significant amount of
money to get this into production to get
it on the shelves this year
and just as important please share it
with everyone you know tell them about
this great water bottle The Hideaway
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
