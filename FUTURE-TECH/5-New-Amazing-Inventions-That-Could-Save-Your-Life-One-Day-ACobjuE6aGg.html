Biotechnology information the highest
rate of preventable deaths on the
battlefield between 2001 and 2009 for
caused by uncontrollable hemorrhaging in
the field if a soldier has an open wound
medics use a painful and not always
effective method of stuffing God's into
the wound to try to stop the bleeding
red men an oregon-based group of
military veterans engineers and
scientists has now developed an
alternative treatment for open wounds in
the field called exFAT the design of the
axe stat was initially inspired by the
form fix-a-flat system for punching car
tires and the finish system is
reportedly capable of sealing an open
gunshot wound in 15 seconds the syringe
is small and lightweight making it
perfect for use by medics and field
using a modified syringe with small
medical spongy's inside the wound is
filled and a sponges expand to stop the
bleeding first in kind medical device
designed to stop bleeding from small
narrow entrance wounds like a gunshot
wound you quickly you take the device
you literally plunge it into the wound
or the bullet hole and you shoot the
sponges into the wound as soon as they
come into contact with blood they
rapidly expand and fill up the wound the
compressor to get the bleeding to stop
with the current standard on a
battlefield taking three five minutes
kake'land soldiers lose a tremendous
amount of blood one of the real
innovations behind the expat is that
it's self compressing meaning that
expands from within the wound
what you normally have to do to get the
bleeding to stop with the traditional
dressing is applied compression from
outside the wound and hope that that
force or that compression gets to the
site of bleeding
what exFAT does is it expands in the
wound and compresses outward so make
sure it gets all the potential sites of
bleeding in the wound and it works
within seconds and because it's
compressing the wound the medic doesn't
have to essentially the treatment done
at that point all my friends are still
on active duty they're still deploying
the combat what drives me is to continue
to make new products to help them on the
battlefield that from my own personal
experience I think are better products
and it will stabilize unavailable
