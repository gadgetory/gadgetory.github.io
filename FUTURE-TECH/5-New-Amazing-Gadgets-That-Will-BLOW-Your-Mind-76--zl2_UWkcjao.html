we're proud to share with you today a
product we've been developing it's glow
the first smart headphones that glow
with laser light music inherently is a
very expressive medium and having light
synchronize with music makes that whole
experience much better and I think
that's where glue really stands out it's
a pair of headphones but it's also
something that builds up that musical
expression through the form of light the
first time we saw fiber and fiber
optical wire was really incredible that
vibrance is just super vibrant it looks
like something I've never seen before
like something magical the inspiration
actually went back to our childhood when
the movies we used to watch and the
books we used to read it was portrayed
light and lasers and sort of the future
the first time we were actually able to
see laser wire in the form of fibrous
wire and we got the idea that maybe we
can use this to actually create a
product with it and that's where we
thought the idea of about the headphone
is that's that sort of a natural
connection of a glowing wire with a pair
of headphones you have the wire glow to
the music with glow we've actually
provided five buttons to be able to
control your music prior headphone
designs don't give you that flexibility
they're a lot more complicated because
they only have a single button glow has
a tight integration with the Android
platform so we're able to use and
leverage that platform to do very cool
things for example I can take a picture
by hitting the center button or I could
even trigger Google now and use voice
actions to control my phone it wasn't
enough that we built an expressive
parrot headphones we wanted the audio
quality to be absolutely amazing
we've come up with a lot of unique
designs such as the negative profile
which allows you to even take a nap with
your headphones we also chose a in-ear
design because it's minimizes the
external interference of the sound which
allows the music to be a lot more crisp
and have deeper bass over the last few
months we've been building a fully
working prototype and we're there but
now we need your help to take glow from
a prototype to final manufacturing to be
able to bring this to market it's not
enough that we have a fully working
prototype we need the backing of the
community we need the Kickstarter
community thank you for taking the time
out to watch this video we're super
excited about this technology these
headphones and we hope you're as excited
as we are
you
hi I'm David and I'm Thomas we're two
product designers from the north of
England and the creators of Nina
sketching and visualizing is critical to
our everyday lives which is why we find
the iPad pro with Apple pencil to be
such amazing products using the Apple
pencil on the go is where we encountered
our first problem in the beginning we
made do with carrying the pencil and its
accessories loose in a backpack what was
missing was one secure place for
everything
the second issue we faced was the
sketching position owning the smart
Keyboard means you can have the tablet
flat at your desk or almost completely
upright what was needed was that truly
comfortable low angle we knew that both
of these problems could be solved with
one simple product say hello to Nina an
iPad pro and Apple pencil companion
through months of design prototyping and
testing we've arrived at what we feel is
a complete solution Nina
acts as a protective case for the Apple
pencil holding the lightning adapter and
up to four spare nibs using the pencil
itself the nibs are removed with ease
when the lid slides back have Dena
transformed into a stun for the iPad pro
holding the tablet at a comfortable 10
degree angle and creating your artwork
and contact Nina is made from only four
components the hard shells are made from
an engineering polymer ensuring a
high-quality scratch resistant case the
top and base are made from a soft touch
polymer gripping the iPod to the care so
it's anchored to the desk this creates a
secure worker platform all of this Amina
is still only 22 millimeters high her
compact size fits easily into any bug
that is perfect for on-the-go Nina has
been brought to life using our skills as
product designers but now we need your
help to make her a reality your pledges
will pay for to learn from the first
production run to bring Nina to market
