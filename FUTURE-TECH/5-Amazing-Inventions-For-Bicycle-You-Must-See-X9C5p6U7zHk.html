hello again Kickstarter we're back this
time presenting a lumen it's our latest
innovation for urban cycling and we want
to ask you for your help and bringing
this idea to light up until this point
if you wanted to reflect a bicycle you
had these options stickers and tape
these are just 2d solutions for a 3d
problem you see reflective material was
designed with flat surfaces in mind
things like stop signs and pavement but
illuminated complex 3d structure like a
bicycle frame well this presents a
technical problem not anymore
we've developed a retro-reflective bike
that for the first time ever will be
available to urban commuters everywhere
no more stickers in no more tape
retroreflection fully integrated the
lumen has been specifically designed for
daily and nightly riding the framing
rims are coated and specially developed
powder coat that makes the bike shine
under light this durable finish has a
deep gray Sheen by day almost iridescent
and at night under headlights the bike
glows white the lumen is first and
foremost a mission bicycle each one will
be handmade in San Francisco to exacting
standards the lumens posture and
components have been carefully curated
for comfort efficiency and reliability
our focus has always been on the urban
rider and we put all our experience into
the lumens design because there are
massive manufacturing minimums we need
your help to bring this smart and safe
innovation commuters around the world
we've been on Kickstarter twice before
with great success each time our last
two projects exceeded our fundraising
goals we met a host of friends connected
with bicycle commuters all over the
world and lured all of our awards on
time together we can do it again help us
light up the street by helping us with a
lumen bike project
