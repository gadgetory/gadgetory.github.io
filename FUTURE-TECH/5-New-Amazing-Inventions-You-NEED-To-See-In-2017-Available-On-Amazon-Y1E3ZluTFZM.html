I think we can all agree that we're
living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to auto ride home
control the temperature turn on the
lights Haven
face it we're living in a technological
Wonderland and yet here we find Phil
Phil's forgotten the combination of his
travel log is the current solution to
that problem we live in an era filled
with technological marvels and yet this
is what happens when Phil forgets a lock
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air baltics is the air bolts is a travel
lock you control it with your smartphone
it's a lot the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
airball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth range well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your lives
that's fine the settings on this airball
require me to enter a password into the
app well maybe you're a bolts been
stolen that's fine too because you can
set your air bolt to activate an alarm
when it moves too far away from your
phone or you can activate the alarm
manually stop that man it's the Justice
the future deserves hi Bill I tell them
what happened bill I lost my back you
lost your we live in a world where I can
use my smartphone to one of my sleeping
patterns but bill here can't find his
bag if bill have been using the air bolt
instead of some antique you could have
located it using the air box
crowd-sourced GPS networks or if you
lose your phone
well you can still unlock your airboat
by logging in for another device well
you can enter a backup button code using
your hands like some kind of prehistoric
man the air vault has a rechargeable
battery which only needs to be charged
once a year by a standard microUSB
connector it's TSA approved so airport
security is not an issue the app will
record a history of every time you've
locked and unlocked your airport you can
even share access to your event with
your friends so you'll be able to unlock
it from the other side of the world
thanks pal
you're welcome buddy and look how small
it is seriously look at it it's really
small a volt it's the travel lock we all
deserve a kick starter over the last
year we've worked really hard on
building the air box and we got to say
that we're truly proud of how far we've
come but now we need your help to fund
the last stages of production tooling
raw materials and manufacturing honestly
we've all been there we've all forgotten
the combination to a look the most
frustrating thing ever and losing your
baggage even worse and that's why we
designed the air boat we believe in
innovation like this is long overdue and
it's time we bring luggage lock
technology into the 21st century the air
boat has so many possibilities we're
even including it with a software
development kit so that you can make
your own features for example imagine
unlocking the air vault with your voice
or gamifying it and using it at a
scavenger hunt
we hope you agree and get onboard our
Kickstarter campaign and as a reward for
backing us early we're offering some
awesome deals on the able thanks from
all of us here at airboat
helva states always had potential to be
a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six or even ten feet high on but also
take any where you want to go the v4 is
the portable trampoline we'd always
dreamed up with the v4 you have the
ability to add or remove air and
completely change the stiffness of the
bounce someone who weighs 300 pounds can
jump on the same exact v4 as someone who
only weighs 80 pounds all you need to do
is change the air pressure in less than
a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family a fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the v4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
down stairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again obstacles and
features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards are perfect for the v4 so
those of you looking for a fun way to
stay in shape the v4 will work most of
the muscle groups in your body and get
your heart pounding immediately it's a
killer cardio workout and the best part
is that while you're having fun bouncing
around you won't even realize how
quickly you build a sweat in order to
achieve superior build quality and
maintain the high tolerances necessary
for the v4 to work we manufacture and
assemble it right here in our Southern
California shop we work closely with our
suppliers to become a part of the build
process and as each component is made or
right there to test them
this streamlines are manufacturing and
ensures that every v4 we make is up to
our standards if you're looking for the
portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it
join us and help change the way pogo
sticks are seen forever
well nowadays people take thousands of
pictures with their cell phones but they
never look at them so we decided to
create an object that will be that will
make them able to share pictures with
their friends and family and a tangible
way print is the first smartphone case
that prints out pictures instantly you
just have to show your smartphone it's
not a picture and to print instantly we
worked during a year on about 15
different prototypes to come up with one
product that's really easy to use for
example it doesn't use Bluetooth
technology or Wi-Fi you can take a
picture but you can also use pictures
from Facebook Instagram any picture that
is already on your smart
my biggest design challenge was to
create an object that will work with
different type of smartphones who are
compatible with the iPhone 5 the iPhone
6 and also the galaxy s4 and galaxy s5
and we are trying to bring it to more
smartphones we don't need any ink
cartridge all the ink is already in the
paper you just have to hit it and the
picture will appear like black magic
like I said what we really love about
instant cameras is the whole experience
so we try to capture it by recording of
short videos five six seconds just
before you take a pictures this video
will play automatically on the paper
through augmented reality when you scan
it with our app
we wanted to go further than just
printing pictures we wanted to bring
memories that you could hold in your
hands and that you could give away
whenever you wanted print is for
everybody because everybody likes a
printed picture that you can hold in
your hand you know it's it's like a
memory that you can give away so we are
on Kickstarter because we need your
support to go to production and also we
need your feedback so that we can
improve our product
