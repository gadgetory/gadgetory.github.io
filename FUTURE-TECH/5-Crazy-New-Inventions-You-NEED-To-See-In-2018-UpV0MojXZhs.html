finally a gaming mouse that puts full
control in the palm of your hand
LexA is a mouse specifically designed
for gamers of all levels so whether you
play in professional gaming tournaments
or you're just a weekend gamer lexif is
designed to be a versatile Mouse for
gamers everywhere Oh awesome the mouse
is super smooth and this is something a
lot of companies can't get Alexa Mouse
easily allows you to perform complex
tasks at multiple dimensions with
increased precision usually you'd have
to stop in order to switch through your
items in your inventory but when you're
using the joystick you can just simply
just scroll through your items so it
does genuinely give you an advantage
when you're playing your game like
Minecraft lexif provides six degrees of
freedom via two joysticks and one laser
glide sensor it works by tilting forward
backward and side-to-side the mouse
moves with your hand and it goes with it
that's a very big plus
this mouse but actually a competitive
advantage in gameplay the laser sensor
lets the user control the mechanical
gliding at very high speeds while
maintaining the best accuracy the
tilting allows you to have more
three-dimensional movement all within
the mouse itself so you can combine
multiple movements into your Mouse
seamlessly it has a joystick on the side
so if I'm playing and I want to zoom in
to shoot someone it automatically goes
into the zoom mode I don't have to like
double click on the mouse I'm kind of
shot are they gonna give you I doubt
that lexif shape is designed in a way
that buttons are very accessible while
still providing a solid feeling the
sides are covered in the finest rubber
enabling a strong grip when needed it's
comfortable it's smooth I wasn't ready
for it the lexif gaming mouse also
provides a separate model specifically
designed for left-handed gamers what
truly sets the Lexx it mouse apart from
its competitors is its conveniently
positioned joystick on the side of the
mouse along with its internal mechanical
two axis joystick which allows users to
operate the mouse to tilt or to use as a
joystick offering two options in one
this mini joystick features mechanical
feedback forces that only regular-sized
joysticks used to offer making this the
first of its kind the joystick allows me
to go through the entire mouth which is
actually really cool it's great it's
gonna make a massive difference in big
games you can use the joystick or
smaller here lexis control panel allows
you to customize and configure the
settings specific to what you're
comfortable with providing you with
various shortcuts and once you configure
the settings you won't need to configure
them again our goal is to bring the lexa
mouse to gamers everywhere but we need
your help please support our campaign so
that you too can take advantage of the
innovative features our gaming mouse
will offer you elevate your gameplay
with LexA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
