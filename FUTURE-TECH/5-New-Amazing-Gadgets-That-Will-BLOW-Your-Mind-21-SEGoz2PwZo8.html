funny well Otto
ha ha buddy movie yeah oh wow

ah
Oh
no matter who your family is we all want
to keep the people we love safe and
that's when we made salt the first safe
gun for a safe home hi I'm Adam this is
Andy we're the creators of salt salt is
a gun but it's not like any gun that
you've ever seen it was designed around
the belief that a firearm shouldn't have
to take a life in order to protect a
life from that simple idea
we started by completely rethinking the
bullet instead of LED salt was designed
to shoot a specialized round filled with
powerful toxin - instead of killing the
target salt opens up on impact in a
cloud that instantly causes respiratory
and visual distress so while an intruder
or a curious child with being
capacitated encounter wouldn't be fatal
this rethink also lets salt be used not
only offensively but defensively as well
so if an intruder is kicking down your
door salt allows you to shoot the area
around it before the danger is on top of
you this creates a protective cloud of
toxin between you and the intruder
before he's ever a threat to you or your
family our last big idea was make salt
easy to use for everyone so we replace
the violent bang of black powder with a
silent power of compressed air the
result is a fear free user experience so
the only person that should have
anything to be scared of is an intruder
and that's all a safe gun for a safe
home so now all we need is you the
testing the Rd the prototyping is all
done and we're ready to begin production
but salt can't be made without you
without all of us really wanting a
better way to keep the people we love
safe so if you're is intrigued by the
ideas as we are we'd love to make you

together we can make the world just a
little bit safer
