monkey here today to tell you about my
latest creation wild card the pocket
knife needs to a halt it's an essential
tool but it's bulky it's one more thing
to remember in the morning and it easily
falls out of your pocket and is lost I
wanted something better
I asked why not put a pocket knife in my
wallet it'd be easier to carry and
harder to lose so I set out to design a
knife that be as thin as possible and
the result is wild card it's only two
millimeters thick
only slightly thicker than a credit card
I was able to do this by reimagining the
blade pivot most knives have a pin
pressed through a hole wildcard has a
pivot unlike anything in the world I
call it fly off technology the three
wings of the pivot allow the knife blade
to remain rigid to the body a necessity
when wielding a sharp tool for safety I
designed the blade to lock open and to
lock closed the blade tucks neatly under
two blade bars and it angles only on one
side so users can't accidentally cut
themselves when carrying a closed knife
and here's the best part about this
design the blade is detachable I
designed this with the forgetful
traveler in mind when you go through TSA
with your traditional knife on you you
lose your knife but with wild card you
only lose your blade and on our website
you can replace it for only a few
dollars with pocket monkey I used a
monkey to represent the personality of
the tool with wild card I kept that
trend going wild card as a wolf cut out
that doubles as a bottle of where the
wolf embodies the nature of the tool
agile yes
I wanted to pack as much functionality
as possible into wildcard
many people misuse knives in place of
other tools like screwdrivers and pry
bars harming themselves of breaking the
nine so I added these tools to the night
I always wanted to challenge convention
because of that I spent the last six
months trying to reinvent how this
product is manufactured every
manufacturer I talked with was hesitant
to produce such an aggressive design the
solution I kept hearing was take this to
China but that isn't something that I'm
willing to do I want to create products
that embody the American spirit of
innovation and my solution was to create
a manufacturing facility in Maine now we
control every aspect of production from
laser cutting to packaging and shipping
so we can manufacture the
highest-quality product while creating
jobs in our community help us make wild
card a reality and help us continue the
American spirit of innovation
is that a tool box no it's the cool box
this can charge your phone yeah it's got
a built-in rechargeable battery nice
yeah it has wireless booties speakers on
the front just like that pass-through
power cool way to get started all right
let's go
these heels do make it easier to move
around and then what's next step number
six coming up gotta love this tablet
stand
finished all done cracking a coma
it's getting pretty dark I did go next
door light yeah guy LED lights on this
now that's cool
want to put these on the magnetic lid
for me dirty lifting handles too okay
honey I approve yep pretty much does
everything introducing the cool box the
world's most advanced tool box hi I'm
Mike and I'm Chris the history of the
modern tool box is over a hundred years
old
but today there have been very few truly
remarkable enhancements or improvements
made to this commonly used carrying case
that's what motivated us to develop the
cool box we've assembled the team of
some of the best product designers
engineers and business development
people in the industry the cool box
product combines many commonly used
tools and workshop items with some of
the most recent and popular
technological enhancements all for the
purpose of making projects easier and
more enjoyable we've created our first
two prototypes and are extremely
satisfied with how they turned out our
warehouse fulfillment center and
manufacturing facility are all set up
the cool box is ready to go now we need
your help indiegogo with your support we
can revolutionize the way you work on
any job thank you
hi I'm Johnny and this is North we've
taken a lot of time perfecting our
little knives we find them so handy not
just use them in a studio but also in
our day to day lives too we hope you
like using them as much as we do
so please back or share our product and
we look forward to seeing how you use
yours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
