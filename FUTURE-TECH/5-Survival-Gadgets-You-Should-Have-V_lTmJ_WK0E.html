son Nathan I've been a engineer and
designer and inventor for about 14 years
now and I've designed a lot of knives
and multi tools that you might be
familiar with I came up with the idea
for the clacks last year over the last
six months I've been designing
developing prototyping and testing out
the clacks
to end up with the floor versions that
we have here today the clacks is more
than an axe the clacks is a multi-tool
built into the head of an axe it has a
lot of useful features built-in
carabiner jimping for your thumb to hold
on to bottle opener gut hook axe blade
which doubles as an Euler knife a knife
blade lanyard hole hammer with a
built-in ruler five wrenches and a hex
bit driver
the clocks has a lot of useful features
like wrenches hammer head and knife
blade along with our innovative new
clamping system that allows you to take
the axe to the field and be able to
break it down for easy transport
the clacks is useful for people who are
involved in hiking climbing camping
survival experts people who do bushcraft
all sorts of things including emergency
preparedness I'm Mike peel for Mike Pihl
logging Vernonia Oregon and I'm a logger
the clacks
it's a great tool this morning I use it
to wedge over a Douglas fir tree and it
did a good job the world is getting
smaller and more of us are traveling to
distant and remote places when we travel
one of our biggest challenges is how to
guarantee that the water we are drinking
is safe
there are currently dozens of personal
water filters and filter bottles on the
market that claim to solve this issue
the problem is that water filters only
trap bacteria insists that then remain
in the filter and continue to live and
multiply this can add up to a major
health concern in addition water filters
do not eliminate or even trap water
borne viruses that are really the
biggest concern of all to be truly
protected from bacteria and viruses
water must be purified not just filtered
meat cure to go the most advanced unique
and multifunctional true water purifier
in the world true to go kills bacteria
and viruses instantly on contact and on
demand while also completely eliminating
waterborne cysts such as crypto and
Giardia there is absolutely no waiting
time or preparation required as
contaminated water passes through period
ago is purified instantly without the
holding timer procedures other true
water purifiers required
here to go can be used by one person or
multiple users with cleanable and
replaceable insert cartridges it can be
used over and over again for many years
and more importantly it can be stored
for long periods without the same danger
posed by filters how do we come up with
this design things weren't really bad in
the world and you can only have one
knife for the rest of your life which
knife would you choose the founder of
ultimate survival tips I could ask that
question all the time over the years
I've tested and reviewed hundreds of
knives but I never found that one night
I could do everything I wanted so on
early 2014 I started sketching
integrating elements from blades I love
along with features that have never been
seen before in one knife like a micro
survival kit in the handle a two-in-one
switchable nylon and Kydex sheath that's
packed with features and a rugged knife
built for tough jobs with the finesse of
a fine carving tool it's called the MS
k1 multi scenario knife to build a knife
like this I knew I needed help because I
came DUP with knife legend Jeff Freeman
the award-winning designer of many
iconic gerber knives like the oh six
Auto the LMF - survival knife the best
survival kit is the one you wouldn't
think of entering to the untamed world
without its small compact easy to use
and multifunctional it can be taken
anywhere knowing what this ultra
portable tool kit provides creates peace
of mind
remember the MS 5 is the easiest
survival toolkit to carry and one you'll
never want to leave behind
the motion raid ms5 lets you blend in
with nature and take advantage of all
its beauty it comes with a world class
water purifier explore the entire jungle
without losing your sense of direction
with the rugged military-style compass
that efficiently puts you right on track
survival requires the right set of tools
and skills
with its easy-fit blades magnesium fire
starter boring grill and flashlight the
ms5 has you covered
precision and perfection are easily
blended using premium materials we have
forged life-saving tools creating a
strong yet stylish product we go above
and beyond the contemporary to integrate
more usefulness in every product the ms5
as what you need to survive a USB
charger SOS GPS tracker a micro burner
fishing tackle plus many more essentials
support our Kickstarter today and share
with us any feedback or thoughts you
think will improve the ms5 and don't
forget to share it with your friends and
family
