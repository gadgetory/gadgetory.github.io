I mean this was like climbing today you
can see the trail for sure it's almost
like you've got daylight around you you
obviously can see better but other
people can see you they they're awesome
you can see everything you can go off
and you are you want they light up the
ground in front of you without bothering
the horse it gives you more detail to
move you can see texture with this light
hi I'm Rob co-founder of symphony over
the past 30 years I've brought hundreds
of tech products to market I live in one
of the coolest places on the planet and
spent a lot of time outdoors and I don't
know it's like to go in just because the
Sun Goes Down there are thousands of
flashlights and headlamps out there but
none of them did what I wanted I decided
to create an entirely new category of
outdoor light so we designed the world's
first strap light the synteny raw
we identified three things the light
needed first it had to be super bright
these lights you just see it all they're
awesome they're really bright you're lit
up so you're less likely to get attacked
you can do it right anywhere at night
second it had to light at the area
around you and that is the spot you know
it was great to have these lights so I
could really assess the entire area that
I was looking at and not just small
spots
I like how I can move my head and the
light still stays with these they branch
out they cover so much area that you can
see everything around you she went
through the park on her own and night
people won't be able to miss her and
third it needed to be hands-free it's
easy to mount right to a backpack with
simple hook and loop ties
you can use the d-ring strap to fasten
Ron in a wide variety of applications
father at all
we build in 10 rare earth magnets to
allow quick attachment to any first
object the matching magnetic factor
makes it easy to securely fasten onto
your clothing
we've completed the prototypes we filed
the patents and now we need your help
please support it some back us on
Kickstarter because we are bringing some
really cool products to market
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
