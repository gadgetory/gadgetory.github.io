Overland Park Kansas
my son Britain is six years old and has
autism so I'm Eileen I'm Charlie's mom
Charlie's a little boy with three years
old he's severely autistic what's great
about lekha is that my son immediately
connected with this robot this this ball
that was running around and coming back
to him and responding to his call when I
saw Charlie playing hide-and-seek with
it I mean that's something that a
neurotypical kid we just kind of do
anyway but Charlie doesn't usually do
that I've noticed my son had a very
rough day at school today he had some
some really challenging times but came
home and took 30 minutes to spend with
Lake and is a much more calm and relaxed
child I didn't get shown hey there's
your proof it's a pretty remarkable
product and to have it in the home would
be outstanding
I haven't Addison s I know and together
we want to help exceptional children
live exceptional nights that's why we
created this little guy look at meet
lekha the first robotic interactive
smart toy designed specifically for
children with special needs children
with autism live in a world where they
are constantly overwhelmed with sensory
stimulation it is often hard for them to
connect to other people or focus on a
single activity for a long time
that's why parents and therapists often
use reinforcers to teach the children
for summit will be music for others
colors and lights or just vibrations
using these reinforces to teach rules
and guidelines to the children is
paramount as it helps them understand
and interact with the world around them
Leckie's unique strengths is in
combining both the activity and the
reinforcer within one toy like I can
play music move around change colors and
even has a screen to display images
icons or emoticons this makes the child
more motivated and engaged because their
attention is focused on the toy and the
task at hand not just the reinforcer
lekha has been tested with more than a
hundred children in France and in the
u.s. it's been trialed at home with
parents with therapists and specialized
centers and hospitals and the results
are quite simply amazing this could be a
great great tool for therapists to
connect with these kids keep them
engaged which is the second very
difficult thing to do and use it to
connect and teach them we really think
that we have something that will truly
make an impact on the whole community
working with exceptional children and
that's the data that they get collects
and passes back to our monitoring
platform identifying what's the next
step in therapy or what is something
that maybe the child is mastered it
would be remarkable to be able to share
that data and also be able to share that
with educators now we're actually
getting into the field of technology and
how it can work with individuals with
autism how it can empower therapists to
work with those individuals and
ultimately I believe will help us from a
research perspective
nikka is not just a toy it's truly an
education that ADA and we are working
hard to bring you the best application
like a will of numerous apps and
activities available on the App Store
right from the start and new apps will
be developed and released continuously
it's important to us that each child
makes the most out of his amazing toy
but it's really more than just a toy
it's a companion an interactive robot
and a wonderful educational tool
it's lekha from the beginning of the
project we go into schools special
education schools and I was seeing kids
playing with the robot
we know it and I wanted to go further
and make the project well I haven't seen
it anywhere else besides you guys with
lega there are some of course apps or
games but nothing that is an emotion
censored or nothing that is really
interactive with the child and that
respect I think that like is really
coming upon something new and
inspirational for children we really
believe that we have to get this
technology into the children's hands as
quickly as possible and that's why we
are here to ask you to give us a hand
you can help us by spreading the word
and if you are interacting with
exceptional children all the people
around you are you can order later now
they came Swedish means to play into
Hill and that's exactly what we are
going to do with love from the lake a
team
you
have unified management of much of our
lives from email to calendar
notifications and tasks reminders
now mail beacon allows you to manage
your physical mailbox with your
smartphone to
male beacon is the first device that
notifies you about letters and parcels
you'll receive notifications via the
mobile app when items are added to your
box and lets you know when you don't
need to check the mail because it's
empty or there's only junk mail in it
an anti-theft feature secures your mail
in the mailbox
precise optical sensors in the mailbox
measure mailbox content in recognized
sender and content type regardless of
the postbox type
and a smart network enables
notifications even if you are out of
range
thanks for supporting male became the
most wanted beacon ever
I'm Derek I'm passionate about Jones and
I've meant managable wanna fly Jones but
found them really hard to control I want
to help because I feel that they are
missing out to the fun of arrow filming
that's why we came out with the idea of
ghost this is a traditional remote
controller it has many switches and
knobs which can be very hard to master
one bad news and a mistake can be very
expensive
most of the joints also require
assembling but not everyone has a time
or skills to do that Ghost comes
preassembled and is ready to fly right
out of the box our app makes it super
easy to pilot simply tap unlock then
take off and ghost will rise and hover
now tap a spot on the map and ghost will
fly there immediately to get it back
just hit return and ghost will take the
shortest route back to its takeoff point
press land and ghost will descend and
land gently for advanced control tap
hover to make ghost hold the current
spot and enter the micro control mode
here you can adjust ghosts direction
speed camera angles and more not only is
ghosts user-friendly it's designed with
quality parts and as great features and
performance what's really cool about the
ghost though is its customizability with
respect to both hardware and software
one project that I'm working on is
mounting this RP lidar unit from Robo
peak on the ghost row giving it the
ability to sense its surroundings
with the data from the lidar the ghost
will be able to detect obstacles like
trees and buildings and adjust its
flight path is necessary I'm also really
looking forward to developing the ghost
SDK which includes libraries for both
Java and c-sharp I also see some awesome
integration possibilities with input
devices like leap motion
Myo and my own device attacked one of my
passions is to travel and taking photos
of the world around me I always have
wanted to own an affordable drone that
thing give me great images and videos
from the sky the ghost with gimbal in
combination with my GoPro works really
well I have created amazing photos and
videos that could not have made before
as an amateur photographer and that's
really great what's great about the
ghost is that super easy to fly I'm
excited to be one of the first users of
the ghost what I like about ghost it's
so easy to fly the control is really
simple and I can do it all on my phone
I don't have to worry anymore about the
control and I can just focus on what I
see the ghost team members come from
both the US and China and have a very
diverse background in how we're in
soccer we want to make Jones accessible
to everyone and help people create
amazing aerial videos we have finalized
the design and now we need your support
to take those to mass production and
bring the cost down tab now and let's
make ghost the world's easiest to fly
arrow filming drum available to everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
