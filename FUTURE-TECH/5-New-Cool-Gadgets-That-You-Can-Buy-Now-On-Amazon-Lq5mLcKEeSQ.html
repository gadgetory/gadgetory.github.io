living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to auto ride home
control the temperature turn on the
lights - face it we're living in a
technological Wonderland and yet here we
find Phil Phil's forgotten the
combination of his travel log is the
current solution to that problem
we live in an era filled with
technological marvels and yet this is
what happens when Phil forgets a lock
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air baltics is the air bolts is a travel
lock you control it with your smartphone
it's a lot the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
airball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth range well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your lives that's
fine the settings on this airball
require me to enter a password into the
app well maybe you're in vaults been
stolen that's fine too
because you can sit you're able to
activate an alarm when it moves too far
away from your phone or you can activate
the alarm manually stop that man it's
the Justice the future deserves hi Bill
I tell them what happened bill I lost my
back you lost your we live in a world
where I can use my smart phone to one of
my sleeping patterns but bill here can't
find his bag if bill had been using the
air bolt instead of some antique you
could have located it using the air box
crowd-sourced GPS networks what if you
lose your phone well you can still
unlock your air ball by logging in from
another device well you can enter a
backup button code using your hand like
some kind of prehistoric man
the air vault has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year by a standard microUSB connector
it's TSA approved so airport security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your airport you can even share
access to your vault with your friends
so you'll be able to unlock it from the
other side of the world thanks pal
you're welcome buddy
and look how small it is seriously look
at it it's really small a volt
it's the travel lock we all deserve a
kick starter over the last year we've
worked really hard on building the air
box and we got to say that we're truly
proud of how far we've come but now we
need your help to fund the last stages
of production cooling raw materials and
manufacturing honestly we've all been
there we've all forgotten the
combination to a look the most
frustrating thing ever and losing your
baggage even where and that's why we
designed the air boat we believe in
innovation like this is long overdue and
it's time we bring luggage lock
technology into the 21st century the air
boat has so many possibilities we're
even including it with a software
development kit so that you can make
your own features for example imagine
unlocking the airport with your voice or
gamifying it and using it at a scavenger
hunt
we hope you agree and get onboard our
Kickstarter campaign and as a reward for
backing us early we're offering some
awesome deals on the able thanks from
all of us here at air

home automation is awesome but current
smart home products are been very
expensive and difficult to set up that's
why we created hook is a platform that
connects any radiofrequency enabled
device in your home to the Internet with
these $5 RF outlets you can already add
remote control to any device in your
home but they only work within range of
the remote and with basic functionality
connecting a new device is incredibly
simple just sync your devices remote
with the hook app now I can control that
device from anywhere in the world
hook is compatible with IFTTT which can
be used to schedule operations of
routine tasks like turning on your
holiday lights at sunset
or turning your entire room into an
alarm clock folks capabilities are
limited only by your imagination you can
create rules that flash your lights when
your bus is nearby notify you if it
appliances five
or turn off your router if your daughter
is watching too much Netflix
wait wait wait come back
luck is powered by spark IO and will be
provided with an open API so anyone can
develop for hook and help expand its
capabilities and the best part
you only need one hook for your entire
home regardless of how many devices you
are connecting so we've been working for
over a year now trying to develop this
technology and then get it into a
packaged device that the users gonna
like and that we like ourselves so we
started off with a big board big set of
electronics we added Wi-Fi compatibility
we added a USB hub so we could power it
through USB and then we started adding
things like radio chips that we had to
make sure didn't interfere with each
other and then the trick is trying to
get that thing smaller get it more
compact and get it into the right
packaging so we made multiple 3d printed
designs each time we print something fit
the electronics into it put it on a
board look at it and figure out no wait
we can pop these chips off with you
moving this way we can read a bit we can
solder it's smaller we can get this
thing more compact and then the end we
we really came down to a product but it
feels nice
looks good
and prototype that we're really proud to
ship hey Kickstarter where the team
behind hook we have been looking fairly
hot for a little year to make hook and
reality we've got a great product and
we're very excited to bring it to market
but we need your help with your funding
we can get our molds in our
manufacturing process dialed in and get
hook to production so if they're as
excited as via back us share us and tell
your friends about hook so join us in
our journey to bring affordable home
automation to everyone
let's be honest upgrading your home is
hard home automation should be easy but
today's products are difficult to
install and use that's why we created
switch mate switch mate turns your
current light switch into a smart switch
simply install it with a snap and
control it from your phone for a tap
simple right switch mate attaches with
magnets which means no rewiring or
modifying your switches perfect if
you're renting or on the move
with switch mate you can set timers for
your lights to come on when you're away
from home it's simple to control any
device powered by a light switch for the
additional ability to control your
lights from anywhere an optional hub can
be added and finally the comfort of
knowing that you never have to come home
to a dark house again so let's make our
home smarter one switch at a time
starting with yours
we've worked hard over the past year to
make switch made a reality but smart
lighting is just the beginning we want
to create a suite of products they're
extremely simple to use and our users
can take right out of the box and
install in seconds by backing us you're
joining our mission of making home
automation simple
