to turn your home into a smart home you
can effectively take any product and
turn it into a smart product plug it
right in to the two smart outlets
located on pivots power genius with the
wink app you'll be able to quickly turn
each one of these products on and off
right from your smart phone if you see
that you forgot to turn your lamp off
while you're at the office you can turn
it off you can schedule things could
turn on and off on there as well so say
you have a lamp plugged into it by
midnight it's not turned off it can turn
it off for you now if this our genius
doesn't just take the form of a regular
outlet it takes the form of one of the
most inventive power strips in the world
everyone's had the problem of their
adapter being too large to fit within a
standard Pallister pivot power genius
solves that problem by allowing the
power strip to bend and move those
adapters out of the way of one another
it flexes so you could fit all of your
power bricks and all the different
appliances right into your power strip
now it's just a hell of a lot smarter
