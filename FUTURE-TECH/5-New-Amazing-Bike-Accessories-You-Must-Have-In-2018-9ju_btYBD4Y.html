mount is the ultimate mount for your
bike
we found it hard to source a mount that
offers a combination of beauty
aerodynamics strength and compatibility
at an affordable price we figured it
can't be that hard after all it's just a
mount so we set out to produce a
beautiful dual amount for all cyclists a
mount that can hold your bike computer
and a camera and light without
cluttering your handlebars our
patent-pending aerodynamic design has
the base scalloped between the mounting
pins making the camera sit more snugly
decreasing drag and making it lighter
for those weight wienies among us this
mount is one of the lightest duo mounts
on the market and yet has the strength
to withstand even the most extreme
conditions we've sourced aircraft grade
materials and tested it again and again
and again even injuring ourselves in the
process
with various attachments the dual mount
has been designed to support almost any
device we cyclists are picky when it
comes to what makes our bikes beautiful
this by far is the best-looking mount in
the world at least that's what we think
the cyclic dual mount along with other
cyclic products are endorsed and used by
former Tour de France writer Ted King
we've successfully launched two
Kickstarter campaigns one from fly six
one for fly 12 delivered to your door

shops all over the world and we wanted
to thank you and Kickstarter backers be
a everlasting support as a token of our
appreciation we want to offer you the
opportunity to get at your mount before
