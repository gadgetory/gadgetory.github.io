I never really thought it was a problem
I'd always suspected those around me had
seen my pen clicking me shaking and desk
tapping but I had no idea how bad they
got
I just figured it all the time with
anything I could get my hands on didn't
matter what
and bubble wrap a bubble wrap
the way of pop pop pops
I just couldn't get enough
that was probably thankfully my
Kickstarter
from the people who came to come over
the counter
eject you to survive an urgent - clay
roll span a clerk common fidgety
impulsive without driving your colleague
and loved ones in a
secur secur education status adjusted
and fidgeting increases focus and
improve productivity
ancient past hours do Netflix icons
which Hakeem does does alone to allow to
strategically digit kids let's be fast
by my fidgeting without endlessly
ignoring those around me I thought I
could stop at any time and now I realize
I don't want you sick you can help take
the first step to fidget in freedom
today okay so in all seriousness we make
joke about fidgeting you give our friend
the co-workers a hard time for the pen
clicking and the nail biting or what if
you're asking what a pigeon is a coping
mechanism a way for us to refocus and
more present in a moment some signs are
smarter than us believe that we have
this thing called floating attention
which makes it hard for us to focus in
certain circumstances okay hey Marc
Accetta
yeah actually the genie was been shown
to be able to help keep that boredom
attention oxide which helps you better
focus on the task in work maybe even a
little crazier is that some recent
studies have suggested that students who
use fidgeting as a mechanism during SAT
and to perform better on those thing
under arts and self
fidget cube has been a project we've
dreamt about for almost four years now
and we're excited to finally be bringing
it to you it's been a long road with a
lot of prototypes so we think you're
going to love it
when designing fidget cube we wanted to
ensure two things first the
functionality needed to truly satisfy
fidgeting yet it needed to be an entire
toolbox of fidgety options while staying
small and compact which leads us to our
second and equally important priority we
wanted physics cubes to be a premium
vest toy that can be discreetly used in
any situation from a classroom to a
board
the fidgit cube of course has six sides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
