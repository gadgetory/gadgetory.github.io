is as easy as measure mark and install
with a miles craft trim 45 to use the
trim 45 start by holding the button
upwards to adjust the reveal gauge to
your desired reveal around the door or
window
the reveal gauge has a maximum reveal of
1/2 inch and can be adjusted for a
shallow reveal in 1/8 inch increments
once you've determined your reveal
push the button back down to lock in the
desired setting to install the trim for
your project start by aligning the
reveal gauge to the jamb corner and make
your horizontal and vertical marks using
the edges of the reveal gauge scale the
front and back of the trim 45 are used
to make all marks or measurements for
your jams and trim casings then repeat
this for all four corners then to
measure for your projects trim nail the
trim 45 in place using the two small
holes just above the reveal gauge to
insert nails then using the tape measure
slots in the body the trim 45 measure
the distance between your marks to
determine the finish trim length
to help hold the tape measure in place
there's two magnets next to each of the
tape measure slots after you've measured
the links to your trim pieces set your
miter saw for a 45 degree cut and cut
one end of the trim casing then using
that 45-degree end you just cut use the
built-in trim plate to clamp your 45
degree miter cut piece onto the trim
plate with the backside of your trim
piece facing up then clamp the trim 45
to the backside of the trim using the
trim plate to keep the trim 45 in
position then using the indicated tape
measure slot measure the finish trim
length and market
next reset you reveal gauge to zero flip
the trim 45 over and make a 45-degree
angle mark on the trim at the finish
length using the 45 degree angle head
your mark should start at the corner of
the reveal gauge and follow the 45
degree angle after marking the finished
length cut the trim along the angle mark
repeat the cutting action for the
remaining trim pieces and then install
with the miles craft trim 45 installing
trim around windows and doors is as easy
as measure mark and install miles craft
always the better idea
you
the Kreg in line clamp makes it easy to
hold work pieces of all shapes and sizes
without the clamp getting in the way the
in line clamp does this with a
low-profile design that applies pressure
from the side rather than from overhead
so the clamp stays out of the way as you
work the in line clamp stays in place
with a peg that fits into any
three-quarter inch diameter hole that
makes the clamp a perfect companion to
the Craig mobile project Center and
allows you to get more from any
workbench that's equipped with three
quarter inch bench dog holes or you can
drill through quarter inch holes in any
work surface to add the convenience of
Craig inline clamping using the inline
clamp is easy simply turn the contoured
easy-to-grip dial to move the push rod
and press the clamp shoe against your
workpiece that makes it easy to dial on
the clamping pressure you need up to 250
pounds of clamping force the low-profile
clamp shoe is just 1/2 inch thick so it
stays out of the way while you work the
clients shoe design holds tight against
work pieces of all shapes and sizes
including corners and round edges and
because you can rotate the inline clamp
it's easy to direct that clamping
pressure in whatever direction you need
with the Craig inline clamp you get the
helping hand you need when you need it
with the versatility you want for a wide
variety of tasks visit us online at
Craig tool comm to learn more about the
Craig inline clamp as well as our other
Craig clamping solutions that help you
create every project with confidence
clamping up a true 90-degree corner used
to be one of the tougher things we have
to do in woodworking the Bessie angle
clamps make that job a whole bunch
easier whether you're gluing up a true
90 degree miter joint a 90 degree butt
joint even one with two different
thicknesses of wood or even a t joint
like we have when building sashes or
cabinets the Ben C angle clamps make the
job easy and accurate we can use two
different wood thicknesses because both
of the jaws pivot on the shaft this lets
them compensate for the varying wood
thicknesses yet still remain square root
of each other
clamping force is applied by turning a
large diameter and very familiar Bessie
handle that handle turns the galvanized
steel shaft that has the Acme thread
formed into it the Acme thread applies
pressure quickly but evenly with very
little effort the fixed and movable jaws
have holes in them for using the Bessie
table clamps these clamps let you secure
the Bessie angle clamp to the work
surface and frees up both hands for
putting the wood in having both
hands-free makes it much easier to get
the wood installed in the clamp
correctly the openings in a jaws make it
easy to do T joints but they make it
possible to install fasteners while the
wood is clamped up if you need it for
that job as I have come to expect from
all things Bessie their angle clamps are
very well made and works exactly as
Bessie describes quality construction
and ease of use mean - Bessie angle
clamps will make building accurate
corners much easier now and well into
the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
