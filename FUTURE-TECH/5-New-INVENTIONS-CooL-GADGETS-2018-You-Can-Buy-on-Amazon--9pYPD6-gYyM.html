a light switch right here so I won't
fall off the bed anymore and I can turn
on the light switch right now whoa how

can turn on the switch like this you
used to think I need to tear out pieces
of the wall and run additional wires but
now this is no longer necessary

setting replace the existing light
switch with this base switch then you
can put the gecko switch wherever you
want
and it's done you can place an icon lets
you know what the geckos switch controls
here there are many icons to select from
the LED behind the icon lets you know
when the light is on or off make the
bedroom light gradually brighten to wake
you up or make it to turn off with a
time delay 3 to 1 if you can't find the
gecko switch use the search function and

being a mom is not easy especially if
you're breastfeeding
and managing a career today I'd like to
make it easier for you
this is Anya she's the reason I'm making
this video I can't stop working because
I like living in a house and having food
on the table but I don't want to
compromise my daughter's well-being as
well so I don't want to stop
breastfeeding whether I'm at home or an
important meeting
that's why milk pumping machines were
invented so that someone else my husband
for example could teach it but there's
one huge problem most of them suck only
up to 60% of the milk because they're
suction cups aren't designed like this
does this look like it imitates the
section of a baby I don't have enough
milk for the bottle after Anna's
finished eating my body doesn't
accelerate the milk production because
40% of the milk is still left inside my
breasts so my body thinks there's too
much milk inside my breasts and reduces
the milk production sometimes Anya gets
hungry and mad and I'm frustrated
because I can't do anything to help her
I looked for a puffing machine that
would pump 100% of my milk but I
couldn't find one
after hours of research I came up with a
way to make the existing pumping
machines better I met up with a genius
engineer who has already designed more
than 30 patents and challenged him to
design one for me
six months later meet Annabella
Annabella is a pumping machine that
draws close to 100% of mothers milk
because it actually simulates the baby's
sucking motion this spherical part under
the main opening contains a mechanism
which imitate the baby's tongue and the
upper part enables power and Gryff
adjustment just like a real muscle
system it has a unique patent-pending
mechanism which makes you feel like a
real baby is sucking the milk the pace
and the intensity can be adjusted it's
user-friendly washable quiet and small
you can charge it and easily take it
with you we made sure that the
production process is also simple to
make Anabella affordable our concept has
been validated by breastfeeding experts
as well as a respected pediatrician it
solved the problems I was experiencing
as a first-time breastfeeding mother it
has one part that needs to be washed and
it's designed to connect with almost any
bottle type the battery allows you to
pump several times before needing to
charge it again we are currently
developing an app which will monitor the
amount of milk thought and recommend the
optimal pace and intensity of the
process we need your support to
introduce this product to the market
millions of moms are waiting for an
innovative product like the Annabella
your financial support will help us
start production in the future we will
take Annabella to retail companies in
order to distribute worldwide we hope
you're excited as we are about the
Annabella even a small contribution will
help us get to the finish line that much
sooner if you have followers on Facebook
or any other social media please share
this video think of all the moms you'll
be helping by doing so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
