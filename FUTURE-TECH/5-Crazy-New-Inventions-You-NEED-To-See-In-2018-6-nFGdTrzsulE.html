this is called cosenza a device that
works as a kind of mobile phone kissing
that has been presented at the
conference on love and sex with robots
the idea is to be able to send kisses
from a distance that we can actually
feel in our skin thanks to the haptic
technology in fact the device is part of
a project by researcher ma Yan Jiang who
has aimed to help solve problems
inherent in long-distance relationships
with this unique product that offers
effective communication of deep emotions
and of intimacy through a multi
sensorial experience of communication on
the internet the description is somewhat
grandiloquent but the truth is that the
solution is unique the cradles Docs in
which the iPhones are inserted we do not
know if it works with other smartphones
count in the lower part with a small
silicone pad the two people who
communicate via FaceTime or Skype have
the option to send a kiss not only with
text or emoticons but also physically
all you have to do is to kiss that pad
which will cause the kissing pressure
pattern to be recorded so that the
person receiving the kiss can place the
pad on the cheek or lips on the other
side and can feel the same pressure
transmitted through small activators
that reproduce that pattern the
kissinger is intended not only for human
beings but as a possible way to explore
the man-machine relationships of the
future the experiments that will be
carried out will also make this
development trying to pass the Turing
test so that a receiver of the kiss
tries to decide if the one who has
kissed him at a distance is a human or a
machine that imitated the pattern of a
human kiss
