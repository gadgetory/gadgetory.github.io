feeling and Luna really does that really
connects you with the music really helps
to get you there it really took me by
surprise honestly to have such full
beautiful saheb coming out of this
compact device and with the brushed
aluminum the surface feels familiar like
my iPhone so I can imagine having this
at a dinner party you know with my
family and friends around it's a great
conversation piece but it's also very
subtle
meet luna by crazy baby a revolutionary
smart wireless speaker we listen to
music more than ever and with luna you
can take hi file with you throughout
your day
and party mode you can give access to
multiple phones and you can sync up to
32 devices at once
Luna will automatically set up stereo
and pairing when you use more than one
device with left and right channels
we believe a space with music is a space
where something unexpected can happen
that's why with the Luna app switching
from Wi-Fi to Bluetooth is simple
creating an atmosphere to work play or
spend time with those you love is
something we do every day
Luna makes this experience seamless from
any smart device in any room at the same
time
Luna is made from aircraft grade
aluminum it's ultra durable and portable
we've considered each part of Luna
inside and out so you can simply let the
music connect us and connect to Luna
this is Luna by crazy baby
