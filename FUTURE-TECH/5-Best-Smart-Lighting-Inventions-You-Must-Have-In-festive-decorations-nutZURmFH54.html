absolutely awesome to be able to control
your lights from your phone is a pretty
damn cool overall feature so let's take
a look at three smart lighting sets from
a company called Xiaomi that you
probably have already heard of so let's
check them out first we have the Xiaomi
Yi lights bedside lamp for about fifty
dollars this is my favorite light out of
the three but despite the slightly
boring name it's a very cool overall
light it's a cylinder with a metal base
and a plastic covered body with a very
simple overall design
you turn it on with the power button on
top and sync it with the me home app
available on Android and iOS or the e
light app on Android unfortunately this
light is currently not compatible with
iOS but should be in the future also on
top is a second button the first two
clicks activate two different presets
and the third is a flow mode that
switches between different colors and to
adjust brightness to spin your finger
around the top so you can do a lot of
things without the app as well making
this just a great overall light in the
app you can turn on and off the light or
swipe down from the top of the screen
and use the quick toggle it's the same
sort of thing on iOS you can also adjust
hue and brightness switch to white light
and adjust the temperature have it flow
between colors adjust the speed and more
in terms of brightness I'd say in
complete darkness it could fill a small
room it's bright colors are vibrant and
has no real issues overall also it can
be used to make some pretty awesome
looking pictures and videos this is cute
the next generation smart light bulb
cuba automates your light at home so you
never have to come back to a dark house
again you can sense when you're entering
or leaving the room
and then automatically switch the lights
on or offer you

your choice whether it's a dinner date
birthday party or a quiet time of
reading cube always has the right
lighting for the occasion
Cuba smart you can set the lights to
dance to the beat of your favorite songs
and it also notifies you if you leave
home without switching off your lights
cube helps to organize your life
it seems with the weather application in
the works you when it is about to ring
or when you receive a phone call or
message

belongings at home by lighting up the
bulb closest to the item that you are
trying to find it even wakes you up in
the morning
cube is easy to use my place your
existing light bulbs with it download
the free app and you are good to go
with cute your life
here you can see many empty wine bottles
in a few settings they were changed into
many beautiful butter lights technically
we use a solar cell a slot had to charge
insert battery with sunlight at night

H can us about four to five hours and
fits most of butters you Macy's us-led

hello and Alice as a solar products
engineer for many years I have been
squeezing myself to create more
innovative and beneficial solar lighting
products for people the idea of these
lights somehow compelled me when I see
all the times in the party or at home of
the party is finished with sir oh wait
empty wine bottles into a garbage can so
I start to think about if I can do some
sit down only to reuse a balance but
also to help and so a little bit of our
global wasting problems now I hope this
small innovation can bring even more joy
and happiness and at the same time we
are doing some subscribe together and
sell our living environment thanks so
much for your supporting us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
