photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range add a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot
we built a better way
today's DSLR and mirrorless cameras have
amazing optics and sensors but they do
very little to actually help you take a
good photo
finding the right settings involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with the
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created Arsenal the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
Arsenal fine settings take the best
photo possible Arsenal's AI searches
thousands of images in its database to
suggest good settings next it fine Tunes
the suggestions by analyzing 18
different factors Arsenal uses state of
the art machine learning to help you
take a great photo in any condition
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo stacking with
Arsenal you can do this in second
capture all the details and scenes with
high dynamic range get everything in
sharp focus and create long exposures
without buying expensive filters using
these advanced techniques Arsenal lets
you go beyond the limitations of your
camera's sensor lens four times when you
want complete control you can wirelessly
adjust manual settings see a live
preview and trigger the shutter all from
up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone
and finally Arsenal makes it easy to
capture stunning time lapses
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing light giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your technique with Arsenal
Arsenal is already being tested in the
field now I need your help to ramp up
production by supporting our campaign
stay you can be one of the first to get
Arsenal we've got exclusive rewards for
our early backers and some awesome
stretch goals in the works I'm really
excited about the photos I've been
getting with Arsenal I can't wait to
share it with you and see all the
amazing photos of you

piloting drones is a relatively new
activity that most people are starting
to explore we wanted to design a drone
that introduced as many people as
possible to the first person view drone
experience without breaking the bank
introducing a whole new flight
experience the bolt is an innovative and
versatile first person view drone
available at a radical price it's a
complete ready to fly out-of-the-box
solution that's easy and safe to pilot
the drone for everyone there are three
ways to fly first for beginners to start
flying simply turn on the drone and turn

and pair and you can takeoff the drone
features altitude stabilization and a
beginner's mode that makes picking up
the basics of breeze learn how to safely
and confidently maneuver and control
your drone next for those ready to
expand their horizons attach the screen
to the controller and start piloting the
drone further away simply turn on the
drone in the screen the camera on the
drone will automatically sync and
broadcast a live high-definition feed
mount the screen on the controller and
you're ready to go finally for those
ready for the whole first person view
experience swap the screen into the
goggles and prepare for a whole new
flight experience immerse yourself into
the world of fpv piloting and cruise
around high in the sky or try your hand
at fpv drone racing and experience the
incredible excitement from every twist
and turn drone racing is a new and
exciting sport that is quickly growing
around the world using fpv goggles
pilots race their drones around courses
to compete for the fastest times it is
truly the sport of the future the bolt
can be used to experience drone racing
at a fraction of the current price it's
an exciting virtual reality flying
experience
the vault drone was designed and tested
in Los Angeles by a team of expert
product designers aerospace engineers
and drone enthusiasts it's built on a
carbon fiber frame that offers unmatched
performance and durability the HD camera
provides crystal-clear video and photos
and the battery easily slides in and out
for quick swapping the drone design is
modular so that individual parts can be
replaced the result is a highly
maneuverable lightweight and aerodynamic
drone the bolt features a unique and
innovative fpv viewing system that
allows seamless transition from
traditional viewing on the controller to
fpv viewing using goggles we're excited

their drones at a high price point since
importers wholesalers and retailers mark
up the price of a drone up to five
hundred percent by cutting out the
middlemen we are able to sell directly
to you and pass on the savings the bolt
drone was designed to introduce as many
people as possible to first-person view
piloting and racing without breaking the
bank with our finished prototypes ready
