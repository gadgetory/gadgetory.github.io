makers we've learned the following but
if the work is well done every detail
thought out every rough patch polished
and every seam complete and the piece
will last a lifetime that if the parts
are crafted with an insane attention to
detail and no expense spared in
fabrication
then the final piece will excel and
perform that if the aesthetics are
conceived of first and foremost as a
result of function then the piece will
be striking we learned that sharing the
manufacturing process with the absolute
best in the craft creates a vibrant
community of craft that grows to make
the very best again and again and again
above all we know that the true magic of
the piece is the concert of all of these
and that's why coal is a revolution in
the art of the trim Kari
here's a list of stuff from kind of
magical to unbelievably magical body
wash that's also shampoo Mentos and cola
things that fly with your help the

shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
wants to try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy always said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight

breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power up the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of shai's told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane shy
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted two years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen
Meech eyes unbelievably magical
invention power op 3 the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane

up three turns your embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just fold a piece of copy paper to a
plane that's power up 3 and install the
app now call your mom and tell your
pilot because it works out of the box in
the back of the module are a propeller
and a rudder that are in charge of
controlling the plane in the front there
is an advanced ship with powerful
Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beast out of juice charge
the battery with any microUSB cable as I
learned in his career as a pilot planes
should be building when flying and for
crashing that's why all components of
the powerup 3 are super durable and
crash proof but here's where shy made it
really cool
powerup threes smart shape is programmed
to optimize user happiness you don't
