and behind me we've got one of our
travel displays it's one of the displays
we had out at SHOT Show this year as
well as the great American outdoor show
in Pennsylvania you already know we've
got some of the fastest access firearm
storage on the market I'm gonna prove
that point right now with our magnetic
keys one on each side we've got access
to our tab or in here go ahead and close
it up locks it right back up
that's our 12 42 we've been doing that
now for about a year very fast access
but what we're really excited about is a
new product for this year it's our RFID
model so initially it's going to be on
the 825 a 812 the 1420 and the 1450
product line and it works just like this
you take your RFID key place it right up
top and the shelf opens right up now
like I said this is our display we've
had this thing to shot show we've had it
out to the great American outdoors show
and we have literally opened and closed
this particular 825 thousands and
thousands of times some of the
additional features of the RFID system
is that you're able to actually program
multiple products to the same key card
and you're also able to program multiple
key cards to one product so if you
wanted to be able to give out keys to
two or three different people to have
access to your home defense weapons
you're able to do that or if you want to
be able to unlock four different
products in four different parts of your
home you're able to do that as well so
that's one of the really neat things
about the rfid technology another thing
is you can see it this form is a key
card you could put it in your wallet you
can carry around with you everywhere you
go
or in the case of this book we have one
just stow it away right inside that lets
you open it right up something that's
real close by right on the shelf now you
can hear it's actually chiming if you
leave your product open for too long it
will let you know that you've left it
unlocked it's a safety feature it's also
able to be disengaged and you can turn
that off
that's our new RFID 825 come check out
these awesome products and the rest of
our line at tactical walls comm take
care and God bless
