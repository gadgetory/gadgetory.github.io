every day women wear bras and there are
thousands of colors and styles to choose
from but at vitally bear we want to make
them more functional than ever this is
vitally the world's first fashionable
comfortable smart bra that helps you
live a well-balanced life stress begins
in the body before it reaches the mind
but by the time we realize it it's too
late and we already feel its effects
vitally detects these early signs by
monitoring your breath posture and HRV
and it's sensors are made of fabric so
they have all the accuracy of
traditional sensors while being much
more comfortable for all-day wear HRV is
a key physiological indicator of stress
when vitally notices your HRV getting
low it gently reminds you to take a deep
breath vitally then coaches you to
breathe in sync with your heart's
natural rhythm doing this stops your
body's unconscious reaction to stress
before it starts and this breathing
technique can also be used proactively
but deeper focus or relaxation for me
it's interesting to be wearing a bra and
looking at emails and seeing how my
heart is reacting to just having to
filter through emails with this bra I'm
able to monitor my stress and do things
that can allow me to reduce stress
throughout the days and really know what
my triggers are so that I can change my
day as I'm noticing the patterns but
good breathing is impossible without
good posture vital II can sense your
body slouching and will softly remind
you to straighten up better posture is
proven to lead to better focus and
confidence with vitally maintaining it
is as simple as getting dressed and
vitally doesn't need your smartphone to
work so you can stay balanced anywhere
like a great coach vitally make senior
progress simple the Wellness score is a
combination of everything vitally
measures personalized to your goals
everything you do changes in real time
so whether it's a morning yoga routine
or an afternoon meditation you can see
the exact before and after effects so
recently I've been trying to do a lot of
meditation and this bra has really
helped me in terms of giving me feedback
for my improvements every single time I
have a session and it's just add a
motivation to keep doing what I'm doing
there's actual progress mythili comes in
two classic colors as a front zipper or
back clasp for easy access and it's
sweat wicking and supportive design lets
you move worry-free my first impression
is that it's so comfortable I love that
all the seams are really smooth and from
the is really comfortable I just worked
out of it it's easy to take on it's easy
to take off and easy to move in so I
love it so whether you're at home in the
office or on the map vitally is the bra
for every woman
hi my name is Rebecca Ozzie and I'm a
lactation consultant today I'm going to
be sharing my new paper product called
the lovey lactation massager
which is literally a lifesaver if you're
breastfeeding or pumping it's easy no
mold has multiple vibration modes
there's a hundred percent waterproof
which means you could use it in the
shower what I love about this product is
its unique shape it has three different
sides which helps you solve a bunch of
different breastfeeding problems the
smooth back side can be used to help
soften the breast and stimulate letdown
the rounded edge can be used to dig into
plug ducts and help break them up and
the sides can be used to help move fluid
and Express milk whether you're in the
beginning middle or end of your
breastfeeding journey this is a
wonderful tool to have on hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
