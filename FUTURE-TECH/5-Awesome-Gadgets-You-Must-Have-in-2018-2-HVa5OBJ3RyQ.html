to your home
it begins with touch control LED
lighting for perfect illumination in any
setting One Touch bluetooth connectivity
two-way speaker system for better music
make or take a call from a friend
turn on anti-fog before entering the
shower watches vo clears for you
vo beauty sound and light 15 miles
that's insane
it's far it's really about what you can
do with that range though I think the
launch video is about freedom
I think it's nobody on land big lives
big landscape in the hair pure bliss
there's nothing else like we go we shoot
in the desert
disagree 15 miles that's legit urban
transportation I think it's gotta be
going places
you're progressing the city stopping on
a dime
crushing Hills having coffee riding all
day without turn
screw launch video
you
as you look to the future you get to
decide what you want to hold on to this
is a vest aboard a wonderfully
mechanical display that you can control
from anywhere it works with your
favorite apps so you can stay connected
to what's new
keep your team and sing
manage your schedule or help guests find
their way
we created Vesta board so you can
connect with what matters to you
hero clip was originally a crowdfunded
concept the product is simple intuitive
and incredibly versatile is the 3m one
clip swivel
and hook with a rubber tip that allows
you to store hold carry organized and
easily accessed year of any sort at any
adventure or in daily life
and extra ham was exactly what I needed
when I came up with the idea for hero
clip I was a very active parent of two
small kids training to summit Mount
Rainier and juggling a hundred other
things
I'd love getting outside and exploring
and I wanted to have a tool that I could
use for all the different things I do
not just one or the other so we created
a tool that does it all a tool that
makes it easier to do all the things you
want to do every day
the Yeti touch defrosting board will
defrost hard rock meats poultry and fish
in as little as 20 minutes this amazing
design literally pulls the chair away
from the meat and into the tray
once thawed you can even use the board
as a cutting board for dicing and
slicing if you want to thaw out beef and
then slice it for fajitas you can easily
with the board thawing your meat on this
board reduces the spread of contaminants
microwave defrosting poses because there
is no heat source there's no chance of
spreading salmonella staph or any
contagious disease you could attempt to
run water over it and defrost it faster
but then you're washing away vital
nutrients minerals and its most potent
flavors the design of the cast molded
aluminum literally pulls the cold and
frost out of your food reducing your
thought time from several hours to
sometimes minutes best of all there's no
messy overflow to clean up after defrost
all the water carefully runs off and
it's trapped in a safe water secure tray
underneath the tray
no batteries or electricity needed makes
food preparation or breeze</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
