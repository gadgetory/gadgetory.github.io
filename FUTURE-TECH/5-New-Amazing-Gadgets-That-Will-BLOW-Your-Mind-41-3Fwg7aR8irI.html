long-range radio technology to create
your own personal network that does not
rely on cell service within your own
network you can communicate via text to
others in your group even without a slot
device go telly can still track and
broadcast your location and if in
trouble go telly has an SOS button that
will alert others in the group that
helps Ismene go telly is a great
addition to any outdoor activity get in
go telly today coding with drones coder
on light is a learning tool which means
you can use it to learn how to code
you've probably tried a lot of other
toys that are either boring they break
easily or do too expensive code your own
light is programmable meaning you can
code or program your code drone within
minutes thanks to our awesome software
and tutorials there are three ways to
program making it easy and fun to learn
how to fly your code wrong whether
you're a kid or even an adult it's the
smartest most beginner friendly drone
for coders of any level but you can also
fly your drone using our smartphone app
it's built with the best-in-class
hardware and material meaning not only
does it fly well but it can take a few
metres
and can get optional parts to do more
with Khodro there's no other drone like
it get a head start on learning code

measurements are integral to our
everyday lives
but they can put us into risky and
tricky situations or require someone
else to help gange those lengthy
distances but here's a change by bagpipe
size image in between now you can get
out of that risky spot and don't need a
helping hand to determine long distances
new jamiemeasures and not one but two
directions from one press of a button
you can acquire the left/right and total
value at once saving you precious time
and energy on every move and allowing
you to work with greater efficiency by
making new the focal point also your
measurements can be instantly updated to
your smart device with our sketch
application we can design and plan for
any project VH Ami's additional
functions enable you to use continuous
measuring mode to find the points

we take that extra step so you don't
have to hi i'm joe jones inventor of
turtle 15 years ago I created Roomba
small and user friendly robot that
cleans home floors all by itself
since room is amazing success I've been
looking for opportunities for other
practical robots I found a great one in
the garden
it's called turtle turtle is a robot
that eliminates weeds it's solar powered
chemical free and waterproof everyday it
charges itself in the Sun and one has
enough energy goes patrolling for weeds
my name is Rory McKean I'm the CEO of
Franklin robotics turtle uses the height
of the plant to decide if it's good or
if it's bad if it's taller than an inch
of the obsidium it's smaller than an
inch it cuts in turtle has two methods
of removing weeds the first is a small
nylon string on the bottom of the robot
that spins rapidly to cut the weeds the
second is the design of the wheels as
the robot drives around the wheels scrub
the surface of the soil damaging
pre-emergent weeds turtle doesn't need
to pull weeds because it chops them
every day even if a chopped weed sprouts
again coda will keep chopping it down
until it runs out of store energy and
dies there's no mapping or programming
required for turtle you put the robot in
the garden press go and the robot takes
care of the rest
turtle uses bluetooth to talk to the
user smartphone there's an app that
accompanies turtle through the app you
can learn about conditions in your
garden and what turtle has been doing
because turtle cuts the weeds every day
the clippings are small so they fall
back onto the ground and travel up
returning the nutrients to the soil to
inform turtle that you want to keep a
small plant you put one of the provided
plant collars around the seedling this
lets turtle know that it's a desired
plant once the plant is larger you can
remove the collar if you like turtle
collects some energy even on cloudy days
and it uses this energy very carefully
thus it can keep operating through
extended cloudy periods turtle is helped
by the fact that we can't grow very fast
when there's no Sun turtle can easily
cover the typical garden size in the US
which is about a hundred square feet
given favorable soil conditions or sunny
climates turtle is able to cover more
area than that
turtle is round it's short it has
four-wheel drive and extreme camber
wheels those are all design choices that
improve total mobility in the garden
turtle requires a barrier to keep it
from wandering away from the garden this
could be the edge of a raised bed a
chicken wire fence or some other type of
border we've been developing turtle over
the past two years constantly testing
prototyping and iterating to make the
best product that we can the launch and
kick started because we need your help
to bring turtle to production with your
support today you can be one of the
first to have turtle in your garden
because weeding sucks you should make a
robot do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
