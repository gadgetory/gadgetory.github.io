Bieber and David Beckham which means

wink tell me do you enjoy a nice glass
of wine I think you might and so you
know that as good as wine is when you
open a bottle it only tastes that way
for about a day but not with cuvee
because cuvee has a super smart bottling
and dispensing system that keeps oxygen
from touching your wine this is what you
order and this is how you pour it the
screen tells you what you're drinking
tells you how much there is left to
drink shows you the story of the wine
lets you rate the wine and even order
more hey guys what are we drinking well
I was gonna open a red and I've been
craving a Chardonnay closely now that's
a problem what are you gonna do open two
bottles well I've read it's fine no it's
fine no with cuvee you can have that
Chardonnay baby knock yourself out
pour both
take it apart it was one friend who
loves his rose a live person the rest of
us not so much with cuvee you can choose
between hundreds of varietals styles and
vineyards in order from the cuvette
online store or even from the bottle
this means you can keep more wines
around and not worry about wastage
oxygen never gets into this bottle so
every glass you pour will taste amazing
for up to 30 days
drink what you want always fresh one
glass at a time
you and I have something in common we
are dreamers at least I prefer to think
you are and dreams are real aren't they
but not someone else's only your own
sanity is not to have control of a
reality of the capacity to light up the
chaos the place of origin of all our
discovery when sanity is lost I go back
to my dealer priest or favorite book
about a self-proclaimed film Messiah
sometimes it helps we don't need to
venture to the stars nor seek to dance
at magnificent horizons far and beyond
maybe it is enough to take light where
light has not been before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
