artist but a great tool can help an
artist see things in a different light
meet scribble it lets you borrow the
colors around you and allows you to use
the world as your inspiration
just scan and start creating
it works by using a special color sensor
to read the colors you scan and a smart
pump mixes and dispenses the colored ink
and with this scribble smart stylus the
colors you scan will sync up with your
smart devices via bluetooth with
scribble the world is your palette

for yourself but also to share them and
nothing is more satisfying than a
successful collaboration
the world is made of wonderful colors
and now you have them all at your
fingertips
so it's time for you to scribble I love
to study but doing homework is a
different story
so I soon find myself on my lung luckily
I was able to grab a scan marker it's
the digital highlighter that lets you
scan printed material anywhere anytime
scan marker is an incredible
productivity tool and it lets you
accelerate the summarizing and typing
process transfer it to any of your
devices and share it with your friends
it saves so much time and it's easy to
use awesome
skee and marker take notes and create
separate ello Kickstarter my name is
Nils three years ago my team and I came
to you with an idea we wanted to let you
know your home was safe without invasive
cameras or complex security systems
that's why we designed point thanks to
you the point is now used by thousands
of people across the world today we're
launching the next generation we've
learned from our community and we've
seen from families and neighbors come
together when the unexpected happens
that's why the new point is full home
alone sign for collaboration we think
you'll love it
meet Susan Bob and Judy Anderson and
their neighbor Alex this is their home
wood point
point consent smoke
point can sense noise point can sense
movement
traditional alarm systems rely on many
individual devices and sensors appoint
combines sound motion and environmental
sensors in one device through machine
learning it identifies what's happening
in the environment much like a brain
when point detects something important a
message is sent to a group of people
chosen by you so you can help each other
out when needed point is now serious
business and the team behind it is grown
after more than a year of hard work
we'll just a few months away from
shipping the new point will come with a
subscription when it hits retail but we
want to offer you something special
all Kickstarter backers new and old will
get free lifetime service so please
support us and join us on our journey
hey everybody its Joshua fields
Melbourne and I'm Ryan Nicodemus and
together we are the minimalists and you
know what we decided to finally make a
thing it's a bag it's a really really
awesome bag what it's really cool we
were gonna wait to tell them we were
actually gonna tell them in the video Oh
perfect well let's start the video for
the better part of the last decade we've
traveled all over the world talking with
people about our simple living story and
we've learned a lot of lessons
throughout our years of travel one of
the biggest lessons we learned was this
our oversized suitcases were weighing us
down we tried just about every bag you
can imagine but they were either too
small or too large or too awkward but
then our friend Colin introduced us to
this travel bag designed by a guy named
Malcolm Fon ta it was a duffle bag a
carry-on bag a messenger bag a laptop
bag and a suitcase all in one but
Malcolm made only 300 of these bags Josh
and I we were lucky enough to buy one
yeah but there was a problem because
everywhere we would travel we're on the
road people will come up to us and they
would say hey where do I get that bag
but there weren't any more left and then
we got an interesting phone call hey
guys it's Malcolm fatty yet after seeing
your documentary minimalism people keep
asking me about my bag I want to bring
it back I need your help we knew how
much value that bag had added to our
lives and so we decided to what we
wanted to give mal con the hand and
bringing him back and making it even
better so many of us have traveled the
world with these bags that there's
certain things that we've learned that
can be implemented in the version two to
make it even that much better
the good news is that is already 98%
there here's the pact one a
collaboration between Malcolm Fon ta and
the minimalists the pact one has the
same unique zip around dual compartment
design that provides the versatility of
a duffel with a pack ability and
organization of a suitcase we reviewed
every detail of the bag and carefully
added new features to ensure all your
belongings are easy to pack and access
after going through hundreds of security
checkpoints and thinking about how our
bag can help you navigate them we added
a TSA pocket use it to securely stash
all the things you have to remove from
your pockets instead of using a bin the
padded laptop pocket is placed in the
center of the bag so your clothing adds
additional protection it still allows
quick access in keeping with our ethos
there are no logos on the exterior of
the bag as conscious consumers we source
modern durable materials that are animal
friendly and have the lowest possible
environmental impact
we designed the original as the ultimate
travel bag that we wanted but couldn't
find you know this is truly the best bag
we've ever used that's why it's the one
and only physical good that bears the
minimalists name so if you're ready to
purchase the only bag that you ever want
we think that this is the one but truth
be told I'm gonna tell you you probably
don't need
new back and if you don't please don't
feel compelled to purchase this one you
will be just fine without it the air
bubble is the first proven technology
that effectively removes more than 95%
of both nitrogen dioxide and particles
from inside a car it's now well known
that air pollution affects our health
especially those living in cities
however what most people aren't aware of
is just how bad the air in your car can
be nitrogen dioxide levels primarily
from diesel emissions inside your car
cabin can be 10 times over the WHL limit
sitting in a vehicle with your windows
up in traffic is not the safe haven you
might think that it is that's why we've
created the air bubble the first proven
technology of its kind that removes all
elements of air pollution including
nitrogen dioxide from inside a car cabin
the air bubble is optimized to protect
drivers and their families in polluted
cities and professional drivers who
spend hours on the road designed to fit
on the back of the car headrest the air
bubble works by drawing polluted air
circulating inside the car into the unit
before our proprietary filtration
technology removes gases particles
bacteria dust and odors clean air is
then released back to the driver and
passengers in the most efficient way
possible using advanced air flow
dynamics what we breathe matters and a
lab son mission to reduce people's
exposure to air pollution light rays
parents are always conscious to avoid
the high levels of air pollution found
on busy roads what I hadn't realized is
the levels of harmful nitrogen dioxide
can be even higher inside our cars
our research is a real wake-up call as I
realize the impact this could have on
the house of my son and of other
children of our labs knowing we had the
only proven technology to effectively
remove nitrogen dioxide I knew it was
our duty to serve out the air bubble
giving people the power to protect
themselves and their families the air
bubble has been designed by our team of
atmospheric chemists and airflow
engineers at air labs in our research
laboratory here in Copenhagen it uses
our proprietary filtration technology
developed over the past decade at air
labs we specialize in creating clean air
zones for people the technology inside
the air bubble has proven itself inside
of clean air bus shelters and in a clean
air bench commissioned by Transport for
London during the past year we have
focused on creating a clean air zone
inside of a car and not making the air
bubble a reality we have manufacturers
lined up and with your help we can start
protecting people with the air bubble
early next well we're really excited to
be launching the air bubble and today
we're asking for your support so you can
start making a real difference to
people's lives
