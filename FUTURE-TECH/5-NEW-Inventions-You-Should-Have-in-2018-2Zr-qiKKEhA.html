this is an all-season all-terrain
electric board for the first time a
track was developed with a
patent-pending tire like form factor
this allows for the board to benefit
both from the incredible traction of a
track in the fluid carving feeling of
the board
for the past 10 years we've been
engineering everything from drones
aerospace all-terrain and electric
vehicles and realized there's nothing on
the market that combined all of this
coolest tech into one portable machine
we used our electric car experience to
reinvent the track as you know it we do
everything in-house we imagine design
patent build manufacture and test every
detail all here at flux our dream was to
create a portable vehicle that allows
you peace of mind knowing no matter what
situation storm adventure or daily
Transit demands you face the track one
will get you there our planet Earth's
rain is a force to be reckoned with and
only our patented continuous track can
cruise through whatever Nature throws at
you now go explore the path and traveled
hey I'm Eric and I'm stoked to share
with you the riptides r1 an electric
skateboard that blends massive power and
a compact design let's check it out
the riptides has dual belt-driven motors
at 1,800 watts of power you can fly up
the line and get it with the top speed
of 20 miles per hour in no time with all
that power riding up hills is no problem
the board is rated for eight miles of
range and it actually gets it once you
get your destination just grab it and go
more than anything I designed the
riptides out of my love for surfing
skating and snowboarding
this board is built by riders for riders
which drove some very key decisions
first it had to have a kick tail so I
can tack it around or kick it up then it
had to be built to shred so it can
handle anything I throw at it
to ensure a smoother ride it has wide
trucks and some of the best long
boarding wheels on the market finally I
knew I'd want to bring it on all my
adventures so our battery pack is UN
approved and airline friendly I've
ridden almost every electric skateboard
on the market and I found the perfect
board for me doesn't exist so I designed
the riptides focusing on big-time power
and a small pad
at Riptide electric we build a board
that blends massive power and a small
package if you can handle it you're
gonna love the way it rides
we all know it's not about where you're
going but how you get there so why not
do it smarter
come on
let's try this again
he's a proud owner of the brand new G by
a revolutionary foldable electric
bicycle
assisted with a powerful motor go up
hills without breaking a sweat
compared with efficient gears and rings
get there fast and get there user
customize your ride with the speed
selection of six choices and ride as
long as you want with over 55 miles on a
single charge
when you've arrived holding up is as
easy as one
to
three
you don't need to bother locking up
because you could wheel it on in you can
store it right under your desk and let
it charge until you need it again
we've created G bike as a green and
convenient alternative to current
transportation we also made sure it is
affordable yet crafted with the best of
components so join us in making your
right smarter by helping us bring this
project along
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
