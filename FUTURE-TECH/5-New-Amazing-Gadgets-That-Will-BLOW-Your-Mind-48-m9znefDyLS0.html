explore the amazing places around the
world and most importantly shopping we
all want to pack everything in the air
we're anything we've bought into the
luggage but we all face the same problem
we past no matter how you organize the
size of there will still be too much in
the end we cannot put everything the
luggage but make ourselves tired oh and
the dirty coil starts taking off during
the trip we don't even want to mix it
with new clothes or maybe there is no
space for it already
hello Kickstarter I'm Jennifer as a
traveler we are thinking about how to
make more space in very short time and
after our research we found out clothes
back and other sort of things occupy
more than 50% of the luggage for a
five-day trip so that's what creates
vago a miracle solution of making more
space in a very short time
you
now
we only need to do is to put our clothes
in Tobago back think about it put on Bay
go plug in power and push the bottom
Vega will automatically and read quotes
you can enjoy your time in the hotel or
any other place where van Gogh is doing
straw
don't worry this intelligent vago will
automatically stop when the process is
finished the only thing you need to do
is putting the shrunk vacuum back into
your luggage we can also use further
battery to recharge bagel we believe
this convenient design to make
Shopaholic to buy more remember those
thirty closed beta welcome back to
prevent smelly smell and urine so you
can keep bloggers clean and use more
space efficiently in the same time to
make your overall trip even more
convenient so we use the general
microUSB cable for the recharge design
create extra space for your luggage to
make every phase count currently bago
will have four color and will have more
color collection in the near future
each bagel will come with vacuum bag for
clothes and silk socks now vago is in
the modeling design process and we have
a really great team to make it even
better we will appreciate if you can
support and plus this product and we are
sure bago can make your trip more
relaxed more convenient and later be
more souvenir and memory home thank you
