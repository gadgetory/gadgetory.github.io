and slider to create the exact look you
want from a slow track that reveals a
key plot detail to slow cushions for
dramatic effect in motion gives you a
cinematic shot every time hiking
standard I am so Alec and my team and I
need your support to bring in motion to
the market we're a diverse team with
backgrounds in software engineering
mechanical design and manufacturing but
what unites all is a huge passion for
photography with in motion everyone will
be able to create hollywood-style shots
just with their smartphone so please
back our campaign today and help us
bring this dream to reality

hi i'm ryan and i'm elias we are part of
the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it clings to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we'd come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travellers wanting an easy
way to wash clothes while on the go it's
also simple to use you simply place it
in water add some soap turn on the
built-in timer and walk away
30 minutes later your clothes are
cleaner than ever before
sonic soak is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close sonic soak is your solution
sonic soap is ready to be shipped just
after our campaign ends we just need you
to help make it happen which means you
can have a cleaner almost anything and
practically no time once we end this
campaign successfully so please help us
bring sonic soap to mass production and
experience clean like never before now

I'm on top of my game
I have been for a while
outfox in everybody it's hard to see
everyone from way up here my life is
made of gold party time
we all know the Fox says
hey Kickstarter's I'm Brett Palitana
I make my living as a stand-up comic in
Los Angeles my line of work be mobile is
impaired
so that means my car is my lifeline
especially in this city because nobody
walks in LA
if I lose access to my car I lose access
to my life and that's exactly what
happened my most Fox tough day
it started out perfect I hit the beach
to catch some surf Sun was shining birds
chirping water was warm then my
girlfriend called and everything changed
my girls like hey babe where are you I'm
at the beach catching some waves why
he's surfing she says like I know I'll
be there in a little bit don't worry
about it my audition you're supposed to
be here in 30 minutes take me up like I
know I'll be there I promise promise me
you'll be here in 30 minutes her
audition wasn't for another hour now
that gave me 20 minutes to surf
15-minute car ride to her house say ten
minutes to get her stuff into the car
15-minute ride to the audition that's
more than half an hour early I'm good
I thought I was good until I got back to
my car because it wasn't I had to think
quick I have no money I had no keys no
phone all I had was a wetsuit and the
surfboard some nice little lady let me
use her phone now I couldn't call my
girlfriend cuz she wouldn't believe it
so I called my boy Rick said he went out
the boys last night and left his car at
work
it says keys were in the gas cap
go for the keys no keys I'm gonna lose
that girl and I heard that sweet noise
ring ring
one more chance
I don't know how I'm gonna get her to
our audition I just need to be there and
then I can explain to her what happens
but that isn't how it went
look who's rolling by and look at me
no car no board no girlfriend
box is a four-letter word and everyone's
had to use it because everyone's had a
Fox tough day this is actually no
laughing matter
and that's why I started Fox well to
develop a solution that gives people
tall access controls their vehicles so I
brought together the best designer
programmer marketer and engineer to make
sure we never have another Fox tough day
let's go meet the team
how about a fox update - this is one of
the coolest projects I've ever worked on
seriously this is one of the sickest
codes I've ever worked on we're all here
because we've all had that Fox
up day this is one of the most exciting
campaigns I ever worked on but the
reason I'm here is because I had a fox
step down we engineered a box out of
this so you don't have a fox tough day
our dedicated team has spent countless
hours working side by side with some of
the best minds in the transportation
vehicle manufacturing safe and vault and
cybersecurity industries to design Fox
vault from auto dealers and fleet owners
to locksmiths and hackers this has been
such an exciting process we've simulated
over 27 virtual designs written over
350,000 lines of code tested 23 physical
prototypes and beat the Fox out of way
too many trunks and bumpers to count and
as a result we've learned a ridiculous
amount about all the things it takes to
truly safeguard a key to your life there
are five critical success factors to
consider when engineering or purchasing
a legitimate smart license-plate ball
that's why our team engineered it with
high carbon steel composition seamless
unibody construction and reinforced wall
and structural supports which makes it
practically indestructible we also
designed it with shrouded exterior seams
anti pry lap joints and interior mounted
hinges to make it nearly impenetrable we
developed it with dual state data
encryption multi-factor authentication
and SSL certificate pinning to make it
virtually unhackable that's why we
created Fox fast a proprietary vehicle
fastening system that makes the Fox
vault license plate in your vehicle
become one making it virtually and more
without your combination and a Fox fast
key and so that it's actually smart we
innovated it with the capability to
internally sense keys in motion track
keys and vehicle and share
an axis all with the phone to make it
remarkably self-aware we know all too
well that foxes are strong crafty and
sneaky they're also wickedly dogmatic so
we fully grasp the potential
ramifications of hiding your vehicle's
key in plain sight that's why we've
engineered the Fox out of this thing
enough to outfox even the most cunning
of foxes we all fundamentally know how
valuable our vehicle keys are yet we've
all put them in unlocked hide-a-key
cases magnetic lock boxes gas cap
holders even above the visor and under
the floor mat we sometimes don't
safeguard them in the way that we should
consequently we've all had the
unfortunate experience of losing them
locking them inside or leaving them
somewhere and perhaps even had them
taken and we all probably remember that
unsettle feeling the moment we realized
that we weren't able to freely go
anywhere that's why we created Fox vault
so you never feel that way again
has to be a dream or some kind of
nightmare
what was that thing
where did it come from
well I hope I never see it again this
thing goes viral I'm gonna be out of a
job
we had a great time making this video
but in all seriousness I want to thank
all of you who've already given us your
support you provide such amazing
feedback and we're so close to realizing
the Fox vault dream with your
contribution we can make Fox Hall a
reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
