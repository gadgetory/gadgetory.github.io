need mounts you don't need a big selfie
stick you can just stick it up there and
take shots from above or just right in
front and your hands are free to do
whatever photo uses a special micro
suction pad it'll work on walls windows
a pole basically on anything and it's
not a tape so you can stick unstick and
just wipe with water to use again oh
that's pretty cool to wash it wet your
finger like this and wipe carefully you
can feel the dirt rolling off let it dry
and you're good to go even better if you
use a blow dryer a hand dryer all the
grippy features loosen up and the pad
