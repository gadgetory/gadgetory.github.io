experience voice control
from these high-tech devices on the
market I would expect a super engaging
experience then I discover that with a
bunch of cancer I could see this
everyone dreamed about controlling
things with their mind and that's how we
started the next step was to transform
this into a product and that's why we
applied for Cox and came to Shenzhen
China the manufacturing capital of the
world
here we build and build and build until
area area is a tiny gesture controller
designed very specifically for
SmartWatch you wear it you calibrate it
and then you use it with your favorite
market disclosed to the menu and launch

some music or check email or Jarmon Mugg
we worked closely with the spirit of
smartwatches in order to guarantee the
best user experience possible area is a
Bluetooth compatible device so it can be
connected to most of the electronics you
always use we're starting with a set of
essential up to cover the main names and

develop this technology and now we need
your support to start the production

still using the old fashioned way to
measure sizes and distances measuring by
yourself is always difficult you get all
sweaty it's hard to know how to do it
right
either way it can be a waste of time and
effort feeling frustrated and bothered
now you have a better measuring choice
the eye pins spatial ruler from the eye
pin spatial ruler app plug the eye pin
spatial ruler into the iPhone headphone
jack then you can easily measure spatial
dimension of course you can save the
measuring results and also instantly
share them it makes the discussions
between you and your designers or even
your mates easier never again worry
about picking a wrong size of furniture
snap the furniture you lied and get its
size for the IP and spatial ruler app

away
you can edit the same places in
different times and spaces which saves
you time make furnishing easy and with
no more mistakes create lovely and
comfortable living spaces on your own no
matter if you're a designer a housing
agency security a materials key catalog
maker a curator or a builder an AR app
developer or a family member the IP and
spatial ruler is the best assistant so
the coolest thing about Poteau is you
can just stick it anywhere you don't
need mounts you don't need a big selfie
stick you can just stick it up there and
take shots from above or just right in
front and your hands are free to do
whatever photo uses a special micro
suction pad it'll work on walls windows
a pole basically on anything and it's
not a tape so you can stick unstick and
just wipe with water to use again oh
that's pretty cool to wash it wet your
finger like this and wipe carefully you
can feel the dirt rolling off let it dry
and you're good to go even better if you
use a blow dryer a hand dryer all the
grippy features loosen up and the pad
will work good as new for extra
flexibility there's a strong magnet in
there too so that's how photo sticks
