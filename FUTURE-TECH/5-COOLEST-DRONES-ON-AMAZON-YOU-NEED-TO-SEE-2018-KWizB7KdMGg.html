gear so we're out here in El Mirage
California we have the typhoon H and
we're going to show you how to use a
feature called T mode in T mode the
pilot is able to fly the drone
independent of the camera so the
videographer can focus on capturing the
shot it is great for film teams like us
once pad the drone follows the wizard
and you can control the camera with the
st 16 controller very simple let's show
you how to bind it right now
finding the wizard with the typhoon H is
simple turn your st 16 controller on
then power on the drone after this go
into settings once you're in settings
switch from single mode to team mode
when the LED indicator is flashing
yellow this means it's ready to bind
with the wizard to buy and hold the
power button on the wizard for 6 seconds
after this you'll get a solid blue light
on their drone and to beeps this means
the wizard is bound another great
feature about the wizard is it's got a
pressure sensor inside it so what that
means is when you're ascending or
descending the drones altitude will go
with you so having that pressure sensor
is great and another feature that is
just awesome
using your wizard is very simple holding
a vertical controls the altitude and the
you're holding it flat controls the
direction of the drone to change the
position of the drone in Follow Me mode
there's a point to fly feature by simply
holding the center button of the wizard
you can point in any direction hold it
for three seconds it will vibrate let go
it will change the position of the drone
in follow-me mode
and idea we believe that the capturing
process should happen seamlessly just
like the experience itself does PETA is
the world's first transformative drone
that appeals true versatility in a way
that you capture your experience whether
it's aerial and held or mounted PETA
transforms the your needs in a matter of
seconds the action cam module has three
screw holes for universal mounting
changing modes is quick and easy with
modular design that magnetically snaps
and twist to lock optimized for the
first time pilots across all ages PETA
is light and small to take with you
everywhere without adding extra bulk
with our vision recognition technology
to target and follow users capturing
with PETA is as easy as throwing it with
a click of a button
our team has deployed a number of vision
recognition technologies across many
different sectors we have been working
days and nights for the last year and a
half to bring the same video processing
technologies to PETA to create a small
yet powerful autonomous drone that
combines all the pros of previous drones
and action cameras we have completed
development and are now in need of your
help to move on to the manufacturing
stage to shed light on PETA please join
us to make PETA a reality
and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
