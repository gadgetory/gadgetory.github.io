got a lot of this yep your snoring is
putting a damper on things at home and

strokes and heart attacks so you go out
there and try all kinds of anti snore
products and then you meet Nora using
Nora is simple just pick your favorite
pillow put the expander in your
pillowcase tap Nora and go to sleep when
you start snoring
Nora gently moves your head so you stop
before your partner wakes up the science
of it is simple when you fall asleep
your neck and throat muscles relax this
decreases the size of the airway and
causes the vibrations the slight
movement of your head stimulates these
muscles and opens the airway so you can
breathe normally again
the best part is you won't feel a thing
you can sleep in any position or on any
part of the pillow our patent-pending
design is just as effective

make it a delightful addition to your
bedroom the organic shape is inspired by
natural objects and the smooth matte
finish looks great in any setting nor
comes in a beautiful portable bag
equipped with the rechargeable battery
making it easy to use on the go we
created Nora because we were frustrated
with the impractical and expensive
products out there a year of obsessive
designing prototyping and testing has
brought us here the result is unlike any
other snoring solution an elegant device
with the seamless experience now ready
for mass production
Nora less that and more this we can't
wait to bring silent sleep to you
