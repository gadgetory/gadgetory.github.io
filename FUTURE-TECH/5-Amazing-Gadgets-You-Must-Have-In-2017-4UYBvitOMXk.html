doing Facebook live yeah but this cool
new camera called the nympho
so first lap with the key key a lot of
take down home I've got some prepared so
vanilla smell lady Brading some tools
I'm going to add in a little bit of rice
wine vinegar
so the little shoelace yeah there you go
folks
we have to make this at home
hi I'm Friday yes I'm a lock but that
doesn't mean I'm not smart I know that
any second now mom will be home and I'll
unlock the door for as long as she has
her phone with her I can sense it and
grant her access I can also tell when
someone shuts the door so if the kids
forget to lock it when they head out
again I can do it for them
just another way that I keep your home
safe and secure but why stop with your
house I do a great job of looking after
your work studio - keyless access is
perfect for those times do you have your
hands full speaking of things that can
be a handful Bruno wants to go walkies
don't worry you might be at work but I'm
still at home just give me the word and
I'll let the dog-walker in you can share
access with anyone you choose
maybe you're always on the go or maybe
that's dad's excuse for never doing any
repair work himself either way I can
deal with the handyman so don't worry
about waiting around for him
oh and you can revoke his access when
the jobs finished but that was obvious
right of course
I'll notify you whenever someone opens
your door so when the kids get home from
school you'll know that they're safe and
sound I don't want you worrying about
who's in or out I just want to give you
peace of mind well I also want to look
good but I do that anyway but no matter
how fancy I might look I won't mind if
you ignore all my smarts and treat me
like a normal lock I mean it would be a
bit of a waste but hey you're in charge
and did I mention that I'm the smallest
retrofit smartlock in the world
seriously check out my curves but what
really matters is that you can rely on
me to make your life easier and keep
your home more secure I'm smart I'm
reliable I'm safe I'm Friday
you
