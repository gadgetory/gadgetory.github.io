shift it is the world's easiest
controller ever you just need to move
your thumb and then the drone will
follow in the same direction there is no
need for you to think about it
beforehand it is simple and easy you can
play with it 24/7 even while you eat a
sandwich it can be used with only one
hand and still not the best performance
now you have an extra hand available
while flying your drawing
what's more shift is compatible with
other existing drone models
using our application the old drum you
already known is now ready to go
and of course with your free hand you
can even answer the phone at the same
time you can also use the advanced mode
by adding the central T ie extension
there are extra customizable T's for
experts like MTV racers and advanced
camera users
simply put it's for everyone then women
and children and even first-time drug
violence
shift a better solution

we set out to pioneer the future of
robotics we've unlocked the power of
advanced mobile processors that enable
us to run cutting-edge AI algorithms on
it
Quizlet technology we created hover
camera which allows anyone to capture
photos and video from unique
perspectives to use however cameras
various and powered on Flippa opens like
this and you can hold anywhere when you
let go it just hovers automatically we
have a camera you can take 13 megapixel
photos and 4k video we replaced a
traditional gimbal with electronic image
stabilization so that your shots are
always steady other camera is the first
truly autonomous flying camera that
anyone can use and is powered by our
groundbreaking embedded AI technologies
we built a ton of sophisticated AI
algorithms into the small circuit board
it runs a powerful Hong Kong snapdragon
2.3 gigahertz quad-core processor this
enables us to run complex calculations
locally without the need for a remote
server the AI was developed in such a
way that it reduces the learning curve
so anyone can operate it out of the box
that's why we've designed a
revolutionary user experience that
centers around hovering hovering is
actually more difficult than just flying
the reason it hovers so steadily is
because it's running optical flow on its
downwards viewing camera and visual slam
from the front view in camera and that's
how it gauges its own speed and position
at all times
on top of that we're running advanced to
flight control algorithms at 1 kilohertz
it's so intelligent that it follows
people automatically as they move around
it does this without GPS but instead
using real-time facial and body
recognition this is the most compact and
elegantly designed flying camera on the
market it is so small that it could
easily fit into a purse but you wanted
to make sure that this device is safe
we've geared up with the suit of armor
this entire protective enclosure is made
out of the most durable and lightweight
carbon fiber material the radical design
allows users to grab throw and catch
hover camera yet it looks just enough
air to flow through without sacrificing
the ability to hover or fly Tony and I
we both graduated from the Stanford
engineering ph.d program we have about
80 plus people now and a very diverse
background we're fortunate enough to be
surrounded by a team of passionate and
experienced adventurers who share our
vision we're setting new standards for
aerial robotics
pavan camera is always around capturing
those unique moments in reaching your
vision of the world I'm Taylor and this
is snaps the world's first fully
portable 4k flying again lots of quads
of decent quality video but they all
forced you became frustrated choice
tiny toy model digit only stabilization
forces you're compromised on video
quality flight time moon performance or
heavy duty model the big bulky carrying
case I mean we want to go hiking with
this until now you need a dangerous open
blaze in order get good one performance
but a hard test fun with a big flying
lawnmower nearby ever try that open
bladed model I won't recommend it that's
what we built the spaces for cave line
camera fits in a small backpack you can
take it anywhere capture the moments get
important to you the best camera is
always the one you have with you 500
grams it's 20 minutes lifetime and facts
the gimbal stabilized 4k camera we made
a flying camera for capturing the best
stories and ventures that stories
usually have people in them and people
sometimes make mistakes that would have
been a bloody Mac with any other flying
camera there they messes are any fun we
think flying camera should be fun flying
snap with your smartphone means you
always have your controller with you the
smarts of your smartphone lets us make a
lot of the hard things easy like one of
those traumatic shots when the camera
pulls back and orbits around yet we've
worked with a team of directors and
videographers to define those amazing
cinematic shots and make it easy for you
to recreate them without being a
professional director
snap knows exactly where you are which
lets it automatically tracking fly
around you and come back to you snap
works of ios and android phones to sick
dsm controllers or bluetooth game
controllers whatever suits your style or
you cannot pilot snap at all and let it
do the work for you
amazing of the freedom to see anything
and anyone any perspectives any time
without having to think or worry just
have fun and this is just a start we've
got modules going for obstacle avoidance
wildly fast flight speed and unlimited
range with a cellular modem we spent
over two years work an extremely
talented team of engineers designers and
programmers developing the technology to
make this possible we want to show the
world just how easy and mind-blowing
gharial video can be snap is ready for
pre-order now we can't wait to see what
you're going to do with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
