until we need to drink it sure we know
it's healthy but it just doesn't taste
as exciting as all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more of that Chuck hey
and that's a problem a very big problem
so we decided to put some fun into
drinking water with the right cup it's
the world's first ever fruit flavored
cup designed to get people drinking more
water sure it might look simple but it
actually took six years of research and
patented technologies to get where we
are today and we believe it's gonna be a
real game-changer so how does it work
well for starters our brain identifies
flavor using two main senses taste and
smell that's why we inserted innovative
fda-approved fruit scent and flavor
directly into the right cup so when you
drink water from it your nose picks up
the fruity aroma your tongue senses the
hint of a sweet taste and your brain
yells when in fact you're only drinking
natural water but does it work well we
asked ourselves that very same question
so we put the right cup to the test with
our orange flavored prototype whoa okay
Wow
you're kidding me right what's in this
it's not just water it tastes like
something else just water it's crazy
brilliant just brilliant now that we
know that it works let's meet the team
behind the idea for years have been
researching and lecturing about scent
marketing showing how easy it is to
manipulate the brain with smell when I
was 13 I was diagnosed with diabetes and
my doctors told me to drink only water
but I hated the taste that's when I came
up with the idea for the right cup
after years of research and development
we've reached the stage where we need
your support to turn the right cup into
a reality the right cup is great for
anyone who wants to cut down on sugary
drinks and drink more water which is
basically everybody please help us
change lives of millions of people by
supporting our project on IndieGoGo
together we can make a real difference
and turn the world into a better and
healthier place one cup at a time
let's make drinking water fun again
the most important thing to parents is
their children's health and today we
have so much access to information
parents can track their children's
health and lost different ways from last
errant devices but the question is how
do you really hone in on what's most
important fever smart is a real-time
smart thermometer that allows parents to
track their children's temperature using
their smartphone our team ascends a lot
of research and studied what's currently
available on the market and there's
number of key problems with the current
solution conventional thermometers can
be difficult to use uncomfortable for
children and most concerning they only
provide a one type temperature reading
there have been so many technological
advancements but thermometer technology
hasn't changed hundreds of years which
is crazy considering that it's the most
basic indicator of health we identified
this huge problem and knew that there
had to be a better solution so we
created fever smart fever smart has some
amazing features it's wireless
continuous cloud connected and most
importantly notifies parents through our
alert system fever smart is a
preventative solution it allows you to
be proactive and track your child's
temperature as it starts to rise so you
can intervene before there's a serious
health problem throughout the
development process we had children help
us design the device whenever we had a
new generation of the prototype
developed we would send it out to actual
parents to see how feasible it was in
the real world when we came away from
our drawings with fever smart we knew
that it had to be non-invasive very
accurate and provide immediate real-time
data to the parents to provide them
peace of mind and to give them the
comfort that they needed here's how it
works
the fever smart system has three
components the reusable device the
disposable patch and the relay unit the
parent applies the device to the child's
underarm using a disposable patch next
the temperature data is transmitted via
bluetooth to the relay unit the relay
unit then forwards the data onto the
cloud now your child's temperature can
be accessed from anywhere around the
world
using your smart device fever smart is
really great because it's so easy to use
right as you take it out of the box it's
ready to go
you just pop in the battery and connect
it to your smart
not only can you constantly monitor your
children's temperature but you can also
track trends over time as you track the
data with fever smart you can send the
information directly to your
pediatrician which means that they can
help you create better personalized
health care solutions for your children
a device is finalized and ready to go
after two years of hard work we have all
the necessary safety certifications and
we have a beautiful user interface on
our app with your help we can fund the
first round of manufacturing and bring
the first products to market by the end
of 2014 so join us join us join us join
us and help fever smart bring peace of
mind to millions of parents around the
world
