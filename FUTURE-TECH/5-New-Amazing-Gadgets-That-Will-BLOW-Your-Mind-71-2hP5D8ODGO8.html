co-founder at fuel box my name is Dan

home automation is awesome but current
smart home products are but very
expensive and difficult to set up that's
why we created hook is a platform that
connects any radio frequency enabled
device in your home to the internet with
these five-dollar RF outlets you can
already add remote control to any device
in your home but they only work within
range of the remote and with basic
functionality connecting a new device is
incredibly simple just sync your devices
remote with the hook app now I can
control that device from anywhere in the
world
hook is compatible with IFTTT which can
be used to schedule operations of
routine tasks like turning on your
holiday lights at sunset
or turning your entire room into an
alarm clock folks capabilities are
limited only by your imagination you can
create rules that flash your lights when
your bus is nearby notify you if an
appliance is left on or turn off your
router if your daughter is watching too
much Netflix wait come back
Lok is powered by spark i/o and will be
provided with an open API so anyone can
develop for hook and help expand its
capabilities and the best part you only
need one hook for your entire home
regardless of how many devices you are
connecting so we've been working for
over a year now trying to develop this
technology and then get it into a
packaged device that the users gonna
like and that we like ourselves so we
started off with a big board big set of
electronics we added Wi-Fi compatibility
we added a USB hub so we could power it
through USB and then we started adding
things like radio chips that we had make
sure didn't interfere with each other
and then the trick is trying to get that
thing smaller get it more compact and
get it into the right packaging so we
made multiple 3d printed designs each
time we print something fit the
electronics into it put it on a board
look at it and figure out no wait we can
pop these chips off we can moving this
way we can read opt it we could solder
it's smaller we can get this thing more
compact and then in the end we really
came down to a product but it feels nice
looks good
and prototype that we're really proud to
ship hey Kickstarter were the team
behind hook we have been working fairly
hot for a little year to make hook a
reality we've got a great product and
we're very excited to bring it to market
but we need your help with your funding
we can get our molds in our
manufacturing process dialed in and get
hook to production so fair as excited as
via Bacchus shadows and tell your
friends about poop so join us in our
journey to bring affordable home
automation to everyone
