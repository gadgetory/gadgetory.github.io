entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal as
a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
into remote controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it select a surface
to attach it to and then to find all the
things you'd like Nike to do naki can
control a wide variety of devices around
us but the true beauty of our technology
is that what it can do is only limited
by your imagination put one in your
living room or the kitchen or even your
bedroom I mean imagine rolling over in
the morning and tapping a simple pattern
anywhere on your nightstand to snooze
your alarm and start the coffeemaker
without even opening your eyes
you just bought ten more minutes in bed
and you'll definitely want to put one in
your kids bedroom it's exciting to think
of how naki will spark their imagination
as they figure out all kinds of ways to
use it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be
far more reliable and would better reach
than bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day it currently
includes nest Phillips you lifx smart
things IFTTT and more but even if you're
new to the smart technology world you
can still use naki for simple functions
around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
respected our patent-pending technology
uses non acoustic sensors it's able to
distinguish deliberate tap or knock
patterns from random vibrations in the
environment the beauty of our product is
that it makes any regular environment
into a user interface think about the
surfaces around you so many of them
serve one or two purposes add an AA key
to them and you instantly have a hub for
automation we carefully chose every
material and finish Funaki
we've gone through a series of different
tests and prototypes to make sure that
naki blends in in your environment and
also looks beautiful on your surfaces
we're doing our first production runs
here in the USA because it's important
for our entire team to be there on the
ground floor ensuring that we're
manufacturing the best possible product
it's not some far-fetched idea we have
finalized our designs we have beautiful
working prototype and we need to raise
funds to actually get it into production
and immediately start shipping them to
your door we couldn't be more excited
about how this product is going to
change lives and bring joy to people
everywhere
naki accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
things that really matter
tap into the world around you with the
magic of Nike Lucy I'm home welcome home
messages mm-hmm please Lamar go home now
okay
I am sending MOC a message
this is the game tonight yes your
calendar shows a game at 9:00 tonight
okay the reserved a spot for me at the
top house at 8:30 will do
Oh Lucy's gonna rain no the low-pressure
front is passing to the north of us my
brothers
you've already met Lucy but there's so
much more when I tell you about her she
doesn't just listen and talk to you we
gave her an amazing touchscreen and an
HD camera that has facial recognition
that comes in very handy when she is
your personal assistant we've spent a
lot of time developing what we believe
is the best personal home assistant on
the market
nothing comes close Lucy is extremely
well-connected
she has black fire purple cloud
connectivity but also the ZigBee bridge
or other smart home devices that don't
have a fireplace just imagine what we
can do we can control your lighting your
air conditioning your eating the blinds
your security cameras your baby monitors
or turning so you see there's just so
many possibilities so our designing to
you did a great job
Lucy's customizable friend you can
literally choose from beechwood look or
a nice stay steel frame there's a few
choices you'll see them on the website
and it's just beautiful here's for Lucy
you really shines as your personal
assistant and that is by helping you
with your daily routines check your
calendar reminded you of a birthday or
an appointment
have to take your coats you can ask them
to order pizza or make a reservation at
your favorite restaurant
Lucy's everything you can dream up with
your personal offices so not only is
Lucy a great teacher she can show you a
recipe when you're cooking she can show
you a training video something that you
want to learn but she's also really
smart student because she can remember
the favorite foods they like to order
say you want extra anchovies well that's
exactly what we're gonna catch so she
learns a lot of things about you deal
with an anchor which makes her even
better than you
you have this beautiful frame that you
chose and when you're not using Lucy
actively we actually thought to put some
beautiful art in there giving you the
possibility to connect to your favorite
artists or uploading your own photo
gallery on your smartphone to Lucy to
show that Luce can install the numerous
things in your home but can also work
together with the team behind Lucy will
constantly be offering you new features
and services and those updates will be
for free forever if you guys are just as
excited about having your own personal
assistant as we are then we really
appreciate you backing this project
Thank You Lucy I wish you could make me
a drink still working on it
hi I'm Friday yes I'm a lock but that
doesn't mean I'm not smart I know that
any second now mom will be home and I'll
unlock the door for as long as she has
her phone with her I can sense it and
grant her access I can also tell when
someone shuts the door so if the kids
forget to lock it when they head out
again I can do it for them
just another way that I keep your home
safe and secure but why stop with your
house I do a great job of looking after
your work studio - keyless access is
perfect for those times that you have
your hands full speaking of things that
can be a handful Bruno wants to go
walkies don't worry you might be at work
but I'm still at home just give me the
word and I'll let the dog-walker in you
can share access with anyone you choose
maybe you're always on the go or maybe
that's dad's excuse for never doing any
repair work himself either way I can
deal with the handyman so don't worry
about waiting around for him oh and you
can revoke his access when the jobs
finished but that was obvious right of
course I'll notify you whenever someone
opens your door so when the kids get
home from school you'll know that
they're safe and sound
I don't want you worrying about who's in
or out I just want to give you peace of
mind well I also want to look good
thought I do that anyway but no matter
how fancy I might look I won't mind if
you ignore all my smarts and treat me
like a normal Locke I mean it would be a
bit of a waste but hey you're in charge
and did I mention that I'm the smallest
retrofit smartlock in the world
seriously check out my curves but what
really matters is that you can rely on
me to make your life easier and keep
your home more secure I'm smart I'm
reliable I'm safe I'm Friday
measurements are integral to our
everyday lives but they can put us into
risky and tricky situations or require
someone else to help gange those lengthy
distances but here's a change by back by
tech eh indeed now you can get out of
that risky spot
and don't need a helping hand to
determine long distances
vhat measures and not one but two
directions from one press of a button
you can acquire the left-right and total
value at once saving you precious time
and energy on every move and allowing
you to work with greater efficiency by
making you the focal point also your
measurements can be instantly updated to
your smart device with our sketch
application where you can design and
plan for any projects VHA knees
additional functions enable you to use
continuous measuring mode to find mid
points
pythagoras function to reach heights
and calculate the area and volume of any
stance
life made easier
vhat by magpie check we take that extra
step so you don't have to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
