my name is Alex and I believe this is my
third or fourth project on Kickstarter
this is one of the ones that I spent a
lot of time on it and I believe it has
merit
I want to tap into the EDC market which
is everyday carry so I created this
survival multi-tool which I call Nomad
like I said it's a survival multi-tool
and everyday carry it's composed of 3d
printed parts sandwich by a back and
front stainless steel plates that are
laser-cut they're attached all together
with stainless steel rivets to endure
rust and oxidation has many features a
carabiner clip a bottle opener with dual
function it's a bottle opener and a
wrench at the same time it has a compass
it has a blade momentary flashlight for
emergencies ferrocerium rod it has a
split ring to hang keys or any other
things you might want to hang to it on
the other side you'll find a scraper
that slides out the scraper itself it's
a mini tool that has a quarter inch bit
adapter it has three different size not
adapters ranging from small medium and
large
it also can serve as a flathead
screwdriver goes back in place when you
need to start a fire
you basically swivel out your
ferrocerium rod take your scraper out
scrape scrape spark spark and you start
a fire when you're done you close it
turn it around put your key back in
place or scraper and you're done like I
said has a carabiner where you can hang
it in any belt loop backpack or wherever
you want to hang this to it's very
lightweight and this is a very cool
multi-tool as many functions and this is

hi i'm ryan and i'm elias we are part of
the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it cleans to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we've come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travelers wanting an easy way
to wash clothes while on the go it's
also simple to use you simply place in
water add some soap turn on the built-in
timer and walk away 30 minutes later
your clothes are cleaner than ever
before
sonic Stoke is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close
sonic soak is your solution sonic soap
is ready to be shipped just after our
campaign ends we just need you to help
make it happen which means you can have
a cleaner almost anything and
practically no time once we end this
campaign successfully so please help us
bring sonic soap to mass production and
experience clean like never before now
