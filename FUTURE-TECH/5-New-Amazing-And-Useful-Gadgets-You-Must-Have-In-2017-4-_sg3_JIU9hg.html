each morning to a brand new day a day of
balance and wellness we nourish our body
with healthy foods we physically stretch
our bodies in hopes of stretching our
minds everything we do goes back to our
well being but there is one piece we
often tend to neglect from the Wellness
puzzle introducing turbo a simple and
effective addition to your daily routine
before the 19th century toilets were
non-existent people used to squat to
release two thirds of the world actually
still do and for good reason as we
adopted the toilet into our lives we
unknowingly added tension and straining
during bowel movements
studies have shown us the perpendicular
posture brought on by the toilet creates
a kink in the colon which makes it
difficult to go it also makes us
susceptible to a number of other health
issues by elevating your feet that kink
disappears your muscles are able to
relax and your colon is open for quick
and efficient release and that's why we
invented turbo turbo is an elegant yet
affordable solution that makes a great
addition to any bathroom it's sleek
design allows for flexibility and
comfort the unique ramp design makes
using turbo easier for any person of any
size the lower toe area allows you to
easily load your feet then you can
position your feet forward or backward
on the ramp to adjust to a squat that's
just right for you and with turbo
squatting is only the beginning turbo
comes with interchangeable massage
rollers to further increase your comfort
on the toilet not only does it feel good
but it can help with constipation too
your feet have pressure points that can
stimulate your colon when it's time
Oh massaging with turbo also helps with
blood circulation which can improve your
energy levels to get you through the day

I don't care how old you are the zero
blaster smoke ring launcher is awesome
and it's even more awesome if you have a
friend to do battle with I'll be right
back
the zoo blaster fires harmless smoke
Ling's made from a water-based non-toxic
superfluid the vortex rings range from
two to four inches in diameter and can
fire up to 12 feet there's a ray gun
sound feature you can turn on and off as
well as a function to adjust the speed
at which it fires vapor rings timeout so
how does this thing actually work the
zero blaster creates an area of low
pressure and when that area has air flow
surrounding it the smoky vortex forms
okay cover me I'm going in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
