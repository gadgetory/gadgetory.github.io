attachment designed to be the perfect
complement to your streaming remote
finally you can ditch your TV remote and
power up and control volume with one
unit cyclic is available for the
following streaming devices Apple TV
amazon firetv stick amazon firetv google
nexus player and roku my family ditched
our cable and we use our Roku to stream
all of our content so when I sit down to
watch TV I use my TV remote to turn on
the TV and select the input then I use
my Roku remote to control my apps and
last I use my sound bar remote to turn
up and down the volume
none of the string remotes can control
the basic TV functions and that's why I
created cyclic cyclic is a slim
universal remote that snaps on to your
streaming remote cyclic uses IR learning
technology that can be programmed using
multiple devices so say you want to
power up using your TV remote but you
want your volume button to control your
sound bar or receiver no problem you can
program anything that uses IR technology
as a button on side click the entire
setup takes only minutes we have three
and six year old daughters who love
watching shows on Netflix independently
but juggling multiple remotes is too
challenging for them parents will love
that side click makes accessing TV
faster and easier for kids cyclic
streamlines your streaming experience
the ability to ditch your old remotes
and use one unit for all controls will
make cyclic a must-have accessory for
streamers cyclic is an affordable
solution it's not an expensive universal
remote that costs more than the
streaming unit itself and because cyclic
adapts to any streaming device using a
clip system you don't have to worry
about it becoming obsolete should you
decide to upgrade your streaming device
you would simply purchase a new
inexpensive adapter clip and your cyclic
would easily transfer to your new device
your support will help us fund the
initial production run in tooling costs
please help us get to our goal so we can
make side click become a reality thank
you

if you're sitting with poor posture
you're not just creating chronic back
pain you're cutting off circulation of
blood lymphatic fluid restricting
digestion and creating a true health
problem for yourself the Center for
Disease Control confirms it by calling
sitting the new smoking you need to sit
correctly and you need the right chair
to do it for you introducing the back
strong chair the revolutionary
advancement to sitting in health while
making yourself stronger this novel
design was created by renowned doctor
two celebrities and the Los Angeles
Clippers Denis colonnello DC of Beverly
Hills and Jim Grove industrial designer
whose reputation at BMW design works and
la design are legendary the back strong
chair was developed with your actual
body mechanics in mind you will sit in
comfort you will sit in motion and you
will virtually eliminate your ability to
slouch hunched and sit wrong the back
strong chair instantly addresses every
issue first sit and it saddle hugs your
pelvis and gives you lower thoracic
support fitting to your physiology that
gets your hips and pelvis forward
upright and in an athletic position
putting the natural S curve in the spine
for natural support second the
form-fitted back is contoured for an
ideal supported sitting position to keep
that posture correct third is where the
unique sit and motion technology takes
over most chairs have stagnant saddles
attached to the post under the chair the
back strong saddle actually hangs from
the arms of the chair and moves with you
like a swing it attaches precisely in a
location that mimics the ball and socket
of your hip joint that allows movement
that means you hunch forward and the
chair reacts organ amelie putting a
gentle supportive pressure in the small
of your back and the chair assists with
your posture lean back the support
increases again holding that nice
s-curve lean forward and the support
follows you
it even assists you with a supportive
push when you get up
being able to naturally move your pelvis
torso and back while you sit with great
posture encourages muscular stretching
core strength lymphatic movement blood
flow the result less back pain more
flexibility and feeling great when you
get up without the stiffness when you
sit better you live better hi I'm Dennis
colonnello and I created the back strong
chair my patients in Beverly Hills
wanted the besties so it frustrated me
to send someone home fully adjusted out
of pain and then just a week later see
them all screwed up again I knew their
office chair was the culprit your body
was not designed to sit all day thanks
to modern work you have to to be healthy
your body needs dynamic movement for
your heart your digestion for your nerve
treks for your skeleton for your health
this is precisely what the back strong
chair does I work as a team chiropractor
in the NBA as part of my practice this
chair places you in a natural athletic
position of strength of engaging your
core legs glutes back and abs it's
active sitting you'll feel to develop it
I let a team that went through literally
hundreds of designs dozens of prototypes
and a myriad of materials we got this
right I guarantee you sit in it once and
you'll sit in it for life the back
strong instantly engages your core
making you sit stronger what I didn't
know when I started this was how much it
would cost to develop a chair for all of
us who sit more than we wish we had to
now I need your help to bring it to the
world I put together a great team found
a great factory and put all the elements
in place we are ready to make the molds
buy the raw materials and start making
chairs I want to make sure that every
single person can afford to have a back
strong chair in their office and home
through this crowdfunding raise you'll
help us finish the tooling of this
design we'll be able to deliver the
chair to you for a fraction of what we
thought it would cost and get super
premium quality that is
to last I was shocked by how much people
markup furniture we are not doing that
we want every touch in America in this
chair in fact I told my team if we could
not sell this chair for the value of two
visits to my office we wouldn't do it

ready to try it we will deliver the
world's most comfortable supportive and
healthiest chair to you I look forward
