hey Kickstarter's two years ago you made
history by backing the splash drone the
first waterproof drone that can float
and take pictures and video underwater
into the air today we're back on
Kickstarter to bring you the much more
advanced splash drone three auto and
fishermen edition the splash drone is
now modular and comes with a 4k
detachable camera and a stronger payload
release system to deliver your bader
payload over water if you have a drone
you know what it feels like to fly over
water and if you still don't you've
probably seen video of the thousands of
drones that have crashed in the water to
never be seen again our goal is to
change the way you fly by removing the
fear of flying over water or even land
on it the new camera captures 4k video
at 25 frames per second and 14 megapixel
pictures
the gimbal has stronger motors for
better stable video underwater and in
the air
it also has a quick-release clip that
allows you to store your splash drone in
this redesigned compact travel case
we've also redesigned the flight
controller to make it more stable and
repositioned the GPS to provide more
accurate location hold while still
giving you features that make flying
easier than ever
features like return to home at the flip
of a switch Waypoint navigation Follow
Me mode and tap to fly to a specific
location on the map all features that
can be accessed on the swell pro mobile
app available for Android and iOS
devices the splash drone fishermen
Edition now comes with a completely
redesigned payload release system that's
equipped with a high-resolution fixed
camera that allows you to see where
you're dropping your bait or fly best by
redesigning the remote control from the
ground up we were able to integrate a
high-resolution video monitor with an
on-screen display that shows the health
of the splash drone and vibrates to
alert you when the battery's running low
the entire propulsion system has also
been re-engineered for more stable and
longer flights and the quick lock
propellers allow it to fly it up to 35
miles an hour today we're coming back to
Kickstarter and hope that you can help
us continue the dream of delivering the
best splash drone yet thanks
