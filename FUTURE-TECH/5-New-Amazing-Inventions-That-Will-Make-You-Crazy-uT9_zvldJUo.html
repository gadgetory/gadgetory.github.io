glance but it's not like any mirror I've
ever seen when I look into other mirrors
all I see is a reflection I see today
but the truth is so much more than that
naked shows me my truth my truth is
sweat early mornings
one more rep
one more mile one more second I'm
stronger than I think I can go further
than I thought
the honest naked truth is that what I
look like today is not a moment frozen
in time my body is the reflection of my
journey my choices
that's where naked helps me see my true
self naked is a 3d fitness tracker that
keeps me motivated by showing me my
progress I can instantly get my exact
measurements body fat percentage and
weight and with heat maps of muscle gain
and fat loss side-by-side comparisons
and time-lapse of my body's changes I
know where I am where I'm going and how
to get there
I'm on a journey to become my best self
this is me naked our couples trying to
conceive women's basal body temperature
is a key indicator fertility basal
temperature is the lowest temperature
your body reaches while resting and the
differences over the course of the
ovarian cycle reveal when your most
fertile in the past tracking your basal
temperature has been a challenge many
women find it frustrating and tiring we
want it to make the process of tracking
BBT data seamless so we created Yo no Yo
no is a revolutionary patent-pending
wearable thermometer it measures and
records your core body temperature while
you sleep giving your true basal
temperature meaning that the data is
more accurate than any other method
unlike underarm sensors which can easily
be affected by ambient temperature and
other external factors
Yano creates an enclosed and controlled
environment in the ear canal preventing
external factors from affecting the
measurement it's designed by top human
factor designers with comfort in mind
soft silicone surrounds the exterior so
the device will fit snugly in your ear
without feeling invasive Yano is left
right indifferent you can sleep on the
ear wearing Yano without feeling it Yano
doesn't transmit data during your sleep
to protect you from emissions in the
morning the data will conveniently sync
with your phone where the user-friendly
Yano app will keep a running log of your
ovulation calendar you don't even need
to think about it if you are traveling
take Yona with a base station and you
don't have to worry about the battery
for up to a week the app and algorithm
interprets your ovulation cycle and
predicts when you're most likely to
conceive with Yo no tracking your
fertility is as natural as your desire
to be a mother
women find it very challenging to
the basal body temperature they have to
measure it exactly the same time every
day you know is a very convenient device
you simply place the device in your ear
you go to sleep you wake up and you take
it out all the data is automatically
collected in the cloud for you the you
know product has many benefits you can
not only use it to detect your basal
body temperature and predict your
ovulation but you can also use it to
understand your hormonal health and use
it for family planning
Yano is a company that is founded by
female entrepreneurs these women know
and really care about female health when
I was trying to get pregnant couple of
years ago I found the process very
stressful and I found collecting basal
temperature data is very difficult and
frustrating so I thought about
leveraging the latest most innovative
wearable technology to make the process
easier and more convenient take the next
step towards building your family and
have Yano start tracking your fertility

hi I'm Jim Joe I'm here to introduce you
the next gem bracelet element element is
the first jewelry that blends the latest
technology with your own unique style I
grew up in China and have lived here in
the US one thing I noticed that girls in
China and girls in the US have so much
in common
it's hard to find an accessory can match
all our outfits we can never find our
phone we don't want to be rude and take
calls during a date or meeting but what
if it's an emergency combining both
function and fashion for many situations
we invented elegant a stylish bracelet
for women all over the world we've
brought together a top team of designers
and engineers with drawn inspiration
from Native American jewelry
impressionist paintings and new
materials from top labs el-amin combines
one of the smallest sensor and chip
boards a rainbow of LEDs with a special
ivory polymer surface and copper band
need to match their gorgeous dress take
a picture with the app and elements
lights will create the perfect color
match you can even design your own
patterns
can't find your phone just rubbed
element its sensors and Bluetooth
technology will set your phone off don't
want to miss an important call or text
message element and let you know and
even display customized designs
depending on who it is
we're a team of creative free-spirited
people we've put a lot of love and
effort in developing the device and we
need your help to take it to production
don't miss out
join us and be the first to express her
style with element did you know the
women are four times more likely than
men to say that recent sex was
unpleasurable in fact studies have shown
that men are twice as likely to have an
orgasm during sex than their partners we
call this the pleasure gap and we're out
to fix it eva is the first hands-free
strap free non-intrusive patrol vibrator
which a woman can wear during sex
Eva's unique design features dynamic
wings which tuck under the labia
allowing the vibrator to stay on top of
the clitoris without getting the way of
penetration research shows the two most
important contributors to women's
pleasure and climax are physical contact
like kissing and touching and control
simulation 70% of women knee control
simulation to orgasm but most vibrators
are distracting or creative barrier
during sex between the partners because
even small hands-free and completely
external it allows you and your partner
to keep the focus on each other
the problem with holding a vibrator
during sex is that it can really get in
the way and detract from the experience
this was just not obtrusive at all it
was like as far as he could tell there
was nothing you know there was nothing
in his way I definitely noticed when
she's enjoying herself more and I get a
lot of pleasure out of that I didn't
have to think about holding it down you
know I could focus on my partner and
doing stuff with my partner while also
having that sensation at Dame products
our missions create phenomenal sex toys
the study of sex has been Alex's
lifelong passion and I'm an established
mechanical engineer who decided if I
want better sex toys
I guess it'd better making myself with
our powers combined we think we have a
unique opportunity to bring you an
original sex toys but fit the real needs
of women and the people they have sex
with Eva doesn't work like anything else
in the market so it doesn't look like
anything else we use our fleet of 3d
printers to be able to iterate quickly
on form and get a lot of user feedback
to get Eva to the shape fit and strength
that it is today
Engineering Eva's wings was an
interesting challenge because they have
to be flexible enough to fit a range of
women and arrange positions but also
sturdy enough to hold a vibrator in
place we selected a small motor with a
powerful kick then gave it three very
distinct speeds from gentle to almost
imitating Eva sits in the right place
the vibration is always comfortable if I
had this product I think I would
probably wear it all the time
we believe that innovative designs
commit to better sex and happier couples
that's why we're so excited to bring you
Eva your support will allow us to order
tooling in our first round of production
any additional funds will enable us to
grow as a company in a brand to bring
you even more awesome products we're
just trying to make the world a happier
