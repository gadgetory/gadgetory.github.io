hello again navdy not this roud found -
early bird cafe you and me we're busy
people and being busy means checking
your phone even when you're not supposed
to even when you're on the road but now
there's Navi hold on we gotta get this
Katy talk to me hey Adam quick reminder
first thing today about coffee with
Connie and Greg at the earlybird already

Rome fell automatically rerouting to
save 10 minute perfect everything this
way before
let's switch to Nabi - see what's so
brilliant about Navitus display is
focused in the distance so your eyes are
never off the road it's also 40 times
brighter than your smartphone it dims
automatically so it's you'd be the speed
day or nurse in fact it was sorry going
to take coaching to Greg and I actually
want to do boy cafe out on 60 to smiley
face Oh awesome
luckily roids is one of my favorites
navdy uses Google Maps and built-in
offline maps you'll never get lost like
out here in the desert and it's
connected to your car which means that
oh my god rerouting to nearest gas
station sex Connie

don't you hate having a flat tire when
you are about to rush for an urgent
appointment
imagine fixing a flat tire in a deserted
area meet Provo tire the most advanced
tire pressure monitoring system Pro Bowl
tire visitors TPMS to use Bluetooth
low-energy Fobo tire comes with a three
level alert calling you when the tire is
merely under inflated or if it is
dangerous to continue driving
bow-bow tire alerts you of a tire leap

important appointment

cross pair technology and it's great for
families no matter who is using the car
beau-beau tire is intuitively designed
for quick and easy installation

future and notification when the sensor
is missing it monitors your car tires
continuously 24 hours every day giving
you and your family peace of mind for a
safe and comfortable ride Fobo tire
monitors for you so that you can enjoy
the journey
imagine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better I use the flick app to set it up
and then I can sick click wherever I
want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so we can use it when I'm not
around the flick isn't just for your
house you can stick your flicks anywhere
like in your car or on your bike
and
it's really cool
your destination is on the left
and you can clip your flicks it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut me me me me me

this the flick can be so much more than
just a shortcut to your phone it can be
integrated with lots of different
services beyond your devices check this
one out

want everything to just take care of
itself
Shh movie starting
another great feature flick that it can
be used as a safety device with just a
push of a button you can send live
updates with your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
