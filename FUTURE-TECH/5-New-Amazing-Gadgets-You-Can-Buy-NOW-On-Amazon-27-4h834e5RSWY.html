today we're going to talk about the
technology behind the mega vers
antigravity case and why ours is better
than the competition
the amazing feature that allows you to
stick your mega vers anti-gravity case
to smooth flat surfaces is the Nano
suction material it's comprised of
millions of tiny suction cups if you
look closely you can see them here when
I press down and release a lot of people
ask why mega tiny antigravity cases work
so much better than all the cheap
knockoffs on the market well it's simple
really
quality when we invented the antigravity
case we tested over 50 different types
of nano suction material from all over
the world after hundreds of hours of
testing we chose to enter into an
exclusive partnership with a Japanese
manufacturer that had superior premium
material this was certainly not the
least expensive option but we chose
quality and we stand behind it we also
include for plain backing plates that
perfectly match the finish of your
iPhone and protect the Nano suction
material when not in use plus you can
purchase the optional wallet mirror or
bottle opener mega back plates with more
coming soon

connecting to a charger it's the sound
of relief knowing you are still
connected to the world connecting and
disconnecting your phone from a charger
should be a simple seamless task but it
isn't we have all been there
frustrated at our cables for any number
of reasons the fight game looks it's
becoming smaller they haven't evolved to
become any easier to connect until now
presenting the future of USB cables ASAP
Connect featuring rare-earth neodymium
magnets with 18 carat gold plating ASAP
Connect will change the way you interact
with your USB devices forever
featuring the world's first reversible
cable on both the phone end and charger
end it works by inserting the tip to the
phone and the cable magnetizes onto the
tip instantly meaning you can
effortlessly connect when you only have
one hand free or in a hurry to head out
or even in the dark
you no longer have to worry about your
devices getting damaged ASAP connect
even helps you retreat your phone from
hard-to-reach places we've designed to
test one for micro USB devices such as
Android phones mini cameras and speakers
the other is for Apple products we've
removed the weakness of your traditional
Apple lightning connector tip which
snaps off easily by combining the tip
and base into one piece we call this the
Alpha connector one of the engineering
hurdles in designing ASAP Connect was
its compact size by condensing the
technology down to the size of a
fingertip we're able to make sure that
it's compatible with all phone cases in
creating a new standard for USB cables
we have performed the most stringent
quality control tests combined with
superior materials to really challenge
the users expectations of what a
state-of-the-art USB cable should be
we've spent the past two years working
closely with one of the world's largest
USB cable manufacturers we're a team of
disruptors from Sydney to LA we believe
that users should be the creators of
products not large corporations seeking
profit over practicality we've created
the final prototypes and delivered
samples to dozens of major tech
publications worldwide through your help
combined with the magic of IndieGoGo we
hope to bring ASAP connect to life and
unleash the future of USB cables today
