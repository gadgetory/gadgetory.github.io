from UC Berkeley and I am the co-founder
of accent accent where is a company that
makes innovative headphones that you
haven't seen before I came up with idea
wild goat but I was never able to turn
into a reality
fortunately I met my best friend
Victoria and she was able to help me
with a lot of the things that I could
accomplish by myself so we came up with
the idea for the name for accent where
when we were actually just on Facebook
and we were chatting with a bunch of our
friends and we were like hey guys let's
think of a good name that would be
fitting for this new company and we're
just throwing ideas back and forth and
finally someone said oh you know what
what about accent wear and we're like
you know what sounds pretty good first I
came up with a few sketches I drew them
on people's had to get idea of how they
were looked I tried all different colors
different designs there's a great lab at
UC Berkeley and we just got a fellowship
at the Innovation Lab and we would go in
every week and we would take her around
and we just put things online finally
got a design that I'm happy with I
started doing a 3d model of it I have a
physical model to try on people one of
the things that we ended up changing
through feedback from our our fans on
Facebook was that they wanted bigger
cans they wanted it over the year
instead of on the year so we changed
that because a lot of people were
requesting that each new prototype the
the headphones get closer and closer to
what we envisioned so these are the
headphones accent or accent and the
headband and all the plastic parts are
made of ABS which is a recyclable
material so it is environmentally
friendly that way these are the LED
lights that are that show up that would
be the color that you choose we're going
to have a couple of options these are
the external speakers so you can share
music with your friends we're really
excited to make these a reality and to
take these from the prototyping stage to
the final product we really hope that
you'll support us and our endeavor
please back us up on our campaign and
help us turn this into a reality thank
