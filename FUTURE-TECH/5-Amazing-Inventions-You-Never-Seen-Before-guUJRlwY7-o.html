RV to your home so this started about a
year ago where we had to measure the
contours of an organic surface turns out
that's a very hard problem the only
available solution cost twenty thousand
dollars and that that's ridiculous
so we set out to build around we looked
at what was available out there at the
intersection of computer vision and
service measurement and we couldn't find
a single solution that was compelling
3d scanners have a precise force 10 mm
bolts in the ones are affordable 1 mm
today that
we're only just beginning to explore the
possibilities of capturing the world in
3d 3d printing is an amazing tool it
converts a digital file into a physical
object some call it an industrial
revolution the eora 3d scanners does the
exact opposite of the 3d print it lets
artists makers and designers captured
objects and surfaces and turn them into
high-quality 3d models and use them as
part of the creative problem we knew we
had to use a smart phone model phones
are simply amazing we use them to take
pictures and videos update social media
even for gaming the euro 3d scanner is
powered entirely by your smartphone
using it is easy just open the app and
press scan it'll automatically adjust
focus and exposure and drive a green
laser to scan your object as it sweeps
we take over 1,000 photos and analyze
them in real time to give you a 3d model
a typical scan takes three to five
minutes and gives you your full color
mesh with up to 8 million points with a
range of 1 meter you can capture objects
big as well
accurate in less than 100 microns
that's the thickness of a single sheet
of paper
we're engineering the scanner we had one
objective in mind
precision all that's possible thanks to
a design that's both beautiful and
machined from a solid block of aluminium
with over 35 million operations we've
designed it to be both robust and
precise the light ring gives you quick
visual feedback and the adjustable knob
that to secure any model smart run the
green laser lets you scan in any
lighting conditions as most cameras are
twice as sensitive to green than any
other color for watertight models we
also design a Bluetooth turntable it
will sync to your scanner and rotate
your object to make sure you get every
area we've meticulously designed every
aspect of the hardware and they've
tested seven different order types we've
put together a great team and we've
lined up several manufactures now we
need you to help us put this together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
