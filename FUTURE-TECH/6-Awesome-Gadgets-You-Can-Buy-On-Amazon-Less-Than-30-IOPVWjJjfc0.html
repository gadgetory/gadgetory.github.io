I have long been fascinated by the idea
of letters being seen as things abstract
forms of something bigger what if I told
you that letters have arms and legs eyes
and ears a spine and even shoulders is
remarkable how many comparisons exist
between typography and human anatomy the
Garamond corpus alphabet was created by
me pure and Johansson for anyone wishing
to dig deeper into the world of
typography or maybe you just want to
hang something that is beautifully
crafted on your wall my hope is that
this project will change the way you
think about typography and teach you
about the anatomy of our Latin letters
screen printing 26 individual prints is
expensive due to the printing starting
costs that's why we turn to Kickstarter
to help fund the starting cost for
printing logistics and packaging so we
can get this out to the world by backing
us you will be the first to get the
posters in your hands you can choose
from either the 100 x 70 centimetres
full alphabet posters or get individual
letters printed on high-quality a4 i
