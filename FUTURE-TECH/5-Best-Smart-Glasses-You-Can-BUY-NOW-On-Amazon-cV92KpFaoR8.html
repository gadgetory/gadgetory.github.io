hallo geeky uncomfortable and

you
you
now tired of preparing kids for
yesterday
you're always preparing kids for this
world that didn't really exist anymore
and it wasn't going to exist when they
graduated and I wanted to get my kids to
the point where they could actually
build the future we've seen a
fundamental shift already in how a lot
of educational resources are being
delivered we've seen a shift from print
books through to ebooks and I think the
next evolution of that is from books to
mixed reality as I started preparing my
lectures and thinking how I'm going to
communicate this to the students one
thing I wished is I had a 3d chalkboard
you actually have all these tools that
allow students to generate content for
other students which means that you
could have students that are subject
matter experts informing the development
of experiences to help teach content
that they're learning about their other
classes and that's just amazing
with Holland our idea for an app which
if you didn't have access all the
attachments you can't learn them I've
been able to interact with something is
what makes you a member I'm a visual
learner I'm someone who learns by
experience as opposed to reading out of
a book and so having the hololens put
that visual in front of you makes things
much easier we could use mixed reality
for agriculture science class geography
mass would be a big one
that provides a much more engaging
experience for students and that the
ultimate goal for a teacher is to engage
the students and have them learning
in this video we'll give you a quick
tour of jets main features then we'll
show you how to set things up to make
sure you have the best experience before
you get started with jet a few key
