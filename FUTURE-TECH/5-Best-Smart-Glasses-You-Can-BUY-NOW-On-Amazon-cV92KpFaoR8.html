away
hallo geeky uncomfortable and
distracting and having a camera stuck to
your face it's kind of creepy
introducing the world's first pair of
smart glasses that match your lifestyle
and
regular earphones transmit sound through
the air but views bone conduction
speakers transmitted through vibrations
send directly to your inner ear only you
can hear it hi Judy
let's get today started bone conduction
lets you stay aware of your surroundings
even as you enjoy your music view is
built for people who use prescription
glasses sunglasses and even style
friends at an ultra-light 28 grams it
won't weigh you down you talk to your
phone via bluetooth with the app you can
perform a range of different tabs
without checking your phone like take a
call hands-free you have a call from
Leslie hey Leslie what's going on get
directions in few hundred feet turn left
on 10th Street
or control your music you is designed
for work and play it has a
water-resistant housing and built-in
activity tracking you ran six thousand
steps today and burned three hundred and
fifty calories nice job you can set
friendly reminders hey going you've been

two designs classic and trendy with its
easy-to-use charging case use batteries
last bucks is 100 smart glasses that fit
your lifestyle and your look say hello
you
you
now tired of preparing kids for
yesterday
you're always preparing kids for this
world that didn't really exist anymore
and it wasn't going to exist when they
graduated and I wanted to get my kids to
the point where they could actually
build the future we've seen a
fundamental shift already in how a lot
of educational resources are being
delivered we've seen a shift from print
books through to ebooks and I think the
next evolution of that is from books to
mixed reality as I started preparing my
lectures and thinking how I'm going to
communicate this to the students one
thing I wished is I had a 3d chalkboard
you actually have all these tools that
allow students to generate content for
other students which means that you
could have students that are subject
matter experts informing the development
of experiences to help teach content
that they're learning about their other
classes and that's just amazing
with Holland our idea for an app which
if you didn't have access all the
attachments you can't learn them I've
been able to interact with something is
what makes you a member I'm a visual
learner I'm someone who learns by
experience as opposed to reading out of
a book and so having the hololens put
that visual in front of you makes things
much easier we could use mixed reality
for agriculture science class geography
mass would be a big one
that provides a much more engaging
experience for students and that the
ultimate goal for a teacher is to engage
the students and have them learning
in this video we'll give you a quick
tour of jets main features then we'll
show you how to set things up to make
sure you have the best experience before
you get started with jet a few key
things should be highlighted the engine
features the high resolution display
that sits just below your right eye
the touchpad is used to navigate through
Jets dashboard both forward and back and
up and down the rocker button underneath
combines select and back functions the
back function also doubles as an on/off
switch when held down the camera is
located at the front of the engine at
the back of the engine is a USB port
through which jet can be charged and
connected to your computer when
connected to a PC or Mac Jack can be
managed through engage our web
application engage lets you access and
share your activities it also lets you
customize dashboard views and download
maps featured apps and software updates
get the engage app for iOS and Android
to access and share your activities on
the go then gauge app also allows jet to
track your friends and display call and
SMS notifications in real time
jet was designed for maximum comfort and
fit with adjustable ear stems as well as
the two axis nose piece adjust you to
your comfort in to ensure jet stays
securely in place during your activity
next remove the battery protection tab
you're now ready to use jet the white
LED light lights up when jet is powered
on you should see the display just below
your right eye make sure the display is
centered in your viewing window by using
the joystick underneath push in the
joystick then pivot left and right and
back and forth if needed the nosepiece
can be retuned for final adjustments
you're now ready to navigate through
Jeff's menus watch our other videos to
