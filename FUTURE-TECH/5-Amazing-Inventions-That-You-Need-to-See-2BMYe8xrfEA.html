distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation
why isn't there a single tool that lets
us measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and it worked beigel
has three different modes string modes
wheel mode and remote mug spring mode is
great for measuring straight lines
curves and around corner wheel mode lets
you measure irregular or odd shaped
objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice description
just take your measurement push the save
button and then tag a voice memo to it
toast a few to later when you're done
bangle will send your measurements to
bagels mobile app via bluetooth this
mobile application lets you review your
saved measurements and share them with
your friends bagel is precise it uses
our patented technology to make sure you
always get an accurate measurement also
bagel has an easy-to-read digital
display that's viewable in most lighting
conditions in the past few years old
also measuring devices have become
smarter and made our live feature smart
scale not thermometers and even
smartwatches thought when it comes to
measuring side we still use a tape
measure which is more than a century old
why don't innovate the way we measure
size so we created bagel a smartie

creating bagel our team works night and
