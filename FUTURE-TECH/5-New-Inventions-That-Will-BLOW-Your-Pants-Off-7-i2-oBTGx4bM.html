love my gear I love the scratches
bruises and stories my gear carries I
love knowing how many clicks I need from
each lens for the perfect exposure my
gear is irreplaceable that's why I
created dear I see I had a nightmare
shoot where I didn't take my macro lens
and ended up losing a memory card full
of great pictures I'll never capture
again that's when I realized there had
to be a better way to manage my gear I
partnered up with yuliya she's a super
smart engineer together we created gear
I your gears commander-in-chief gear is
a small device that stays in your back
uses RFID to scan your bathroom inside
and make sure all your gears their UI
tells you if all your beers with you and
if not what's missing okay something is
missing here I helps you locate it and
it's not just about what's missing it's
also about packing light and only taking
what you really meet in the gear I app
you can create lists with equipment you
need for different types of shooting
dates and gear I will also tell you if
there's something in your bag you won't
be using today we chose to use RFID
stickers and tags because there's no
need to charge them in they last for
years they're also super affordable and
come in many shapes and sizes so you can
tag all of your gear all of it we've
created gear I for photographers but
it's really for anyone who cares about
their equipment from sound engineers to
make up artist and even travelers or
parents gear eyes the solution for any
worried mind pack like keep track of
your gear don't spend money on we buying
it and don't worry that's what we arise
about so if you care for your gear as
much as we do help us fund Iraq let's
take care of our gear as much as our
gear takes care of us
gear I
you
Oh

Oh
we live in a world where one value is
prized above all of us the freedom
freedom to speak we freedom to move
freedom to live that's what allows us to
chart our own course to be who we are
and to determine our own way when you
think about the internet why should it
be any different shouldn't technology
make us more free in today's digital
world you might think that your cloud
service gives you freedom but the big
print giveth and the small print take it
away whether you know it or not our
search for convenience has led us to
give up certain freedoms feels like
ownership privacy permission
when it comes to cloud services we've
essentially uploaded all of our
belongings to someone else's computer so
that person or business could then turn
around and rent those things back to us
all for a month of fee our own stuff
stuff that we paid for why are we okay
with that and you're not that's what
dapper comes in we want to help you take
back what's being lost our moments our
memories the music that shaped our lives
we want to help take back the Paladin
shoes how when and where our digital
lives unfold it's why we created cloud
bye dad if the first personal home cloud
that gives you back the keys no more
renting no more contracts no more using
your data to size them because we
believe convenience shouldn't come
particularly
ready to take back their digital life
joy come the master of your command
