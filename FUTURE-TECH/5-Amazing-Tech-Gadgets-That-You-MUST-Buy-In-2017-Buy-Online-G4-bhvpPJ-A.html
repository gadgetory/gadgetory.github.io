experience
but there's one problem that all
cyclists share and that is navigation we
are very active cyclists ourselves and
we've often experienced how using your
phone while cycling is both awkward and
sometimes even dangerous and having
headphones in your ears telling you
where to go just makes you lose some of
the tens of freedom that cycling
normally give that is how the idea of
high fare was born we wanted to create
the simple affordable and easy to use
product that will help find your way to
the feeling I suppose like a magic
compass but instead of pointing north it
points to your final destination in that
way you are free to choose your own
routes to the table
just open the app set your location and
attach Hydra to your bike
the LEDs of the outer circle show you
the direction and the central LED
indicates the distance to your goal
so now you can find your own way through
the city without being in danger of
getting lost and who knows what amazing
places and experiences you can find by
not choosing the route mode 7 Heiser is
made out of machined aluminum making it
sturdy and waterproof and when we are
not using the device you can simply hide
the rubber bands within the device and
put it in your pocket that way you can
always bring it with you be it to find a
new restaurant after work or to discover
when cycling abroad
if you have a day where you feel more
like sticking to the main road I'll of
course also offer turn-by-turn
navigation we have a spend the last year
developing the simplest possible product
to find your way through the city and
now we're very happy to have a working
prototype we need your help to develop
the first production run so please
support our campaign and make sure you
will be one of the first owners of this
magical compass that will change the way
you navigate the 54 Evan
