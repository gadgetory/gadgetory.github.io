not inhale to prospect either party or
mind think about this issue we came up
with an idea that there should be a more
positive interactive device for children
introducing the agar AR projector it is
our belief that grid idea come from grid
camera such as brick Nvidia and this
camera should be durable cute in all
this and the nurture a child's
imagination this is our agar it looks
like an egg but your child it could be a
monster or at first a monster and now a
pretty girl and before it was a pretty
girl by in Raritan it's a boy although
at first it may seem like just a toy we
have developed this way to preserve a
child's innocence
agar was built with all consideration
for the whole children such as knowing
that children are naturally sensitive to
light so we have scared projection
brightness down to 100 Loomis to ensure
a child's comfort and safety

system which automatically adjust its
brightness depending on its surrounding

easy to operate with our safe contact
