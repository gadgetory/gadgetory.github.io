all of us getting your house broken into
sucks it's not just stuff to use but
because your home feels violated what
you want to keep it from happening in
the first place that's why we created
Cunha help you prevent break-ins
this is Cunha Cunha is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you you can see and talk to them
on your smartphone hey could you leave
the package out front we're a little bit
the best way to actively prevent
break-ins most burglaries are crimes of
opportunity the burglars were actually
knocking on your door to see if you're
home and when they realize you're not
home they'll attempt to enter your house
keeping them outside is the most
important thing you can do and koona
allows you to do you can deter burglars
by talking to them or setting off from
his alarm yeah no thanks believe and all
this happens when they're still outside
before they even try to break it making
your home safer shouldn't be a chore for
one of these you have to climb in the
Attic run wires drill holes it's a pain
and it's not cheap that's why we built
Kona into an outdoor light just replace
your old light fixture and use your
existing wiring connect to another Wi-Fi
and you're done it'll take 15 minutes do
we want color to look good no matter
where it is so we're making it in three
different styles to match your house you
can put kuna anywhere front door back
door even the garage to watch your car
oh and your light get smarter too you
can control it with the kikuna app turn
it on turn it off set a schedule or just
let it turn on automatically when it
gets dark when there's a person you only
want to get alerts that matter
kuna ignores trees and small animals and
it recognizes people's behaviors so you
don't want to know every time your
spouse goes out jogging
you can tell kuna to alert you only for
visitors waiting at the door
and it'll learn and get smarter over
time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones or the
delivery guy Kona will always let you
know and if it's someone bad now you can
do something about it

video games even virtual reality who are
