the day will bring that's why we're
creating classy Oh spark a smart fallen
one home entertainment center with
premium high file high-definition video
display and voice assistance all powered
by the latest octa-core processor
technology
easily make Skype video calls hey mom
how's it going great how are you I'm
good
hey listen we're having a barbecue
tonight do you want to come over

life simpler

trailer for lego ninjago on youtube
it's also lightweight and portable so
you can enjoy hours of music and video
on a single charge
Oh
lazio spark the all-in-one smart speaker
that has your family's entire home
entertainment covered
when selecting furniture and decoration
for our home we focus on style and
functionality we spend a lot of time
looking to find what would work and look
best however when it comes to light
switches we usually end up with boring
square boxes that just do one thing
switch on the lights we want to change
that with switch me Anna Anna is the
world's first Wi-Fi enabled Braun smart
motion-detecting light switch and alarm
that has expandable features and
over-the-air firmware updates we focused
on three main aspects design usability
and made it future-proof we like
thinking out of the box and we did
switch Vienna's round shape is unique
and gives your home that minimalistic
touch made out of premium materials
found on the latest mobile phones we got
rid of plastic and used aluminum and
glass switch Vienna has interchangeable
pop on face plates so it will fit in any
home no need to screw or unscrew
anything because switch Vienna is WPS
enabled you don't have to be a computer
guru to get started instead of going
through the process of configuring the
device with portals and visiting IP
addresses with switch maiena you can
connect to your Wi-Fi network with just
the press of a button compatible with
iOS and Android control the device from
any phone tablet or even your computer
we figured you also want to use it like
a normal switch so switch me enna is
touch enabled but senses your hand and
switches on and off without even
touching it can detect when you're
coming home and switches on and after
you leave it switches off it also has a
motion detecting sensor built in so you
can set it on motion mode and when you
walk in the room the light switches on
and if you leave it switches off this
exact sensor enables switch mieta to
function as an alarm as well just set it
to alarm mode and enna will notify you
with a push message or email if someone
broke into your house while you're not
home it can even be used as a baby
monitor so this won't happen
however that's not all we know you don't
want to install a new light switch every
year so we made switch me and a
future-proof
we left room for additional sensor packs
that can be added later by just removing
the faceplate and because enha updates
over-the-air no need to remove it from
your wall so if you want to help us make
switch me a successful product the air
bubble is the first proven technology
that effectively removes more than 95%
of both nitrogen dioxide and particles
from inside a car it's now well known
that air pollution affects our health
especially those living in cities
however what most people aren't aware of
its just how bad the air in your car can
be nitrogen dioxide levels primarily
from diesel emissions inside your car
cabin can be 10 times over the w-h-o
limit sitting in a vehicle with your
windows up in traffic is not the safe
haven you might think that it is that's
why we've created the air bubble the
first proven technology of its kind that
removes all elements of air pollution
including nitrogen dioxide from inside a
car cabin the air bubble is optimized to
protect drivers and their families in
polluted cities
and professional drivers who spend hours
on the road designed to fit on the back
of the car headrest the air bubble works
by drawing polluted air circulating
inside the car into the unit before our
proprietary filtration technology
removes gaseous particles bacteria dust
and odors clean air is then released
back to the driver and passengers in the
most efficient way possible using
advanced air flow dynamics what we
breathe matters an a lab some missions
reduce people's exposure to air
pollution flight most parents are always
conscious to avoid the high levels of
air pollution found on busy roads what I
hadn't realized is the levels of harmful
nitrogen dioxide can be even higher
inside our cars our research is a real
wake-up call as I realize the impact
this could have on the house of my son
and of other children
at our labs knowing we had the only
proven technology to effectively remove
nitrogen dioxide I knew it was our duty
to divert the air bubble giving people
the power to protect themselves and
their families the air bubble has been
designed by our team of atmospheric
chemists and airflow engineers at air
labs in our research laboratory here in
Copenhagen it uses our proprietary
filtration technology developed over the
past decade at air labs we specialize in
creating clean air zones for people the
technology inside the air bubble has
proven itself inside of clean air bus
shelters and in a clean air bench
commissioned by Transport for London
during the past year we have focused on
creating a clean air zone inside of a
car and on making the air bubble a
reality we have manufacturers lined up
and with your help we can start
protecting people with the air bubble
early next well we're really excited to
be launching the air bubble and today
we're asking for your support so we can
start making a real difference to
people's lives
