dial phones and VHS tape that's because
I would like to present to you this
snapping screen by kitchen gizmo so many
advantages to this innovative product
first it easily clips on like this to a
pot pan or basically any type and size
of cookware and it only takes up a
fraction of the space that a colander
requires which is great if you have
limited storage space in your kitchen
and who doesn't as unwieldly as a
colander is the snap and strain is easy
and simple to use
even one-handed it's also dishwasher
safe fda-approved and bpa-free
this is a product that just makes sense
Holly with another kitchen gizmo product
highlight join us next time for another
fantastic innovative kitchen product the
mulch our salad dressing mixer is the
easiest way to mix and store your own
homemade salad dressings you can use one
of your favorite recipes or choose one
that we've included on the bottle
there's balsamic vinaigrette Greek salad
dressing and a honey mustard vinaigrette
when making something simple like the
balsamic pop the top off the amol star
to fill with your ingredients
once you've filled me a monster with
your ingredients replace the top and
pull the trigger
the stirring stick blends automatically
and easily when the dressing is fully
mixed pull the top up but not off to
pour easily and without any mess
for storage push the top back down
toss the amol stir in the fridge until
next time
so and today I'll be demonstrating our
three and one egg separator this handy
little tool keeps bowls and countertops
clean when you're cracking eggs to use
just hook the separator on the side of a
bowl it fits both six and thin ribs
bowls this raised edge is the perfect
surface for neatly cracking eggs the
base doubles as a separator to divide
the yolk from egg whites in one easy
step
finally the separator catches unwanted
shells when you're done just pop it in
the dishwasher for easy cleaning the new
fast cut herb tool from Zyliss makes
light work of chopping herbes with five
high quality stainless steel cutting
wheel fast cut curve tool is great for
cutting rosemary coriander basil parsley
tarragon chives and more much quicker
than shopping with a knife this gadget
glides through herbes with speed and
ease this compact handheld device reach
to the blade rotation mechanism allowing
the blades rotate 90 degrees offer
greater versatility when in use you can
either roll the herbs using your palm or
rotate the blade and use the grip
function the soft touch handle ensures
comfortable and easily ideal for using
herbs of the garnish or adding herbs to
sources or roasted vegetables
a blade cover allows the fast cut curve
tool to be safely stored and for
cleaning simply remove the top and put
in the dishwasher for effortless herb
chopping use the fast cut herb tool
