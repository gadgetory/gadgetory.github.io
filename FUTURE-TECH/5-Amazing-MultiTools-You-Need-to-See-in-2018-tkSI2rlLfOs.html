carrying case that's what motivated us
to develop the cool box we've assembled

designers engineers and business
development people in the industry the
cool box product combines many commonly
used tools and workshop items with some
of the most recent and popular
technological enhancements all for the
purpose of making projects easier and
more enjoyable we've created our first
two prototypes and are extremely
satisfied with how they turned out our
