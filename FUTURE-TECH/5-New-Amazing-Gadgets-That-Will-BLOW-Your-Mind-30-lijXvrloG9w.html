send and receive messages browse through
news feed track Fitness stats and much
more
all directly on my wrist all on its own
here's a pocket screen much like a mouse
a keyboard or a monitor this pocket
screen is simply an interface for my hub
it's not very smart it doesn't need to
be if I need a bigger screen I can grab
a tab spring or I can plug it into this
keyboard if I want to be more productive
I can even use this dongle to turn any
existing TV into another screen for my
wrist now that I'm always using the same
computing hub I can start an application
on one screen and seamlessly continue it
on another if I lose the screen don't
worry it has none of my personal stuff
and because these screens are
inexpensive and can be everywhere all I
ever used to carry is my house
