lot of fun growing up but the technology
just wasn't good enough to let us do
what we really wanted back in 1997 we
set out to turn pogo sticks into a whole
new sport our concept was based on the
idea of having a portable trampoline
something you can jump 36 but even Ken
feet high on but also take anywhere you
want to go the v4 is the portable
trampoline we'd always dreamed up with
the v4 you have the ability to add a
remove air and completely change the
stiffness of the bounce someone who
weighs 300 pounds can jump on the same
exact v4 as someone who only weighs 80
pounds all you need to do is change the
air pressure in less than a minute you
can perfectly tuned the v4 to each
writers preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family of fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy you
can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the v4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
downstairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again obstacles and
features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards are perfect for the v4 so
those of you looking for a fun way to
stay in shape the v4 will work most of
the muscle groups in your body and get
your heart pounding immediately it's a
killer cardio workout and the best part
is that while you're having fun bouncing
around you won't even realize how
quickly you build a sweat in order to
achieve superior build quality and
maintain the high tolerance is necessary
for the v4 to work we manufacture and
assemble it right here in our Southern
California shop we work closely with our
suppliers to become a part of the build
process and as each component is made
or right there to test them this
streamlines are manufacturing and
ensures that every before we make is up
to our standards if you're looking for
the portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it join us and help change the
way pogo sticks or seen forever
you
you
when you're a kid learning and playing
always seemed to be on opposite sides
but we believe we can change that meet
Spiro spark addition the playful robot
that makes programming fun and offers
challenges for every skill level spark
began as a local meetup group where we
talk kids how to code beer later we
launched a series of free lessons
labeling students and teachers to
discover all that's possible with the
Sphero ball now as we face a future
where coating will be as important as
reading and writing we want to give
everyone the opportunity to learn the
language of tomorrow in the box you'll
find Spiro spark addition an induction
charger the few other handy tools to
help you get creative the ball itself
comes packed with all the same sensors
and electronics the sphero 2.0 but
unlike scarrow two point O white shell
we've in case spark addition and clear
polycarbonate bringing you closer to the
robotic action
get started by downloading the spark app
and connecting to your ball via
bluetooth if you're new to coding learn
some basic principles by first exploring
the sample programs then set off to
create your very own using drag-and-drop
commands like roll spin flip and color
change at any time you can even access
the actual code behind the blocks and
get a sense of how text based
programming operates if you need a break
from coding turn you to buy sideways to
just drive or tap on the community tab
to see what others are creating spark
addition is also compatible with all of
the other games and apps already
available for Sphero we have big plans
for spark addition so be sure to check
for updates it's time to break the rules
about learning so fire up your
imagination and begin exploring robotics
programming and so much more

hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hide away the bottle you'll
always reach for because it's always
within reach so as a freelance product
designer I'm traveling a lot visiting
clients visiting factories going to
trade shows I was looking for a water
bottle that would not take up a lot of
space in my carry-on and I started
looking around for a product that would
work that would still be functional and
it wasn't out there as I'm going through
airports I'm seeing so many travelers
probably with the same problem and I
figured this is a problem I could solve
myself you know once i had a solution
for business travel i realised this had
great application my personal life
especially in the outdoors going
backpacking or just on hikes I could
bring water with me and when the bottle
was empty it it collapses and goes away
and takes no extra space in my pack yeah
it fits an active lifestyle whether in
the winter when you're skiing and you
can fill up the hideaway in the lodge or
in the summer when you're backpacking or
hiking it collapses in your backpack and
takes no extra space no one loves buying
disposable water bottles it's it's
merely out of convenience and The
Hideaway makes a reusable bottle more
convenient in fact in some places
disposable water bottles are are being
banned so we're all gonna move towards
the reusable water bottle model and
that's why I feel like this is kind of
the next generation in hydration this
gives you an option to have a water
bottle all the time without having to
throw anything away The Hideaway bottle
comes in two sizes 21 ounce and 12 ounce
which is great for kids and both are
watertight I'm really excited to share
the hideaway bottle with with the world
the hideaway
hi I'm John and I invented my phone the
grab-and-go booster seat
this is a regular car booster seat and
this is my fault my fault is the most
advanced compact and portable booster
seat in the world it's more than 10
times smaller than a regular booster and
it's just as safe how's that possible
well a regular booster seat lifts a
child to be in the position of an adult
my fold does the exact opposite instead
of lifting the child up it holds the
seat belt down it's that simple my fold
is engineered to protect children from
the age of 4 all the way up to 12 the
patented design takes the seat belt off
the stomach and the neck making it
comfortable safe and easy to use car
loads of kids and parents already tried
and they love it when it comes to car
seats for children safety is the number
one priority it's crucial for us to meet
the highest regulatory standards and
we've crash tested prototypes
successfully in testing facilities all
around the world now people often ask me
John where did the idea come from so let
me tell you some stories about when my
four kids were little guys come on when
you were little thank you carpooling was
a big part of our lives we always had
boosters for our own kids but not for
the extras that came along my fold is so
small that kids can keep one with them
all the time when my parents visiting we
always had to juggle bulky booster seats
from car to car my fold is so compact
you can store one almost anywhere and my
fold is narrow so you can easily put
three in a row even in the smallest cars
do you live in a big city how often do
you jump in a taxi they never have a
booster seat and that's not safe and hey
by the way that is not a taxi thank you
last time you rented a car you probably
paid an additional forty dollars to rent
the booster that's more than my fault
cost and ours isn't covered in another
kids dinner or worse my fault easy to
keep clean you can even put it in the
dishwasher so I thought if I could make
a booster that's mighty small and mighty
strong when you could take with you
everywhere then children could always be
safe no matter whose car there in using
super tough plastic polymers an aircraft
grade aluminium top designers engineers
and industry experts together we've
created my fold the most advanced
compact and portable safety seat ever
invented and we can't wait to start
getting my fault</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
