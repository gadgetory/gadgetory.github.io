like love petted your fingertips today
we bring you the world's smallest camera
frame drone incredible shame out drone
2.5 6-inch body sizes only 40 grams of
weight Shamu becomes a well-deserved
hummingbird through the Wi-Fi connection
shame Mau will be in your control and it
will achieve any of your flight vision
with advanced gas pressure high system
Shamu is stable and sensitive under your
control shame out can take off directly
or even complete the 360 degrees stunt
rotating flying due to the high-strength
grid structure armour protection shimau
remains unharmed even after thousands of
crash tests we pursue the ultimate fun
Shamu is characterized by small size but
it bears a strong shooting function with
2k resolution high quality camera
Shaima will always record your good
moments in your life 720p camera can

through the gravity sensing technology
and real-time data synchronization
Shamal will imitate the track of what's
your mobile phone shakes via VR glasses
you will see a clear scene whether a
vast blue sky or a narrow the mystery
area more importantly with the
assistance of Shame ow
you will increasingly love the beautiful
world
you
with all the global climate changes
weather has an even greater impact on
our lives daily activities work and
plans in general we rely heavily on
weather channels and apps using local
weather stations that could be dozens of
miles away and its values are most of
the time inaccurate what about all the
outdoor plans like sailing camping
safari hiking beekeeping or agricultural
activities with no access to Internet
weather channels or apps we reinvented
that concept and got a solution to help
you take this matter into your own hands
we have created weather at point the
world's smallest weather station that
fits on your keychain and reads weather
values right at the spot where you are
simply plug whether it point into your
phone connect with app and read and
store values whether at point consists
of sensors that measure temperature
ultraviolet radiation atmospheric
pressure humidity current altitude and
even ambient light for your perfect
photo does not require the internet and
does not need a battery every time you
use weather it point it gathers
information now with the introduction of
weather a point cloud that information
is sent and stored in database that
database is accessible to all so we can
see what the weather was like in the
past the present and the future anywhere
in the world the housing is made of
aluminum and titanium making this device
durable and ensuring a longer lifetime
building hardware is costly we invested
a lot of resources into making weather
at point possible and now we need your
support to make it affordable and
available to anyone whether at point
take your weather with you and there
will be no more rain on your parade</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
