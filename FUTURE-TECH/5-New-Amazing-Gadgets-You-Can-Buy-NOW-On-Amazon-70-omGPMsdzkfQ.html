quality is the simple philosophy behind
the zenmuse x7 together with the inspire
- it marks the next evolution in DJ eyes
aerial imaging technology the inspire -
has become a standard aerial platform
used on film sets around the globe the
new Zen music 7 transforms it into the
world's first fully integrated aerial
platform featuring a super 35 millimeter
sensor for video recording the x7 offers
video resolution of up to 6 K a high
resolution not only provides incredible
detail but also allows reframing
the raw and ProRes codex integrates
seamlessly into industry standard
post-production workflows 14 stops of
dynamic range enhanced grading
flexibility by preserving detail in
shadow and highlight areas the large
sensor also enables filming with a
cinematic shallow depth of field and low
image noise
an ISO range of 102 25600 makes it
suitable for use in all lighting
situations the new DJI cinema color
system consists of two parts an updated
dialog curve for extended dynamic range
and a D gamut RGB color space for
preserving maximum color information
when I first took a look at this x7
footage it really has a color fidelity
there so the dynamic range of colors
that it can reproduce and I can push the
grades around pretty hard and I still
don't get noise with this camera the
superb picture quality of the Zen music
7 is an asset on every film set a new AI
mode makes it easy to match with
different cameras used for TV series
commercials and documentaries as well as
for feature films DJI also proudly
introduces the world's first aerial lens
mount system the DL mount the ultra
short flange distance allows a compact
lens design DJI offers for prime lenses
specifically built for the x7 with focal
lengths of 16 24 35 and 50 millimeters
made with carbon fiber they're
lightweight and durable
the advanced optical elements deliver
brilliant image quality the x7 also
captures stunning DNG RAW or jpg still
pictures with a resolution of 24
megapixels with its sturdy build the x7
was made for professional cinematography
and ambitious aerial stills
photographers it replaces large and
difficult to use aerial solutions even
on high-end film productions when I
think of the x7 I just think of just the
endless amount of possibilities that
cinematographers and directors can craft
their movie with shots that they may not
have even thought was possible before
the zenmuse x7 is a top-of-the-line
professional filmmaking tool making it
possible for creators to focus on
capturing their unique vision of the
world a world that now looks better than
ever before
