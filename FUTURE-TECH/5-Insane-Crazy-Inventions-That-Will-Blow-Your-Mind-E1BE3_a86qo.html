hi folks Jeff here from mega tiny Corp
today we're going to talk about the
technology behind the mega vers
antigravity case and why ours is better
than the competition
the amazing feature that allows you to
stick your mega vers antigravity case to
smooth flat surfaces is the Nano suction
material it's comprised of millions of
tiny suction cups if you look closely
you can see them here when I press down
and release a lot of people ask why mega
tiny antigravity cases work so much
better than all the cheap knockoffs on
the market well it's simple really
quality when we invented the antigravity
case we tested over 50 different types
of nano suction material from all over
the world after hundreds of hours of
testing we chose to enter into an
exclusive partnership with a Japanese
manufacturer that had superior premium
material this was certainly not the
least expensive option but we chose
quality and we stand behind it we also
include for plain backing plates that
perfectly match the finish of your
iPhone and protect the Nano suction
material when not in use plus you can
purchase the optional wallet mirror or
bottle opener mega bag plates with more
coming soon
