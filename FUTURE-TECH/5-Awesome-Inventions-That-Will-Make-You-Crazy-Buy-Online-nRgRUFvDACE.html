the M 3d pro based on getting feedback
from our existing users so we've already
gone through three iterations of design
prototypes and we're almost completely
done the engineering three months ago we
proved a lot of the important concepts
like making a hated bed that uses less
power approving that it can move a lot
faster proving the benefits of higher
quality and higher precision metal parts
and right now we're going through the
final phases of proving the feedback
system and finishing the next steps in
programming our goal with the EMA 3d
pros to make the most reliable 3d
printer in history and the way we're
going to do it is by combining a full
suite of sensors what we call a sensor
network with precision metal parts the
combination allows the printer to become
more self-aware and it can correct for
errors that are common in all 3d
printers a cheapo invent expensive poems
things such as filament snags printhead
crashes even power outages first time I
ever heard about 3d printing was one of
my friends printed a Ninja Warrior
Training hold and I thought it was
really cool the unique thing that you're
getting with em 3d pro that we have not
yet seen in this industry is that
ability for the printer to sense many
different things within itself it has
the ability to sense position and has
the ability to sense speed has the
ability to sense temperature in five
different places and if there's a
problem it can be self diagnosed and in
almost all cases can be self corrected
ultimately that gives you more time in
the creative process with 3d printing I
have right on my desk or my
granddaughter's have right on their desk
if they get an idea they can try to make
that idea on a 3d printer right there
they can turn their ideas into reality
this I didn't have when I
really the greatest advancement the 3d
printing could accomplish at any point
in the future is ease of use making it
so that anybody can just go from an idea
to creating that idea within an
afternoon we've introduced this new
thing that we call tutorial mode so what
we got from our feedback from original
backers was that they wanted more
detailed guide so they can grow into
becoming a expert user rather than
having to start up next we're using the
thing I think that needs to happen for
educators is speed as an issue how fast
we can turn around so with em 3d pro you
have the ability to print a single
prototype with extreme accuracy and high
quality but you also have the ability to
take that prototype and print it in
quantity cover the entire print bed with
multiples of your model and produced
edit volume I am so excited for the
future not only for me for my daughter
to grow up being able to use her mind to
create anything she wants do thanks to
the 3d player I've been fascinated with
just the whole idea of 3d printing for
quite a while now focusing on just
simple things that I could print for
around the house or you know toys that I
can print to play with my kids really
just the idea that I could create
something myself so the n 3d pro is
already successfully funded and is the
largest crowd funded through printed
this year due to popular demand we're
opening up pre-orders using the
IndieGoGo in demand play and what M 3d
is doing I think many people are going
to see is extremely innovative and
they're going to want to be first to
support it and help nurture where this
technology is going to go they just also
happen to get a printer as one of their
rewards very early and at a deep
discount
you
introducing the neato bought that
connected line of smart powerful and
connected robot vacuums nita's laser
smart mapping and navigation system with
real-time object detection continuously
scans your home and methodically cleans
every room cleaning around furniture and
objects neato robots even navigate well
in the dark and get under beds and
furniture too we're dirt and dust hide
unlike other robot vacuums that bounce
around the room and a random style neato
robot vacuums use smart path planning to
clean in a back-and-forth pattern to
deliver an intelligent methodical clean
it's the bitches to finishing the job up
to four times faster than other BOTS
neato also automatically avoid stairs
using drop sensors when it comes to
floors neato robots drive over your
different floor surfaces with these
automatically adjusting for optimal
performance and corners are no match for
neato because unlike round BOTS Vito's
unique d shape allows it to clean deep
into corners when bigger messes happen
neato knows what it takes to tackle them
with one of the largest dirt bin and
biggest slower on the market it can pick
up larger debris as easily as it picks
up pet hair and since it's all powered
by lithium ion batteries larger jobs are
no problem for your neato robots neato
bot bag clean automatically moving from
room to room then if neato is running
low on power it just goes back to the
charge base to recharge then returns to
where it left off to finish the job and
so the entire level of your home is
cleaned
but most importantly you get the power
and convenience in the palm of your hand
by using the neato app start/stop and
receive notifications wherever you are
it's easy just scheduled cleanings every
day or on the schedule that works for
you and view your cleaning stats to
better manage your robots use the neato
app to clean from anywhere at any time
smart powerful connected
you
no one likes to see their child struggle
imagine if your child struggles with the
most common way of learning its letters
on a page looked foreign if it took them
three times longer to finish a simple
homework assignment imagine if your
child had dyslexia what would you do
when the 45 million people across
America struggle with dyslexia every day
that's why we've created the reading
style pen a patent-pending electronic
reading pin they'll instantly convert
text to audio with a simple path of a
hand I reading text aloud the reading
style pinned will help your son or
daughter learn to overcome obstacles on
their own boosting their self-confidence
and making them more independent the
review style pen was built with the
classroom in mind because it stores no
information it can be used on tests with
no risk of cheating this means never
again will your child experience the
pain and embarrassment of being pulled
from the classroom at home your child
will be more efficient knocking their
homework out in a fraction of the time
leaving them free to be a kid we saw
this project three years ago with the
mission to support the education and
empowerment of people through technology
getting to this point has taken a lot of
hard work patience and personal growth
but finally in a position to bring this
product into the world with the support
of the University of Kansas our family
and our friends we have made a great
deal of progress our prototype is
complete our manufacturer is ready to go
now we need your help to make your
reading style pen a reality our goal is
40 thousand dollars which will cover the
equipment tooling and inventory
necessary for a first production run by
backing at one of our three tabs
electric tears you will be one of the
first to get your hands on the reading
style pen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
