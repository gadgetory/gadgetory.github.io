if we're lucky most of us can take water
for granted turn on the tap and there it
is but what if that changed
hurricanes earthquakes all sorts of
other disasters natural or man-made can
leave us vulnerable water is vital to
survival emergency prep kits should have
three days of drinking water per person
but if you need more what can you do for
safe drinking water would you be
prepared for a disaster an emergency a
desperate situation even if that
desperation is just about getting in
touch with nature whether you're
prepping an emergency kit or going for a
hike Puri so is an easy to use and
dependable water purification system
that's an important yet inexpensive
investment to make the Puri so water
purification bottle filters and purifies
water by removing a variety of
contaminants bacteria protozoan cysts
and particulates and it reduces viral
chemical and heavy metal content simply
place the bottles Inlet into the
freshwater source and pump water is
drawn through the hollow fiber membrane
and carbon filter resulting in purified
water
close off the inlet flip it over unscrew
the pump handle and sit directly from
the 410 milliliter purified water
reservoir contaminated water never
enters this chamber or save in a
separate bottle so you can purify even
more water the replaceable filter can
process up to 1,000 liters the pure reso
water purification bottle is great for
hiking emergencies and for travel to
places where you might not be so sure of
the local water quality with the funds
we raise from our Kickstarter campaign
we'll be able to complete the final
steps needed and bringing pure reso to
market
Americans are receiving more packages
and home deliveries than ever before at
box lock we've made it our mission to
protect your deliveries from ports
pirates and package thieves our first
product is a smart padlock that opens
when you use it to scan a valid barcode

drivers to handle all the paperwork when
a claim is filed what's more there's no
recurring cost for using box lock we're
excited to share box lock with you and
look forward to making sure your
packages are delivered safely and
securely
the air bubble is the first proven
technology that effectively removes more
than 95% of both nitrogen dioxide and
particles from inside a car it's now
well known that air pollution affects
our health especially those living in
cities however what most people aren't
aware of is just how bad the air in your
car can be nitrogen dioxide levels
primarily from diesel emissions inside
your car cabin can be 10 times over the
WHL limit sitting in a vehicle with your
windows up in traffic is not the safe
haven you might think that it is that's
why we've created the air bubble
the first proven technology of its kind
that removes all elements of air
pollution including nitrogen dioxide
from inside a car cabin the air bubble
is optimized to protect drivers and
their families in polluted cities and
professional drivers who spend hours on
the road designed to fit on the back of
the car headrest the air bubble works by
drawing polluted air circulating inside
the car into the unit before our
proprietary filtration technology
removes gases particles bacteria dust
and odors clean air is then released
back to the driver and passengers in the
most efficient way possible using
advanced air flow dynamics what we
breathe matters and a lab son mission to
reduce people's exposure to air
pollution light noise parents are always
conscious to avoid the high levels of
air pollution found on busy roads what I
hadn't realized is the levels of harmful
nitrogen dioxide can be even higher
inside our cars
our research is a real wake-up call as I
realized the impact this could have on
the house of my son and of other
children at air labs knowing we had the
only proven technology to effectively
remove nitrogen dioxide I knew it was
our duty to serve out the air bubble
giving people the power to protect
themselves and their families the air
bubble has been designed by our team of
atmospheric chemists and airflow
engineers at air labs in our research
laboratory here in Copenhagen it uses
our proprietary filtration technology
developed over the past decade at air
labs we specialize in creating clean air
zones for people the technology inside
the air bubble has proven itself inside
of clean air bus shelters and in a clean
air bench commissioned by Transport for
London during the past year we have
focused on creating a clean air zone
inside of a car and on making the air
bubble a reality we have manufacturers
lined up and with your help we can start
protecting people with the air bubble
early next week we're really excited to
be launching the a bubble and today
we're asking for your support so we can
start making a real difference in
people's lives
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bottom one has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power in
productivity like 3d printing it can
print your product with fluency and
details to colors no problem or use
laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with a force sensitive 3d
mouse you can control do bot m1 as
precisely as you want
no more trying and guessing on a
confusing software with its hand whole
teaching feature you can input
coordinates in the fastest and most
intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bot m1 is highly extendable
there are no limits to your imagination
on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger
when it can actually go further or use a
camera for visual with it's fast and
accurate image recognizing algorithm it
can distinguish colors without making
one mistake do bottom one loves
companions they can work seamlessly
together processing paperwork way faster
than humans could ultimately do bottom
one is built to replace manpower in
production line working day and night
non-stop the built-in mapping and path
planning system provides this excellent
mobility providing inventory management
service in your warehouse to be able to
create so much value to bottom one has
been built with extraordinary
performance the perfect calibration of
the high performance DC servomotor
harmonic reducer and kinematic algorithm
has brought out the best of both
strength and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters
maximum payload of up to 1.5 kilograms
angular speed of up to 200 degrees per
second it's also a steady player never
slips up
everyone loves creating things and
having a robotic arm is awesome with do
bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
robotic arms everyone can now benefit
from a cost-effective user-friendly
robotic arm technology so when a new
idea hits you do bot m1 will be ready
all you have to do is say yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
