when technology caught up with my dreams
to make the world a safer place for
everyone in 2000 I was attacked by a
complete stranger pick up my throat open
my skull a cup three times into my heart
it happened in a ditch neighborhood in
the light of day 200 feet from the
police station
I thought the life with what I had
Suzanne name but what actually saved me
was the call for help 16 years ago I had
few options are you plan for it I was
extremely lucky the house painters
analyze and Binga life is all the
difference
since that they have been thinking
anything could have kept me away from
that experience I'm Amelia and Martin
midlife and give a warm feeling that you
and your loved ones are safe now

ring with the penny button to send an
alert to friends people in nearby police
and private security services with just
a touch of home when an emergency simply
push the button the message with you map
coordinates immediately reaches your
safety circles
NIEM helps to feel safe in any situation
of suspicion threat or direct danger
give it to your loved ones and you will
always know when they need help if
they're in emergencies including fires
floods robbery armed attacks sexual
assault or health problems

need to dig around for the device and
then look earth to find the badness you
don't need a big hand to be free you
don't need to have a long conversation
with the 9-1-1 operator
operators are busy please stay online we
are a great team you created the system
that brought the latest high-tech
knowledge and design around your finger
in the application you can manage a list
of receiver that's by not health issue
very controlled and so other critical
information we've made dozens of
prototypes to make sure the ring is nice
and comfortable to wear the bottom is
functional and the false alarms are
negligible we aim to build community
where people come forward to a
prosthetic hand for those in trouble
we call it crowdsource security and we
believe that society's ready to protect
themself name is available in two colors
to fit your child it looks and feels
good with the urine and morning run a
business meeting a party it meets any
dress code and looks appropriate in most
situations of your exercise I wear my
name everything I can work late and

night write or do any independence my
