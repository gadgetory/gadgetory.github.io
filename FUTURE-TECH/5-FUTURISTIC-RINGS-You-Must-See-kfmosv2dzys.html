earring a wearable relative to your
charge card
it's a fun inconvenient wastes computing
style
we would really high and went through
many prototypes to make sure that you
have a good experience what game is it
beginning for us we want to do in
between all over the world opening
possibilities everywhere everyone is
asked to have their own little piece of
wearable technology we've heard many
ideas of how the submarine can be used
and in the midst of exploring this ebony
firm because the sesame rings 3d protect
really customize the design to you we
need your help with the production of
the first metal earring which can be
used to take public transportation in
the Massachusetts Bay air in order to
move on with our project we need to buy
our 3d printers hardware and mass
production mode no more efficient we are

we make this happen
hello my name is Kathy I'm an
entrepreneur professional writer
activist friend mother and longboard
writer and here to celebrate the day
when technology caught up with my dreams
to make the world a safer place for
everyone in 2000 I was attacked by a
complete stranger pick up my throat open
my skull a cup three times into my heart
it happened in a ditch neighborhood in
the light of day 200 feet from the
police station
I thought the life with what I had
Suzanne name but what actually saved me
was the call for help 16 years ago I had
few options are you plan for it I was
extremely lucky the house painters
analyze and Binga life is all the
difference
since that they have been thinking
anything could have kept me away from
that experience I'm Amelia and Martin
midlife and give a warm feeling that you
and your loved ones are safe now
at long last ferry one this isn't in the
ring with the penny button to send an
alert to friends people in nearby police
and private security services with just
a touch of home when an emergency simply
push the button the message with you map
coordinates immediately reaches your
safety circles
NIEM helps to feel safe in any situation
of suspicion threat or direct danger
give it to your loved ones and you will
always know when they need help if
they're in emergencies including fires
floods robbery armed attacks sexual
assault or health problems
my read is the fastest and safest ways
and in a mother
with the Rings they can Samba Sydney
without no one who did that they don't
need to dig around for the device and
then look earth to find the badness you
don't need a big hand to be free you
don't need to have a long conversation
with the 9-1-1 operator
operators are busy please stay online we
are a great team you created the system
that brought the latest high-tech
knowledge and design around your finger
in the application you can manage a list
of receiver that's by not health issue
very controlled and so other critical
information we've made dozens of
prototypes to make sure the ring is nice
and comfortable to wear the bottom is
functional and the false alarms are
negligible we aim to build community
where people come forward to a
prosthetic hand for those in trouble
we call it crowdsource security and we
believe that society's ready to protect
themself name is available in two colors
to fit your child it looks and feels
good with the urine and morning run a
business meeting a party it meets any
dress code and looks appropriate in most
situations of your exercise I wear my
name everything I can work late and
writers do that all the time go for a
night write or do any independence my
daughter takes it under go out to create
a closet and I'll let you go with Aliza
heart
I embrace been known while suing safe
and secure
I want to share that feeling review
imagine the world where health is always
there we can make it together
back our Japan keeps better help us to
make their oldest space a place for
everyone
