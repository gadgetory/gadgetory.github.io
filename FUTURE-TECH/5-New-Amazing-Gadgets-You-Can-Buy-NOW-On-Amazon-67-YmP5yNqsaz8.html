the handle and open the dispenser
compartment the towel memory has been
cleared and it's ready to be reset now
there's nothing required to install the
roll you simply place the roll inside
making sure to leave a portion hanging
below the door now close the compartment
after a few seconds it retracts the
remaining towel now place your hand in
front of the sensor to get your first
towel then just tear off the amount you
want at the desired perforation the best
part is that the dispenser retracts the
remaining towel and it has learned your
desired length this length will dispense
every time from here on or if you need
more than one paper towel for a larger
mess I simply hold my hand there a
little longer until I have as many paper
towels as I need it will only dispense
up to five of the set lengths at a time
so it will never empty all at once and
it doesn't respond to frantic waving or
just somebody passing by another helpful
feature of the novia
sir is that when I grab for the towel it
creates tension to ensure I get a clean
tear every time if I don't need all of
the towels dispensed after a few seconds
there automatically retracted so I'm not
wasting any and and saving money it's so
easy you can do it with one hand which
is great when you're multitasking with
kids dinner and everything else going on
in your life you don't have to worry
about picking up germs from the
dispenser or leaving any behind a truly
waste free germ free kitchen this is a
one-of-a-kind appliance smart enough to
automatically dispense retract and learn
I hope you enjoy the benefits of your
inovio paper towel dispenser I know I
certainly do
