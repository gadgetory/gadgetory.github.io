photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range add a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot we built a better way today's
DSLR and mirrorless camera have amazing
optics and sensors but they do very
little to actually help you take a good
photo
finding the right settings involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created Arsenal the world's first AI
photography assistant with one task
Arsenal fine sevens take the best photo
possible Arsenal's AI searches thousands
of images in its database - suggested
setting next it fine Tunes the
suggestions by analyzing 18 different
factors Arsenal uses state-of-the-art
machine learning to help you take a
great photo in any condition
many of the memorable shots you - today
are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo second with Arsenal
you can do this in section capture all
the details and seams with high dynamic
range get everything in sharp focus Phil
is a working professional just like most
of us whenever he goes on a business
trip he takes all his digital pals with
him and he needs a bunch of cable to
keep his pals going but one day
bill up all of them at home because he
met imaginable managable is a
one-size-fits-all cable for all your
gadgets lightning micro USB USB USBC
imaginable fits them all now Bill can
charge his phone in many different ways
power adapter in the car portable
battery and even his new MacBook Pro in
an emergency magical can even help him
take power from his friends smartphone
whenever Bill wants to use magical for
his other devices like a Kindle
he just lifts it and attaches it to the
device bill loves his new MacBook Pro
except that he had to carry the original
adapter and USB C cable which are pretty
much useless for most of other devices
however was manageable he can charge his
macbook pro with whatever is around him
no matter whether it's the power adapter
for his iphone or ipad the original
power adapter or even a USB hub by the
way with magical you can connect your
iPad to your laptop and turn it into an
extra display one day bill wants to get
some files to his new MacBook Pro from
his hard drive and he can't find his USB
home again but it's ok magical can be
used as an adapter so Bill can
disconnect his laptop to his hard drive
or any USB device bill is a heavy
Instagram and thanks for the magical he
never worries about the storage on his
smartphone because he can transfer
pictures or videos to a flash drive
anywhere at any time
with magical build work and life are
more fun and efficient also magical
charges faster and transfers faster -
with the 24 odd copper wire inside
Matt will charge is 150% faster and
transfers 30% faster than most regular
tables the premium nylon material and
robust braiding makes magical much
stronger and more durable than other
tables you can even use it to pull a
4,000 pound SUV when you had a magical
you'll have five cable plus a mini
adapter why not go with magical magical
the ultimate cable to charge your
devices
hi i'm dr. jason wars 'land founder and
head of performance development at there
again if their gun is for chiropractors
physical therapists trainers and
athletes and anyone that's active the
benefits of the fair gun is it increases
blood flow decreases lactic acid and
interrupts the pain cycle in the brain
I've seen the most success with a
faragon in athletes within minutes
loosen up their muscles and go out and
perform the way they need to
we all have our own routines what we
like to eat how we work out and the best
addition to my routine has been tarragon
g1 whether it's pre workout or after a
long trip on the road and I'm just
unwinding at home
the g1 is unmatched when it comes to
recovery its aggressive but it's not
painful and I feel as soon as when I use
it or dr. Jason used it on me I mean
it's it's immediate results and it's
easy to use it's not heavy its
lightweight you can travel with it so I
like that they're going a lot better
the g1 is absolutely the real deal I
used on my quads calves hip flexor I use
it everywhere it helps create blood flow
where you have not or scorches the ther
gun is better than anything currently in
the market because it's lightweight easy
to use battery-operated handheld mobile
and go anywhere with you with a really
strong amplitude which is the distance
the head travels the feedback on the
ther gun is done unanimously positive
period
you
mom would ring but not cold
over the past three years the smartphone
has become the single most important
communication device that we use on a
daily basis no matter where we are we
need it to stay in contact with those
around us
however smartphones are entirely
dependent on a communication
infrastructure that they use what
happens when this infrastructure becomes
unreliable or is non-existent for
instance when we are out in the wild
traveling abroad when there are too many
users congesting the network or when a
natural disaster knocks down existing
cellular towers that's why we created
the sonic a wireless communication of
ice that enables your smartphone sanic
for instant messages voice recordings
image data and GPS location even when
there is no internet access or cellular
coverage how does it work simply connect
your smartphone to the Wi-Fi access
point on the phone end and it will
transmit the data sent from your phone
to other sonic users via long-range
radio frequency no cellular data no
satellite service and no monthly
subscription the typical range for
point-to-point communication with the
sonnet is approximately five kilometres
for three miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase the detective
range by securely relaying data to other
SONET devices in the area the sonnet is
designed specifically for use in the
outdoors it is rated ip66 meaning that
its dust tight and water resistant
the sonic is powered by a four thousand
milliamp hour battery that allows you to
use it continuously for up to 24 hours
as a built-in USB port so that you can
even charge your phone with it on the
software side is the sonnet app an
intuitive instant messenger that draws
upon the familiar user experience in
addition the stolid app comes with
useful features such as offline maps and
real-time location sharing so that you
always know where you are in relation to
your friend in the case of an emergency
the sonnet app has a panic button which
will activate the SOS mode broadcasting
your distress call in your current GPS
location any sonnet users in range we've
been developing the sonnet for over a
year now and we're super excited by the
possibilities prototypes are now
complete and we're ready it's moving at
full production that's where you come in
we're looking for your support to bring
this school on a decentralized
communication into the mainstream sana
is just the beginning and we're so
grateful for you to be a part of it
thank you for your help
you
