that orbits around wooden disk telling
the time what's unique about story is
that it has three different modes you
can customize manually through the side
buttons or through a mobile device the
first mode is journey mode which allows
you to set a future date for example a
birthday graduation or travel plans the
levitating sphere will make one full
orbit and arrive at the 12 o'clock
position at the date of your choice the
second mode is clock mode which works
normally just like a clock would the
levitating sphere represents the hour
hand the third mode is timer mode which
allows you to set shorter intervals like
30 minutes or an hour they can be really
good in an office meeting for example
when everybody can see the same time
another cool features that story can be
levitated both horizontally on a table
or vertically on a wall it's something
we've worked really hard to achieve
story also has optional backlit display
features that can display time through
patterns of light for example moon
phases to me story represents a metaphor
and that's the planet going around the
Sun it's simple as that

electricity and electric circuits are
now essential for life however most
people feel those are something far from
them to enable anyone to play with the
electric circuits we launched conductive
man with which you can draw electric
circuits for example she has no
experience of study design that she is
comfortably making electric circuits
with our pens hey see oh this doesn't
work really let me see umm this short
out
you shouldn't have connected these how
can I fix it
well unfortunately you have to make it
again from scratch are you serious this
is what happened in the past but now you
don't have to make it a game from
scratch
we got the racer with our way racers you
can race in a fixers hockey patterns
quickly
our racers enable you to create advanced
gimmicks with trials and errors for
example you can make a birthday card
that lights up when opened
you can add tricks to a gradient cars
you can also make a slider with which
you can control lights you can make
sensor interfaces on paper you can make
even more complicated works such as
music interfaces octave lasers allow you
to try and edit circuit patterns
intellectually and flexibly I've been
researching electrical circuit
prototyping using the conductive in a
major limitation of prototyping with the
conductive ink is difficulty about
changing the design you can't undo
circuit design unlike software with our
circuit eraser you can change your
design easily and quickly obedience try
and radar is important process is with
our circuit racers you can make a
circuit without fear of mistakes we've
developed a prototype of the racer by
supporting this project you can help us
find the first mass production of the
racers be prepared kids doesn't let you
realize your creativity instantly so why
don't you join us and let's see a new
Fry's Electronics together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
