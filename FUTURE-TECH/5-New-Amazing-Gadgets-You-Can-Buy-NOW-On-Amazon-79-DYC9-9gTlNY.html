York is now boarding at gate 3 please
hurry so you can find a place to stow
your carry-on luggage assuming you were
even able to carry it on and the airline
didn't make you check it because you
pack too much hopefully you all have a
blue smart the world's first smart
carry-on suitcase introducing blue smart

smartphone with revolutionary features

sensors location tracking trip tracking
information a built-in digital scale and

over designed for today's sophisticated
traveler and even guys like this
pull the handle and the app will tell
you the exact weight of your carry-on so
that you never have to check it because
you pack too much god knows what a
suitcase has to go through
forget about keys or combinations
control the lock from the app and if for
any reason you need to part ways with
your blue smart or not it will
automatically lock itself life's too
short to fight for an outlet blue smart
will recharge your electronic devices
with our super powerful built-in battery
so relax
Bo smart will alert you if you ever
leave it behind or if it finds a new
friend and if it's ever lost you'll be
able to track its location you will
breeze through airport security
thanks to easy access to your electronic
devices with blue smart anyone can
travel smart
even this guy
home automation is awesome but current
smartphone products are got very
expensive and difficult to set up that's
why we created the hook hook is a
platform that connects any radio
frequency enabled device in your home to
the internet with these five dollar RF
outlets you can already add remote
control to any device in your home but
they only work within range of the
remote and with basic functionality
connecting a new device is incredibly
simple just sync your devices remote
with the hook app now I can control that
device from anywhere in the world
hook is compatible with IFTTT which can
be used to schedule operations of
routine tasks like turning on your
holiday light sunset
or turning your entire room into an
alarm clock folks capabilities are
limited only by your imagination you can
create rules that flash your lights when
your bus is nearby notify you if it
appliances left Owen or turn off your
router if your daughter is watching too
much Netflix wait wait come back luck is
powered by spark i/o and will be
provided with an open API so anyone can
develop for hook and help expand its
capabilities and the best part you only
need one hook for your entire home
regardless of how many devices you are
connecting so we've been working for
over a year now trying to develop this
technology and then get it into a
packaged device that the users gonna
like and that we like ourselves so we
started off with a big board a big set
of electronics we added Wi-Fi
compatibility we added a USB hub so we
could power it through USB and then we
started adding things like radio chips
that we had to make sure it didn't
interfere with each other and then the
trick is trying to get that thing
smaller get it more compact and get it
into the right packaging so we made
multiple 3d printed designs each time we
print something hit the electronics into
it put it on a board look at it and
figure out no wait we can pop these
chips off with you moving this way we
can read app√©tit we can solder it's
smaller we can get this thing more
compact and then the end we really came
down to a product but it feels nice
looks good
and a prototype that we're really proud
to ship hey Kickstarter were the team
behind hook we have been looking pretty
hot for a little year to make hook a
reality we've got a great product and
we're very excited to bring it to market
but we need your help with your funding
we can get our molds get our
manufacturing process dialed in and get
hook to production so fit as excited as
via Bacchus
Shanna's and tell your friends about
coop so join us in our journey to bring
affordable home automation to everyone
it has been said that f Favaro
we learn from the perfect forms that
have been present in nature since the
dawn of time they're just waiting to be
discovered
we created the flood sensor binding
technical perfection into a shape
inspired by a water drop
we gave it an independent power source
Bluetooth connectivity and temperature
sensor as well as telescopic probes
covered with 24 karat gold all of this
in one of the smallest devices of its
type in the world
the device will alert you in case of
flooding or temperature changes with
light and sound and a status update in
the smartphone app the sensor will
detect even the slightest change in
location or any attempts to tamper with
its case
our goal is to design solutions which
are perfect both in form as well as in
their functionality and now you get to
explore what they can offer
Favaro flood sensor works with apple
homekit
attaches to any pea bioprocess so it
saves what you are seeing now without
using hands and you can download any
photos to your smartphone and deal them
and also upload out to our web service
or share via SNS I designed this camera
to those who who don't want to miss
shatter chances so you can take any
photos even when your hands are full
like logging daily life blinking helps
you saving good memories of your life do
you remember the first time your kid
stood touch the doggie you should see
the moment not through screen of a
smartphone but with your eyes and take
pictures at the same time like cooking
while making something with your both
hands you can record the processes
imagine how you take this picture
without blinking blinking helps you to
make recipes much
while enjoying outdoor activities like
cycling hiking or traveling
you should not pass by the good scenery
but you should take as many pictures as
you like at any moment
blinkin captures what you see which may
be something different from usual
pictures you've taken of course while
your hands are occupied let's see we use
the convergence of technologies such as
camera about the family and I move in
the sensor which we have Patel invented
it is 25 weight light enough to keep it
on glasses
Lincoln means are to collect those
precious moments in your life so you
will no longer use hands to take
pictures
we will offer new category of photos
let's explore the world with Lincoln and
save them all Lincoln will never let the
moment pass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
