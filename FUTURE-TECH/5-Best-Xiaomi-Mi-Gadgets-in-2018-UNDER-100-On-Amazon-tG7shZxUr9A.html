which is so nicely packaged and there's
also a small instruction manual and the
power adapter the lamp has exactly the
same design as the ye light bedside lamp
that's been held in the me home store
for years but the main difference is the
golden looking base color and the media
logo instead of a ye'd light logo on the
front the power adapter is now turned 90
degrees which is a very welcome change
as the adapter on the older ye lights
took up way too much unnecessary space
you can use this light standalone and
control its color and brightness
settings on top of the lamp here you'll
find a on/off switch and a switch to
toggle between the different light modes
the brightness can be changed by simply
moving your finger around the top and
you can change the color by holding down
the toggle switch and moving your finger
around the top of the lamp at the same
time the light modes of the lamp are a
reading light which allows you to choose
a blue cold light and dial that to a
warmer orange tone there's color which
allows you to choose any color and color
flow which will flow between four
different colors besides manual control
you can also set this lamp up over Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth allowing you to control it
from your smart phone setup timers use
it with the me band and setup automation
rules for that you'll need to install
this lamp with the me home app and that
is SEP pretty easy just power on the
light after which you can add a new
device in the me home app I got prompted
that the light was found when I opened
up the app but you can also add a new
device from the devices page and find
the lamp all the way in the bottom after
setting up your Wi-Fi details the lamp
will be installed after it's set up in
the app you can turn the lamp on or off
remotely changes colors and brightness
set timers and set up smart home
automation rules for this lamp because
this new bedside lamp now has Wi-Fi you
can use all the switches and sensors
from the Xiaomi ecosystem to control
this lamp you can set up a sensor or
switch to turn the light on or off
change its brightness and you and change
the mode of the lamp the light just got
released yesterday so this automation
list is not yet translated but I expect
they will do that
soon so to compare it with the older ye
light bedside lamp I noticed that the
light distribution is slightly different
I also noticed that the new light is
capable of orange tones slightly better
as the older versions seem to go from
yellow to red more abrupt besides a very
minor difference in the light the base
color and a power adapter there's not
much of a change but the addition of
Wi-Fi was something that was very much
needed to make this light integrate in
the me home ecosystem and that's what
makes this newer bedside lamp so much
better than its predecessor it's all
hard to get a breath of fresh air when
you're outdoors these days oh man
somebody left the window open when will
people stop burning trash
the air quality is indeed bad but not to
worry though the me air purifier 2 is
inspired by aircraft engines it's
powerful system creates an air vortex
which purifies dust and other unwanted
particles within minutes so the
breakfast will be ready in 15 minutes
the me air purifier too has great
coverage in governed area 400 square
feet with a super high clean air
delivery rate oh by the way do you know
there's so many unhealthy particles in
our bones we can't even see tiny
pollutants like poland's dust mites
another PM 2.5 matter that cause
allergies but the knee air purifier -
comes with 360-degree triple-layered
filter with activated carbon that traps
the more it keeps me and my family
allergy free thanks MA something doesn't
fit
how about now perfect
well winter is coming and it brings with
it the worst kind of air pollution I
think I should buy a treadmill instead
of going out for a run at least in my
house clean air is guaranteed
