built-in rechargeable battery yeah yeah
it has wireless bluetooth speakers on
the first just like that pass through
power cool way to get started all right

number six
coming up gotta love this tablet then
the next I'm done correctly a cold one

it's getting pretty dark out even extra
light yeah get LED lights on this now
that's cool
want to put these on the magnetic lid
for me no problem
dirty lifting handles - okay honey I
approve yep pretty much does everything
introducing the cool box the world's
most advanced tool box hi I'm Mike and
I'm Chris the history of the modern tool
box is over a hundred years old but to
date there have been very few truly
remarkable enhancements or improvements
made to this commonly used carrying case
that's what motivated us to develop the
cool box we've assembled a team of some
of the best product designers engineers
and business development people in the
industry the cool box product combines
many commonly used tools and workshop
items with some of the most recent and
popular technological enhancements all
for the purpose of making projects
easier and more enjoyable we've created
our first two prototypes and are
extremely satisfied with how they turned
out our warehouse fulfillment center and
manufacturing facility are all set up
the cool box is ready to go now we need
your help IndieGoGo with your support we
can revolutionize the way you work on
any job thank you hi everyone it is our
pleasure to present the Adam fly we
started to design and create the Adam
fly a little bit more than a year and a
half ago our idea was to make the best
and the most durable hoverboard on the
market we have finally made a fully
functional prototype after many tests
with many different components and we
are ready to hit the market you can ride
your Adam over a variety of terrains
they come across your path ride down
streets and you will feel like you are
surfing on waves in the ocean
Adam is made with an aluminum alloy
frame and you can even ride down stairs
without any problems
feel the freedom of movement at a top
speed of 12 miles per hour padam fly is
water-resistant so if you see a pile of
water don't hesitate just run over it we
have created atom to fit everyone take
your atom on a rocky surface or even on
grass it is up to your imagination atom
fly will work for seven and a half miles
on a single charge so you can plane and
trip and go for a distance without a
problem we have tested atom on different
obstacles and terrain you can easily
ride over bumps and go uphill or ride
down stairs like a chain we wanted to
create a hoverboard that feels like a
skateboard or surf course it also works
as a transportation vehicle that takes
you wherever you want we're developing
an application that supports both iOS
and Android it will make it easy to
adjust the settings of your atom it will
also have an anti-theft function which
means your atoms can only be started
when you turn off the anti-theft
function on your rack the lights of atom
switch at the same time you switch the
direction you are going that means you
will always have a bright light on the
front and a red light on back no matter
how many times you turn around atom is
the ultimate off-road all-terrain
vehicle we are ready for production and
now we need your help to get atom flying
to the market
you and I have something in common we
are dreamers at least I prefer to think
you are and dreams are real aren't they
but not someone else's only wrong
sanity is not to have control of a
reality of the capacity to light up the
chaos the place of origin of all our
discovery when sanity is lost I go back
to my steel and priest or favorite books
about a self-proclaimed film Messiah
sometimes it helps we don't need to
venture to the stars nor seek to drams
that magnificent horizons far and beyond
maybe it is enough to take light where
light has not been before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
