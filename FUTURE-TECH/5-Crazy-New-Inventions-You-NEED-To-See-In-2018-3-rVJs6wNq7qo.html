has become the single most important
communication device that we use on a
daily basis no matter where we are we
need it to stay in contact with those
around us however smart phones are
entirely dependent on a communication
infrastructure that they use what
happens when this infrastructure becomes
unreliable or is non-existent for
instance when we are out in the wild
traveling abroad when there are too many
users congesting the network or when a
natural disaster knocks down existing
cellular towers that's why we created
this sonic a wireless communication of
ice that enables your smartphone to send
for instant messages voice recordings
image data and GPS locations even when
there is no internet access or cellular
coverage how does it work
simply connect your smartphone to the
Wi-Fi access point on the sonnet and it
will transmit the data sent from your
phone to other sonnet users via
long-range radio frequency no cellular
data no satellite service and no monthly
subscription the typical range for
point-to-point communication with the
sonnet is approximately five kilometres
for three miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase its effective
range by securely relaying data to other
SONET devices in the area
the sonnet is designed specifically for
use in the outdoors it is rated ip66
meaning that it's dust tight and water
resistant the sonnet is powered by a
four thousand milliamp hour battery that
allows you to use it continuously for up
to 24 hours as a built-in USB port so
that you can even charge your phone with
it on the software side is the sonnet
app an intuitive instant messenger that
draws upon the familiar user experience
in addition the sonnet app comes with
useful features such as offline maps and
real-time location sharing so that you
always know where you are in relation to
your friends in the case of an emergency
the sonnet app has a panic button which
will activate the SOS mode broadcasting
your distress call and your current GPS
location to any sonnet users in range
we've been developing the sonnet for
over a year now and are super excited
but as possibilities our prototypes are
now complete
and we're ready to move in a full
production that's where you come in
we're looking for your support to bring
this form of decentralized communication
into the mainstream sana is just the
beginning and we're so grateful for you
to be a part of it thank you for your
help
you
everyone loves outdoor activities but
with all that fun comes all that cleanup
that's why I created the rinse kit it's
like having a hose to go my name is
Chris Crawford and after countless hours
of developing I've created something
that is truly revolutionary rinse kit is
super easy to use to fill it simply
attach the Quick Connect adapter to any
sink or hose bib turn on the water it
will fill in 30 seconds attach the
nozzle and it's ready to go
there's no pumping or batteries required
it uses no moving parts and it will hold
the water pressure for months ok so
right now you're probably asking
yourself how in the heck does this thing
work inside the rinse kit there's a
sealed chamber when you connect it to a
hose bib the water pressure from your
home simply compresses the air in the
chamber the best part about this design
is that it essentially uses the air as a
spring there's nothing to wear out we
specifically designed the rinse kit to
be easy to carry and travel with it
holds 2 gallons of water which will
spray for over five minutes on the
center setting and for over 30 minutes
on the mist setting the lid detaches so
you can clean up and change on it you
can also use it as a cutting board or to
sit on as you rinse off your feet
rinse kit is bpa-free so it's safe to
drink out of
and it's extremely durable you really
can't hurt this thing
throughout the years mankind has pursued
their outdoor passions and has suffered
unnecessarily we've always felt that the
rinse kit could be the ultimate portable
shower if it could make its own hot
water but our early attempts to heat the
water in the rinse kit were a little
impractical finally we figured it out we
developed a heating probe that drops
into the tank and runs off a
rechargeable battery it quickly heats
the water in the tank to a nice
comfortable shower temperature
I even included a Smart USB port for
charging your devices we've had some
help from friends and family but we're
essentially still a startup company we
need your support to help develop the
engineering tooling and production on
this game-changing heater accessory by
backing us on Kickstarter I promise that
you're going to be one of the first
people to receive this ultimate heated
portable shower system and I'm
absolutely sure that the rinse kit will
make your life easier when it's time to
clean up
no more excuses it's time to get outside
and have some fun thanks so much for
hearing our story we hope that you'll
support us with one of the options below
and please make sure to share us with
your friends on social media
this is called Kissinger a device that
works as a kind of mobile phone kissing
that has been presented at the
conference on love and sex with robots
the idea is to be able to send kisses
from a distance that we can actually
feel in our skin thanks to the haptic
technology in fact the device is part of
a project by researcher ma Yan Jiang who
has aimed to help solve problems
inherent in long-distance relationships
with this unique product that offers
effective communication of deep emotions
and of intimacy through a multi
sensorial experience of communication on
the Internet the description is somewhat
grandiloquent but the truth is that the
solution is unique the cradles Docs in
which the iPhones are inserted we do not
know if it works with other smartphones
count in the lower part with a small
silicone pad the two people who
communicate via FaceTime or Skype have
the option to send a kiss not only with
text or emoticons but also physically
all you have to do is to kiss that pad
which will cause the kissing pressure
pattern to be recorded so that the
person receiving the kiss can place the
pad on the cheek or lifts on the other
side and can feel the same pressure
transmitted through small activators
that reproduce that pattern the Cosenza
is intended not only for human beings
but as a possible way to explore the
man-machine relationships of the future
the experiments that will be carried out
will also make this development trying
to pass the Turing test so that a
receiver of the kiss tries to decide if
the one who has kissed him at a distance
is a human or a machine that imitated
the pattern of a human kiss
thank you for watching our video
I'm Bowser from the Netherlands what I'm
about to tell you okay I'll take it from
here you see this great mind invented
something that will enhance your
festival experience imagine that you're
at the first day of a multi-day festival
event having a great time with your
lifelong friends

their cups you know the drill but then
party's over deep into the night you go
to your campsite crash into your tent
and don't bother to get into that
sleeping bag it's four o'clock and you
fall asleep only to wake when the
Blazing Sun pierces the night and this
giant sphere of hot searing gases rises

have the energy to make the most out of
their day
the Anana tent makes this possible it
uses two 170 t reflective covers to
drastically cool the tent down on the 25
degrees Celsius summer day conventional
tents heat up to 40 degrees Celsius
while the Anana keeps you cool at 27 in
this way you can sleep up to 3 hours
longer up to 3 hours this means you have
the energy to play laughs and bestow
let's take a look at the inside the
canopy effectively blocks the Sun
keeping it dark inside great for
sleeping in after a rough day and night
of festival activities with every tent
two pairs of 3d eye masks and earplugs
are included there are two windows for
extra airflow it has two pockets to
store your valuables there's a fan to
give you a nice little breeze it also
functions as a light and as a canopy
where shoes can be stored
the Anana tent is easy to set up and to
be stored again it is lightweight so you
can take it on all your adventures it
also functions as a backpack or not a
tents support the ocean cleanup
foundation of Bojan slots with 5% of its
net profits once we unable you to be the
best version of yourself day after day

rest that's why we're making this thing
we need your support for its
effectiveness minimum and start

elongate our legs and enhance the
femininity of our gear but we've also
developed a love-hate relationship with
them the sharp pains aches and cramps

a 2cm to a 9 cm heel these Heights were
selected after an online poll of over
