you see amazing isn't it this is the air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
Micro land ultralight it comes with it's
very own device for storage and charging
with an easy one-hand control from its
own where did the idea come from well
I'll show you look at this what an epic
day out of bonafide selfie time as they
say just need to squeeze a teeny bit no
problem oh never mind
ah more manageable group just two guys
actually they want to take a selfie to
remember this wonderful place well I
guess they can just describe the view to
their friends back home right okay one
more try this time a good old barbecue
outside on a sunny day with lots of
prints let's try the selfie stick
strategy still can't fit everybody in
annoying situations am i right we've all
been there buddy
that's how air selfie was born a perfect
team gathered together working in London
Milan and Shanghai to combine micro
flying technologies ultralight HD
cameras with in flight stability systems
err selfie can travel in a 20 meter
radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's
only 52 grams and it's locked into his
phone cover and recharges so what if the
guys had an air selfie with them they
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air
awesome what about the two explorers
they select the classic flying mode from
the three options available control
layer selfie through the app by holding
the phone horizontally and take both
memorable photos and videos and what
would have happened at the barbecue
enough with the squeezing just select
the selfie mode use only two buttons to
find the right distance to shoot and
take a great picture

electric wine opener go ahead and pop
one off today hi i'm mike scully creator
of the lever gear tool card I founded
lever gear to design products that solve
real problems look great and will last
forever we all have little projects that
pop up in life and they don't always
happen when our tools are handy it's
annoying to have to spend time chasing
down tools for a job that should take 10
seconds if you're like me it usually
ends up getting added to your to-do list
that's why we created the lever gear
tool card it's a multi-tool the size of
a credit card that has 40 different
tools it's always with you you can get
things done I like to be prepared to
handle any task but I also hate the idea
of carrying around a lot of extra stuff
a credit card size tool that could
disappear in my wallet seemed like the
perfect solution we developed the tool
card with a simple premise the real
estate in your pocket is precious so you
should own stuff that's actually worth
carries to begin our design process by
brainstorming all of the functions we
could pack into a credit card sized
multi-tool we also tested every card
that existed on the market
we thought a lot about the design and
layout of the tool card by nesting the
tools we were able to add tools and
reduce weight without sacrificing
strength we kept the edges smooth so it
feels great in your hand when you're
using the tools we chose not to have an
exposed blade so the tool card is TSA
compliant and it won't damage your
wallet instead we added a blade
protected by the can opener you can cut
cord but not your fingers the tool card
weighs only one ounce and slips easily
into your wallet so you won't notice it
until you need it or ditch the wallet
altogether the innovative money clip is
designed to snap on with a click and
disassemble with ease no extra tool is
required
no fasteners to lose so you can quickly
switch from wallet card to money clip
tool card is made in America from blade
quality 420 stainless steel which is
then heat treated for excellent strength
and hardness
it's then bead blasted for a
professional finish and laser etched for
rich permanent graphics the tool card
makes an awesome gift that will last a
lifetime and it's scheduled to ship
before Father's Day and graduation we've
put in a lot of time to make this tool
as good as it can be
please help us by supporting our
campaign and sharing it with your
friends thank you
you
