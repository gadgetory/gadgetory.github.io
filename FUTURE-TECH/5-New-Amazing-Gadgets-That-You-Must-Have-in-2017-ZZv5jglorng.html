capsules to use and how to mix them

same capsules can create completely
diverse scents the capsules are very
affordable so you don't have to be
scared to play around with them you like

hello everybody today we are proud to
announce a new exciting way to capture
sound
say hello to insta Mike the smartest
Mike on earth ready to record let me
show you how important sound is in our
lives and why insta my can change all
the recording how does your morning
sound will you crack the eggs the way
she taught you I followers today I'm
gonna show you my best egg recipe how
does fresh laundry sound can you capture
the flash of I I love you the voice can
you keep the thrill forever fresh

wings and it's gone unless you weave it
into song unless you catch it
hence it on the front Kara Mike this is
your passcode there Michael Jordan
sneaker it is your rhythm all around
blowing sound what sound were you
capture next I first thought about insta
Mike when I noticed I was missing a lot
of great sounds in my work but was in my
life
so about ear ago I decided to involve
friends and experts from the field to
create instant Mike from scratch in
stomach is a very small microphone with
the ability of onboard recording it's
waterproof and he has a lot of mountains
that's why I think is Martin the insta
Mike is time and it's been challenging
to design such a great quality
microphone in this form factor using the
latest in ultra low power digital signal
processing and MEMS microphone
technology we've been able to do just
that we're even building in wireless
connectivity so it'll be as easy as
possible for you to use as a video maker
I imagine how much easier it would be to
just put it on my subject and be free to
focus on the video I think everybody
will find their own way to use it
journalists bloggers sound designers
everybody who works with audio or simply
wants to capture the sound of the world
we keep pushing to make the best product
so you can make yours now we need your
help to make it happen to bring the
shared experience to success I think
