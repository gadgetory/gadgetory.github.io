and creator of the sky camp in 2009 my
family and I hit the road and covered
58,000 miles all across North America
over three years I was traveling with my
wife and two daughters and we weren't
satisfied with the comfort of a
traditional tent or the time to pitch it
we settled on a pop-up trailer but it
was a drag and a pain to set up after
going back home
I found it I camper and after many tests
prototypes and improvements on our
previous three models my team and I are
proud to have found the answer
introducing the sky camp the world's
first expandable hard shell rooftop tent
has featured in tech insider the Sunday
Times Lonely Planet insider design G
gadgets Mashable Asia and Business
Insider the sky camp is truly
exceptional it is a treehouse dream come
true except that it is bigger mobile and
more comfortable it is made for life on
the road so you can take off whenever
stop wherever and fall asleep looking up
at the stars the sky camp is of the
highest quality so you can keep camping
in your rooftop tent night after night
waterproof tent fabric a fiber
reinforced hard shell top aluminum or
stainless steel metal components to
prevent rust we did not sacrifice
quality for price the sky camp is
perfect for a family trip or a road trip
with friends it can fit two adults and
two children or three adults the
extension floor folds out to reveal a
comfortable king-size mattress made of
high density memory foam pillows and
bedding can conveniently be left inside
the tent when you close it worried about
weight high camper takes safety
seriously the floor is made of aluminum
honeycomb panels that are extremely
strong and can hold up to 900 pounds the
sky camp weighs only 150 pounds
including the ladder and mattress so two
people can easily mount it within a few
minutes its Universal mounting system
and lightweight make it compatible with
most crossbars
or
fracks we know how difficult and
annoying it can be to pitch a tent open
a pop-up trailer or soft top roof tent
only to have to pack it up the next
morning day after day the sky camp can
be set up easily in less than a minute
one person can open it on his or her own
and closing it is just as simple you
love your car and we wanted it to look
just as good with a rooftop tent mounted
on it the sky camp's fiber reinforced
hardshell is aerodynamic lightweight and
available in glossy black or white want
more customize your sky camp by adding
an awning to protect you from the rain
or Sun an annex room to hang out in or
store gear a rack to keep your shoes dry
and away from bugs and animals hanging
storage shelves or a wind deflector the
sky camp is my dream come true
and now I want to share it with you
embark on your own journey and follow
your dreams back this project and help
travelers around the world grow closer
to people and nature I've always been a
gypsy I've always loved the idea of
traveling light when I first experienced
the teardrop trailer I didn't really
know what to expect and I didn't think
that I'd fall in love by all means I
never expected to be so comfortable I
feel like I'm cheating when I'm
traveling in one of these teardrop
trailers because it's so comfortable and
warm there's electricity it's heating
there's a sound system I have a burst
sound system an all-inclusive kitchen
with everything that I need and it's
really fascinating to watch people's
reaction to the Teatro Caleb because I
think everyone really wants the idea of
comfort like simple comfort like this I
think the appeal of such simple
adventure you don't have to think about
anything nothing's over complicated the
one word I would probably use to
describe myself is freedom I do
everything around the idea of freedom
because I don't like being stuck
anywhere and I want to see what the
unknown has on offer but at the same
time I love luxury because I'm 28 and I
don't want to be setting up tents I
don't want to be cold but I hate hotels
because they're so restrictive you got
to carry your luggage back in full if
you're gonna check in their expense
if you want to change your mind last
minute about where you want to go you
can't two reasons why I don't like
spending too much fuel when I'm out
there exploring is I don't want to
really leave a big carbon footprint
you know I'm exploring the world because
I'm fascinated by it I don't want to
just spend all this fuel and feel like
I'm killing but that's the same time and
also money I don't want to spend all
this money when I'm going into venturing
because that suppose the experience mink
doesn't take that much fuel it almost
feels like there's nothing extra that
we're spending on the field who would I
recommend the link to anyone that loves
adventuring but in a simple style the me
gives you the necessities food and
shelter and then you have to find the
rest outside of yourself so like the
outdoors is the extension of your living
space which I really love
just to have a home on the road no
limits as to where you want to go no
time restraints
right circular windows slippers pillow
Doudna times to music us people summers
Northern Lights stargazing bunk bed for
a child or your luggage cow shoe bucket
blinds heating system comfortable
queen-size mattress mood lighting on
point
welcome to the kitchen gasps Bose sound
system salt and pepper gas burner
chopping board turns into cooler with a
drain hole nice water container cleaning
good tea party good plates and stuff
coffee maker right aerodynamic shape
solar panels ventilation Wi-Fi GPS
tracking I think I'm done though sweet
perfect timing
my wife we just finished the dishes we
can finish up this video I hope you
enjoyed and yes I would recommend the
mink traveler to anyone that wants
adventure and fun and not be restrained
by hotels or camping and wants a bit of
luxury in their lives

pass through to get from your apartment
