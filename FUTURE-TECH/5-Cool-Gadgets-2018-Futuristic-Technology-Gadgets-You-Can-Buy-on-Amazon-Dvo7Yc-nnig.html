immersive near eye display with
see-through capability that uses your
smartphone to project panoramic IMAX
like imagery add up to five times a
resolution of VR viewers
providing you a personal theater
experience anytime and anywhere
compatible with most modern smartphones
simply slide your phone into expanse
connect an optional controller or air
mouse and immerse yourself in your
favorite movies shows and apps in
stunning resolution hi I'm will founder
of expanse as a gamer I love the idea of
3d hands-on fully immersive
virtual-reality like the rift revived
but there just isn't enough good content
out for these devices and it'll take a
while before there is so with that in
mind I set to work designing a VR device
that would transform the way we use non
VR content like playing video games or
binge watching your favorite movies or
TV shows anyone who's watched a movie in
a gear VR or a rift knows how immersive
it is to watch a video in a life-size
virtual theater the current VR devices
just don't have the resolution needed
for movies and games why is that
well nageire VR each eye sees a separate
roundish image which uses less than half
from the screen worse the standard
rectangular a Spectre issue for videos
in most non VR content has to fit within
gear VR square aspect ratio wasting
another half of the pixels this is why
gear VR content is pixelated and suffers
from the so called screen door effect
there just aren't enough pixels but with
expanse each eye can see all of the
displays pixels providing up to 3.6
million pixels per eye almost twice the
resolution of a 1080p TV and five times
more than a movie in gear VR or a rift
but resolution is only half the battle
immersion also requires field of view
other near eye displays are described as
looking like say a 50-inch TV of eight
feet as you can see here this gives you
about a thirty degree
you'll review for comparison behind it
is a 10-foot projector screen which
provides a 64 degree field of view and
here is expanse and almost twice the
resolution and over 90 degrees field of
view this means you can catch your
favorite movie show or sports game on an
IMAX sized screen in full resolution
anywhere in your house or on the go
expanse uses your phone so you can
stream your content anywhere you can get
a cellular or Wi-Fi connection
we've also sourced a full HD display
cartridge that slides into expanse and
connects to your favorite HDMI device
and we're currently working on a 4k
AMOLED cartridge which would provide a
4k theater experience at 10% the cost of
a similar TV but this is only the
beginning
expenses head tracking and see-through
capability allow you to use it in new
and exciting ways with it's stunning
resolution expanse is the single best
way to experience new and immersive 360
content spans doesn't suffer from
pixelation or the so called screen door
effect which can ruin immersion drone
enthusiasts can watch a high-definition
real-time feed from their drones camera
overlaid on the real world letting you
pilot your drones while simultaneously
getting a first-person view of the
flight from the cockpit and gopro heroes
can show off their most recent
adventures the way they were meant to be
seen while HDR photography enthusiasts
can see their photos on-site in wide
field of view right when they take up
expanse also offers new and exciting
challenges for software developers to
begin making the first wave of apps that
utilize our unique see-through design
whether it's a heads-up display of GPS
or an augmented reality pet your
imagination set the limit for what
expanse can do we've been through
countless product design and prototype
iterations we finally arrived at a
design that is comfortable functional
and stylish we have production quotes
from multiple manufacturers including a
handful that are capable of moulding
encoding our unique
and should be ready to start production
in 12 weeks we're extremely excited to
share expansion the Kickstarter
community so please support us and help
make expanse a reality
blending seamless to virtual with the
real mad gaze brings you closer to the
future maneuver and navigate at your
fingertips see the possibilities and
feel with every touch swipe or pinch
Hey are you guys coming over yeah we're
wrong I'll see you in a bit okay
powerful interaction to you your glasses
and the environment
become one this is a true embodiment of
life work and entertainment Victor
you
presents this is often touted as a holy
grail of virtual reality but what is
presence his presence just feeling like
you're in another world well no I think
that's the bare minimum for me true
presence is about being a part of this
other world being aware of it as it is
aveer I'm Lachlan Wilson CTO and
co-founder of Furth and we are
presenting to you the world's first
consumer eye tracking virtual reality
had not displayed one of the keys to
this is our eyes communication for the
first time got your characters will
perceive your gaze how about you lock
eyes with a monster stare them down
well how about share a moment of eye
contact with a fellow hero or heroine
before they dive into peril gaze our
natural human reaction will become a
trigger for modern storytelling and
expand the possibilities of interactive
cinema - even in the field of healthcare
we enabled a boy with muscular dystrophy
to play music with his eyes and a 90
year old grandmother used our system to
remotely attempt to grandson's wedding
by a robot when she could not control
aim with your eyes accurately and faster
than with any other controller this
could give you a killer edge in intense
action games how I tracking works with
the speed of thought
both can enable a magical UI experience
where the information you're looking for
is in front of your eyes before you even
know it depth of field a key to presence
is a sense of immersion by rendering
realistic depth of field in the fovea
region and appropriately blurring the
periphery
when fovea - rendering is properly
adopted in the future it would be
possible to focus the GPU power where
the user is looking greatly reducing the
overall power required to render a scene
with no perceptible reduction in quality
we build a specialized state-of-the-art
eye tracking solution into a solid VR
hardware platform that boasts 42% more
pixels the current mainstream PC
headsets we back all this are with our
own compositing SDK and Auckland VR and
os VR support to leverage existing
content and ensure developers don't
waste their time developing for a closed
ecosystem as a ferb developer you will
have access to potentially up to 25
million users per month at 7,000
internet cafes across Japan and Korea
that are using our head mount display on
their high-end pcs we have finally
finished something that everyone here at
home is proud of and we are getting
really cheap our first lot to
Kickstarter backers and then to you via
developers around the world interested
in creating new experiences let's push
the boundaries of what is possible but

do you know what you're breathing
indoors do you think the air is clean at

indoors is about five times more
polluted than the air outdoors
do you wonder why you start coughing
when you get home or why you are having
an allergic reaction every time you
enter your laundry room it might be
volatile organic compounds that are
polluting your home or household items
and chemicals such as detergents
cosmetics carpets or even your romantic
soothing candles
I am I baby air a smart air quality
monitor and purifier I'm here to make
sure you and your family are breathing
clean fresh air alerting you every time
the air quality drops functioning as an
air station I allow you to see data from
iBaby air monitors near you for
comparison when I detect a decrease in
air quality I'll send an alert straight
to your phone and will automatically
start purifying the air with ions

suggestions to improve your lifestyle
I'll make sure you're living a happy
healthy life just like I did for this
