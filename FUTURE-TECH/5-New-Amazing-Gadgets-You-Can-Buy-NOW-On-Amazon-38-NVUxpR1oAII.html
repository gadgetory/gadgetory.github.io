ah
you
but it is a wrist-worn
subwoofer which is exactly what it
sounds like you put it on your wrist you
sync it up with this little dongle right
here plug that into your phone play
music it syncs up with the music and it
sends bass vibrations through your arm
so really the parts of place I met with
the company a couple of days ago and the
first thing that I asked was you know
why is this something that anybody would
possibly want and it's they basically
told me to try it out so I did and it's
kind of a neat thing it's supposed to
simulate the experience of going to a
live show and you know really feeling
the music in your body and you you do
you know did it vibrates your arm but
you feel it very very localized it's a
$200 device it's really pricey
essentially what they're saying is
anyone who's really an audiophile is you
know playing it spend a lot of money on
a pair of headphones so I guess why not
spend an extra two hundred dollars on a
wrist form subwoofer I don't really
think the technology is there yet it's
an interesting company it's really
interesting tech you know I know that
they're meeting with a lot of other
folks you know game developers music
companies and things like that in order
to build a tactic into system so it
could potentially make VR a more
immersive experience in the future but
right now this is about as close as
you're going to get and watch us today
it's $199 and the bass player
in 2007 Steve Jobs said that this was
the best input device that was 2007 this
is 2015 in 2015 we love our touchscreens
we take them everywhere we go and why
wouldn't we they're light they're
powerful and they're gorgeous
