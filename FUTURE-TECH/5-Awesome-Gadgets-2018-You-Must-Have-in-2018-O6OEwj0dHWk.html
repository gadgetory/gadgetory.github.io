mailbox four letters it's a mailbox
robot that can see when a package gets
dropped off and sends me a notification
through the app you Silla is like my own
teeny tiny little post office right
there by my front door but you Sela is
not a toy it's not an excuse to have yet
another connected device it's a
responsible way to protect and manage
the things that are meant just for me
the things that often get left out for
people who aren't me you sell out my
personal post purchase package and
postal concierge

with a few clicks of your mouse 3d print
a toy for your child in the comforts of
your own home what if you could create
gifts for your friends and minutes
introducing the 101 hero mini 3d printer
the most affordable 3d printer in the
world we've worked with the best in the
industry to ensure a compact and easy to
use design simply turn it on insert a
memory card and print anything
imaginable the beauty of the 101 here on
many is in its simplicity all you have
to do is download one of thousands of
lab tested G code files from our website
save it to your SD card and make it real
with one touch we think that everyone
should have access to 3d printing
technology and it's for this reason that
we've made the 101 hero mini the most
affordable way to 3d print the hero mini
uses a new technology to drive the
plastic extruding motor and we've come
up with many innovations in the
structure and design of the printer
itself with these adaptations you're
able to have the same functionality of a
high-end 3d printer but for a fraction
of the cost
meanwhile we've also worked hard to
ensure a safe design so the 101 hero
mini can be enjoyed by the young and all
the life the 101 hero mini represents an
entirely new medium for kids engineers
artists and makers
the first motorized expansion technology
system enabling a truly portable speaker
that can fit your pocket and play
amazing high-quality audio an innovative
coin system with a repositional adhesive
allows you to attach bump-out to any
surface imaginable to ensure you can
kick the party off at a moment's notice
bump-out is a true feat in engineering
we worked with some of the top audio
product specialists in the world to
design our proprietary expansion
technology bump-out combines a full
range driver passive radiator and
powerful battery into the smallest cabin
possible with a push of the button the
internal acoustic chamber activates the
passive radiator generating rich sound
and bass temp bumps bump out comes with
multiple coins that feature patinated he
