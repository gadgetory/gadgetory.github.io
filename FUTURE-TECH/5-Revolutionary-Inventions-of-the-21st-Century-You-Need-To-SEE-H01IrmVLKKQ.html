hi I'd like to tell you about a
revolutionary new backpack wearing a
conventional backpack means you can't
reach your stuff without the effort of
taking the whole backpack off so I
thought wouldn't it be great to have a
backpack that somehow brings your stuff
to the front without all the hassle of
unstrapping well I invented one it looks
just like a normal backpack except you
can swing it round
get your stuff
and be on your way it's simple easy and
totally new
Wolfpac is a revolutionary new concept
in backpack design it's a design that
gives quick and easy access but without
the hassle of taking it off setting it
down and putting it back on again
it makes crowded situations easier to
navigate great for work play and travel
you can swing it round and avoid the
crush this design helps keep your
valuables where you can see them and
with a pack still on you can sit
comfortably on trains buses ski lifts
wherever your journey takes you I've
moved the idea from the initial sketches
to detailed drawings computer aided
designs and 14 generations of prototypes
I've been joined by award-winning
industrial designers and we've
engineered a patent-pending new
technology we've combined the technology
with slick bag design and all the
features and quality you'd expect in a
great backpack we're working with
skilled bag makers handcrafting quality
backpacks with high performance
materials we're now at the stage where
the wolf pack is almost ready to go into
production and this is where we need
your help to fund the first production
run and guide the product development if
you'd like to help make this happen and
see a revolutionary bank pack that
offers better access more comfort and
greater security then join in become
part of the story and we'll make the
wolf pack a reality thank you
you
hi i'm ryan and i'm elias we are part of
the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it cleans to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we'd come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travellers wanting an easy
way to wash clothes while on the go
it's also simple to use you simply place
it water add some soap turn on the
built-in timer and walk away minutes
later your clothes are cleaner than ever
before sonic Stoke is designed for
travelers moms neat freaks looking for a
thorough cleanse and not just on clothes
by the way but on fruits and vegetables
to folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full size laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close sonic soak is your solution
sonic soap is ready to be shipped just
after our campaign ends we just need you
to help make it happen which means you
can have a cleaner almost anything and
practically no time once we end this
campaign successfully so please help us

experience clean like never before now
