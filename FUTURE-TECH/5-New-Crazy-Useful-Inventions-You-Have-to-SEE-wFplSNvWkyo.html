his Serbian small town war and I came in
Belgrade to study industrial design when
I was a young girl together with my
brother we will plant different kinds of
seeds in plastic caps I was a
fascinating with the growing with the
plans with the nature so I came up with
a great idea how to design something
that it's combining like product design
and some kind of nature element will
make a lamp that please first primary
function is to light the the living room
but then I put a grass in it so you have
various of combination with greens and
lighting
I would like to be those designers that
make high quality products but also I
would like to make her some design that
has some story to express some emotion
all my designs is inspired by simplicity
with form with object and my thoughts of
industrial design that needs to be in
minimalistic form so you don't need you
know the famous quotes is the less is
more so that is why the design is
substrate
I totally will be a painter one day some
famous painter like Leonardo or maybe
one God but also I really like technical
drawings and 3d models so when you work
like in painting and drawing you work
just in two dimensions but when you work
with industrial product you work in 3d
dimension and you you can make products
that you can see and touch so it gives
you more freedom to experience when you
normally want to plan something you will
plant in soil but with this product you
will plant just with water and with the
help of LED lights and that's why this
product is like combination with digital
the green colors is an typically proven
it feels relaxed super dyes and the
whole process of growing plants it has
been officials for people similar to
meditation
each product tells some kind of story
and this story grassland provides that
you need to stop and to think about
nature that will provide some balance
your inner balance so grass lamb gives
you that balance with nature so you have
that closer connection this kind of
product is suitable for family you know
children will be very interesting to
play with plants and parents will be
taught them how to grow something
for me design is art it's maybe it's
more than an hour it's a tool that
express my emotion and it's a great
connector with people
when was the last time you got excited
about a home theater experience and not
about the movie or game but about the
sound introducing spark oh the world's
first 720 degrees levitating home
theater system that can understand what
you say just say Spotify or the name of
a radio station Sparco will change
channels and play high-resolution audio
you can say DJ Sparco will play the
tunes you like it gets smarter the more
you listen
a revolutionary 720 degree acoustic
field is created when foreign non
electrostatic diaphragm drivers face
outward reducing audio distortion and
doubling the richness distance and
detail of your audio the levitating
tweeter speaker unimpeded by surface
friction faces upward providing
crystal-clear
high-pitched audio a full range woofer
faces downward perfectly balancing the
tweeter the world's first 720 degrees
levitating home theater system plus a
separate subwoofer providing the sort of
bass you feel in your bones hi I'm Alan
I'm the felt of a suite for decade I
work with some of the best audio
branding companies I was involved in
developing the most advanced audio
systems putting them into max production
and testing their sound quality
the most because I tested the more I
found there who lifts them up in the air
you always got better sound quality
because of zero friction helped to bring
out a speaker's best performers so in
2014 I meant it the first left-hand
speaker using magnet repulsion to lead
the speaker up in the air and we got a
patent from the USA Patent and Trademark
Office we kept on researching and
developing and started on this journey
of sparkle you can say TV or say mute to
enjoy dinner Sparco supports multi room
technology and it's also a smart
lighting system just say light Sparco
creates the perfect light and sound
environment it supports every moment
Sparco creates a mesh network of Wi-Fi
extenders you will never lose Wi-Fi
again anywhere around your house Sparco
is also a communication channel simply
say a name to talk to friends live
anywhere around the world say pick up to
answer any calls say professor to
conduct a global classroom say help to
call out to all your contacts in an
emergency say company to conduct a
teleconference Sparco connects people
around the world in real-time all you
have to do is just say Sparco

after having a successful Kickstarter we
are back introducing gravity chopsticks
2.0 gravity chopsticks are the world's
first chopsticks that you can rest on
any side keeping the eating area
sanitary our chopsticks are a major
evolution over traditional chopsticks
our design removes the need for
chopstick breasts by using the force of
gravity to levitate the eating area from
touching the resting surface there are
times when your bowl or plate is
unavailable to rust or chopsticks on
gravity chopsticks eliminate this
problem for you
the poor sign of design prevents them
from rolling while the texturized design
allows for better gripping I'm Dan Tran
and I'm the inventor of gravity
chopsticks I redesigned gravity
chopsticks to be a seamless one-piece
design
born from thermoplastic polymers this
gives them high impact strength and
toughness gravity chopsticks have
heightened resistance allowing
dishwasher stations making gravy
chopsticks perfect for everyday use
gravity chopsticks are clouds to be made
in the USA back this project can be the
first to experience the new and
modernized octopus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
