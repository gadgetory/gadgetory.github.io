2016 terror
combat competition the company is in the
process of implementing orders from the
Israeli forces every year in the u.s.
more than 150 billion is spent in R&amp;amp;D
and acquisition of better solutions to
secure our troops the total global
aerial drone market by itself is
expected to reach 10 billion in 2017
over the next several years the military
robotic and drone sector will continue
to lead all other sectors and drone
spending invest in guro body
Kika the robot that will transform the
way conflicts are being solved Duke no
boots on the ground
we're explorers we're creating the tools
to inspire a whole new generation of
filmmakers
the first word that comes to mind is
dependable it's capable add John
every detail has a purpose every ounce
save increases performance
at the heart it's got a synapse flight
intelligence with purpose giving pilots
exquisite control
all our tools they have an honesty in
engineering a sense of design simplicity
functionality you feel the power the
control the agility every aspect of this
machine understands your needs

building block for movement movement

the Mavic pro is not just a new drone
it's a whole new type of drone we merged
power and smart features making it easy
for everyone to fly and create beautiful
images the toughest challenge for us was
to find the sweet spot between form and
function when engineering the folding
arms we wanted to save as much space as
possible we really wanted to make it
quick to unfold and leave enough room
for the powerful processors and system
system this took several attempts and
many many prototypes
in one of our earlier prototypes the
arms took up way too much space when
folded almost two-thirds of the entire
volume combined with the space that we
needed for the internals
this meant the Mavic was much larger
than we wanted and another attempt the
amazonian took up half the volume but
there's a lot of wasted space in between
body and arms eventually we solve this
problem and creates an easy flick to
unfold mechanism seem from above the
Phenom sit flush against the body when
folded we carved out two indents at the
rear of the airframe to fit the motors
saving additional space the rear arms
fold out in a three dimensional motion
and snap into place in one sweep with
this design you can have your magic Pro
unfolded in under five seconds powerful
components generate a lot of heat
especially when they're placed close
together so for the first time ever on a
DJI drone we integrated a heat sink at
the base made from Newseum aluminum
alloy and a centrifugal fan behind the
gimbal the fan pulls in air from the
front of the aircraft and channels it
across the heatsink participating heat
we wouldn't go through all this trouble
without making sure you have a great
camera we spent thousands of hours
trying to region ear and shrink the
stabilization technology found in our
phantom series one of the major
challenges we ran into when making a
stabilized camera this small was a
stiffness of the electrical wires the
mechanics the structure and the
brushless motors had to be specifically
engineered to take this into account
plus it's the first DJ camera that's
able to rotate 90 degrees for portrait
shots we also wanted a remote controller
for the Matic pro that would feel
natural and familiar in people's hands
so they would be more confident when
they fly that's how we came up with a
small controller that expands with a
pair of grips these grips also clamp
your phone keeping all of your controls
in easy reach the Mavic pro concentrates
some of our most advanced technologies
into one compact body it's an incredible
tool to turn everyday moments into
fantastic art wherever you go

I'm Derek I'm passionate about John's
and I've meant managable wanna fly
John's but found them really hard to
control I want to help because I feel
that they are missing out to the fun of
arrow filming that's why we came out
with the idea of ghost this is a
traditional remote controller it has
many switches and knobs which can be
very hard to master one bad news and a
mistake can be very expensive
most of the joints also require
assembling but not everyone has a time
or skills to do that Ghost comes
preassembled and is ready to fly right
out of the box our app makes it super
easy to pilot simply tap unlock then
take off and ghost will rise and hover
now tap a spot on the map and ghost will
fly there immediately to get it back
just hit return and ghost will take the
shortest route back to its takeoff point
press land and ghosts will descend and
land gently for advanced control tap
hover to make ghost hold the current
spot and enter the micro control mode
here you can adjust ghosts direction
speed camera angles and more not only is
ghosts user-friendly it's designed with
quality parts and as great features and
performance what's really cool about the
ghost though is it's customized ability
with respect to both hardware and
software one project that I'm working on
is mounting this RP lidar unit from Robo
peak on the ghost rope giving it the
ability to sense its surroundings with
the data from the wide art the ghost
will be able to detect obstacles like
trees and buildings and adjust its
flight path is necessary I'm also really
looking forward to developing the ghost
SDK which includes libraries for both
Java and c-sharp I also see some awesome
integration possibilities with input
devices like bleep motion my oh and my
own device attacked one of my passions
is to travel and taking photos of the
world around me I always have wanted to
own an affordable drone that then gives
me great images and videos from the sky
the ghost with gimbal in combination
with my GoPro works really well I have
created amazing photos and videos that
could not have made before as an amateur
photographer and that's really great
what's great about the ghost is that
super easy to fly I'm excited to be one
of the first users of the ghost what I
like about ghosts it's so easy to fly
the control is really simple and I can
do it all on my phone
I don't have to worry anymore about the
control and I can just focus on what I
see the ghost team members come from
both the US and China and have a very
diverse background in how we're in
soccer we want to make those accessible
to everyone and help people create
amazing aerial videos we have finalized
the design and now we need your support
to take those to mass production and
bring the cost down tab now and let's
make ghost the world's easiest to fly
arrow filming drum available to everyone
deep passion for uncompromised image
quality is the simple philosophy behind
the zenmuse x7 together with the inspire
- it marks the next evolution in DJ eyes
aerial imaging technology the inspire -
has become a standard aerial platform
used on film sets around the globe the
new Zen music 7 transforms it into the
world's first fully integrated aerial
platform featuring a super 35 millimeter
sensor for video recording the x7 offers
video resolution of up to 6 K a high
resolution not only provides incredible
detail but also allows reframing
the raw and ProRes codec integrates
seamlessly into industry standard
post-production workflows 14 stops of
dynamic range enhanced grading
flexibility by preserving detail in
shadow and highlight areas the launch
sensor also enables filming with a
cinematic shallow depth of field and low
image noise
an ISO range of 102 25600 makes it
suitable for use in all lighting
situations the new DJI cinema color
system consists of two parts an updated
D log curve for extended dynamic range
and a D gamut RGB color space for
preserving maximum color information
when I first took a look at this x7
footage there really has a color
fidelity there so the dynamic range of
colors that it can reproduce and I can
push the grades around pretty hard and I
still don't get noise with this camera
the superb picture quality of the
zenmuse x7 is an asset on every film set
a new AI mode makes it easy to match
with different cameras used for TV
series commercials and documentaries as
well as for feature films DJI also
proudly introduces the world's first
aerial lens mount system the DL mount
the ultra short flange distance allows a
compact lens design DJI offers for prime
lenses specifically built for the x7
with focal lengths of 16 24 35 and 50
millimeters made with carbon fiber
they're lightweight and durable
the advanced optical elements deliver
brilliant image quality the x7 also
captures stunning DNG RAW or JPEGs still
pictures with a resolution of 24
megapixels with its sturdy build the x7
was made for professional cinematography
and ambitious aerial stills
photographers it replaces large and
difficult to use aerial solutions even
on high-end film productions when I
think of the x7 I just think of just the
endless amount of possibilities that
cinematographers and directors can craft
their movie with shots that they may not
have even thought was possible before
the Zen music 7 is a top-of-the-line
professional filmmaking tool making it
possible for creators to focus on
capturing their unique vision of the
world a world that now looks better than
ever before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
