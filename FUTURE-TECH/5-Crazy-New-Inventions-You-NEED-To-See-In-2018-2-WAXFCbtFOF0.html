time in our bets and in our cars but for
some reason our cars have climate
control and can now park and drive
themselves while their beds have stayed
the same for hundreds of years at smart
divan we believe it's time for our beds
to catch up to the 21st century
introducing the smart new bed breeze the
world's first dual zone climate control
self-making bed well possibly the single
biggest innovation in our bedrooms in
the last 100 years in addition to making
the bed for you
the breeze lets you select your
preferred temperature for each side of
the bed independently using the
smartphone app avoiding all future
arguments about room temperature we were
able to achieve both climate control and
self making bed features through our
patent-pending inflatable sheet placed
seamlessly between your duvet and duvet
cover no more sweaty nights spent
regulating your body temperature by
leaving a leg out of the duvet it's time
we give sleep the attention it deserves
we all know that a good night's sleep
will leave us happier healthier and more
productive
in 2016 smart duet amazed the world by
introducing the first app controlled
self making man this year we wanted to
make smart duvet even better by doing
more than making the bed 40 we wanted to
improve your nights as well that's how
the smart duvet breeze was born you and
your partner can benefit from a better
night's sleep
by individually adjusting the
temperature with your smart phone you
can even refresh or preheat your bed a
few minutes before sleep to enjoy the
perfect temperature when you get in then
the breeze is also a great way to reduce
your energy consumption by heating and
cooling your body directly instead of
the entire house
it will also eliminate arguments over
room temperature or who will have to
make the bed keeping your sheets dry and
oxygenated will also eliminate potential
dust mites in terms from the bed truly

the breeze need the vision and support
of the crowdfunding community to come to
life we thank you for your support
without which we would not exist
this is called cosenza a device that
works as a kind of mobile phone kissing
that has been presented at the
conference on love and sex with robots
the idea is to be able to send kisses
from a distance that we can actually
feel in our skin thanks to the haptic
technology in fact the device is part of
a project by researcher ma Yan Jiang who
has aimed to help solve problems
inherent in long-distance relationships
with this unique product that offers
effective communication of deep emotions
and of intimacy through a multi
sensorial experience of communication on
the internet the description is somewhat
grandiloquent but the truth is that the
solution is unique the cradles Docs in
which the iPhones are inserted we do not
know if it works with other smartphones
count in the lower part with a small
silicone pad the two people who
communicate via FaceTime or Skype have
the option to send a kiss not only with
text or emoticons but also physically
all you have to do is to kiss that pad
which will cause the kissing pressure
pattern to be recorded so that the
person receiving the kiss can place the
pad on the cheek or lips on the other
side and can feel the same pressure
transmitted through small activators
that reproduce that pattern the
cassandra' is intended not only for
human beings but as a possible way to
explore the man-machine relationships of
the future the experiments that will be
carried out will also make this
development trying to pass the Turing
test so that a receiver of the kiss
tries to decide if the one who has
kissed him at a distance is a human or a
machine that imitated the pattern of a
human kiss does this situation look
familiar

live well hi I'm David and this is
Colleen and we're the founders of Munna

something about it together we developed
a product that not only gets you to
sleep faster but also helps you get the
best sleep until it's time for you to
wake up

temperature is the key to good sleep to
fall asleep our body needs to cool down
and lower temperatures help us get a
better sleep quality when we wake up it
is the opposite our body needs to warm
up and I have plays a critical role in
this temperature regulation that's why
I'm una improves your sleep by
regulating your pillow temperature
simply place the device in your bedside
table insert the pad into your
pillowcase and use the app to set the
wakeup time the temperature of the pad
is regulated through a water circulation
system which cools down as you lay in
bed to help you fall asleep faster sleep
and environment sensors combined with
machine learning help understand your
perfect sleeping pattern and regulate
the temperature accordingly when it's
time when I will gently warm up and wake
you at naturally with the app you will
get key insights on the sleep and how to
improve it further we believe that is
not about how long you sleep but how
well you sleep so by improving your
