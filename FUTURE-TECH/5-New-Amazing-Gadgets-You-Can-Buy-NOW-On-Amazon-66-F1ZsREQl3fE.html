yes a team of Swedish neurologists is
currently searching for a cure
this is a cue ball it's a hard rubber
reaction ball with a moderately erratic
bounce that means if I bounce it to
waist height
it'll deflect up to 18 inches
horizontally forces me to watch and
react to each and every bounce but it's
not too erratic I don't have to chase it
all over the room
so I can bounce the ball really quickly
faster I go the more challenging it is
but it also keeps me at the best of my
ability and keeps my brain fully focused
my mind wanders I'm going to drop this
ball there are two core elements are
exercises to be done using the cue ball
the first is called bouncing catch you
take one or two cue balls and you bounce
them to waist height alternating hands
as you go you try to go as fast as you
can you count how many bounces you can
do in 60 seconds to keep track of how
you're progressing it trains I hand
coordination vision and reaction time
the faster the better the next exercise
trains peripheral vision if you think
about it the center of our vision the
one we used to read with is really quite
small
everything else is peripheral vision so
we can train that we expand our visual
awareness there's very little on the
market that will do that but the cue
ball does it really fast and efficiently
and that this is how it works you do the
same exercise again but this time
instead of watching the balls as you
bounce them you fix your focus on a
point on the ground and you bounce the
cue balls around that fixed point
they're erratic and they're bouncing and
they're small you have to track it with
your peripheral vision and catch it with
your hands you know increase your
confidence in the ability to do that and
as you do it faster and more your brain
will automate that skill so you don't
have to think about it anymore you will
just react and you'll react quickly the
cue ball adapts to any one skill level
you can go slow or you can go fast it'll
work with children as young as five
years old
all the way to the elderly it'll make
driving your car a better experience
you'll be able to see more of what's
going on around you if you're an athlete
you'll be able to see hit and catch
better if you're a student or an adult
you'll just simply get better at eye
hand coordination you'll see better and
your reaction times will become much
faster by some cue balls and try these
exercises you'll be amazed at the
results follow me on Facebook follow me
on Twitter there's lots more information
where this came from
thanks for watching
