hey i'm dan and these are locks about
three years ago i had a vision of
crafting wooden sunglasses with editor
chopping down a tree and just recently
with my partner tim's help we did just
that believe it or not these shades are
made entirely from 500 year old wood
from the depths of the Great Lakes these
Timbers sunk during the logging boom but
actually increase in strength while
underwater recovering them gives us
access to some of the most beautiful
old-growth wood on the planet while
preserving our forests no trees are
chopped down in the making of locks
but we didn't stop there we wanted the
strongest and most form-fitting frames
for this ancient wood
ten layers a super strong old growth
wood cross-grain impressed into amazing
Ponder's that wrap your face for the
perfect fit and it comes in three sizes
everybody can say yes to sustainable
style well almost everyone
we need your help so that we can adapt
our frames to receive prescription
lenses as well we've already spoken with
a large distributor who wants to bring
lock frames to stores across North
America if they're prescription ready
and you're also supporting economic
sustainability we design create build
buy and sell in the same communities as
you because we manufacture retail in
North America
check out our early bird Awards for an
amazing price on a pair of blocks thanks
for your support
