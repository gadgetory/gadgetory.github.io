to inspire a whole new generation
the first word that comes to mind is
dependable capable agile
every detail has a purpose every ounce
saved increases performance and removes
barriers
at the heart it's got a synapse light
control
intelligence with purpose giving pilots
exquisite control
all our tools they have an honesty an
engineering a sense of design simplicity
functionality
you feel the powers of the control the
agility every aspect of this machine
understands your needs
- pre-crime stabilization with the
building block from movement movement
leads inevitably to flight
introduced because the hate
the Mavic pro is not just a new drone
it's a whole new type of drone we merged
power and smart features making it easy
for everyone to fly and create beautiful
images the toughest challenge for us was
to find the sweet spot between form and
function when engineering the folding
arms we wanted to save as much space as
possible
we really wanted to make it quick to
unfold and leave enough room for the
powerful processors and system system
this took several attempts and many many
prototypes
in one of our earlier prototypes the
arms took up way too much space one
folded almost two thirds of the entire
volume combined with the space that we
needed for the internals this meant
fanatic was much larger than we wanted
in another attempt the amazonian took up
half the volume but there's a lot of
wasted space in between body and arms
eventually we felt this problem and
create an easy click to unfold mechanism
seemed from above the cinema sit flush
against the body when it's folded we
called out to index at the rear of the
airframe to fit the motors saving
additional space the rear arms fold out
in a three-dimensional motion and snap
into place in one sweep with this design
you can have your magic Pro unfolded in
under five seconds powerful components
generate a lot of heat especially when
it placed close together so for the
first time ever on the DJI drone we
integrated the heat sink of the base
lead form using aluminum alloy and a
centrifugal fan behind the goodwill
the fan pulls in air from the front of
the aircraft and channels it across the
heatsink dissipating heat we wouldn't go
through all this trouble without making
sure you have a great camera we spent
thousands of hours trying to re-engineer
and shrink the stabilization technology
found in our phantom series one of the
major challenges we ran into when making
a stabilized camera this small with a
stiffness of the electrical wires the
mechanics the structure and the
brushless motors had to be specifically
engineered to take this into account
plus it's the first DJI camera that's
able to rotate 90 degrees for portrait
shots we also wanted a remote controller
for the Matic pro that would feel
natural and familiar in people's hands
so they would be more confident when
they fly that's how we came up with a
small controller that expense with a
pair of grips these grips also type your
phone keeping all of your controls in a
reach
the Mavic Pro concentrates some of our
most advanced technologies into one
compact body it's an incredible tool to
turn everyday moments into fantastic art
wherever you go
you
I'm Derek I'm passionate about John and
I've met managable wanna fly John but
found them really hard to control I want
to help because I feel that they are
missing out to the fun of arrow filming
that's why we came out with the idea of
ghosts
this is a traditional remote controller
it has many features enough which can be
very hard to master
one bad move enemies take can be very
expensive most of the joints also
require assembling but not everyone has
a time or skill to do that Ghost comes
preassembled and is ready to fly right
out of the box our app makes it super
easy to pilot simply tap unlock then
take off and ghost will rise in hover
now tap a spot on the map and ghosts
will fly there immediately to get it
back just hit return and ghost will take
the shortest route back to its takeoff
point press land and ghost will descend
and land gently for advanced control
task cover to make ghost hold the
current spot and enter the micro control
mode here you can adjust ghosts
Direction speed camera angles and more
not only is ghost user friendly it's
designed with quality parts
and as great features and performance
what's really cool about the dosa
that's customizability with respect to
both hardware and software one project
that I'm working on is mounting this RP
lidar unit double peak on the ghost rope
giving it the ability to sense it's
around with the data from the wide are
the ghosts will be able to detect
obstacles like trees and buildings and
adjust the flight path as necessary
I'm also really looking forward to
developing the DOS SDK which includes
libraries for both Java and c-sharp I
also see some awesome integration
possibilities with input devices like
leap motion bio and my own design attack
one of my passions is to travel and
taking photos of the world around me I
always have wanted to own an affordable
drum that then gives me great images and
videos from the sky the ghost with
gimbal in combination with my GoPro
works really well I have created amazing
photos and videos that could not have
made before as an amateur photographer
and that's really great what's great
about the ghost is that super easy to
fly I'm excited to be one of the first
users of the ghost what I like about
ghosts it's so easy to fly the control
is really simple and I can do it all on
my phone I don't have to worry anymore
about the control and I can just focus
on what I see the guilty members come
from both the US and China and have a
very diverse background however it's up
here we want to make those accessible to
everyone
I help people create amazing aerial
videos
we have finalized the design and now we
need your support to take those to mass
production and bring the clock down tap
now and let's make out the world's
easiest to fly arrow filming job
available to everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
