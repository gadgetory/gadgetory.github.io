hi i'm mike scully creator of the lever
gear tool card I founded lever gear to
design products that solve real problems
look great and will last forever
we all have little projects that pop up
in life and they don't always happen
when our tools are handy it's annoying
to have to spend time chasing down tools
for a job that should take 10 seconds if
you're like me it usually ends up
getting added to your to-do list that's
why we created the lever gear tool card
it's a multi-tool the size of a credit
card that has 40 different tools it's
always with you so you can get things
done I like to be prepared to handle any
task but I also hate the idea of
carrying around a lot of extra stuff a
credit card size tool that could
disappear in my wallet seemed like the
perfect solution we developed the tool
card with a simple premise the real
estate in your pocket is precious so you
should own stuff that's actually worth
carrying the began our design process by
brainstorming all of the functions we
could pack into a credit card sized
multi-tool we also tested every card
that existed on the market we thought a
lot about the design and layout of the
tool card by nesting the tools we were
able to add tools and reduce weight
without sacrificing strength we kept the
edges smooth so it feels great in your
hand when you're using the tools we
chose not to have an exposed blade so
the tool card is TSA compliant and it
won't damage your wallet instead we
added a blade protected by the can
opener so you can cut cords but not your
fingers the tool card weighs only one
ounce and slips easily into your wallet
so you won't notice it until you need it
or ditch the wallet altogether
the innovative money clip is designed to
snap on with a click and disassemble
with ease no extra tool is required
no fasteners to lose so you can quickly
switch from wallet card to money clip
tool card is made in America from blade
quality 420 stainless steel which is
then heat treated for excellent strength
and hardness
it's then bead blasted for a
professional finish and laser etched for
rich permanent graphics
the tool cart makes an awesome gift that
will last a lifetime and it's scheduled
to ship before Father's Day and
graduation we've put in a lot of time to
make this tool as good as it can be
please help us by supporting our
campaign and sharing it with your
friends thank you
