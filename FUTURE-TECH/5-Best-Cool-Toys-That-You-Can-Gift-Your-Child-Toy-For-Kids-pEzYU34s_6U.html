robotics we bring robots to life as
animated characters with facial
expressions physical moving gestures
conversational interaction they can look
at you and be your friend that's our
goal
professor I'm Sonya just the story the
times right now to make an educational
consumer robot that is affordable that
everybody could have in the home your
own personal genius
you have cloud connectivity in this
amazing software that we built on this
smart device he has natural language
speech processing with the cloud he can
trigger our activities on the iPad like
videos and interactive games let's skip
the green sign ring we all know that the
human being form better the more senses
you open up near my body we have this
visual communication between you and the
robot then we have the auditory one and
then while using your finger with the
iPad and interacting with him at the
same time it's opening up more areas of
the brain so you're much more adept to
learn one thing says really behind
everything we've done with Einstein is
entertainment education and
entertainment put into law when he
teaches you he teaches you everything
the science fact in a way that's
digestible very easy to understand if
you ask him what the weather is he'll
tell you the weather but with a
scientific fact professor what's the
weather like in service conditions in
Charlotte Tabrizi the current
temperature outside is 70 degrees with a
low of 41 degrees by the way not to put
myself out of a job but you can tell the
temperature by counting the jobs of the
corrected he's always trying to record
you to learn to reach to grow just like
the realize that he explains everything
in very simplistic terms he walked like
Einstein talks like Einstein has I find
spatial motions most of all I find
personality professor I heard you good
jokes lately stop me if you've heard
this one
and I on meeting Adam on the street and
said he has lost an electron the Adam
asks are you sure the ion replies I am
positive the technology is often now
very cold and socially isolating by
bringing an animated character into our
physical world
we're humanizing the technology instead
of dehumanizing the human professor
Iceland has an amazing set of facial
expressions he'll smile or frown or
fellas forehead he'll stick his tongue
out it makes people want to interact
with it it makes people want to use it
it makes them feel friendly comfortable
especially when you're learning
something if you're learning something
new having an emotional connection with
the robot is really important tell me
about the brain melting bringing 100
billion neurons the human brain is
Predacon clicks not not for something
that looks like a big wrinkly sponge
it's hard to make animated characters
it's hard to make robot and the two
together require an extra push will
crowdfunding professor Einstein because
we want to reach people who know who
care who are like us dreamers and if you
can get behind this task is Hanson
robotics can change the world
introducing pixel play pixel play takes
your smartphone and turns it into a pond
kids camera it has rubber handles
working knobs for pretend play a
protective touch sensitive screen and a
working shutter button pixel play also
features childproof latches and an
adjustable clamp to fit a wide variety
of smartphone it's easy simply plug in
the headphone jack and that powers the
camera shutter button
use the adjustable clamp to securely fit
your phone double check that the phone
lenses lined up now just tuck the wires
in and close the door if it's the
majority of all standard sized
smartphones both Android and Apple as
far back as the iPhone 4 the included
iOS app features fun activities where
kids can make silly faces or go on
scavenger hunts
to learn about colors numbers and shapes
through photography the included
activity sheets get your kids active and
creative The Color Me scavenger hunt
like for a great day for the kids in
your life the included sticker sheet
will allow your kids to decorate and
personalise their pixel play camera you
can even make your own photo booths with

do-it-yourself props pixel play turn
your smartphone into a fun kids camera
my name is Tracy Howell and I'm from
Overland Park Kansas
my son Britain is six years old and has
autism
so I'm Eileen I'm Charlie's mom Charlie
the little boy who is three years old is
severely autistic what's great about
maker is that my son immediately
connected with this robot this this ball
that was running around and coming back
to him and responding to his call when I
saw Charlie playing hide-and-seek with
it I mean that's something that a
neurotypical kid we just kind of do
anyway but Charlie doesn't usually do
that I've noticed my son had a very
rough day at school today he had some
really challenging times that came home
and took 30 minutes to spend with lekha
and has a much more calm and relaxed
child I didn't get shown hey there's
your proof but it's a pretty remarkable
product and to have it in the home of
the upstanding I'm gonna dismiss I know
and together we want to have exceptional
children live exceptional night I'll
tell you we created this little guy look
at meet Lika the first robotic
interactive smart toy designed
specifically for children with special
needs children with autism live in a
world where they are constantly
overwhelmed with sensory stimulation it
is often hard for them to connect to
other people or focus on a single
activity for a long time that's why
parents and therapists often use
reinforcers teach the children for
summit will be music for others colors
and lights or just vibrations using
these reinforces teach rules and
guidelines for the children is paramount
as it helps them understand and interact
with the world around them
Leckie's unique strength is in combining
both the activity and the reinforcer
within one toy like I can play music
move around change colors and even has a
screen to display images icons or
emoticons this makes the child more
motivated and engaged because their
attention is focused on the toy and the
task at hand not just the reinforcer
lekka has been tested with more than a
hundred children in France and in the
u.s. it's been trialed at home with
parents with therapists and specialized
centers and hospitals and the results
are quite simply amazing
this could be a great great tool for
therapists to connect with these kids
keep them engaged which is the second
very difficult thing to do and use it to
connect and teach them we're really
seeing that we have something that will
truly make an impact on the whole
community working with exceptional
children and that's the data that they
collect and passes back to our
monitoring platform identifying what's
the next step in therapy or what is
something that maybe the child is
mastered it would be remarkable to be
able to share that data and also be able
to share that with educators now we're
actually getting into the field of
technology and how it can work with
individuals with autism how it can
empower therapists to work with those
individuals and ultimately I believe
will help us from a research perspective
nikka is not just the toy it's truly an
advocate in that ed and we are working
hard to bring you the best application
like a we'll have numerous apps and
activities available on the App Store
right from the start and you absolutely
developed and released continuously it's
important to us that each child makes
the most out of his amazing toy but it's
really more than just a toy it's a
companion an interactive robot and a
wonderful educational tool
it's lekha from the beginning of the
project we went to schools special
education schools and I was seeing kids
playing with the robot and really loved
it and I wanted to go further and make
the project feel I haven't seen it
anywhere else besides you guys with lega
there are some of course after games but
nothing that is a motion sensored or
nothing that is really interactive with
the child in that respect I think that
like I was really coming upon something
new and inspirational for children we
really believe that we have to get this
technology into the children's hands as
quickly as possible and that's why we
are here to ask you to give us a hand
you can help us by spreading the word
and if you are interacting with
exceptional children
people around you are you can order
later now they change traditions to play
into Hill and that's exactly what we are
going to do with love from the look at
him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
