the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body

empower people to reach their goals

it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a

the gym and combines them into one
solution

strong the posts are spaced evenly apart
on both sides so you can simulate any
exercise movement and quickly adjust
difficulty the base is made wide enough
to stand comfortably during your workout
and we even added a layer of non-slip
material to assure you stay in place the
bands were customized for this concept
and can handle any height there's even
cloth in the bands to protect you simply
clip in to get started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
slide providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
uppers we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor can
increase the workout the body boss is
