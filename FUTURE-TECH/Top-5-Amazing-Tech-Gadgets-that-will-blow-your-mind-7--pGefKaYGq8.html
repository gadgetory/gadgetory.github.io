rechargeable nightlight that you can
control with your phone or tablet it's
the only smart nightlight that offers 16
million color options precise light
dimming custom programmable timers and a
motion activated sensor oh did we
mention it's portable Oni has a safer
chargeable battery that lasts up to
eight hours finally a modern nightlight
that looks great
and offers functionality that you
actually want bomi is way more than just
a nightlight hi my name is Mitch I'm a
product designer for a company called
human scope the last year the team and I
have been working on something called
foamy only is a smart rechargeable
nightlight we ran a campaign on
Kickstarter last year and it did really
well now we're about to enter production
and we've teamed up with IndieGoGo to
offer in demand so we can sell it at a
discounted rate one last time we've
designed only to be safe and portable so
we've incorporated these folding prongs
on the back so that you can place it on
a flat surface only has a built-in
rechargeable battery but it's not a
dangerous lipo battery it's an iron
phosphate which is very stable and it
won't catch fire as a nightlight the
Omi's battery will last up to 10 hours
or you can crank the output and use it
as accent lighting for three hours the
great thing about omie is it's bluetooth
enabled so it works with our iOS and
Android app that we've developed with
the app you can dim or brighten the
light you can choose between over 60
million color options you can enable
motion detection and you can set it to
turn on for five seconds of ten or
however long you want you can also
program up to eight smart timers
perrault me the smart timers allow you
to turn the light off or dim it down at
a certain time or you can turn the light
on or have it change color at a
different time we've also gone above and
beyond with the
Dex of the design we've incorporated
this elegant aluminum bezel which can be
used to turn the light on or dim it or
turn it off completely
I'm really excited about what we
accomplished in the last year and I know
it took a little longer than expected
but we think we have a great product and
we can't wait to start shipping it to
you
you

this is Nora a smart snoring solution
that you want to have in your bedroom
this is you well rested and fresh but
you used to be more like this thanks to
your outstanding vocal performance you
got a lot of this yep your snoring is
putting a damper on things at home and
you know it can increase the chance of
strokes and heart attacks so you go out
there and try all kinds of anti snore
products and then you meet Nora using
Nora is simple just pick your favorite
pillow put the expander in your
pillowcase tap Nora and go to sleep when
you start snoring
Nora gently moves your head so you stop
before your partner wakes up the science
of it is simple when you fall asleep
your neck and throat muscles relax this
decreases the size of the airway and
causes the vibrations the slight
movement of your head stimulates these
muscles and opens the airway
so you can breathe normally again the
best part is you won't feel a thing you
can sleep in any position or on any part
of the pillow our patent-pending design
is just as effective
everything about nora is designed to
make it a delightful addition to your
bedroom the organic shape is inspired by
natural objects and the smooth matte
finish looks great in any setting nora
comes in a beautiful portable bag
equipped with the rechargeable battery
making it easy to use on the go we
created Nora because we were frustrated
with the impractical and expensive
products out there a year of obsessive
designing prototyping and testing has
brought us here the result is unlike any
other snoring solution and elegant
device with the seamless experience now
ready for mass production
Noora bless that and more this we can't
wait to bring silent sleep to you we are
introducing the sense eight the next
generation of all-in-one smart home
security device the device is truly a
piece of art where environmental
monitoring sensors are precisely crafted

burglars using a 95 decibel alarm since

cinsay is equipped with many high
precision sensors such as temperature
humidity ambient light sound motion
sensor and HD camera with night vision
our patent-pending smart health
technology gives you smart analysis of
home health index which helps you to
adopt methods to make your home a
healthier place we are surrounded by
technology it's entering our homes and
helping us automate daily tasks but I
find myself thinking there has to be a
more natural and accessible way to
control the devices around us if the
goal of automation is to simplify our
lives why does it feel so complicated
our goal as a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
into remote controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it select a surface
to attach it to and then define all the
things you'd like Nike to do naki can
control a wide variety of devices around
us but the true beauty of our technology
is that what it can do is only limited
by your imagination
okay put one in your living room or the
kitchen or even your bedroom
I mean imagine rolling over in the
morning and tapping a simple pattern
anywhere on your nightstand to snooze
your alarm and start the coffeemaker
without even opening your eyes
you just bought ten more minutes in bed
and you'll definitely want to put one in
your kids bedroom it's exciting to think
of how naki will spark their imagination
as they figure out all kinds of ways to
use it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be
far more reliable and would better reach
than Bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day
it currently includes nest Phillips you
lifx smartthings IFTTT and more but even
if you're new to the smart technology
world you can still use naki for simple
functions around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
respected our patent-pending technology
uses non acoustic sensors it's able to
distinguish deliberate tap or knock
patterns from random vibrations in the
environment the beauty of our product is
that it makes any regular environment
into a user interface think about the
surfaces around you so many of them
serve one or two purposes add an AA key
to them and you instantly have a hub for
automation we carefully chose every
material and finish Funaki
we've gone through a series of different
tests and prototypes to make sure that
naki blends in in your environment and
also looks beautiful on your surfaces
we're doing our first production runs
here in the USA because it's important
for our entire team to be there on the
ground floor ensuring that we're
manufacturing the best possible product
it's not some far-fetched idea we have
finalized our designs we have beautiful
working prototype and we need to raise
funds to actually get it into production
and immediately start shipping them to
your door we couldn't be more excited
about how this product is going to
change lives and bring joy to people
everywhere
naki accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
things that really matter
tap into the world around you with the
magic of Nike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
