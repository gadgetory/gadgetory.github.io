mailbox four letters
it's a mailbox robot that can see when a
package gets dropped off and sends me a
notification through the app you Silla
is like my own teeny tiny little post
office right there by my front door but
you Sela is not a toy it's not an excuse
to have yet another connected device
it's a responsible way to protect and
manage the things that are meant just
for me
the things that often get left out for
people who aren't me you sell out my
personal post purchase package and
postal concierge
you
everyone loves outdoor activities but
with all that fun comes all that cleanup
that's why I created the rinse kit it's
like having a hose to go my name is
Chris Crawford and after countless hours
of developing I've created something
that is truly revolutionary rinse kit is
super easy to use to fill it simply
attach the Quick Connect adapter to any
sink or hose bib turn on the water it
will fill in 30 seconds attach the
nozzle and it's ready to go
there's no pumping or batteries required
it uses no moving parts and it will hold
the water pressure for months ok so
right now you're probably asking
yourself how in the heck does this thing
work inside the rinse kit there's a
sealed chamber when you connect it to a
hose bib the water pressure from your
home simply compresses the air in the
chamber the best part about this design
is that it essentially uses the air as a
spring there's nothing to wear out we
specifically designed the rinse kit to
be easy to carry and travel with it
holds 2 gallons of water which will
spray for over five minutes on the
center setting and for over 30 minutes
on the mist setting the lid detaches so
you can clean up and change on it you
can also use it as a cutting board or to
sit on as you rinse off your feet rinse
kit is BPA free so it's safe to drink
out of
and it's extremely durable you really
can't hurt this thing
throughout the years mankind has pursued
their outdoor passions and has suffered
unnecessarily we've always felt that the
rinse kit could be the ultimate portable
shower if it could make its own hot
water but our early attempts to heat the
water and the rinse kit were a little
impractical finally we figured it out we
developed a heating probe that drops
into the tank and runs off a
rechargeable battery it quickly heats
the water in the tank to a nice
comfortable shower temperature
I even included a smart USB port for
charging your devices we've had some
help from friends and family but we're
essentially still a startup company we
need your support to help develop the
engineering tooling and production on
this game-changing heater accessory by
backing us on Kickstarter I promise that
you're going to be one of the first
people to receive this ultimate heated
portable shower system and I'm
absolutely sure that the rinse kit will
make your life easier when it's time to
clean up
no more excuses it's time to get outside
and have some fun thanks so much for
hearing our story we hope that you'll
support us with one of the options below
and please make sure to share us with
your friends on social media
new for 2016

hi I'm Taylor founder of no zip sleeping
bags even the best zipper snag so we
came up with a better solution magnets
that's right magnets we've married
magnets with sleeping bags magnets
provide a simple consistent and
effective closure system getting all
tucked in tonight is a snap these
puppies are strong enough to keep you
tucked in all night but convenient
enough to break out for those late-night
emergencies eliminating the most
annoying part of sleeping bags is
zippers zippers are that bad nobody
asked you Andrew okay
so we did more than just eliminate
zippers we're able to tackle another
sleeping bag issue what we call
comfortable temperature range or CTR it
basically boils down to a bags ability
to keep it comfortable in a variety of
weather conditions think of a zero
Degree bag an hour after sunup in the
summer it gets hot mighty fast or if
you're sleeping near a bags extreme
limit you might not die but you're not
gonna be happy about it how did we
address this with more magnets of course
by adding an extra row of magnets that
line up interchangeably we've been able
to create the first ever sleeping bag
that can change its shape based on user
preference mummy mode roomie mode open
mode this is awesome because at non
extreme temperatures it gives you more
room and it's easier to dump heat all of
which grant you faster access to sleepy
town the no zip bag is the ideal one bag
solution because it protects you during
the extreme temperatures but doesn't
overheat you the rest of the time oh and
it doesn't have any zippers being
outdoors is awesome and staying here
should be awesome too the last thing you
want to do is fumble with something you
assumed was easy
we've made it easy with your support as
a backer this project will be a success
I'm gonna have a camper and traveler but
I'm also a professional engineer and
I've guided mega-project from design to
reality we've assembled an elite team to
support us in manufacturing sourcing and
logistics and we're ready to execute and
get you inside the no zip sleeping bag
so we're coming back here today it's up
and let's go on an adventure together
