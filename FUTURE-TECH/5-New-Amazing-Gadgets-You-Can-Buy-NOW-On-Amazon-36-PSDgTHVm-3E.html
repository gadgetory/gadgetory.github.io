yeah well I don't really know where to
start
Rango was probably the coolest cat on
the face of the planet he used to ride
up to work with me on my motorcycle he
used to go to cafes to get out there's a
critical relationship and eventually I
came across a note stuck to a tree
saying that they had found this really
beautiful tabby cat dead on the side of
the road I decided if nobody else had
found a way of tracking cats and dogs
then I was certainly going to it so this
is pod life it's the smallest and
lightest GPS Dracul in market has an
interchangeable battery it's waterproof
it has bluetooth but the most important
thing is that this device can be
attached to your animal collar and sync
to your phone allowing you to always
know where your animal is you never have
to worry about losing your phone again
we've spent a lot of time getting the
product is on absolutely bang-on the
ergonomic design is really cool with no
sharp edges so it's as comfortable as
possible for the animal the app is a
really sleek user experience that's both
fun and functional to you and we've
squeezed as much as we can out of the
battery life getting up to a week's
usage I don't know you've been
inconsolable with your life your dog not
knowing where they are or what they're
doing or if they're alive or well is
that types of temperatures warmed up and
then we rely on other people to bring
him back but they're always worried that
there'll be a time when we're losing
forever
they're one of the most amazing features
that we've developed is a pet League
which is like a social network for your
animal this is going to allow you to
compare your animals results across the
world so you'll be able to determine
whether you've got the fastest dog in
the park or the most adventurous cat in
the country the apples are allows you to
set safe zone alerts so you can actually
see when your animal breaches the set
perimeter through an alert on your phone
you know he just he disappears he goes
on adventures it's cool like that just
to be able to see what he's done tell us
how far each
ran and then we can compare them spirit
from Maggie's past life's part of a
professor so we're really excited
because we have confirmed orders from
some of the largest pet retailers in the
world we've finalized the design and
we're just about to go into the final
stages of production we really need some
help in production and that's why we'd
like you to support us in this campaign
and make sure that nobody ever has to go
through the pain of losing their animal
again like I did
you
cars have had powerful computers inside
them for years but that hasn't really
improved the way that we drive them in
creating automatic we set out to unlock
our cars potential and redefine people's
relationship to driving making it safer
more efficient and fun we did this by
introducing your car to your smartphone
it all starts with the automatic link
just plug it in to your car's data port
and follow the simple instructions on
the screen
now your car and smartphone will connect
wirelessly whenever you drive most
people don't realize just how big an
impact their driving style can have on
to efficiency you can save up to 1/3 on
gaps with only a few adjustments to how
you drive an automatic helps you do that
without being a taxi driver it learns
about your driving style and gives you
subtle audio cues when you do things
that waste gas click accelerating
quickly the app shows your weekly Drive
score and trip timeline so you can track
your progress and see where to improve a
high score could save you hundreds on
gas every year when you drive automatic
monitors your car's health and warn do
something's wrong so if your check
engine light comes on you'll see a
description of the problem and possible
solutions you can even clear the light
yourself and save a trip to the mechanic
because automatic connects to your car
when you drive it always knows where you
parked your family can even access that
location for seamless car sharing
accidents happen and far too often there
isn't someone there to help if you're
ever in a crash automatic alerts 9-1-1
with your location it can even contact
your loved ones to let them know what's
happened and it helped us on the way we
wanted to reimagine what driving could
be and I think we did that with
automatic we believe that cars should
live up to their potential and that
every driver can be a smarter driver
that's why we created automatic the
smart driving assistance water the
essential element of life it flows in
all of us through our veins and out our
pores we depend on it no matter your age
or lifestyle everyone needs to drink
water but with busy schedules work
filled days staying hydrated it's easy
to forget with h2o pal hydration is one
less thing you need to worry about h2o
Pal has an energy efficient way to turn
the traction water intake throughout the
day
I think straight to your smartphone or
watch sending you notifications to drink
more water h2o pal how to establish a
habit of drinking more water at the
right time which can lead to improved
focus and productivity motivate you to
stay on track with your daily goal and
give you the satisfaction of seeing your
progress over time you have enough
things to worry about
h2o pal staying hydrated won't be one of
them start a healthier life by getting
yours at h2o Pal calm
