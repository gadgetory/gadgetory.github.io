controller that could replace all the
video game controllers in your
collection right now controllers like
this and this one that one
of course this that this and even one of
these ok maybe not that but how about
these two well we've made something that
can do everything these controls can do
and a little bit more and what would we
call a controller that can replace all
the controllers in your collection well
you would call it the all controller for
the past two years we've been designing
this controller by creating a bunch of
different models coming up with
different internal components and
external pieces to really get the best
features we could possibly fit in a tiny
package right out of the box our
controller has a bunch of different
drivers built into it so that you can
connect to virtually any operating
system on any computer you own and not
only that you'll be able to play any
video game ever made and when we say any
video game we literally mean that if the
game didn't have controller support
initially you'll be able to control your
mouse and keyboard directly from the
controller itself the old controller can
connect to Windows Mac and Linux and it
also has the ability to connect to iOS
and Android just use the built-in screen
on the controller to select the device
you want to connect to and then connect
it's just that easy and that built-in
screen isn't just for connecting to
different devices
you're also able to customize the
controller in a bunch of different ways
remap every single button every single
joystick invert them adjust their dead
zones adjust their sensitivity and
adjust the trigger sensitivity whatever
you want to do you're capable of doing
it with our built-in operating system
within the controller itself if you want
you can even set up the entire
controller to just do macros or set up
macros on the fly whatever game you're
planning however you want to play it
this controller will give you more
options than any other controller ever
made
we're adding new support for devices all
the time through software updates for
our controller and those software
updates are totally free once you've
gotten the controller we'll be adding
new features as time goes on alongside
the all controller we'll also be
releasing the dongle allows you to
connect to the Xbox 360 Xbox one
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 and all
of the features you've seen all the
customizability also
works on those systems as well
everything you've seen in this video is
based off of a real controller that
already works but what we need your help
to do is raise enough money so that we
can produce these things on a larger
scale and start sending them out to
people so if you want to help us check
out our Kickstarter page below and thank
you so much for watching
when we created Razer chroma we designed
it with one thing in mind to give gamers
a more immersive experience by
integrating the desktop with the game
Razer chroma gives gamers access to an
incredible range of integrated effects
through an ever growing list of triple-a
titles with over five million devices in
the hands of gamers worldwide at Razer
we believe in an open community and
today we're opening up the chroma to a
host of our external partners for
elevating their products to an all-new
level the possibilities are endless
and that is just chroma today we'd like
to give you a sneak peek of a concept of
design of what we think Razer chroma
could be in the future project Arianna
is a concept design that utilizes
room-scale scanning an immersive video
projection technology that transcends
boundaries with gaming immersion this
technology is modeled exactly after how
the human eye perceives the world with
your eye focus remaining fixed on the
screen or project Arianna scans your
surroundings and automatically calibrate
civ projection to really gain or moving
your screen to the entire world we are
incredibly excited about what razor koma
can do for gaming what began as an idea
as materialized into the world's largest
operating platform
for immersive gaming which today
involves top developers and other
hardware partners and tomorrow at the
forefront of this evolving gaming
landscape is project Ariana a concept
design for the future of Razer chroma</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
