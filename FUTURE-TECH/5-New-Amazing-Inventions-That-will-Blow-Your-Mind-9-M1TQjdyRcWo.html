hi everyone it is our pleasure to
present the atom fly we started to
design and create the atom fly a little
bit more than a year and a half ago our
idea was to make the best and the most
durable hoverboard on the market we have
finally made a fully functional
prototype after many tests with many
different components and we are ready to
hit the market you can ride your atom
over a variety of terrains they come
across your back ride down streets and
you will feel like you're surfing on
waves in the ocean atom is made with an
aluminum alloy frame and you can even
ride down stairs without any problems
feel the freedom of movement at a top
speed of 12 miles per hour Adam fly is
water resistant so if you see a pile of
water don't hesitate just run over it we
have created Adam to fit everyone take
your Adam on a rocky service or even on
grass it is up to your imagination Adam
fly will work for seven and a half miles
on a single charge so you can plane and
trip and go for a distance without a
problem we have tested Adam on different
obstacles and terrain you can easily
write over bumps and go uphill or ride
down stairs like a change we wanted to
create a hoverboard that feels like a
skateboard or surfboards it also works
as a transportation vehicle that takes
you wherever you want we're developing
an application that supports both iOS
and Android it will make it easy to
adjust the settings of your Adam it will
also have an anti-theft function which
means you're Adam can only be started
when you turn off the anti-theft
function on your end
the lines of Adam switch at the same
time you switch the direction you are
going that means you will always have a
bright light on the front in a red light
on back no matter how many times you
turn around Adam is the ultimate
off-road all-terrain vehicles we are
ready for production and now we need
your help to get Adam fly to the market
