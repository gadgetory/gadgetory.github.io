what matters
my name is Robert Morrison and I am the
founder of access drones and today I
have with me the wallet drone
while it drone is the world's smallest
quadcopter it fits inside of the
controller itself which is the size of a
wallet fits perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size of the small size rip but it flew
longer than just about any other copter
whatever you
the wallet drone is available in four
unique colors blue green yellow and
orange get yours today on IndieGoGo for
a simple contribution and we'll deliver
one right to your pocket
these days most photos are taken with
smartphones and quite a few have great
cameras one thing none of these phones
can do is take high quality close-up
photos there are several lenses
available to capture those tiny details
so we're here to narrow down the
selection this lens cost $70 and doesn't
fit that fancy new phone of yours this
is going to hurt out this Universal lens
doesn't even fit every phone here we go
oh man to use this lens you have to glue
a metal ring on your phone wait oh no
that was our last lens that's right
easy macro fits every phone without any
small pieces or glue it's shockingly
thin and it's so easy to use hi I'm Adam
the inventor of easy macro I'm an
engineer and I've worked on everything
from space propulsion to high-power
lasers to biofuels I can't help
tinkering and trying new things back in
2009 I saw some people using simple
lenses to capture close-up photos with
their cell phones and I thought I could
do better not only was my solution
useful and fun but it fit right in my
wallet so I always had it ready
what started as a fun accessory for
myself eventually became easy macro
having bought countless cases adapters
and other accessories for my phone over
the years it was really important to me
that easy macro fit every phone
including the ones that haven't been
designed yet let's look at how it works
open your favorite camera app and turn
the flash off strap easy macro over your
phone and center the lens over the
phone's camera lens move your phone
towards an object until it comes into
sharp focus and take your shot record
close-up videos or stack two lenses
together for even more magnification
unlike the other lenses on the market
you can use easy macro on any phone with
any case and there are no small parts to
glue to your phone or lose last year we
finally hit on the perf
design we added a rim to protect the
lens from scuffing and made easy macro
much more durable thanks to our previous
Kickstarter backers we have shipped over
20,000 new and improved easing macros to
over 70 countries easy macro users are
using their lenses to take incredible
close-up photos teach close-up
photography and schools record insects
for ecological field studies keep track
of dermatological concerns show off
their awesome nail art and even inspect
electronics our customers have told us
that they want even more lenses so we're
here to ask for your help in
manufacturing two awesome new
magnifications the funds raised from
this campaign will go directly towards
the creation of new molds and the
production of lens sets providing 2x 4x
and 10x magnification by pledging
through our project you will receive an
original ez macro or a set of all three
magnifications below retail prices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
