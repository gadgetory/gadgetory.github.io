bad breath and poor breath quality can
have several causes food poor hygiene

I'm Charles Michael iam the founder and
CEO of breath ometer first and foremost
I wanted to give a personal thanks to
our most loyal fourth ometer fans for
supporting us and making the original
alcohol breath ometer a massive success
we've come a long way since shipping the
original alcohol kilometer we also
developed its bigger brother breeze the
world's first wireless wearable
smartphone breathalyzer once again we
need your support to develop our third
product mint a barometer that measures
breath flowing and hydration levels
I'm Tim Rado I've been involved in
breath analysis for almost 20 years
mint is the first of its kind a portable
breath analysis platform that monitors
breath quality and hydration this is a
laboratory grade instrument designed and
used by Dennis and periodontist to
monitor volatile sulfur compounds in the
breath the ones that impact breath
quality and oral health we've managed to
create a miniaturized version
miniaturized portable connected version
of that this is mint
it measures volatile sulfur compounds
connects to your phone
downloads information from this device
to your phone that allows you to track
your breath quality in addition unlike
the laboratory instruments this device
also helps you monitor dehydration it
measures the hydration levels of the
tissues in your mouth and throat a
practice currently used by medical
professionals to monitor key hydration
really looking forward to launching the
mint program on IndieGoGo as you know
big IndieGoGo supporters and helps us

where dreams meet reality where digital
meets physical

around us we find the current technology
is individual focused we miss out on
real-life moments here at H+ we won't
change that
Alice is a tabletop holographic display
that enhances your life and invites
connection it is a central place to sink
any type of device and to display its
content from all sides you can play
games as family
connect across generations work together
cooperatively or compete head-to-head
make education and engaging experience
for something so natural as sharing and
displaying we wanted to make something
with many viewing angles as possible
to get to where we are today we iterated
hundreds of times we settled on a design
that's beautiful strong and safe it has
an eco friendly monitor and it's
tempered glass has a coating that is
specially designed to reflect a specific
amount of light for optimal display
quality USB and HDMI ports allow devices
to collect and display on the halls from
Judge Thomas controls like lead motion
to brain sensors and a 3d printer we
have tested them all with the Hollis and
are adding more connection options to
make the Hollis more natural and
intuitive to interact with making the
Hollis combine lots of different
software and hardware makes it even more
complex that's why we have assembled the
best team possible to do just that and
our information more great programmers
develop content for the Hollis once it
is released we have unreal and unity
SDKs available and are adding more
middleware support in the future
connection is important to everyone
you've gone as far as we can go without
more support and need your help to take
us to the next level we are so excited
to bring the Hollis to life and get it
into your hands I want to play baseball

Mars but can we come back of course

introduce the factors in 1 year ago who
wanted to push the envelope on personal
fabrication and 3d printing today we
were ready to make another step forward
in that direction introducing fab totem
prism
Bab totem prism is a new sterile
lithography 3d printing technology it's
an affordable yet high-quality solution
that works without expensive optics
print small details on a huge printing
volume
get ready for an unprecedented design
freedom and choose among different
