hey guys I'm Jonathan and I'm Chris and
this is charger and together we designed
this in Crete to help reduce pet anxiety
like many pet owners my dog charger is
part of the family
charger gets extremely anxious and
afraid whenever I'm out of the house the
only thing that terrifies him more in
separation is his fear Thunder fireworks
this was heartbreaking to watch as I can
only imagine how he felt after trying
every option available with no really I
decided to come up with my own solution
I teamed up with my partner Chris buzz
his PhD in robotics we started by
researching what causes anxiety and dogs
Hal dog sense and feel things
differently than we do and how they
naturally seek comfort during times of
anxiety the design was inspired by
combining several different remedies
through our research this solution came
down to several factors vibration
dampening noise cancelling and making a
comfortable home for the dog after years
of research we built the first prototype
in 2014 and it results for our amazing
charger instantly took tows news and
great seeing how much calmer charger was
during thunderstorms I realized we were
onto something big we designed the Zen
crate with a built-in proximity sensor
which tells the crate when it's occupied
once the sensors are triggered the crate
activates a unique playlist of soothing
music and sounds which have been shown
through scientific research to reduce
anxiety and fear related stress in dogs
understand it like humans each dog also
has its own personality we want to make
sure the playlist was adjustable to the
dogs likes and dislikes since dogs can't
provide feedback like we do on our music
apps we've developed an algorithm that
looks for trends in the dog's behavior
which adds an delete song to
specifically customize the playlist just
for them one of the best features of
this end crate is that
ready to transmit data through Wi-Fi and
can let the owner know through a text
message or email when the dog enters or
leaves the crate
and the a dull Wi-Fi camera gives the
owner the ability to see their dog when
they're not on the zinc Ray has been
designed with simplicity in mind as it
does not require a single tool to
assemble with each piece engineered to
snap or slide together the entire
assembly process takes less than five
finally we wanted to build a smart crate
as attractive for the dog as it was for
the owner so we focused the design on
being aesthetically pleasing the
physical look of the zen crate invites
owners to place it within any style of
home and it'll blend in as a stylist
piece of furniture hi my name is jasmine
and this is my son rocket living in
miami very crazy schedule that I have
Brocket gets major anxiety when I leave
he's crying he's scratching the door
down and after getting the Zen crate I
noticed the change in his behavior he's
more calm he doesn't cry as much he
doesn't worry as much so I feel
confident when I have to go make a run
or something happens last-minute I get
called in to work that he'll be safe
when he's hearing had be comfortable
most importantly my name is Benna suru
Tia I am the CEO for k9 specialists dog
training in South Florida and 25 years
doing this a little bit a little over
9,000 dogs
and I've got a good 25-30 percent of
dogs that have all these issues anxiety
issues or fit of light under trees or
free of thunder takes not my 25 years of
experience I would highly recommend the
st. crate for your dogs in order for us
to make this possible we need the
support in collaboration of other pet
owners we've assembled a number of
prototypes and sent them to beta testers
all around the world we've taken their
feedback and we've incorporated them
into the latest design now we're ready
to start manufacturing our goal is to
raise $80,000 and start manufacturing
the Zen crate with their hardness your
support will help bring comfort and
relief to millions of pets and their
owners thank you everyone for your
support
hi I'm Shane Shane I've been inventing
for a long time now I started my company
lamented as a way to get my inventions
from public you might have heard some of
my inventions like the solowheel and
hammer tracks
a lot of news was generated around the
products caught hoverboards but most of
the all of the products you have seen a
knockoffs of Muhammad racks which was
funded in Kickstarter 2013
my team and I started to develop the
idea of Yoda because the feedback from
the solar wave and how attracts users we
sell a need for community solution for
light applications which is easier to
learn lighter weight and still
practically
I really enjoy seeing people using and
loving my inventions I hope you like
this one too
