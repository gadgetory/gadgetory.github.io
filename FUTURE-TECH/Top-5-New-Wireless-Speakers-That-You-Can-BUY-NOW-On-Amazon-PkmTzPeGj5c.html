system electronic portable microphone
sprinkler had an attachment for a camera
or something or is a spy coming through
very nicely it's very very powerful for
the compact size that it is it plays
really long does it go to 11 pebble is
the world's smallest true wireless
speaker that produces sound beyond
inside the new pebble sound system
provides unparalleled clarity as well as
sound separation you can pair your
pebble speakers together allowing them
to play music simultaneously amplifying
your sound or you can place your pebble
speakers in separate rooms sharing the
music in various spaces to create an
incredibly flexible audio experience
pebble so compact but you can take it
with you everywhere and pebble is so
small you'll barely notice it whether
it's at the office and the car or on
vacation enjoy the freedom of creating
your own personalized sound environment
for both indoors and out you can really
create like a home stereo system using
just these three just like in like very
covert locations throughout like your
house like just in a room yeah far I can
take it alright I can hear you that's
amazing pebble packs enough power to
keep you entertained throughout the day
and pebble comes in a variety of color
options including black silver gold rose
gold and JetBlue a significant
take one with me like this you need to
stack one for all my friends honey they
shrank the speaker table size matters
I think we started something I'm gonna
tell the world again oh you're so
beautiful I just can't hold it in I
think we started something I've been
never in town be that the good old days
are over with - OH
no sir we don't have to burn out
no we don't have to burn my what are you
just what you're waiting for
waited oh look at the Sony XR sxb
10 Bluetooth speaker among all the ultra
portable speakers on the market they
usually suffer one common problem which
is bass because of the form factor
physically pretty impossible for the
speakers to create a lot of low lian's
well Sony recently released is X speed
10 which probably is the upgrade of the
X is 11 and the biggest selling point of
the speaker is extra bass which printed
very clearly on the box but
unfortunately the XP 10 does not mean my
expectation here's my pros and cons as
usual let's start with the back the bass
actually disturb that lis a higher
volume poor bass heavy tracks not only
that it sounds extremely artificial
there's pretty much no low-end below 100
Hertz all the basis this thing provides
this heavily processed the speaker does
not feel premium in the hand the silicon
rubber coating seems flimsy and does not
have that quality look for sure on top
of that it's really easy to attract dirt
and dust assess the bass the knit and
Tribble it's also not very clear finally
in case you don't want that bass feature
there is no button to turn off the extra
bass feature like other Sony speakers do
offer and here's a couple pros the
speaker does support NFC like usual Sony
products which is always a nice feature
pairing the speaker should be fairly
easy to do the strap is definitely a
nice feature not only you can use the
strap to hang speaker they also double
up as a stand so you can use the speaker
horizontally which projects sound right
in your face ok so here are some sample
of the sony
for casual use if you keep the volume
around mid it actually sounds ok because
it does provide for bass compared with
all the ultra portable speakers out
there this is good for one person used
before a small party it's not going to
do the job in conclusion I cannot
recommend this SRS XP 10 at this time
the extra base is very artificial and
you pretty much cannot use the speaker
at higher volume it is very
disappointing the hopefully were one
step closer to create a full range ultra
portable speaker in the future thanks
for watching like comments and subscribe
as usual and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
