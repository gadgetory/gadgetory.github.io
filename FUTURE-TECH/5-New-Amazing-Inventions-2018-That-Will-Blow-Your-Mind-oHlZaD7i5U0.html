instrument used for detecting
respiratory system disorders is the
stethoscope unfortunately at present it
can only be used by doctors and the lack
of the possibility of remote
auscultation results in telemedicine

your photos and videos two years ago I
lost a whole month of baby footage of my
new bundle we lose and break our phones
all the time yet most of us hardly ever
backup her photos as much as we should
and even if we do they end up scattered
across folders hard drives and devices
making it difficult to find that one
special moment our team came together
with one clear mission to change the way
we think about preserving experiencing
and sharing our favorite memories we
also wanted to create something that's
affordable and easy anyone with big
cloud storage companies we're handing
out all our memories to them and paying
them monthly they routinely scan our
photos analyze them and sell that
information to the bodies we capsule
your photos videos everything lives in
your home
totally private we set out to design a
product solely for people and the
families capsule is a smart little
device for home that backs up and
organizes only photos and videos so you
can always find a perfect memory with

Reach
helped make have show a reality reserve
a capsule for you and your family
whatever happened to the days in mobile
when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so where sometimes
even considered wacky we needed to
design a device that was not only an
incredible phone but also an amazing
wearable I used to repair a lot of
phones I had to crack screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brand's
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and vetting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
and before you knew that the portal was
boring
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and wearable we needed to
build a team of incredible people with
the wide range of skill sets who are all
unified to pursue our mission and break
the mold at the mobile market the
problem with the mobile market right now
is that the phones are all the same and
what little differentiation they have is
that some are less user-friendly and
some are less durable things like this
still happen so we're here to change
that with the vibrant pallets clean
typography and easy to understand icon
set the portal UI is an experience it
cannot be missed why be stuck with the
same old design when you've got a new
refreshing interface to play with the
interface that hurts you interact that
knows what you want and works with you
in the way that you want it to work the
portal not only has all the features you
would expect such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC but also has a waterproof Kevlar
infused polyurethane body a six inch
flexible display wireless charging an
unlock network and so much more
