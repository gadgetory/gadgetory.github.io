camera that can stick to any surface
glass wood and even marble the
changeable surface makes my shot able to
hide an environment that should never
suppress in life folk shot would take a
picture every 15 seconds automatically
the best thing is to pay back our
supporters talk shot is only $39 on we
love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go they help us plan our
day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us they even
support our work day
but all these fun functions come at a
cost battery don't you just hate it when
your phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quick charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Hugh simply wrap it into
this tuck away slot and you're good to
go
how really does the cube work well it's
a simple concept just plug your cube
into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will
let you down hi my name is question as
every busy person I was often on the
road and almost every day my form was
running out of the battery in the
afternoon instead of messy wires and
power bank I wanted to have only one
small device that can replace the number
of home accessories I have to carry
every day when we started to think about
the cube we look at the existing
technology on the map and we quickly
notice that most of the available
devices were not complete and not
user-friendly together with fear our
head designer we developed the cube we
went through several prototypes to find
the best design for you a designer DS
elegans compact and practical it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a small
and cool design with a significant
battery capacity it was something that
had never been done but we made it and
we're so proud and excited to bring it
to you cube is the world's first compact
and lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sink in quick charging
cable you'll also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
simply put it's an amazing piece of
technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world so
get yours now and be one of the first
few boulders
you
now VR gives you a real feeling meet
Adam the world's first controller that
makes each touch in VR absolutely we try
to touch it it's so real that you're
going to blush or laugh

innovative technology
hundred percent you Felix
it's the first time you can experience
they're known sojourneth and help to
change a virtual 12 in forever
using hebdo's a piece of cake
let's make this huge step in VR together
and we'll get a whole
after
this is filter it may not look like much
but this small device solves some very
large problems we live in a time where
everything you do online is monitored
tracked or censored just because you
don't have anything to hide doesn't mean
you don't deserve privacy finding a way
to stay private and secure is not such
an easy task services are fragmented and
none provide coverage on multiple
devices making it a hassle to stay
protected we created filter in order to
make privacy and security more
accessible and easier to use filter
provides VPN support ad blocking
capability and Tor anonymity and all the
devices in your home this is especially
important for devices that don't
normally support these applications like
gaming consoles Smart TVs and media
players those who not only protects you
from unwanted ad targeting but it
prevents companies government's and
internet providers from seeing more
personal information like your web
activity searches and even physical
location in VPN mode filter uses
enterprise grade encryption to protect
all the devices in your home
simultaneously this level of security
keeps all incoming and outgoing web
traffic private VPN mode also allows
access to geo restricted content or
censorship
simply by switching regions within the
app filters app is incredibly easy to
use
select the VPN setting the region you'd
like to connect to or automatic for the
speediest connection you can switch
between VPN mode and tour or configure
more advanced settings filter also does
the job of blocking advertisements
dangerous websites trackers and malware
infected advertising is a huge threat
and annoyance with filter you'll never
have to see him let's just add again to
stay ahead of threats all security
features and lists are kept up-to-date
automatically you can choose what you
want to have updated or turn this off at
any time filter has a lot of
capabilities but setup couldn't be
easier run all of your network traffic
through filters simply by connecting it
between any modem and router filter will
start working automatically and can be
configured within the app filter can be
used as a regular router which you can
connect your devices to via Wi-Fi or
Ethernet filter is ultra portable and
can even be powered off an external
battery even if you're in a public area
you don't have to worry about saying
secure and finding power we have a great
idea and an industrious team working to
make filter the best it can be but we
need your help we need to meet
manufacturing requirements and volume in
order to make filter affordable for
everyone we hope you'll support us and
help spread the word about our campaign
every little bit counts and helps bring
us closer to our goal to make your
online experience yours again
