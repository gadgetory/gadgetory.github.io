go for whatever reason piece is a
simplest solution this is how it works
take the SIM card out from your work
phone put in beefs connect piece to your
private phone via bluetooth and now you
can get rid of your work phones when
your friends or family call your private
number
hey I'm gonna shoot right now can I call
you back in a minute
or your boss calls your working number
it all happens in one phone by the P
stop you can control all the settings of
both your numbers separately manage your
contacts send text messages basically
just work your phone like you normally
do peace is so small it fits easily
anywhere you barely even know it's there
oh one last thing
when your phone and piece are over 15
meters apart piece will ring to prevent
you from losing your only phone you can
also use piece to look for your phone
just like you would your car in the
parking lot that way we make sure you
have one and only one phone on you at
all times
likewise if pieces in your wallet you
can use the piece app to look for it so
it's nothing big just this piece right
here and it will certainly make your
life a little easier thank you
whatever happened to the days in mobile
when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so where sometimes
even considered wacky we needed to
design a device that was not only an
incredible phone but also an amazing
wearable I used to repair a lot of
phones I had crack screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brand's
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and vetting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
and before you knew it before it was
boring
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and where it works we
needed to build a team of incredible
people with the wide range of skill sets
who are all unified to pursue our
mission and break the mold in the mobile
market the problem with the mobile
market right now is that the phones are
all the same and what little
differentiation they have is that some
are less user-friendly and some are less
durable things like this still happen so
we're here to change that with the
vibrant pallets clean typography and
easy to understand icon set the portal
UI is an experience it cannot be missed
why be stuck with the same old design
when you've got a new refreshing
interface to play with an interface that
hurts to interact that knows what you
want and works with you in the way that
you want it to work the portal not only
has all the features you would expect
such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and NFC but also
has a waterproof Kevlar infused
polyurethane body a six inch flexible
display wireless charging an unlock
network and so much more
this pen is the technology that touches
the peak of professionalism all existing
3d pens large heavy uncomfortable and
uneasy to use leaks is designed to offer
an entirely new experience to all the
creative people
the enhanced dimensional features of
leaks helped them to come up with
something unique and interesting lit has
a great potential and can be a perfect
tool for stylists architects designers

we are excited to share this amazing
experience with you
I think we can all agree that we're
living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to order a ride home control the
temperature turn on the lights
Haven face it we're living in a
technological Wonderland
and yet here we find fill pools
forgotten the combination of his travel
lock is the current solution to that
problem we live in an era filled with
technological marvels and yet this is
what happens when Phil forgets a lock
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air baltics is the air bolts is a travel
lock you control it with your smartphone
it's a lot the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
airball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth range well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your lives that's
fine the settings on this airball
require me to went to a password into
the app or maybe your air bolts been
stolen that's fine too because you can
set your air ball to activate an alarm
when it moves too far away from your
phone or you can activate the alarm
manually stop that man it's the Justice
the future deserves hi Bill hi tell them
what happened bill I lost my back you
lost your we live in a world where I can
use my smartphone to model my sleeping
patterns but bill here can't find his
bag if bill had been using the air bolt
instead of some antique you could have
located it using the air box
crowd-sourced GPS networks or if you
lose your phone
well you can still unlock your able by
logging in from another device well you
can enter a backup button code using
your hands like some kind of prehistoric
man the air vault has a rechargeable
battery which only needs to be charged
once a year via a standard microUSB
connector it's TSA approved so airport
security is not an issue the app will
record a history of every time you've
locked and unlocked your airport you can
even share access to your a vault with
your friends so you'll be able to unlock
it from the other side of the world
thanks pal you're welcome buddy
and look how small it is seriously look
at it it's really small a vault it's the
travel of we all deserve a kick starter
over the last year we've worked really
hard on building the air box and we got
to say that we're truly proud of how far
we've come but now we need your help to
fund the last stages of production
tooling raw materials and manufacturing
honestly we've all been there we've all
forgotten the combination to a look the
most frustrating thing ever and losing
your baggage even worse and that's why
we designed the air boat we believe in
innovation like this is long overdue and
it's time we bring luggage lock
technology into the 21st century the air
boat has so many possibilities we're
even including it with a software
development kit so that you can make
your own features for example imagine
unlocking the air vault with your voice
or gamifying it and using it at a
scavenger hunt
we hope you agree and get on board our
Kickstarter campaign and as a reward for
backing us early we're offering some
awesome deals on the air ball thanks
from all of us here at airboat
hi Kickstarter let's talk about remotes
we think there's something wrong with
them it's a concept that is not evolved
for more than 30 years we have so many
different devices and each one has their
own remote or app you end up with so
many jumping from one remote to another
or when using an app finding her phone
unlocking it finding a right app and
waiting until the app is ready it's
cumbersome and inconvenient it would be
so much easier to control everything
from one place that's why we have
created knio knio is a smart system that
connects to all the devices in your home
and makes them available in one
easy-to-use app and for the ultimate
simplicity use the new remote it
recognizes you and lets you control
everything instantly so whether you're
watching a movie setting mood lighting
relaxing with your favorite music or
lowering the window shades neo makes it
effortless and trust us setting all of
this up is insanely simple to make Neil
absolutely amazing we assembled a team
with expertise in home automation
software hardware and consumer product
design we truly inspired each other to
create something really special after
year of research and development we have
perfected the remote you'll be delighted
with the results he has just the buttons
which
needed to get that tactile feedback
whether cranking up the volume or
flicking through the channels near
includes a superb high density
touchscreen display surpassing even
impose a permit in a standard we
embedded a hand detection technology
into new for which we have a patent
pending the technology knows you and
shows you your favorites instantly a neo
will even help you set and manage
parental controls neo goes months
without needing to be charged and if you
can't find it use your phone to activate
the SOS so you know where it's hiding
prizes like Apple TV nest cube Sonos
Roku and over 10,000 other major
audio-visual devices are supported right
from the box our driver team adds more
devices every day so even if you don't
have the latest devices Neil will just
work we've been spending a lot of time
testing devices and electronic stores
and repair shops and that's why it is
insanely easy to set up Neil
after a year of hard work developing
software and machining prototypes we are
now ready for production by backing our
project will enable us to start the
first production run of the neo system
