accurate count for how many sounds than
an average person hears in a given day a
Dorado audio we understand that sound is
what inspires us motivates us drives us
and connects us introducing the Apollo 7
the world's most compact true wireless
earphone we just wanted to make
something that just made sense we wanted
to create an earphone a completely
wireless earphone that delivered
incredible sound the Apollo 7 earphones
come in a sleek aluminum case with a
built-in lithium battery that makes it
easy and convenient to store as well as
charge on the go see you'll never run
out of power no matter where your day
takes you these earphones are ready to
go they're coated with a nano
waterproofing technology that makes them
perfect for any situation as an athlete
I absolutely love the Apollo 7 not only
are they waterproof they're Wireless
true Wireless meaning no wires involved
at all and they're very small and
compact and they sit in the ear
incredibly comfortably and I've done
products for monster and beats and the
Apollo 7 is truly innovative
well-thought-out design and excellent
execution a lot of times you get a
wireless Bluetooth headset and you still
haven't an outside box and this wires
all over the place I can't stand wires
I've gone through like I said several
pairs of headphones that are just like
garbage the Bluetooth like it just
doesn't doesn't sound good at all you're
sacrificing a lot usually when you go to
a small earbud and these just sound
awesome sound really really good that's
my favorite part about them it's
brilliant
you have the carrying case has wireless
charging essentially when you dropped
the earpieces in and then there's a
battery in the case you don't have to
find an outlet to plug it in and charge
it so this is an all-day solution
we wanted to keep the Apollo 7 easy and
intuitive with its single button
features you'll be able to take a call
skip tracks control volume activate
Google now or even talk to Siri we also
built an omnidirectional microphone for
the Apollo 7 because we know how
important it is to have a crisp
hands-free solution for taking calls on
the go support us now and be one of the
first to experience true wireless audio
the way it should be
Apollo 7 by errata audio how does your
phone survive with today's common cable
do you carry a bulky cable around or
just put up with your phone dying let's
face it the time for a breakthrough in
cable design is long overdue this is
life link to the ultra portable cable
that makes charging on-the-go easy and
stress-free keep lifelink in your purse
and it's always there for you store it
in your wallet or your phone case and
you're good to go attach it to your keys
and you'll never be without a cable
again it's your smart phones new best
friend life link is easy to use just
plug it into any USB port and get
charged fast be in your car on a flight
at work with a portable battery on a
laptop tablet or even a TV
so what makes life links such a
breakthrough in cable design firstly
it's as long as your credit card and
amazingly as thin as two combined but
when opened it extends to more than
double its length
secondly the tough red cable is
engineered with teflon technology this
makes your life link a heavy-duty
compact cable that's both flexible and
built to last life link works with all
Android and Apple smartphones and
tablets and because it's always with you
you can share it with your friends so
they can stay connected - hi i'm vice
one of the cofounders of plus us we
realized more and more people were
getting frustrated like we were by
getting stranded with a dead phone and
no cable so we started developing life
link to create an ultraportable cable
the best supports your lifestyle and the
way that you use your phone the life
link is much more than a breakthrough in
cable design it goes beyond that with
every life link ordered Plus us will
contribute towards a cause of your
choice provide education for a child
shelter for a family or clean water for
a community you choose free order now
and be one of the first to join our
community and get your life linked this
winter
you
excuse me
I don't know how to buy this ticket
I wanted a room with a nice view
it's very karaoke near here
take me to Los Angeles
this is not the future I was promised
Wi-Fi routers are dumb machines and they
make us act like dumb people yes we
unplugged it these machines worked just
fine a decade ago when I only had one
computer but now my house is more
connected devices and I can even count
I want a modern Wi-Fi network that's
reliable and consistent wherever I am in
the house a network that's fast and
secure a network that keeps kids like my
nephew out of harm's way
enter luma an intelligent Wi-Fi system
that actually delivers on the promise of
fast reliable internet it surrounds you
with Wi-Fi using technology that was
previously only available to large
companies you put one here another one
there immediately you're up and running
we call it surround Wi-Fi luma is smart
enough to know things like what devices
you're using what networks are
interfering and where potential problem
spots are so it can make smart decisions
to get you the fastest data everywhere
and of course no network should be
without a good security system
I can easily grant people access to my
network and just as easily revoke it
speaking of that I can rest easy knowing
that luma has modern parental controls
so I can limit the kid to G level
websites and monitor to make sure he's
not up to any shenanigans I can even set
time limits pause the internet like
during dinner time
yay awesome yeah go plug this in
I love you speed safety security this is
the future I was promised
this is luma
the first thing I think about when being
a new parent is you know you come home
from the hospital and you feel this this
full weight of responsibility I remember
my son Ashton was born looking at him
and just like making this promise me to
him like I'm gonna be there for you I'm
gonna do everything I can to make sure
that you're happy and you're safe and
you're healthy and outlet really
believes in building technology that
helps parents do that we launched MARSOC
one a little over a year ago since then
we've had almost a hundred thousand
people who have used the device but as
excited as we are about that we're even
more excited to launch smart sock to
it's marked 2 is a complete rewrite of
our previous version that enhances
everything we wish we could have done
the first time around we met with
several users to find out exactly what
their needs were and we went through
prototype after prototype and iteration
after iteration to make sure that the
baby's needs were in mind so what we did
was we came up with a universal design
that had been used on either foot as
well as we made a new breathable toe so
that all three sock sizes have the most
comfort and breathability for your baby
we're also excited because it has this
new comfort mechanism so that no matter
how tight or loose the sock is it'll
always be in the right spot as we dove
into the data one of the immediate
improvements that needed to make was to
drastically improve Bluetooth range we
went all the way down to the hardware
and decided to spend our own RF design
so it allowed us to get an antenna that
matched perfectly for our application
additionally we were able to add a low
noise amplifier to the base station
which essentially made it so that the
base station had better ears and then we
added a 3d antenna essentially this
antenna just got a lot bigger and a lot
stronger so that we could get a lot more
range we're seeing on average customers
will experience a 10 to 12 X Bluetooth
range improvement depending on their
environment to put that in perspective
with some parents they couldn't go more
than 10 feet with that with the very
first socket meaning it had to be right
outside the baby's window or the baby
had to be right in your same room with
you now we've had people that are able
to have homes where the baby is three
levels above where you sleep and it's
still connected I've been using it in my
home for the last five months we've been
testing and you know I just love that
the the range from the sock to the base
station has increased that makes it more
usable for my wife and I because it
means the base station can now actually
be on our nightstand and that allows me
to wake up at night and just glance at
the base station know everything's okay
the outlet smart sock enables parents to
have that reactive nature to monitor
and you can actually get insights from
the data that will help you be a more
proactive man after using the smart sock
one the smart sock - is an incredibly
different experience we're really
excited for parents to use the new smart
sock to the new smart sock - is gonna
revolutionize the way we're able to care
for infants at home we love them so much
we'd do anything for our kids outlets
mission really is to enable parents with
technology it allows them to be there to
be more in tune with what their baby
needs and we believe that smart sock -
nod takes that to the next level and
really allows parents to to feel
completely empowered in the home
