when we first launched the 3doodler we
asked the world to imagine a pen that
can literally draw in the air two years
on we've made the world's first 3d
printing pen even better with the new
and improved versions that slimmer
lighter quieter and even easier to use
the 3doodler heat then rapidly cooled
plastic allowing instant 3d creation and
with no software or computers the
possibilities are limited only by your
imagination we've shipped over a hundred
and thirty thousand first generation
three doers and our community has used
them to create amazing things and
jewelry to RC planes fully three doodle
dresses architectural models and even
writing Braille it was because of the
support of this Kickstarter community
that we were able to make the 3doodler
dream a reality to say thank you we've
decided to bring 3doodler 2.0 to you
first completely redesigned from top to
bottom and housed in a sleek aluminum
casing the new 3doodler is the result of
over two years of research and
development all aimed at giving you the
best pre-drilling experience possible
the new 3doodler is also packed with
loads of enhancements making it smoother
sleeker and easier to use than ever
before we're also releasing exciting new
accessories including the jet pack a
portable power pack that gives you the
freedom to three doodle on the go
the help kick-start creativity in the
classroom we've created a special
educational bundle complete with pens
plastic accessories and curricular
materials which you can send to any
school library or makerspace of your
choosing if you can draw write or wave a
finger in the air you can create with
