this is lock farm in 2014
1800 Kickstarter's help bring his
product to life today he's back to
introduce not one but two macro products
the mission stays the same transforming
this to this crafting solutions to keep
your cables neatly organized and tangle
free
first up market 2.0 magnetic cable
organizer that keeps your cables neatly
bundled it's easy to use insert the
cable through the slits so that Marcos
stays safely attached and secured next
roll up your cable and snap the magnetic
ends of the Marco together and there you
have it
the my code is so much more than
organized your cords with the use of
magnets you can also secure your earbud
cable on your shirt and ensures cords
will stay out of the way while you're in
the creative zone going for a morning
run or enjoying a coffee
use the magnetic points to dark marker
to any ferrous metal surfaces you can
dock your belongings to the fridge so
that it's always in reach and ready to
go when you are for the new Macko 2.0
we've made several improvements it's
more streamlined as the magnets are now
closed inside the elastomer rubber body
the new material is both dust resistant
and water repellent
compared to the original macro the macro
2.0 is longer and it's filled with
stronger magnets making it simpler to
use in addition to macro 2.0 we're also
excited to introduce the Big Mac Oh
suitable for larger cords Big Mac Oh is
available in two types of materials the
durable elastomer rubber and the
two-tone premium leather the stay on
cable feature of Big Mac o differs from
the Mac oh the loop design allows the
big Marco to accommodate four cables
with a variety of thicknesses and all
kinds of connectors
rest assured big Marco still shares all
the same features as the Marco 2.0 there
are endless applications for Big Mac Oh
for instance organize your guitar chords
for easy carrying and quick release it's
a handy travel buddy keep your luggage
in order and your electronic devices
tidy lastly for non-ferrous metal
services a custom designed platform can
be used to dock your cables the platform
incorporates a removal and reusable
micro suction tape to allow for
convenient relocation it is taken two
years to refine the designs or sketches
3d modeling prototypes and testing the
design is ready for production your
support will help fund the tooling and
minimum order quantities required for
manufacturing we look forward to having
you join us on this next adventure thank
