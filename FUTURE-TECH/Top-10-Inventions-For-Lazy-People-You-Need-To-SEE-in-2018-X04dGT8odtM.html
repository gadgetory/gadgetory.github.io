more streamlined as the magnets are now
closed inside the elastomer rubber body

and water repellent
compared to the original macro the macro
2.0 is longer and it's filled with
stronger magnets making it simpler to
use in addition to macro 2.0 we're also
excited to introduce the Big Mac Oh
suitable for larger cords Big Mac Oh is
available in two types of materials the
durable elastomer rubber and the
two-tone premium leather the stay on
cable feature of Big Mac o differs from
the Mac oh the loop design allows the
big Marco to accommodate four cables
with a variety of thicknesses and all
kinds of connectors

the same features as the Marco 2.0 there
are endless applications for Big Mac Oh

a handy travel buddy keep your luggage

services a custom designed platform can
be used to dock your cables the platform

micro suction tape to allow for
convenient relocation it is taken two
years to refine the designs or sketches
