Oh
lift was inspired by the design of Apple
MacBook MacBooks are innovative slim
sleek and designed to use anywhere as
you go however we notice that even
though users are still bound to the
old-time accessory they are not able to

your MacBook throughout the day the lift
lift provides you adjust Wilhite
flexible mobility and stylish protection
turn your MacBook into a comfortable
workstation at any time anywhere and
express your personality by giving your
MacBook a new look using different
colors currently we have personally
prototypes for MacBook Pro experience
manufactures ready to start production

happen need your help
please beg a doc to bring this project
to life
so you got a new Apple MacBook Pro with
many groundbreaking features like the
touch bar only to discover it doesn't
work with any of your devices you would
practically need a dongle for everything
what if there is a sleek compact adapter
for your macbook that is able to provide
all the ports you need introducing hyper
drive the adapters it replaces all other
dongles now you can connect an HDMI
display and a thunderbolt display USB C
data SD memory cards micro SD card USB
3.0 flash drive and a USB 3.0 hard drive
all while charging your macbook pro at
full speed stop figuring out how to
store and carry your dongle with hyper
drive just pack and go don't look silly
with dongles just go with hyper drive
hyper drive gets you up and running in
no time hyper drive is the first hub
specifically designed for the new
macbook pro utilizing two thunderbolt
USBC ports to provide more bandwidth
than any other dongle in the market
hyper drive is made of precision milled
aluminum available in both silver and
Space Gray to match the MacBook Pro and
the same hyper drive works with the 13
and 15 inch macbook pro
these three plastic dolls cost over $100
from the Apple store but you can get the
sleek ultra compact aluminum hyperdrive
with all the same ports and more
starting at $49 but only through this
campaign so pledge now and be the first
in the world to get the hyperdrive
I love my laptop I rely on it every day
and I take it everywhere but
economically laptops are not ideal the
longer we spend the look the more we
hunch leading to tension or pain in our
next two shoulders and back which is why
we've designed a Tiny Tower a portable
and height-adjustable laptop there the
tiny tower allows you to set up and get
to work in the no sign whether it at the
office at home in a cafe or wherever it
has an elegant design which integrates
beautifully with your laptop helping you
work comfortably and protect your
posture I suffered a serious disc
herniation in my neck after hunching
over my laptop for too long I realized
that a lot of existing products don't
really solve the problem and they're not
something I want on my desk so as an
industrial designer I decided to create
a product that laptop users would be
proud to own the tiny tower has a clever
push-button mechanism that adjusts your
laptop screens were high that suits you
there are 10 different height metal
developers when you're done it takes a
second to fold down flat into a compact
and lightweight unit that you can take
anywhere it's compatible with both Mac
and Windows laptops from 11 to 15 inches
inside your laptop sit firmly and
securely on a non-slip grip all for
added security to tiny Taylor has
fingers you can extend we've also
created a high quality zipped nylon
pouch to carry your Tiny Tower keyboard
and mouse we've been working on this
project for over 18 months during
development we tested seven different
prototypes to get every details just
right we wanted to find the perfect
balance of functionality and simplicity
and to create something you'd be proud
to own and use we decided on aluminium
as plain material because it's strong
lightweight and durable the aluminium is
precision constant speed blasters can
analyze the event lustrous semi matte
finish
high-kick data I'm Matt and I'm anti
together we've created the planet our
the money we raise on Kickstarter will
help us pay for the tool hold a
materials we need to give the time power
into production so we can get it into
your hand and onto your debt if you want
a stylish clever solution this is
portable of your laptop and you care
about your posture and well-being while
you work and we'd love your before
you've got the hottest new computer but
now you can't plug in any of your stuff
your new MacBook shouldn't make the rest
of your hardware obsolete
and some things just can't be connected
via the cloud introducing hub plus
connect all your devices to the new
macbook hub course is compact and
durable so you can take it with you
charge up your phone no matter where you
are we developed hub plus in palo alto
and designed it with our team in germany

deliver on time + select Kickstarter
backers will even receive a bonus mini
adapter hub + ports power portability
