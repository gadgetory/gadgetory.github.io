each child peeking through a gap in the
fence every scientist hunting for an
answer and all the lovers staring up at
the sky while dreaming or while
searching we have always turned to the
night sky filled with the wonder of a
billion stars and the infinite space
around us all of us look up but how many
of us can capture it frame it bring it
home and share it no you can capture
space in the palm of your hand that's
why we make tiny one the world's
smallest smartest and most social
economy camera with this tiny one you
can capture the nice guys never before
you no longer have to worry about
expensive equipment my advanced
photography knowledge just point and
shoot
we developed proprietary noise reduction
technology that allows you to
effectively improve image quality over
various environmental conditions without
sacrificing on image fidelity
this coupled with a powerful sensor fits
in the sleek and compact form factor
that means that the tiny one sees better
at night and fits perfectly in your
pocket pre-programmed and augmented
reality star map to help you locate
planets and constellations easily the
tiny one is also compatible with all the
lenses out there and even telescopes did
we mention it takes selfies too it
connects seamlessly to your smartphone
and allows direct sharing to your
favorite social media so the tiny one is
not just about the night sky it's about
you like Neil deGrasse Tyson said when I
look up at the night sky I know that we
are part of this universe we are in this
universe but more importantly the
universe is within us
