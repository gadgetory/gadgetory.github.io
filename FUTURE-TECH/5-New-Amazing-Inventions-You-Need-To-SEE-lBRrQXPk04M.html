light that occurs naturally on sunny
summer days it helps you become more
active whenever you need it
you simply feel more energetic yeah okay
that sounds good I'll see you in a bit
so you might not been able to hear that
but using Ori I was able to have a call
and that's because Ora is a voice
assistant ring that turns your finger
into a smart phone all through just a
touch of the ear but why that's because
the way in which we're using their
devices is changing changing from a
world where we use screens and touch to
one where we talk now Ori uses a bone
conduction and bone conduction has been
used in many medical great devices we
package it in a way that ascends
vibrations through your finger directly
into years so only you can hear and that
allows you to hear and talk through just
your finger hey man that's music thanks
to bone conduction and the
noise cancelling microphone you can hear
and talk even and loud places so check
this out
Oran is perfectly private and discreet
using it mixing futures like a secret
agent Inori is more than just a neat
gadget for taking and making calls
because behind it is powerful voice
artificial intelligence our friend Siri
and Google assistant it puts them
exactly where you need them think about
all the different things that you can do
and one of my favorite translation all
we have to do is just motion upwards and
you say Ori how do I say where are the
burritos in Spanish understand lost
burritos and just like burritos come in
different flavors Ori comes in three
different colors I guarantee you there's
an Ori ring for every outfit and every
occasion and even better Ori is splash
proof too
look guys I know how popular you are and
that's why you have the Ori app because
it helps you filter out everything else
and there's four LED lights that tell
you what kind of messages are coming
through come on let's hit the streets to
see what people think of all really
thousands of people have tried or it and
we're finally ready to start making and
sharing the origin with the rest of the
world and with everything that's
happened I can't help but think of our
inspiration my dad he also happens to be
visually impaired Ori doesn't just help
the visually impaired access something
that had difficulty before smartphones
but in turn they have inspired us to use
our devices in new natural screen
freeways I really want our venture in
darkness to power the screen free
revolution thanks for watching guys
remember to pack us today because one
day with Ori you too can find your voice
hi everybody I'm Martin CEO of Nokia as
our name says we just hate to carry
around the phone and keys in one pocket
we thought there must be a better
solution for this so we started to
develop no key a smart dollar for
everybody and easy to use no key
consists of a key turner that you mount
on top of your existing lock in which
you can control from your smartphone via
bluetooth we will also be offering an
Okie bridge so that you can also control
your Nokia from any place in the world
the installation of Nokia can be done
within 5 minutes you just place the
backplate on your existing door lock fix
it and put Nokia on it after that you
pair it with your smartphone and setup
d/f
for us design is a poetic discipline and
lives within the tension between the
archaic and the high-tech we decided to
go for a magic black box and to add to
that black box friendly interface in the
form of a light circle another very
important aspect is security no key is
as secure online banking because we use
the same end-to-end encryption mechanics
we also plan to make our communication
protocol publicly available and get our
software certified by security
specialists on the software side naka
will be really easy to use you can
unlock your door with a swipe be our new
phones with the push of a button or send
invites to anyone why a mail but the
best of all when you come home your
phone will unlock your door
automatically without even touching it
we are thrilled to make this journey and
we'd love to work with you to find you
our product the proceeds will be used to
fund the final manufacturing of Nokia
join us and shape the future of your
smart home thank you so much for your
support
