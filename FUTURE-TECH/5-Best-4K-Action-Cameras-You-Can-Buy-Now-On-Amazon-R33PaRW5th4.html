performance with 4k 60 1080p 240 video
you're gonna get this really buttery
smooth slow motion that doesn't drop a
frame every aspect of the shot is that
much more brilliant that much more
lifelike and when you combine it with
quick stories the experience is unlike
anything before quick stories is a way
to go from capturing a great experience
to the story that you can share your
GoPro will automatically copy any new
photos and videos over to your phone
where the GoPro app will edit that into
a video for you hero 6 is our smartest
camera yet we have algorithms for faces
and audio accelerometers GPS and we're
able to take that data and pull them
into your edit so we can create the most
compelling story for you
when you're able to capture something
and slow it down it really allows you to
appreciate the moment what was the water

fast and using a GoPro helps you capture
your life slow it down and see it in a
whole new way hero six the stabilization
is far beyond anything we've ever
accomplished a GoPro Hero six can
analyze your footage and then adjust the
stabilization to take out any of the
shake take out the roll and really make
it look like your GoPro is mounted on a
stabilizer people are using their GoPros
to film everything and you can't always
get close to the action and now with
hero six and the built in touch zoom
capability you can with hero six you're
getting more voice commands you're going
to get this hands-free fluid experience

the differences within 60 frames per
second and 30 frames per second no
