monkey here today to tell you about my
latest creation wild card the pocket
knife needs to a halt it's an essential
tool but it's bulky it's one more thing
to remember in the morning and it easily
falls out of your pocket and is lost I
wanted something better
I asked why not put a pocket knife in my
wallet it'd be easier to carry and
harder to lose so I set out to design a
knife that be as thin as possible and
the result is wild card it's only two
millimeters thick
only slightly thicker than a credit card
I was able to do this by reimagining the
blade pivot most knives have a pin
pressed through a hole wildcard has a
pivot unlike anything in the world I
call it fly off technology the three
wings of the pivot allow the knife blade
to remain rigid to the body a necessity
when wielding a sharp tool for safety I
designed the blade to lock open and to
lock closed the blade tucks neatly under
two blade darts and it angles only on
one side so users can't accidentally cut
themselves when carrying a closed knife
and here's the best part about this
design the blade is detachable I
designed this with the forgetful
traveler in mind when you go through TSA
with your traditional knife on you you
lose your knife but with wild card you
only lose your blade and on our website
you can replace it for only a few
dollars with pocket monkey I used a
monkey to represent the personality of
the tool with wild card I kept that
trend going wild card as a wolf cut out
that doubles as a bottle of the wolf and
body is the nature of the tool agile yes
I wanted to pack as much functionality
as possible into wildcard
many people misuse knives in place of
other tools like screwdrivers and pry
bars harming themselves of breaking
their knives so I added these tools to
the night I always wanted to challenge
convention because of that I spent the
last six months trying to reinvent how
this product is manufactured every
manufacturer I talked with was hesitant
to produce such an aggressive design the
solution I kept hearing was take this to
China but that isn't something that I'm
willing to do I want to create products
that embody the American spirit of
innovation and my solution was to create
a manufacturing facility in Maine now we
control every aspect of production from
laser cutting to packaging and shipping
so became manufacturer the
highest-quality product while creating
jobs in our community helped us make
wild card a reality and help us continue
the American spirit of innovation
