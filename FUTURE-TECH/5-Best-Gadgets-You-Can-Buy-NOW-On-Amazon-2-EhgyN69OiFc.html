hi i'm taylor founder of no zip sleeping
bag even the best dipper snag so we came
up with a better solution magnets
that's right magnet we've married
magnets with sleeping bags magnets
provide a simple consistent and
effective closure system getting all
tucked in tonight is a snap these
puppies are strong enough to keep you
tucked in all night but convenient
enough to break out for those late-night
emergencies eliminating the most
annoying part of sleeping bags is
zippers dippers are that bad nobody
asked you want to drew okay so we did
more than just eliminate zippers we're
able to tackle another sleeping bag
issue what we call comfortable
temperature range or CT are basically
boiled down to a bags ability to keep
you comfortable in a variety of weather
conditions
think of a zero Degree bag an hour after
sunup in the summer it gets hot mighty
fast or if you're sleeping near a bag of
extreme limit you might not die but
you're not going to be happy about it
how did we address this with more
magnets with more magnets of course by
adding an extra row of magnets that line
up interchangeably we've been able to
create the first ever sleeping bag that
can change its shape based on user
preference mummy mode Ruby mode open
mode this is awesome because at non
extreme temperatures it gives you more
room and it's easier to dump heat all of
which grant you faster access to sleepy
town the no zip bag is the ideal one bag
solution because it protects you during
the extreme temperatures but doesn't
overheat you the rest of the time oh and
it doesn't have any slippers being
outdoors is awesome and staying here
should be awesome too the last thing you
want to do is fumble with something you
assumed was easy
we've made it easy with your support of
the backer this project will be a
success I'm an avid camper and traveler
but I'm also a professional engineer and
I've guided mega-projects from design to
reality we've assembled an elite team to
support us in manufacturing sourcing and
logistics and we're ready to execute and
get you
inside the nose that sleeping bag so
become a backer today heads up let's go
on a adventure together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
