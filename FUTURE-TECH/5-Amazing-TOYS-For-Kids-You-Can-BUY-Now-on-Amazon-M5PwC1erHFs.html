what gives a Jedi his power it's an
energy field created by all living

I found a holocaust
old maids
series
I don't care how old you are the zero
blaster smoke ring launcher is awesome
and it's even more awesome if you have a
friend to do battle with I'll be right
back
the zero blaster fires harmless smoke
Ling's made from a water-based non-toxic
super fluid the vortex rings range from
two to four inches in diameter and can
fire up to twelve there's a ray gun
sound feature you can turn on and off as
well as the function to adjust the speed
at which it fires vapor rings timeout so
how does this thing actually work the
zero blaster creates an area of low
pressure and when that area has air flow
surrounding it the smoky vortex forms
okay cover me I'm going in
hi Kickstarter's it's here your promised
future has arrived one of the
cornerstones of the flying car jetpack
rocketskates trifecta now existence we
have a solid team of talented engineers
and designers who have been cast putting
together the world's first lightweight
long-range and remote free and most
importantly fun smart rocket escapes

on to get going kick off and once you
start rolling the four powerful
brushless hub motors engage propelling
you to Finity and beyond to accelerate
you tilt forward to slow down and brake
you put your heel down but don't lean
back it takes a little bit of practice
but just remember what it was like to
learn how to ride a bike or rollerblade
just stick with it and you'll get it and
the great thing is you don't even need a
remote imagine cruising down the
boulevard wind in your face listening to
your favorite tunes you're on your way

to college canvas the best part is you
can wear them in or put them in your
backpack the app connects you to other
scanners and play interactive games you
can also track your route and compare
your mileage to other Rockets Gators and
for you developers who want to develop
your own games for the escapes we have

increasing fun time

minimums to me that's why we're here on
Kickstarter offer you some great deals
