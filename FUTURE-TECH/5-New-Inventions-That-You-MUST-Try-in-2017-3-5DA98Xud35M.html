voice-activated virtual assistants like
Amazon's Alexa are growing in popularity
but with one major caveat they're very
limited in what they can do sure they
can help users order anything from
cookie dough to shoes well that is if
the user speaks English and only plan to
use one service or marketplace even
worse some of these devices must be
plugged into an outlet at all times or
need to be on a Wi-Fi network to work
limiting their portability I don't have
a battery you're a dream wave we knew
there had to be a better way so we found
one introducing Jeanne a self-powered

one in four accidents today are caused
by distracted driving our compulsion to

and it overpowers our better judgment

phone for just five seconds while
driving at a typical highway speed is

length of a football field blindfold

and elegant combination of hardware and
software and the world's very first
product to prevent texting and driving
that actually works

rest ride physically blocks you from
accessing your home screen freeing you
from the compulsion to reach for and
check your phone a customizable message
is automatically sent out in response to
any incoming messages so that the sender
knows you are driving and will respond
later don't worry you'll get all of your
messages and notifications as soon as
you're done driving
