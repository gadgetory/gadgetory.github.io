Sirius is the brightest star
voice-activated virtual assistants like
Amazon's Alexa are growing in popularity
but with one major caveat they're very
limited in what they can do sure they
can help users order anything from
cookie dough to shoes well that is if
the user speaks English and only plan to
use one service or marketplace even
worse some of these devices must be
plugged into an outlet at all times or
need to be on a Wi-Fi network to work
limiting their portability I don't have
a battery you're a dream wave we knew
there had to be a better way so we found
one introducing Jeanne a self-powered
multi-language multi-platform bluetooth
speaker Jeanne pairs wonderfully with
your mobile phone and its accompanying
virtual assistants such as Siri Google

charging the genie allows you to listen
to music to take phone calls or respond
to text messages all while remaining
completely unplugged and unlike other
virtual assistants Genie supports
multiple languages meaning it can accept
voice control commands in the users

steps with our future backers and

a lot of the legwork and the critical
next steps are to finish work on the
components and circuits for the final

the constant stream of buzzes whistles
cherry notifications comic remark phones
are an incessant distraction and if
you're driving they can be deadly nearly
one in four accidents today are caused
by distracted driving our compulsion to
stay connected at all cost is very real
and it overpowers our better judgment

phone for just five seconds while
driving at a typical highway speed is
the equivalent of driving the entire
length of a football field blindfold
it's no wonder that texting and driving
is now the single largest cause of death
for American teenagers and it's six
times more dangerous than drunk driving

and elegant combination of hardware and
software and the world's very first
product to prevent texting and driving
that actually works
simply connect and drive drive does the
rest ride physically blocks you from
accessing your home screen freeing you
from the compulsion to reach for and
check your phone a customizable message
is automatically sent out in response to
any incoming messages so that the sender
knows you are driving and will respond
later don't worry you'll get all of your
messages and notifications as soon as
you're done driving
