good air we needed for well-being health
and performance arey is a world first
that ensures was surrounded by good air
arey is a unique international incident
a cleansing system that uses the
detoxification potential of health class
the problem indoors the pollution caused
by toxins contained in furniture paint
plastic or cleaning fluids is often much
higher than that found on a busy road
these toxins can be responsible for
symptoms ranging from tiredness
headaches discomfort right up to an
increased risk of cancer but for the
entire problem was that I had an
allergic reaction to clean language used
in years our so ten year and garbage
will I began estas resolutions as a
public forum for Google the idea comes
from space travel where the use of
plastic lunare has been researched for
decades the results up to the ninety
percent of the air is purified by the
roots normally however these roots are
covered up a lot of all it needed latest
a plant pot that have ventilates the
roots then from this is over idea a
whole range of other why of small / 18
under clouds money lent to the in pot
with re the air enters the pot through
slaps and is then sucked past the roots
thanks to the chimney effect in this way
the booths absorb environmental toxins
significantly more quickly transforming
them into usable nutrients and emitting
fresh oxygen like this one plant in the
area can replace up to eight plans in
regular parts and
completely naturally without electricity
knives or filters its efficiency has
been scientifically confirmed some
better air atonement in public rooms all
in the office re the world's first for a
healthy atmosphere indoors

I think any dog owner can relate to it
you look into their eyes and share a
brief connection and see that they
really want to understand so when you
think about trying to talk to your pet
there's really only so much you can say
but what if somehow you can communicate
more what would you ask them first this
was the inspiration of a clever way
however kind of interactive device that
reward your dog for solving simple
puzzles we know that when your reward an
animal for performing certain behavior
more likely to perform that behavior
again in the future we use this every
time you try to get our doc to do some
retreat to the most important factors in
making this work a repetition
consistency so clever pet uses your
dog's morning meal the time it spends it
helped encourage interaction throughout
the day it starts out simple your dog
will get a treat whenever she presses
any of clever cuts buttons once she's
got this down lover if it makes your job
a little bit tougher now she only gets a
treat when she presses the button that's
lit up what she's learned that the game
changes again clever pet gradually
teaches her to interact a more
interesting ways and she stays active
and happy all day long the really great
thing is that this is all automatic
plumber cut engages your dog even when
you can't be helped my favorite part
about working with dogs if seen progress
on a daily base I've learned a lot about
how dogs interact with their
surroundings and the most important
takeaway is that a dog to the job is a
happy guy what's really interesting is
that all my clients have the same
request they all want a happy healthy
and well behaved dog so when I was first
introduced to clever pet I learned that
there was something for these problems
keeping our dogs engaged and busy while
we're not at home I've introduced dogs
with just about every interactive toy
and device on the market and nothing
challenges your dog like clever pizza we
begin with simple pet behaviors and have
since events the more complex
interactions I clever pet we're driven
by compassion and curiosity to find a
way to care for pets when they're alone
and get a better sense for who they are
so whether you're looking to keep your
pet healthy and happy or simply dealing
with your dog's anxiety when you leave
the house clever pet adapt to meet your
dog's name
