hi my name is yasm Umrah I'm a jazz
drummer I used to work for major record
company music lover like me live in the
city we always use the headphones
headphones gives you a good sound
mobility and silence but sometimes I
couldn't stand it
headphones are painful leave them on for
more than an hour and hurt when running
it gets uncomfortable and sweaty I
thought why not to design a headphone
and solve these problems this is Lisa V
shares 3d molded open-air frame design
allows you to interact with your
environment while you're listening to
your audio this is the first pain-free
bluetooth headphone it doesn't press on
your ears which can cause discomfort
instead the 3d geometric frame sits
around your ear with minimal body
contact this allows airflow and makes
them comfortable to wear for long
periods of time V shares core audio
technology comes from Yamaha smock five
module one of Yamahas most advanced
codecs and enables us to provide
superior sound quality our headphones
have an onboard 3-band equalizer that
works with all your music apps and
allows you to customize the sound to
your own personal taste
it's important that you and only you can
hear the sound of your headphones V
share is designed with directional flat
speakers that produce amazing sound
quality and yet focus the sound directly
to your ears to keep what you're
listening to private the airframe keeps
you in touch with the sounds around you
so you notice when other people approach
or want to talk with you and without
removing your headphones or adjusting
your audio you can carry on a normal
conversation when you want to be
undisturbed that V Sierra headphones
have an interchangeable closed frame as
well for when you want to concentrate or
when you're in a loud environment each
headset is able to broadcast or receive
from other headsets so you can use V
share to share your audio with your
friends without disturbing others around
you we hope you can find places where V
share fits your lifestyle we partnered
with a major Japanese audio company to
help us manufacture the highest quality
headphones possible our plans are set
and we have a schedule to deliberate be
sure to you on time we need your help we
need funding to cover the cost for moles
and tools for manufacturing with your
help we can deliver these amazing
headphones to you please share and a
this is what I designed this year
we have the opportunity to change the
world all that's needed is you wire free
technology is a revolution and the
revolution is held by
enjoy auditory freedom with next year
one of the amazing things about our
auditory senses are really that we can
take in and perceive sound in full 3d
and asik what we're working on is
letting you hear that fully immersive 3d
audio in headphones in the same way that
you do in your everyday life
Abbey Road Studios has an amazing
reputation for innovation and it's
something we want to extend into 2016 so
we spent a year looking at the startup
environment and what academics were
doing around sound and technology so we
decided to set up the incubator because
there's no one that actually owns the
whole of the music startup space happy
rhodes got this really long history of
being associated with pioneering
advances in spatial audio we started up
scratching into a wax disk a mono
recording and moved to stereo and moved
a quad move to surround sound and then
things kind of stopped progressing and I
think we see audio in headphones is kind
of a future format that's kind of the
ultimate listening experience really
what we're here talking about is what's
next and what are the potentials for 3d
audio technology I mean if we
fundamentally think about what the early
music was about and why stereo was
invented it was really about that same
challenge of how to transport us
somewhere you know so part of it is
about that technology innovation coming
here you know being able to work with
engineers talk about the production side
figure out how we could integrate that
type of technology into the music domain
but then see what kind of experiences
are possible
then when you're hit by an angle it's so
much more enjoyable and when you turn
you go with everything
oh you get kind of lost in any you want
to almost stay in it because the music
feels so alive for me the exciting part
about the future of audio is being able
to replicate the real sound field no
matter where you are even if you're the
musician on stage around the audience
and have it really sound like you're
there the exciting thing about Abbey
Road red is it gives a smaller company
like Asik the opportunity to work with
the very top recording engineers to
figure out what are they listening to
what cues are they picking up on and
that way we can actually improve our
headphone and actually test the things
that we're not even looking for right
now what's exciting about headphones is
it has the opportunity to bring that
next level of immersion to everyone so
people can have a headphone or earphone
they can be on the subway or the you
know wherever it is and they could
experience the full 3d that was created
here and have your own this is a place
that just as obsessed with sound sign
fidelity sound quality and really
pushing the boundaries of what you can
achieve with sound and innovation and so
asik just checked all of those boxes in
terms of really redefining what sign can
look like as we move into future
you
hi I'm Joey alright and we're currently
at a large DJ bar as you can see it's
about a hundred and two decibels of
noise up in this barn today we're gonna
