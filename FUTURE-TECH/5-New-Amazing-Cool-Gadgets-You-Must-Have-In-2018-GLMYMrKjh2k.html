the air bubble is the first proven
technology that effectively removes more
than 95% of both nitrogen dioxide and
particles from inside a car it's now
well known that air pollution affects
our health especially those living in
cities however what most people aren't
aware of its just how bad the air in
your car can be nitrogen dioxide levels
primarily from diesel emissions inside
your car cabin can be 10 times over the
w-h-o limit sitting in a vehicle with
your windows up in traffic is not the
safe haven you might think that it is
that's why we've created the air bubble
the first proven technology of its kind
that removes all elements of air
pollution including nitrogen dioxide
from inside a car cabin the air bubble
is optimized to protect drivers and
their families in polluted cities and
professional drivers who spend hours on
the road designed to fit on the back of
the car headrest the air bubble works by
drawing polluted air circulating inside
the car into the unit before our
proprietary filtration technology
removes gases particles bacteria dust
and odors clean air is then released
back to the driver and passengers in the
most efficient way possible using
advanced air flow dynamics what we
breathe matters and a lab sub mission to
reduce people's exposure to air
pollution like most parents are always
conscious to avoid the high levels of
air pollution found on busy roads what I
hadn't realized is the levels of harmful
nitrogen dioxide can be even higher
inside our cars our research is a real
wake-up call as I realize the impact
this could have on the house of my son
and other children
at our labs knowing we had the only
proven technology to effectively remove
nitrogen dioxide I knew it was our duty
to divert the air bubble giving people
the power to protect themselves and
their families
the air bubble has been designed by our
team of atmospheric chemists and airflow
engineers at air labs in our research
laboratory here in Copenhagen it uses
our proprietary filtration technology
developed over the past decade at air
labs we specialize in creating clean air
zones for people the technology inside
the air bubble has proven itself inside
of clean air bus shelters and in a clean
air bench commissioned by Transport for
London during the past year we have
focused on creating a clean air zone
inside of a car and not making the air
bubble a reality we have manufacturers
lined up and with your help we can start
protecting people with the air bubble
early next well we're really excited to
be launching the air bubble and today
we're asking for your support so we can
start making a real difference to
people's lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
