pelvis ticks always had potential to be
a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concepts was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six or even ten feet high on but also
take anywhere you want to go the v4 is a
portable trampoline we'd always dreamed
up click the v4 you have the ability to
add or remove air and completely change
the stiffness of the bounce someone who
weighs 300 pounds can jump on the same
exact v4 as someone who only weighs 80
times all you need to do is change the
air pressure in less than a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family of fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping onto the v4 for the
very first time you'll love the wait
list flight like experience you'll get
the basics in minute and from that point
on there's no limit to how far you can
challenge yourself if the v4 you'll be
able to jump up onto ledges down stairs
and over gaps with all sizes while
nailing down some pretty awesome tricks
after playing around on the v4 you'll
never look at your surroundings in the
same way again obstacles and features
that are too high for bikes and
skateboards perfect for the v4 so those
of you looking for a fun way to stay in
shape could be for well worth most of
the muscle groups in your body and get
your heart pounding immediately it's a
killer cardio workout and the best part
is that while you're having fun bouncing
around you won't even realize how
quickly you build a sweat in order to
achieve superior build quality and
maintain the high tolerances necessary
for the v4 to work we manufacture and
assemble it right here in our Southern
California shop we work closely with our
suppliers to become a part of the build
process and as each component is made or
right there to test them this
streamlines are manufacturing and ensure
is it every before we make is up to our
standards if you're looking for the
portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of be for is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it
join us and help change the way pogo
sticks Racine forever
let's fix you actually in the kilometre
of the what is it a thermometer it helps
women who are ready to get pregnant or

it takes your lowest body temperature
every morning and then it soaks it
automatically to your phone tracking

accurate is the thermometer the
thermometer readings are accurate within
100 of us agree it is not like too much
accuracy why don't we just use a regular
thermometer we want a thermometer a
thermometer to check the smallest
variation your fertility cycle it should
finally be in control of our data and
our body I'm in a thermometer until my
skin room check monitor works for me and
