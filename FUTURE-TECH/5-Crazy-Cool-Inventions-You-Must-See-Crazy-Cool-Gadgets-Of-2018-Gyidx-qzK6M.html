this is Marcell your two-hour tour
inspired Swiss engineers and the
founders of pole or moon our goal is to
revolutionize the outer sleeping and to
eliminate the conventional sleeping bags
so what are the problems with sleeping
bags and sleeping mats hardly any
freedom of movement for arms and legs
sleeping on side is uncomfortable
abdominal sleep is hardly possible
slipping off the sleeping mat the pillow
is constantly shifting when the outside
temperature rises you start to sweat or
you freeze where the zipper is opened
all these problems lead to poor sleep in
comfort parlament solves all these
problems with its new sleep system the
polar mount tracking sleep system offers
best sleeping comfort from 0 up to 25
degrees Celsius so your benefits are
sleeping comfort just like home
temperature regulation in the sleeping
room spacious warm sleeping and storage
room all this promotes increased
recovery and maximum performance next
day so this is our first prototype the
sleep system is ready in only a few
simple steps
and here the packings of the Polar moon
outer shell liner and poles this is the
mattress which can be used for the Polar
Mille system as well as for a
conventional synthetic fiber sleeping
bag we use the capital to finance the
development and the production of the
first series the market launch is
planned for the fourth quarter of 2018
with the polar mode Auto Sleep System
you will experience how to sleep in a
completely new way thank you very much
for trust and for you support for the
last two years we have been developing I
owe an amazing product that puts you in
charge of your energy I use a master key
for controlling your internal rhythm so
you can get the best out of your day and
best of your life our technology is so
revolutionary that it will fundamentally
change the way we look at sleep being
tired and experience at leg using I
adjust 15 or 20 minutes a day you can
achieve a brilliant sleep just what you
need after a stressful day at work
you'll wake up refreshed ready to
welcome the day
i√∂ is also your ideal travel companion
having i/o near you empowers you to
switch between time zones with ease
without the sleepless nights and all the
nasty jetlag symptoms
io is a clear boost for your energy
levels by providing you with the same
special blue light that occurs naturally
on sunny summer days it helps you become
more active whenever you need it you
simply feel more energetic when
developing IO our ultimate goal was
creating an amazing product both on the
inside and the outside Isle is a smart
wearable device based on its smart
technology it gets better with every use
it consists of a powerful combination of
high-tech oil glasses and the
user-friendly i/o app when designing IO
we put the special attention to all the
details scientific proofs state of the
art technology and innovative thinking
were all linked to each other
we are constantly interacting with our
potential customers to test our
decisions and reassure food satisfaction
what I'm really proud of is that we
managed to create a highly functional
stylish and user-friendly product I
expect with the amazing features my
favorite ones are the coronal link and
the up to view this however just the
beginning as we plan to release an open
API and there are many more of those
great additions the technology behind IO
is based on scientific proofs and
research breakthroughs developed over
the past 20 years by leading
institutions worldwide IO is a first
step in personal adjustment of the
internal body clock and will help us to
improve our lifestyle to remain healthy
and to keep the doctor away our team has
spent the last two years developing this
technology and soon you will be able to
enjoy it we believe we have created an
amazing product that will help many
today we need your support with our
IndieGoGo campaign it will help us speed
up the development delivery of new
features and starting production by
supporting us today you will become one
of the very first exclusive owners to
experience I at an amazing price
additionally your contribution will help
us move this next generation technology
forward so pledge support us and share
our campaign
for several days last year my home city
of Seoul had a worst airport in the
world everyone stayed inside where
sometimes the air was even worse
my team was already working on probable
indoor air quality monitor but this
inspired us to make one that's even
better
that's how we created Piko Piko combines
numerous sensors into one tiny I mean
really tiny packs that attaches to your
smartphone it includes your laser based
particle sensors for measuring cancer
closing p.m. 10:00 and PM 2.5 finders
sensors for carbon dioxide and VOCs on
hygrometer for measuring humidity we
even threw in a thermometer for to
measure we made it or smartphone
connected device so you can measure and
track everything through the app pickle
is almost related promise production we
have fully tested our prototype with
half front and an institute of
technology with finalized design and we
lined up great Factory now we just need
heard from in the global trackers like
you to help us bring people to the world
oh yeah if you're curious about our
technology we have details on everything
on our IndieGoGo page
why do we need wireless charging pockets
because of the convenience and
practicality you don't want to be seen
carrying around a brick that still has
wires on it the snow see looks and feels
just like a regular jacket except it
isn't the snow see smart jacket is the
most innovative and useful of all smart
apparel it simply lets you charge your
phone wirelessly inside of your pockets
and this is available for men and women
in Arctic silver or black ice wireless
charges today would never get the job
done like we wanted it to so we decided
to reinvent them using our own
technology our wireless chargers are 20
times thinner than a standard wireless
charger four times thinner than a credit
card and breaks three different records
including the only flexible wireless
charger on the market the snow seat is
built for the outdoors and the everyday
person although it's incredible
technology that's housed in the jacket
it can be used for skiing hiking and
even kayaking due to its water-resistant
coating the jacket uses a 3000 mAh
battery which sends power up to the
wireless charger which is located in the
breast pocket you can easily use your
own battery because of our open battery
compatibility we designed everything so
is intangible by hiding the technology
and wanting the user to feel like they
are wearing a normal jacket that will
keep you
the cable the wireless charger and the
battery has so lightweight and placed
accordingly so you won't even know it's
there
our chargers are compatible with all Qi
enabled phones and use a free special
adapter for phones at armed with your
help we can move into a new way of
charging your phone wireless charging
inside of your pockets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
