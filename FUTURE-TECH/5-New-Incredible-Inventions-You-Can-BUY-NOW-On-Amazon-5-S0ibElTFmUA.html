I'm a cool mom but things need to be
under control well have you seen my
notebook Thanks
there isn't a lot that goes on around
here without me knowing about it honey
have you seen me thanks
and when it comes to my home it's no
different healthy home coach monitors
the vitals of my home so I don't have to
worry about the things that I can't see
or hear it lets me know when things can
be better better I can check every room
in the house for my phone and make
adjustments if I need to seems like it's
a bit too loud in my little ones room
and nap time is extremely important
extremely important
healthy home coach also monitors indoor
air quality which is great because
indoor air can be much more polluted
than outside air Honu it's like having
eyes in the back of my head Touche
when all is good and make sure you know
healthy home coach helps me take care of
the people I love most these guys more
than 40% of our lives are spent in habit
for most of us that time is wasted the
secret to transformation is not to try
harder it's to replace bad habits with
the habits of excellence if you wanted
to transform yourself how would you
start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shock each surge of
voltage trains your brain and weakens
the neural connection until the bad
habit is severed next replace the bad
habit with a positive one reward
yourself when you complete your daily
goal commit to a penalty if you fail the
fear of loss stimulates your basal
ganglia while the chance of reward
motivates your prefrontal cortex in
fewer than 30 days the action becomes a
habit
pavlok is the first system designed to
help you build good habits and break bad
ones earn rewards when you succeed pay
the price when you fail and experience
the electric shock that keeps you on
track contribute to the crowdfunding
campaign today hi I'm Annie Satie
founder of pavlok now I know that
electric shock sounds crazy but
sometimes crazy works like many
revolutionary ideas ours started off
just as a fun project but it turned into
something much more together with my
co-founder Jim Lynch we set out to
create Pavlov the world's first device
that doesn't just track what you do but
actually changes what you do here you
see pavlok in this wristband for but at
its core pavlok is a small module it's
small enough that it can stick anywhere
on your body
now padlock is able to vibrate beep and
even electrically shocked you on command
but what padlock can do is much more
instead of me telling you what I'd like
to do let me show you what padlock is
already done
hi my name is David Goldstein I'm hoping
to use padlock to get me into a better
exercise routine I am a cancer survivor
I've had heart attack I was in a
wheelchair for a while nice to have some
paralysis of both legs as you can see
I've put on a great deal of weight and
I'm hoping that padlock can help me
address all of those issues I am at 65
days at the past 70 woman of using the
padlock system I am down 7 pounds my
arms have got noticeably stronger and my
legs are actually the Strongs they've
been since I was paralyzed in 2001
go play my kids more at the end of the
day it's now just part of who I am and
what I do you see most of us just don't
know what greatness feels like we assume
that we're gonna do what we've always
done but users like David tell a
different story
when they begin to fall back into an
older team how about chokes them out of
it in most cases their older team can be
replaced in fewer than 30 days people
are already using pavlok to begin
writing everyday to learn new languages
to exercise to journal to begin to form
and break dozens of new hats in fact
there's infinite capabilities thanks to
padlocks open developer API I know
firsthand how powerful small habit
changes can be and I'm excited to share
pavlok with the world
that's where IndieGoGo supporters like
you come in we've built the padlock
prototype we've begun testing on users
now we need your help to begin setting
up manufacturing so we can deliver
pavlok and help it change the habits
that matter most to you
