near eye display with see-through
capability that uses your smartphone to
project panoramic IMAX like imagery add
up to five times the resolution of V our
viewers providing you a personal theater
experience anytime and anywhere
compatible with most modern smartphones
simply slide your phone in to expand
connect an optional controller or air
mouse and immerse yourself in your
favorite movies shows and apps in
stunning resolution hi I'm will founder
of expanse as a gamer I love the idea of
3d hands-on fully immersive
virtual-reality like the rift revived
but there just isn't enough good content
out for these devices and it'll take a
while before there is so with that in
mind I set to work designing a VR device
that would transform the way we use non
VR content like playing video games or
binge watching your favorite movies or
TV shows anyone who's watched a movie in
a gear VR or a rift knows how our murse
of it is watch a video in a life-size
virtual theater but current VR devices
just don't have the resolution needed
for movies and games why is that well
now give er each eye sees a separate
roundish image but uses less than half
of the screen worse the standard
rectangular aspect ratio for videos and
most non VR content has to fit within
your VR square aspect ratio waiting
another half of the pixel this is why
gear VR content is pixelated and suffers
from the so called screen door effect
there just aren't enough pixels but with
expand each eye can see all of the
displays pixels providing it for 3.6
million pixels per eye almost twice the
resolution of a 1080p TV and five times
more than a movie in gear VR or a rib
but resolution is only half the battle
immersion also requires field of view
other near eye displays are described as
looking like a 50-inch TV of 8 V as you
can see here this gives you about a 30
degree
for comparison behind it is a 10-foot
projector screen which provides a 64
degree field of view and here is expanse
and almost twice the resolution and over
90 degrees field of view this means you
can catch your favorite movie show or
sports game on an IMAX sized screen in
full resolution anywhere in your house
or on the go
fans uses your phone so you can stream
your content anywhere you can get a
cellular or Wi-Fi connection
we've also sourced a full HD display
cartridge that slides into expanse and
connects to your favorite HDMI device
and we're currently working on a 4k
AMOLED cartridge which would provide a
4k feeder experience at 10% the cost of
a similar TV but this is only the
beginning
expanses head tracking and see-through
capability allow you to use it in new
and exciting ways with it's stunning
resolution expanse is the single best
way to experience new and immersive 360
content spans doesn't suffer from
pixelation or the so called screen door
effect which can ruin immersion drone
enthusiasts can watch a high-definition
real-time feed from their drones camera
overlaid on the real world letting you
pilot your drones while simultaneously
getting a first-person view of the
flight from the cockpit and GoPro heroes
can show off their most recent
adventures the way they were meant to be
seen while HDR photography enthusiasts
can see their photos on site in wide
field of view right when they take them
expanse also offers new and exciting
challenges for software developers to
begin making the first wave of apps that
utilize our unique speaker design
whether it's a heads-up display of GPS
or an augmented reality pet your
imagination set the limit for what
expanse can view we've been through
countless product design and prototype
iteration we finally arrived at a design
that is comfortable functional and
stylish we have production quotes from
multiple manufacturers including a
handful that are capable of molding
including our unique optics you should
be ready to start production in 12 weeks
we're extremely excited to share expense
to the Kickstarter community
so please support and helped make
expanse the reality can you imagine how
future technologies will change our
lives we live in reality but there is a
dream inside everyone what if we can
bridge the gap between dreams and
reality hi my name is Amy
I've been computer engineer for nearly
400 years I'm proud to present to you in
person time virtual reality with an
interactive experience
like you have never seen before in
person time is a revolutionary VR
headset it is Wireless enabling
unlimited movement and incorporates 3d
gesture control position tracking in a
perfect combination of both virtual and
augmented reality I think interactive
controllers are the last major obstacle
for dr to achieve mass consumers options
at its core it is a computer vision
powerhouse made possible by our
specially designed sensing hardware
computing units and advanced algorithms
virtual reality is my passion
my dream has always been making a
digital world as realistic natural
interactive as a real one and combine
the two worlds together in 2004 I've
created one of the first virtual 3d
desktop interfaces and I haven't stopped
creating everything now at impression hi
we are creating something that is truly
mobile and many memory in the most
engaging VR and AR experiences
embedded IMU enabled high-performance at
orientation tracking by observing the
relative positioning in question pi is
able to calculate the actual movements
the computer vision algorithm processes
the images of hands collects information
on hand movements and generates 3d
gesture modeling augmented reality
overlays the real world within the
virtual scenario to provide a
spectacular display that makes what you
see much more enjoyable
you can also confer precious virtual
moments and share them on social
networks
you
we are a multidisciplinary team of core
technologies developed in the Bay Area
and we have manufacturing experts in
China working to put increasing high
mass production is designed to be
fashionable foldable and very compact
you can easily carry it
you can enjoy in person pioneering
social network education and a countless
variety of ways to have a deeply
immersive intellect 3d experience
the oppression eyes erm a displays and
some unique interested in just your
controls that it brings to the mobile
platform i think i will enable some very
interesting gameplay mobile devices that
are powering some of these drf i hope i
really can always get a heads up as we
have impression 5 and create a portal we
designed this product to take you beyond
the reality to where your imagination is
the only limit in order to do that we
need your support we ask you to play a
part and share in the creation of this
captivating product
Paulo tour is one of the Holland's
launch experiences it's a travel
experience that makes you feel like
you've been transported to a place and
feel like you're really there it's a
crazy goal feel like you're really there
what does that even mean like how could
you ever possibly achieve that we were
able to take video and blend it with
some 3d geometry near the user so you
can get up out of your chair and
experience the world around you as you
go the fact that's untethered you can
actually walk around the room you can
turn around there are no wires to be in
your way and that's not something that
you just can't get on another device my
favorite moment in Rome is when you
travel back in time in the Coliseum and
watch a gladiator fight from the
perspective of the Emperor that's a
really cool way to connect with history
that you can't even get even when you're
there the app developer side of this it
is very approachable a lot of your
design stems from a user's natural
behavior when the users head is the
virtual camera the user turns their head
where they want and that drives the
virtual camera that controls what
they're seeing so finding ways to use
body movements that match what your app
is doing that's really the challenge
with the sound because we have a very
accurate understanding of where the
users head is in space we can localize
those sounds and make them feel like
they're actually in the real world in
exactly the same way that we do with
Holograms the sound source feels like
it's coming from that location I feel
like a taps into these sort of
underlying subconscious behaviors you
know you can sort of start localizing
things just by sound you're like it
sounds like it's right up there as long
as you focus on building experiences
that bring these Holograms into your
real world it doesn't really matter
precisely what they're about as long as
you're building human centered
experiences Halla tour and showing you
what this device can do and I hope that
it's an inspiration for people that want
to build their own app with a mixed
reality device the real key is that
ability to navigate
the physical space very comfortably well
same time occupying this immersive
virtual space it still feels like magic
now we are gives you a real feeling me
captain the world's first controller
that makes each touch and we are
absolutely make them try to touch it
it's so real that you're going to blush
or left
all want to know what the secret is it's
an innovative technology with tiny
cultures that create 100% real field
it's the first time you can experience
they're known for Jennifer and help to
change the virtual reality forever you
do have those people cake no wires one
BR put it on and you're all set up let's
make this huge step in we are together
and we'll get a whole VR world
opportunity after
and
it's like a bag and follow-the-sun kick
off the shoes and have some fun get mad
again let's go man oh yeah we kids ah so
and
let this moment
there's no doctor
so grab somebody don't you know oh yeah
we could Paco
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
