I'm from Heiser defense I'm here to
introduce our ps1 paka shotgun it's a
410 tune it's this one's chambers for
two and a half inch round you loaded
here single shot it's stainless steel or
titanium it's got storage compartment in
the bottom you can store 45s or cleaning
kit or whatever else you need to put on
the bottom and it's all stainless
construction we machine and and
manufacture all the parts in st. Louis
we're just located south of st. Louis
and peevly Missouri this particular gun
here we shot over five thousand rounds
through it and we're still shooting it
today
without a fail all we did is clean the
barrel and that's all we did and we kept
shooting continuously in two and a half
days over five thousand rounds but that
have failed we've been in the
manufacturing business over 50 years and
we decided to venture into some firearm
business diversify and we said let's
come up with something really different
and radical let's come up with a pocket
shotgun and that's what we did we're
going into production now in November
time frame is done when we gonna start
delivering the gun and we're gonna have
the guns we're out the 499 price range
is where it's gonna start and let me
chambered for two and a half but we will
be coming out with the 410 for a three
inch shell also
these days children my smartphones
tablets and handheld devices a much more
attractive to them than watching TV an
addiction to the use of the devices is
not in healthy perspect either body or
mind think about this issue we came up
with an idea that there should be a more
positive interactive device for children
introducing the beggar AR projector it
is our belief that great idea come from
pre camera such as great media and this
camera should be adorable cute inovative
and a nurture a child's imagination this
is our eager it looks like an egg but
your child it could be a monster or at
first a monster and now a pretty girl
and before it was a pretty girl by in
rarity it's a boy although at first it
may seem like just a toy we have
developed this way to preserve a child's
innocence agar was built with our
consideration for the whole children
such as knowing that children are
naturally sensitive to light so we have
scared projection brightness down to 100
Loomis to ensure a child's comfort and
safety Acker also supports a smart
lighting system which automatically
adjust its brightness depending on its
surrounding agar is tailored for
children so it's very easy to operate
with our safe contact charging system
using magnetic pole connect to
technology offer a simple fast and safe
charging operation even while charging
agar remains of cool and cute intuitive
and versatile agar is made for children
to enjoy with just a few case of
operation which is demonstrated in the
design of Agra remote controller our
sincere hope is that there could be a
screen tailor designs our children
these are atomic bands the cool new
devices for smart Bluetooth gaming Siena
calls them one of the top new gadgets of
CES 2017
here they are in action
people don't want to train because it's
boring and tedious but we are
professional dancers and martial artists
and movement junkies and we want people
to love movement as much as we do there
are a bazillion fitness trackers already
on the market pedometers distance
trackers but there's nothing really out
there that analyzes correct form like
complex movements and atomic bands lets
you do that because us form equals
function and now you can link to a whole
gaming platform that teaches you to pop
and lock you can do shaolin kung fu you
can learn how stance we want to be the
duolingo of movement atomic bands are
smart bluetooth gaming advanced
bluetooth motion tracking single or
multiplayer options no standing in front
of a camera and most of all these bands
teach you real skills the LED lights and
OLEDs screen make it as fun as pinball
on your wrists all in a cool yin-yang
design which come together like a Temple
of Doom Oracle so putting them back
together the charge feels cool and so
the players learn real skills in the app
platform has actually created the first
ever royalty payment system for movement
artists so poppers can pop loose you
guys can punch and flip house dancers
can shuffle and make money from their
art this gaming platform actually
supports the arts we now have working
prototype and designs are ready to start
manufacturing and production but we need
your help to break atomic bands too
atomic bins turbocharged smart Bluetooth
