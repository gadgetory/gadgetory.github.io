hi and welcome to Urbo today we're going
to be taking a look at our keyring
charger this is a great way to charge or
sync your mobile devices this particular
one is designed for Apple devices so it
has a USB connector on one side and a
lightning connector on the other side
but I'm going to show you this product
in action here so you can see what
really makes it unique and that is of
course on my key ring
so I'll just zoom in so you can get a
little closer look so what I really like
about this product is that it's firstly
it's ultra small it's not going to
tangle and it has a magnetic loop so
that it can easily close with a positive
lock there and it's also very easy to
remove from the keyring now I know that
personally I often lose my lightning
cables but I never lose my keys so by
combining the two I'm sure that I'm
always able to charge and sync my mobile
device on the go it's available in four
different colors as you can see and you
can buy them individually as well it
outputs 5 volts 1.5 amps that's just a
standard charging voltage and amperage
and of course it's available in a micro
USB connector for your Android devices
it doesn't have to go on a keyring it
could definitely go on something else I
actually have a backpack with me today
just to give you an example of what it
looks like you know on another here we
go here here it is on my backpack
easy to put on easy to take off and very
hard to lose once again this is the Urbo
keyring charger and it's for your mobile
devices Apple or Android and thank you
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
