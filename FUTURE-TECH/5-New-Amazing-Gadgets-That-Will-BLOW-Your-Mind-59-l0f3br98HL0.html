folks we have a chance to make this at
home
you
hi Kickstarter I'm Avram
over the past year me and my partner
John have been working hard to bring you
ding a beautiful simple smart doorbell
for your home the idea is a simple one
when you press the doorbell button you
hear a chime in your home like a normal
doorbell but you also receive a call to
your smartphone allowing you to talk
with the person at the front door from
wherever you are in the world whether
you rent your flat out on Airbnb
you're out of earshot in the garden or
even on holiday you carry your doorbell
wherever you go is right there in your
pocket you'll never miss your door again
currently doorbells are unloved and
forgotten objects they don't work with
how we lead our busy lives that we
control through our smartphones we want
to fix this for you you should control
things through our smartphone app this
allows you to set the kind of time you
have look at caller history and even set
some quiet time when you don't want to
wake up the household we've worked for
over a decade and the design and
technology industries and design is
really important to us we don't want to
make just another plastic box that sits
in the corner of your room we want to
make ding something really special that
complements your home rather than
distract him from it we didn't spend a
lot of time trying to find the right
finish in color for ding whether it was
for the chime which had to feel really
it belonged inside the home so we made
it really friendly and warm using the
fabric for example doorbells haven't
really changed in 50 years it's about
moving that kind of doorbell from
something that you were only able to
interact with when you're in the home to
actually something that you can use from
anywhere we've had some great support in
developing ding from both the UK Design
Council
and from John Lewis a leading department
store in the UK from a John Lewis
perspective it's a perfect product you
know we are really excited about new
innovation coming our way and given the
kind of the big boom that we're seeing
around smart home we think this place
perfect it's that trend we believed in
will change the way people think about
smiles making it more about the home and
less about the tech inside with our
manufacturing partners we're almost
ready for production so if you want to
be one of the first to own d check out
our page below there's several rewards
for you to choose from including
ordering your very own ding we hope
you're all as excited about ding as we
are and we're looking forward to bring
it to you very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
