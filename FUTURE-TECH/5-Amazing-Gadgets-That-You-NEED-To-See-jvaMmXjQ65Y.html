so why did we create the 50 pen research
has shown that when we're experiencing
anxiety or boredom fidgeting is the
body's natural mechanism to help us stay
focused present in the moment so the
reason we created the officiating
features embedded inside of the pen is
that so people could fidget more
discreetly you know there's a lot of
other fidget toys out there but the
problem is they're too large and if you
distract into others that's why we
believe that fidgeting is for anyone who
wants to stay focused their lacks and
have fun of the process also research
has shown that people at atb ADHD and
autism can greatly benefit from
fidgeting we believe that habits such as
nail-biting leg shaking and finger
tapping can be channeled into the fidji
pen help people stay cool calm and
