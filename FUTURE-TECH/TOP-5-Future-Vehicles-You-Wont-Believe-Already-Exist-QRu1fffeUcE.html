wonder why a car company is using the
hoverboard in one of its ads is Lexus
planning to make hoverboards now no
shock it's just another marketing stunt
but the hoverboard you see is very real
it's actually levitating and you can
totally ride it but is it the
transportation of the future
probably not
so for like the last two decades we've
been teased with the existence of
functional hoverboards Back to the
Future Part two gave us a glimpse of
what a hoverboard may look like in the
year 2015 director Robert Zemeckis
further fueled our imaginations by
claiming that they used real hoverboards
in the film and that the only thing
stopping these things from being
mass-produced was concerned parent
groups but that's not true at all
they didn't exist last year Funny or Die
trolled the internet with Christopher
Lloyd Tony Hawk and random celebrities
riding a fake hoverboard called the
hover which they swore up and down was
true and that was also not real so when
Lexus released its first hoverboard
teaser earlier this summer I along with
the rest of the Internet was super
skeptical it looked so real but Lexus
out of all companies and then we were
invited to see the thing in person the
whole thing felt a little bit weird in a
beach town about 45 minutes away from
Barcelona Lexus built an entire skate
park or hover Park if you will that
acted as a set for its commercial and
yeah this park was built just for the
hoverboard which does exactly what you
think it hovers off the ground like a
proper hoverboard but as I'm sure you've
guessed there are some big caveats like
the track it needs to run on which is
crucial to how the thing works at all
inside the board are rows of
superconductors a special property of
these type 2 superconductors is that
when they're cooled down to a critical
temperature the exhibit properties that
alter and manipulate any magnetic field
around them therefore the board must be
ridden above a highly engineered track
that's carefully embedded with magnets
strong enough to hold the board and a
rider normally the track is hidden under
the hover pod the board must be resting
upon a portion of that same track when
being cooled with liquid nitrogen which
essentially programs it to levitate at a
certain height after this process is
complete the board can be brought over
to the park and will hover above the
track at roughly the same height about 4
centimeters
this technology isn't actually that new
it's a process called flux pinning and
we've seen people do some fun things
with this on a small scale before but
now that it's been applied to a
hoverboard
what's that actually like to ride it's
hard it's not as easy as riding a
skateboard where all four wheels are on
the ground
the magnetic track in the ground lines
up vertically with the center of the
board
so it's kind of like you're on a
tightrope and if your balance isn't
perfectly distributed on this thing you
end up scraping the ground with the
undersides of the board it took me like
15 minutes just to glide a few feet so
yeah no shot I was going to ride around
the park like Marty McFly did and Back
to the Future Part 2 luckily though I
had the chance to speak with pro skater
Ross McGowan the guy featured in the
commercial so you've been skating for
15-20 years you say yeah and how long
did it take you to get master in a sense
where you could ride around the track
without scraping yeah I mean after that
it's been about five six months I've
been trying to save it now I can go down
to this straight line and even some
corner that scrapes a bit but you can
write yourself it's quick enough so you
don't fall off you can feel it under
your feet feel that sweet spot yeah yeah
just the feeling of some invisible air
rail thing is what it feels like to me
so riding the hoverboard is very
difficult and besides that another major
problem with this thing is that it needs
to be constantly cooled with liquid
nitrogen and when it was as hot as it
was outside that day in Spain we got ten
or fifteen minutes on the board before
it had to be refilled a process itself
that takes another ten or fifteen
minutes at this point I gotta wonder why
this thing even exists
the Lexus hoverboard isn't actually a
product it's just a special effect in a
car commercial it's part of a series
Lexus refers to as amazing in motion
the hover bike is a result of years of
research and development we combined the
freedom of a helicopter with the
simplicity of a motorcycle to create the
world's first hover bike
developing a hover bike is expensive and
challenging and we need your support to
make this a reality the hover bike flies
like a helicopter however it is rugged
and easy to use it represents a whole
new way to fly we created a 1/3 scale
hover bike drone to test a new quad
aerodynamic concept how drone will allow
you to see and feel just how it will be
to fly the full-scale hover bike and
will help with raising the funds needed
to bring the hover bike to market we
have moved to a proven quadcopter design
and this is what our second-generation
hover bike looks like trains should be
friendly and approachable l drone has
ducks around the propellers that protect
bystanders from the blade tips and
allows us to safely operate near the
vehicle we designed a large payload Bay
that can be easily adapted for different
uses a real multi-purpose tool
we felt it important to keep turns fun
safe and accessible to as many people as
possible
I like other most doctors are spikes
down to a third of its size and be
easily transported in a custom multi-use
bag we don't think the world senior just
how useful drones of all shapes and
sizes can actually be the Ducks come
embedded with LED lights for brilliant
nighttime fly we and our large community
of supporters around the world are
really passionate up the idea of cheap
safe airborne transportation with your
help to back this project we can
continue to develop the world's first
flying motor bike with your help we can
take another small step in the evolution
of light
