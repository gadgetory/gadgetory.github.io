yourself up keep it simple with joy
what do you do when you can't find
something you need you create it we want
to change the experience of multitasking
with a smartphone
that's what hallo stand is for by
combining technology in nature we
handcrafted a multifunctional design
object hey we made it affordable sorry
Chris an affordable multifunctional
design object it wasn't easy but we did
it hallo combines elegant design with
beautiful materials the body is made
from solid wood with a clean and dynamic
texture it feels natural when you first
see hallo it doesn't look like an
ordinary phone stand because it isn't we
were eager to explore modern
technological possibilities and put some
inside first we created hallo phone Stan
the great assistant for daily tasks then
we developed hallo with a wireless
charger giving uninterrupted working
experience and finally we added a power
bank so no matter where you are your
battery is backed up we wanted to find
the perfect way to attach your phone to
the stand and then we found nano suction
cups magically strong and wonderfully
effective they work like ordinary
suction cups
but hallows sticky pad has millions of
them and get any better than this oh yes
it can our packaging makes hallo a
perfect gift for someone who loves
gadgets we believe that unpackaging
hallo could be even more fun than
opening your new smartphone hey folks we
already have tested and working
prototype but to make color widely
available we need your support so that
in the world full of plastics we could
give you something real
