today share this dream with me and thank
you of supporting causing problem so the
last few years I've had to go for
several conferences and conventions and
most of them are in the US and from
Singapore that's kind of like a 20-hour
trip and in order to try to get some
sleep I usually have to bring two carlos
pillows in all yet enough support I
recently had the luck of being able to
try out this Koree travelers below and
one of the cool things about this is
this the cushions can be moved into
whatever position with Velcro and
when I get them in the right position it
almost feels like I'm getting the
support two pillows with just this one
and what I really like about this is it
rolls up into a pretty small package and
as a forward to carrying this on my next
trip I travel a lot in my line of work
and homework once a month and you know
it is very important to get to a
restaurant on the plane or in car on the
train usually travel reduced way to have
another big complaint tired so recently
I came across this quarry Travis below
which is very interesting product
extremely compact which fits right into
my bag and very easy to carry around
something like this you know given the
necessary support that you want when I
apply scripts and read so the many ways
of using a cover to pillows you can
actually just wrap it around your neck
you know and give you enough support for
you to take a nice rest or nice in there
and you know you can actually change it
also to get even more before and then
you put it in the position that you know
for me with the portal color and it
gives you just enough firm and if you
just be good support for for a nice long
in a long-haul flight or something like
this actually
you know kohai because I have very very
young kids and it makes sense they fall
asleep quite often you know their naps
in the elements because when you're
driving on the plane they want to be and
this just gives them you know what will
support for their neck you know it is
growing space and they say quite enjoy
there lots of colors and the different
colors it comes in a flow
so I think you know what I'm going to be
traveling this time to do something that
I will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
