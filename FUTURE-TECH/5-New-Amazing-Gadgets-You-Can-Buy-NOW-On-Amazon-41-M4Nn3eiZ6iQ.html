even this guy
you
my name is viktoria who I just graduated
from UC Berkeley and I am the co-founder
of accent accent where is a company that
makes innovative headphones that you
haven't seen before I came up with idea
wild girl but I was never able to turn
into a reality
fortunately I met my best friend
Victoria and she was able to help me
with a lot of the things that I could
accomplish by myself so we came up with
the idea for the name for accent wear
when we were actually just on FaceTime
you're chatting with a bunch of our
friends and we were like hey guys let's
think of a good name that would be
fitting for this new company and we're
just throwing ideas back and forth and
finally someone said oh you know what
what about accidentally and we're like
you know what sounds pretty good first I
came up with a few sketches I drew them
on people's eyes whose good idea of how
they were worth tried all different
colors different designs there's a great
lab at UC Berkeley and we just got a
fellowship at the Innovation Lab and we
would go in every week and we would take
around and we just put things online
finally got a design I'm happy with I
started doing a 3d model of it I have a
physical model to try on people one of
the things that we ended up changing
through feedback from our our fans on
Facebook was that they wanted bigger
chance they wanted over the year instead
of on the years so we changed that
because a lot of people were requesting
that each new prototypes of the
headphones get closer and closer to a
leading vision so these are the
headphones action where accents and the
headbands and a lot of the plastic parts
are made of ABS which is recyclable
material so it is environmentally
friendly that way these are the LED
lights that are that show up to be the
color that you choose we're going to
have a couple of options these are the
external speakers so you can share music
with your friends we're really excited
to make these a reality and to take
these from the prototyping stage to the
final product we really hope that you'll
support us in our endeavors please back
us up on our campaign and help us turn
this into a reality thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
