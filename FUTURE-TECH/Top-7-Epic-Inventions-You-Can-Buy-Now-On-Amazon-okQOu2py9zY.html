it's Monday again isn't it this is Annie
who needs stress and tension relief over
the night but she never gets what she
deserves
many tried to fix the pillow problem but
they focused more on gimmicks like LEDs
speakers out materials and sleep
tracking devices inside the pillows
that's just silly as a doctor myself
seeing too many people suffering from an
insomnia and sleep disorders I thought I
had to do something about it
and this is my first big step for you
why tolerate poor sleep any longer we
wanted to take it back to the
fundamentals the core value of sleep
itself rest recharge and repeat the
better sleep starts with not having to
think about it
introducing the dual plus pillow it's
wreckin AMA CLE designed for you to rest
recharge and repeat every night
first off rest whether you are a side
sleeper or a crazy sweeper don't worry
it supports and aligns the natural curve
of the cervical spine effortlessly in
every direction secondly recharge no
more waking up with a stiff neck and
shoulder recharge your energy with 12
hours of undisturbed sleep I say 12
hours yes trust me even eight hours will
feel like long and your Monday will be
full of energy thirdly repeat it ensures
perfect sleep every night for many years
to come all-night comfort how about
durability watch this don't think about
the sleep itself anymore leave that to
us with the dual plus pillow you will
sleep like a baby again
rest recharge and repeat you are gonna
love it because we designed it with such
precision and love in mind when sleep is
solved everything gets better
even your Monday's we can help that we
can promise
keeping our home safe is important to
all of us getting your house broken into
sucks it's not just the stuff that you
lose but because your home feels
violated what you want is to keep it
from happening in the first place
that's why we created Cunha help you
prevent break-ins
this is Cunha Cunha is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you so you can see and talk to
them on your smartphone hey could you
leave the package out front a little bit
it's the best way to actively prevent
break-ins most burglaries are crimes of
opportunity the burglars were actually
knock on your door to see if you're home
and when they realize you're not home
they'll attempt to enter your house
keeping them outside is the most
important thing you can do and koona
allows you to do that
you can deter burglars by talking to
them or setting off Kona's alarm yeah no
thanks
they'll leave and all this happens when
they're still outside before they even
try to break it making your home safer
it shouldn't be a chore for one of these
you have to climb in the Attic run wires
drill holes it's a pain and it's not
cheap that's why we built Cunha into an
outdoor light just replace your old
light fixture and use your existing
wiring connect to another Wi-Fi and
you're done it'll take 15 minutes
do we want Kona to look good no matter
where it is so we're making it in three
different styles to match your house and
you can put kuna anywhere front door
back door even the garage to wash your
car oh and your light gets smarter too
you can control it with the Cunha app
turn it on turn it off set a schedule or
just let it turn on automatically when
it gets dark when there's a person you
only want to get alerts that matter
Cunha ignores trees and small animals
and it recognizes people's behaviors so
if you don't want to know every time
your spouse goes out jogging
you can tell Kona die alert you only for
visitors waiting at the door
and it'll learn and get smarter over
time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones or the
delivery guy Kona will always let you
know and it is someone bad now you can
do something about it
kuna stop break-ins or they have
phones have evolved so much over the
past 15 years there's one problem
they're too big for our hands in fact in
the US alone a phone breaks every two
seconds costing us time money and
sometimes even our dignity that's why we
created loopy the first case with the
loop to stop the drop the first thing
you'll notice about being in the loop is
how secure and in control it feels loopy
literally makes it hard to drop your
phone these phones are so big and
slippery they're impossible to use
one-handed they seem to put all the most
used buttons and the hardest roof spots
both loopy making your whole screen is a
breeze even with the iPhone 6 plus using
your phone at loopy is truly a
one-handed experience and who isn't
always carrying a million things at once
the multi grasp is a lifesaver
simply flip grab and go you don't
realize how nice having an extra hand is
until you're in the loop moppy is a
perfect running buddy all of your apps
and music conveniently in your hand
no more frustrating hard to reach arm
bands your phone has an awesome camera
and with loopy you can use it to its
full potential with study pictures and
video
you can increase these places you've
never imagined pulling out your phone
before in fact this entire Kickstarter
video was filmed using nothing but
iPhones and our loopies how cool is that
we've gone through countless prototypes
to find the perfect design and even
secure the patents after testing dozens
of materials we chose silicon loops for
their unique properties our loops are
strong they're durable they're super
secure ensuring that your phone goes
Noah most importantly loops lay flat fit
into any pocket even the tightest one
in there perfect where when you don't
have pockets at all they're super comfy
so no more face jobs and lips even act
as a kickstand for sharing videos loops
are easy to install and adjustable to
fit any finger size plus they're
interchangeable make a loop be perfect
for any occasion
oopy is the perfect balance of slim and
protective with wraparound bumpers to
ensure that your phone stays in mint
condition
and thanks to early customer reviews and
surveys no detail was overlooked
including oversized accessory ports you
press buttons and durable materials are
designed to outlast your next phone up
drip loop you won first prize at both
Purdue and Indiana University
entrepreneurship competition those loop
love their even the pro this is one of
the highest rated slim cases that we've
reviewed out of three dozen cases always
really refreshing to find a product that
actually makes the technology that we
have is supposed to make our lives
easier easier to use
and now we need your support please back
this project to help make loopy a
reality and please share this with
everyone you can and with your support
we can stop the drop
here this project on Facebook Twitter or
Instagram and we'll toss in one free
kick starter edition loop with each case
