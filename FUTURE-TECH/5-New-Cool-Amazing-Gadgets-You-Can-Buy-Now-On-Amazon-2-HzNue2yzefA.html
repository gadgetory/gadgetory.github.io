even this guy
yeah well I don't really know where to
start
Rango was probably the coolest cat on
the face of the planet he used to ride
up to work with me on my motorcycle he
used to go to cafes together I was it
was a pretty cool relationship and
eventually I came across a young no
stuck to a tree saying that they had
found this really beautiful tabby cat
dead on the side of the road I decided
if nobody else had found a way of
tracking cats and dogs then I was
certainly going to so this is pod like
it's the smallest and lightest GPS
tracker in market has an interchangeable
battery it's waterproof
it has bluetooth but the most important
thing is that this device can be
attached to your animals collar and sync
to your phone allowing you to always
know where your animal is you never have
to worry about losing your pet again
we've spent a lot of time getting the
product design absolutely bang-on the
ergonomic design is really cool with no
sharp edges so it's as comfortable as
possible for the animal the app is a
really slick user experience so it's
both fun and functional to use and we've
squeezed as much as we can out of the
battery life getting up to a week's
usage I don't know you'd be inconsolable
would give us a dog not knowing where
they are or what they're doing or if
they're alive or if they're well he's
that type that tends to just wander off
and then we rely on other people to
bring him back but we're always worried
that there'll be a time when we lose in
forever they're one of the most amazing
features that we've developed is a pet
League which is like a social network
for your animal this is going to allow
you to compare your animals results
across the world so you'll be able to
determine whether you've got the fastest
dog in the park or the most adventurous
cat in the country the Apple so allows
you to set safe zone alerts so you can
actually see when your animal breaches
the set perimeter through an alert on
your phone you know here just he
disappears he goes on adventures it's
cool like that just to be able to see
what he's done how fast each dog ran and
then we can compare them to see which
one Maggie's faster so we're really
excited because we have confirmed orders
from some of the largest pet retailers
in the world we've finalized the design
and we're just about to go into the
final stages of production we really
need some help in production and that's
why we'd like you to support us in this
campaign and make sure that nobody ever
has to go through the pain of losing
their animal again like I did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
