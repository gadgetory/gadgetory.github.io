alektra goodnight goodnight sleep tight
listen blissful seclusion each toon is
so pure it's liberating everything in
between the lines striking i'm free but
lonely
that's when I come back to your voice
it's almost like a rush when I here
the connection is so clear and Patrick
this kind of scary how you can be so
close yet so far away I regain control I
feel alive and full of passion
sensations of glitter swings and would
it be crazy to call it magic because
it's like I'm there there with you
that's when I realized never actually
alone that's the sound of your phone
connecting to a charger it's the sound
of relief knowing you are still
connected to the world connecting and
disconnecting your phone from a charger
should be a simple seamless task but it
isn't we've all been there frustrated at
our cables for any number of reasons the
fight game looks it's becoming smaller
they haven't evolved to become any
easier to connect until now presenting
the future of USB cables ASAP connect
featuring rare earth neodymium magnets
with 18 karat gold plating ASAP connect
will change the way you interact with
your USB devices forever featuring the
world's first reversible cable both the
phone end and charger in
it works by inserting the tip to the
phone and the cable magnetizes onto the
tip instantly meaning you can
effortlessly connect when you only have
one hand free or in a hurry to head out
or even in the dark you no longer have
to worry about your device's getting
damaged
acep connect even helped you retrieve
your phone from hard-to-reach places
we've designed to test one for micro USB
devices such as Android phones mini
cameras and speakers the other is for
Apple products we've removed the
weakness of your traditional apple
lightning connector tip which snaps off
easily by combining the tip and base
into one piece we call this the Alpha
connector one of the engineering hurdles
in designing ASAP connect was its
compact size by condensing the
technology down to the size of a
fingertip we're able to make sure that
it's compatible with all phone cases in
creating a new standard for USB cables
we have performed the most stringent
quality control tests combined with
superior materials to really challenge
the users expectations of what a
state-of-the-art USB cable should be
we've spent the past two years working
closely with one of the world's largest
USB cable manufacturers we're a team of
disruptors from Sydney to LA believe
that users should be the creators of
products not large corporations seeking
profit over practicality we've created
the final prototype and delivered
samples to dozens of major tech
publications worldwide through your help
combined with the magic of IndieGoGo we
hope to bring ASAP connect to life and
unleash the future of USB cables today
