Emmett is an active non-invasive
wearable technology that helps us face
the challenges of our stressful

balanced state

to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn elf Emmet will
help you focus and concentrate when you
need to
most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting belf
Emmet will calm you down and rock you
into a deep sleep
elf Emmet works in synergy with the
natural rhythm of your mind and body
waves when you're active and focused
your brain frequency is high when you're
resting it slows down
however because of our busy lifestyle
our brain waves aren't always in tune
with what we need elf

technology to non-invasively synchronize
your mind with the frequency of what you
want to do learn and concentrate while
feeling stressed
improve the quality of your sleep stay
awake when feeling tired relax after a
hard day
we designed the technology around a
beautiful light headband that is powered
by your smartphone or tablet and
operated with a simple application
people have always used extremely low
frequencies to achieve altered states of
consciousness just think of meditating
to the rhythmic sound of drums gong
therapy or the steady flashing light of
a fire things that take us into a state
of thoughtfulness even when the sound of
train means
and rhythms in music a ticking clock
they all have an effect on us we always
adapt to an external frequency our
entire biological system the brain and
the earth itself work at the same
frequencies do you have the same problem
I do you arrange the furniture in your
home just the way you like it
but you can't move the light switches so
now you need to call an electrician hey
Kevin hey man what's up
I need that light switch changed I want
a light switch right here so I won't
fall off the bed anymore and I can turn
on the light switch right now whoa how
did you do that I also have a toddler
and I would like to switch lower so he
can reach it and I can turn on the
switch like this you used to think I
need to tear out pieces of the wall and
run additional wires but now this is no
longer necessary you just need to open
the package no setting replace the
existing light switch with this base
switch then you can put the gecko switch
wherever you want
and it's done
you can place an icon lets you know what
the geckos switch controls here there
are many icons to select from the LED
behind the icon lets you know when the
light is on or off makes a bedroom light
gradually brighten to wake you up or
make it to turn off with the time delay
3 to 1 if you can't find the Gecko

make your home and life exactly the way
you like it
hey no need for a hammer Kevin you just
need a gecko switch hello my name is
Scott come Fuhrman founder of clinically
fit the developers of the extensor first
thank you for buying our product I want
to take a few minutes to show you
exactly how this device works and help
you make the most out of using it you're
going to notice that there in your bag
there are going to be a series of finger
bands in three different sizes the
device fits on both of your hands with
the blue thumb bands fitting on either
one of your hands first thing you want
to do is find the bands that fit most
suitable to your fingers place them in
the device and then slowly a few times
for each one going through the motion of
prestretching your finger bands which is
going to activate the elasticity in
these bands making it a little bit
softer and a little easier to use next
you're going to notice that there's a
grid on here and this grid has three
different rows that allow you to
increase or decrease tension for each
one of your fingers individually the
first thing we're gonna do is place the
device arm it slips on either hand and
like a glove and just by sticking your
fingers in these bands both the blue and
the gray securing the strap to your
wrist
you'll be ready to go make sure that you
seek approval from your physician if you
have any kind of a condition before
beginning any exercise program the first
exercise we're going to do is going to
be with your arm held out straight
