need a gecko switch hello my name is
Scott come Fuhrman founder of clinically
fit the developers of the extensor first
thank you for buying our product I want
to take a few minutes to show you
exactly how this device works and help
you make the most out of using it you're
going to notice that there in your bag
there are going to be a series of finger
bands in three different sizes the
device fits on both of your hands with
the blue thumb bands fitting on either
one of your hands first thing you want
to do is find the bands that fit most
suitable to your fingers place them in
the device and then slowly a few times
for each one going through the motion of
prestretching your finger bands which is
going to activate the elasticity in
these bands making it a little bit
softer and a little easier to use next
you're going to notice that there's a
grid on here and this grid has three
different rows that allow you to
increase or decrease tension for each
one of your fingers individually the
first thing we're gonna do is place the
device arm it slips on either hand and
like a glove and just by sticking your
fingers in these bands both the blue and
the gray securing the strap to your
wrist
you'll be ready to go make sure that you
seek approval from your physician if you
have any kind of a condition before
beginning any exercise program the first
exercise we're going to do is going to
be with your arm held out straight
