surfer engineer and the CEO of Revell
the Revell Arc is the world's smartest
4k action camera so white is our cameras
so smart well we've built in four
different sensors into this camera that
measure elevation rotation speed
magnetic north as well as other motion
telemetry
we use it for electronic image
stabilization which takes out all the
bumps and jitters from your video but
beyond that we've built in a secondary
stabilization system which has a motor
built into the back of the camera which
keeps it always level to the horizon no
matter what you're doing including if
you mount the camera on a hubcap of a
band
think of it as a gimbal a camera and
more combined into one compact camera
which is waterproof and you can mount
anywhere you're not going to mount this
anywhere this means you can kite loop
barrel roll and even backflip while the
rebel art keeps your footage stable and
level to the horizon this has never been
possible before with any other camera or
a gimbal system so what else do we do
with all this information we capture all
kinds of live data including how fast
you were going how much airtime you got
even how many g-forces you pulled on top
of all that you can connect external
sensors like a heart rate monitor to
measure your excitement when things get
a little crazy
the final piece of the puzzle is our
sensory AI which analyzes the data
associated with your footage and makes
intelligent decisions it then determines
your most exciting moments and
automatically creates a shareable video
without hours of physical editing or
even a computer at revel we believe that
life was made for adventuring not
editing we want to make it as easy as
possible for you to shoot edit and share
your best moments instantly we can't
wait to see what you will be able to
create with the rebel art thank you
you
okto spot is the first camera that is
able to lock your dive it's also the
first to automatically correct the white
balance to match your depth it records
in high quality and is intuitive to use
it has a long battery life even in cold
water we've designed everything to be
operated while using gloves and it can
be mounted fast and easy the octo spot
is made for divers you feel when it
starts recording and sharing your videos
is easy all you have to do is enjoy the
dive
we've got big plans for the future
but we can't do it without you support
so get on board and come along for the
ride</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
