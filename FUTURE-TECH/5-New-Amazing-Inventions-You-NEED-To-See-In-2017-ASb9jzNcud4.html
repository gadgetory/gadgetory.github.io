shift a better solution
more than 300 72,000 people can be saved
from drowning this year that's why it's
our mission at Kinji to provide water
safety hi I'm Tom agape at ease I came
up with the idea of Kinsey after I lost
a very good friend of mine three years
ago he drowned in the lake similar to
this one and it could have been
prevented when you drive a car you put
your seatbelt on when you ride a bike
you put on your helmet but how do you
protect yourself in water you set out to
make the smallest inflatable in the
world and we came up with a convenient
non-intrusive way to provide safety to
all of those in and around water
this is Kinji affordable floatation
device that comfortably secures onto
your wrist it's fast to deploy durable
and contained within a compact design
kenji helps in case of exhaustion or
heavy currents or when this for
circulation or cramps any time you're on
the water even if you're just relaxing
you'll want a Kinji for you and a friend
we like kenji because it's small it
doesn't get your way when you're trying
to paddle out a lot of times when you're
surfing there's not a lifeguard anywhere
near so this gives you a little bit more
sense of security
Kinji can stay inflated for over 48
hours it includes a compass as well as a
whistle for signaling help in case of
emergency having knowledge and good
judgment are the first steps and water
safety but Kenji can be an important aid
when you're need it's easy and fast
deploy and its are even greater
investments kenji is durable and the co2
cartridge is replaceable so you can
reuse kenji as many times as needed who
need your help to stop production and
fight the dangers of drowning with your
support you become an integral part of
our team of ambassadors and you'll be
the first to receive a Kingsman
