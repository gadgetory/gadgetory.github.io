personal breathalyzer the BACtrack go
measuring only two and a half inches
high and weighing just two ounces the
BACtrack go is also one of the smallest
breathalyzers in the world powered by
backtracks advanced micro check sensor
technology the go delivers reliable and
accurate BAC results you can trust at
the touch of a button
included with the go are one triple-a
battery three reusable mouthpieces and
the instruction manual operating the go
is easy simply power on the device and
wait for the countdown timer to begin
it's important to wait 15 minutes after
eating drinking or smoking before
testing this ensures that your results
are as accurate as possible once ready
take a deep breath and blow through the
mouthpiece until the beeping stops the
goes innovative fold out mouthpiece
ensures that only a precise breath
sample enters the alcohol sensor while
ambient air and other external
pollutants are kept out once your breath
sample has been analyzed your BAC result
is displayed on an easy-to-read LCD
screen for more information about the go
as well as our full line of
award-winning backtrack breathalyzers
please visit us on line at wwlp.com I hi
I'm Jason Moore health coach and founder
of the top-rated elite EHR via and I'm
excited to introduce the course since
the course sense measures heart rate
variability also called HRV HRV is a
deeper and more comprehensive biomarker
than something like steps
heart rate it's kind of like the check
engine light for your entire body in
mind heart rate variability examines the
tiny imperceptible changes and patterns
between heartbeats our advanced
algorithms analyze these precise times
between heartbeats and detects activity
from the nervous system which actually
controls processes like energy
regulation digestion mood and the
response to stress the course sent slips
directly onto a finger and connects via
bluetooth with any heart rate
variability app so you can capture an
HIV measurement in as little as 2 pi 8
minutes each day that could be first
thing in the morning while waiting for
your morning coffee or even for live
biofeedback during much-needed
meditation with this simple daily
check-in the elite HIV app guides you in
optimizing your nutrition training
recovery sleep stress and more heart
rate variability plays a key role in
tracking the progress of my patients
today they come into my facility to get
their HIV readings but because course
sense is so easy to use my patients can
now track their HIV at home this will
help me to regularly check their
progress adjust the treatment plan and
speed up their journey to better health
and well-being with coarse cents an HRV
our mission has been to help people
tackle their goals whatever they may be
and improve their lives but without the
discomfort and inconvenience of chest
straps and adhesives over the years we
heard from so many of our hundred
thousand-plus app users that's why we
partnered with experts and innovators
and sensor technology to come up with
the course sense from the ground up it
has a rechargeable battery that can go
up to six months on a single charge it
has a flexible design that will
comfortably fit fingers of all sizes and
shapes the core sense doesn't come with
any buttons it is intelligent and will
automatically power on when you insert
your finger then it'll detect your pulse
and connect to the HIV app accuracy and
sensitivity are really important to us
you really need accuracy in order to
measure valid and useful HIV that's why
we designed the course ins with medical
grade sensors that are comparable to a
five lead ECG it has built in an
advanced signal algorithm to help detect
arrhythmia the topic heartbeats and even
false beats attributed to signal noise
you take a two minute HIV reading in the
and instantly see your results which we
call our morning readiness gauge the
gauge gives you a green yellow or red
indicator of how able you are to handle
stress on any given day you can also tag
your reading with things like alcohol
consumption your mood exercise or sleep
to gain a deeper understanding of those
items that most impact you as you make
changes in your lifestyle or in your
exercise plan after years of research
development prototyping and rigorous
testing we're ready to bring Corson's to
you the Kickstarter community we simply
need the initial capital to complete
tooling and start full-scale
manufacturing support our Kickstarter to
receive your own corsets and in just two
minutes a day start making vastly better
decisions for your health performance
stress and resilience Thank You

hi I'm awake and I'm really excited to
present you my new product I wanted to
learn something new about coding and
build a vintage budget I came up with
Nixie a club connecting old-school T of
display with a modern technology it took
me a long time to learn essential
background for this project and develop
the best solution I wanted to find a
compromise between classic design and
possibly high-end technology
you can control it with your phone to
change the color time Buckeye effect or
sleep mode
it is ready to go out of the box all you
need to do is to find a nice place for
me to see its versatility makes the
clock of it almost every interior style
it helped me to develop myself and I
would like to share it with you now I
need your support to make it available
for everyone thanks for watching
meet sensible a unique device that makes
any air conditioner smart making your
life comfortable sensibo turns off the
AC when you leave home and saves up to
40% on energy consumption with the
sensible app you can easily control the
AC from anywhere assuring the right
temperature at the right time sensibo
your smart AC has arrived
I fill Swift here for flex tape the
super strong waterproof tape
Beckett instantly patch Vaughn ceylon
repair flex tape is no ordinary tape
it's triple thick adhesive virtually
welds itself to the surface instantly
stopping the toughest leaks leaky pipes
can cause major damage but flex tape
grips on tight and bombs instantly plus
flex tapes powerful adhesive is so
strong it even works underwater now you
can repair leaks and pools and spas
without draining them flex tape is
perfect for marine campers and RVs flex
tape is super strong and once it's on it
holds on tight and for emergency auto
repair clicks tape keeps its grip even
in the toughest conditions big storms
can cause big damage but flex tape comes
super wide so you can easily patch large
holes
I saw this boat in half and repaired it
with only flex tape not only this flex
tapes powerful ease of hold the boat
together but it creates a super strong
watertight seal so the inside is
completely dry just cut peel stick and
sealed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
