keeping our home safe is important to
all of us getting your house broken into
sucks it's not just the stuff that you
lose but because your home feels
violated what you want is to keep it
from happening in the first place that's
why we created Cunha help you prevent
break-ins
this is Cunha Cunha is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you so you can see and talk to
them on your smartphone hey could you
leave the package out front a little bit
it's the best way to actively prevent
break-ins most burglaries are crimes of
opportunity the burglars were actually
knocked on your door to see if you're
home and when they realize you're not
home they'll attempt to enter your house
keeping them outside is the most
important thing you can do and koona
allows you to do that you can deter
burglars by talking to them or setting
off Kona's alarm yeah no thanks they'll
leave and all this happens when they're
still outside before they even try to
break it making your home safer
shouldn't be a chore for one of these
you have to climb in the Attic run wires
drill holes it's a pain and it's not
cheap that's why we built Cunha into an
outdoor light just replace your old
light fixture it and use your existing
wiring connector no to Wi-Fi and you're
done it'll take 15 minutes do we want
Cunha to look good no matter where it is
so we're making it in three different
styles to match your house you can put
Cunha anywhere front door back door even
the garage to watch your car oh and your
light get smarter too you can control it
with the Cunha app turn it on turn it
off set a schedule or just let it turn
on automatically when it gets dark or
when there's a person you only want to
get alerts that matter Cunha ignores
trees and small animals and it
recognizes people's behaviors so if you
don't want to know every time your
spouse goes out jogging
you can tell Kona to hurt you only for
visitors waiting at the door
and it'll learn and get smarter over
time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones or the
delivery guy Kona will always let you
know and it is someone bad now you can
do something about it kuna stop
break-ins before they happen

slip joint deployment mechanism with a
2.2 inch cutting blade that's always
there for everyday cutting tasks all
keyport modules have the same metal base
plate to mount your module to the
keyboard slide 3.0 and the keyboard
pivot to install the module on your keep
our slide 3.0 remove one of the side
plates align the metal feet on your
module with the cavities on the side of
your slide always maintain pressure in
the middle of your module as you slide
it forward replace the end cap and
you're all set to install the module on

the module with the front of the pivot
insert the metal feet on the module into
the cavities in the chassis of your
pivot always maintain pressure in the

pointed tool such as a small screw
driver pin or allen wrench to release
the module you will be depressing the
middle snap tab with the tool and
sliding the module towards the back of
the pivot at the same time rotate your
keys to expose the middle snap tab and
you will see the small dimple hold your

the pocket night module exactly the same
way you would add a module to the pivot
to remove the module you will need to
use a common thumbtack and a non-slip
surface such as this rubber coaster push
the module forward and insert the
thumbtack into the cavity at a slight
angle as shown as you depress the lower
snap tab with attack the module will
release thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
