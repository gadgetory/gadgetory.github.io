so pure it's liberating everything in
between the lines is striking I'm free
but lonely
and that's when I come back to your
voice it's almost like a rush when I
hear it
the connection is so clear and after
this kind of scary how you can be so
close it's so far away I regain control
thank you I feel alive and full of
passion the sensations so bittersweet
would it be crazy to call it magic
because it's like I'm there there with
you that's when I realize I'm never
actually alone
we have many goals in life from managing
stress to increasing fitness we want to
be healthier and perform better we work
hard and track progress because we know
that we can best improve that which we
measure but in order to make real
progress on all of these goals we need
to more deeply understand the true state
of our body and mind hi I'm Jason Moore
health coach and founder of the
top-rated elite HR via and I'm excited
to introduce the courses the course
sense measures heart rate variability
also called HR v HR v is a deeper and
more comprehensive biomarker than
something like steps or heart rate it's
kind of like the check engine light for
your entire body in mind heart rate
variability examines the tiny
imperceptible changes and patterns
between heartbeats our advanced
algorithms analyze these precise times
between heartbeats and detects activity
from the nervous system which actually
controls processes like energy
regulation digestion mood and the
response to stress
the core scent slips directly onto a
finger and connects via bluetooth with
any heart rate variability app so you
can capture an HIV measurement and as
little as 2 pi 8 minutes each day that
could be first thing in the morning
while waiting for your morning coffee or
even for live biofeedback during
much-needed meditation
with this simple daily check in the
elite HIV app guides you in optimizing
your nutrition training recovery sleep
stress and more heart rate variability
plays a key role in tracking the
progress of my patients today they come
into my facility to get their HIV
readings but because core sense is so
easy to use my patients can now track
their HIV at home this will help me to
regularly check their progress adjust
the treatment plan and speed up their
journey to better health and well-being
with core sense and HIV our mission has
been to help people tackle their goals
whatever they may be and improve their
lives but without the discomfort and
inconvenience of chest straps and
adhesives over the years we heard from
so many of our hundred thousand-plus app
users that's why we partnered with
experts and innovators and sensor
technology to come up with the core
sense from the ground up it has a
rechargeable battery that can go up to
six months on a single charge it has a
flexible design that will comfortably
fit fingers of all sizes and shapes the
core sense doesn't come with any buttons
it is intelligent and will automatically
power on when you insert your finger
then it'll detect your pulse and connect
to the HIV app accuracy and sensitivity
are really important to us you really
need accuracy in order to measure valid
and useful HIV that's why we designed
the Corson's with medical grade sensors
that are comparable to a five lead ECG
it has built in an advanced signal
algorithm to help detect arrhythmia the
topic heartbeats and even false beats
attributed to signal noise you take a
two minute HIV reading in the morning
and instantly see your results which we
call our morning readiness gauge the
gauge gives you a green yellow or red
indicator of how able you are to handle
stress on any given day you can also tag
your reading with things like alcohol
consumption your mood exercise or sleep
to gain a deeper understanding of those
items that most impact you as you make
changes in your lifestyle or in your
exercise plan after years of research
development prototyping and rigorous
testing we're ready to bring Corson's to
you the Kickstarter community we simply
need the initial capital to complete
tooling and start full-scale
manufacturing support our Kickstarter to
receive your own Corps
since and in just two minutes a day
start making vastly better decisions for
your health performance stress and
resilience Thank You Kickstarter how
many secrets do you carry around every
day your wallet your phone and some
little secret oh no not that
this secret besides the ones that need
to be put in the safe you must have some
secrets you write down that require
proper perception introducing lock book
the world's first writing notebook with
a biometric fingerprint sensor lock hook
comes with a 0.40 inch by 0.55 inch
fingerprint sensor with 5:08 dpi
resolution the biometric fingerprint
sensor allows Lockwood to recognize your
fingerprint and unlock within one second
when it is locked no one can even try to
take a peek you can bring it wherever
you want to your office conference room
clients office or anywhere else
for an innovative notebook the product
design is also top-notch to provide you
with a better writing experience we
chose the top quality paper for the
pages inside possibly the best in the
world for long term convenience we use
the binder design and provide you with
different accessories like refill paper
a hole puncher
pocket folders sticky notes etc tea is
creative as you want to design your own
notebook
now we need your help to deliver LOC
book to you
please help us Sarlacc look into reality
so you can put as many secrets as you
want in your notebook
home automation is awesome but current
smartphone products are both very
expensive and difficult to set up that's
why we created hook is a platform that
connects any radiofrequency enabled
device in your home to the Internet
with these $5 RF outlets you can already
add remote control to any device in your
home but they only work within range of
the remote and with basic functionality
connecting a new device is incredibly
simple just sync your devices remote
with the hook app now I can control that
device from anywhere in the world
hook is compatible with IFTTT which can
be used to schedule operations of
routine tasks like turning on your
holiday lights at sunset
or turning your entire room into an
alarm clock folks capabilities are
limited only by your imagination you can
create rules that flash your lights when
your bus is nearby
notify you if it appliances $5
or turn off your router if your daughter
is watching too much Netflix wait wait
wait come back luck is powered by spark
IO and will be provided with an open API
so anyone can develop for hook and help
expand its capabilities and the best
part you only need one hook for your
entire home regardless of how many
devices you are connecting so we've been
working for over a year now trying to
develop this technology and then get it
into a packaged device that the users
gonna like and that we like ourselves so
we started off with a big board big set
of electronics we added Wi-Fi
compatibility we added a USB hub so we
could power it through USB and then we
started adding things like radio chips
that we had to make sure didn't
interfere with each other and then the
trick is trying to get that thing
smaller get it more compact and get it
into the right packaging so we made
multiple 3d printed designs each time we
print something fit the electronics into
it put it on a board look at it and
figure out no wait we can pop these
chips off we can moving this way we can
read a pit we can solder it's smaller we
can get this thing more compact and then
the end we we really came down to a
product but it feels nice looks good
and prototype that we're really proud to
ship hey Kickstarter were the team
behind hook we have been looking fairly
hot for a little year to make hook and
reality we've got a great product and
we're very excited to bring it to market
but we need your help with your funding
we can get our molds in our
manufacturing process dialed in and get
hook to production so if they're as
excited as via back us share us and tell
your friends about hook so join us in
our journey to bring affordable home
automation to everyone
