start
Rango was probably the coolest cat on
the face of the planet used to ride up
to work with me on my motorcycle he used
to go to cafes to get out it was pretty
cool relationship and eventually I came
across a note stuck to a tree saying
that they had found this really
beautiful tabby cat dead on the side of
the road I decided if nobody else had
found a way of tracking cats and dogs
then I was certainly going to so this is
pod line it's the smallest and lightest
GPS tracker in market has an
interchangeable battery it's waterproof
it has bluetooth but the most important
thing is that this device can be
attached to your animal collar and sync
to your phone allowing you to always
know where your animal is you never have
to worry about losing your phone again
we've spent a lot of time getting the
product is on absolutely bang-on the
ergonomic design is really cool with no
sharp edges so it's as comfortable as
possible for the animal the app is a
really sleek user experience so it's
both fun and functional to you and we've
squeezed as much as we can out of the
battery life getting up to a week's
YouTube I don't know you be inconsolable
if you lost the dogs not knowing where
they are or what they're doing or if
they're live or well he's that type that
tends to just wander and then we rely on
other people to bring him back but we're
always worried that they'll be at home
when we lose them forever
they're one of the most amazing features
that we've developed is a pet League
which is like a social network for your
animal this is going to allow you to
compare your animals results across the
world so you'll be able to determine
whether you've got the fastest dog in
the park
or the most adventurous cat in the
country the app also allows you to set
safe zone alerts so you can actually see
when your animal breaches the set
perimeter through an alert on your phone
you know here's it he disappears he goes
on adventures it's cool like that just
to be able to see what he's done tell us
how far each child ran and then we can
compare them see the console Maggie's
fast life's far from a perfect day we're
really excited because we have confirmed
orders from some of the largest pet
retailers in the world we've finalized
the design and we're just about to go
into the final stages of production we
really need some help in production and
that's why we'd like you to support us
in this campaign and make sure that
nobody ever has to go through the pain
of losing the animal again like I did
creating a mess can make up some of the
best parts of everyday life with robotic
flora care all it takes is the press of
a button to keep up with the daily
accumulation of dirt dust and stink
mopping robots tackle stains in wet and
damp mode or dust and hair and dry
sleeping mode sensors map out the room
enabling them to navigate under and
around furniture and clean and
hard-to-reach places when it comes to
areas with carpeting and rug robotic
vacuums can navigate from hard floors to
carpeted areas to pick up dirt debris
and hair under and around your furniture
machines with tangle-free extractors are
great for homes with pet Wi-Fi enabled
devices can be set remotely so that you
can rest assured wherever you go you can
return home to clean for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
