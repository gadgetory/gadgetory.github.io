cuts and with the Craig ank you cut
making those perfect cuts is easier than
you ever imagined with the Accu cut you
eliminate the hassles inaccuracies and
inconsistencies of needing to mark a
long cut line and then trying to
freehand the saw along it just make a
couple of marks and then align the edge
of the AK you precision guide
track with the marks whether you're
making a cross cuts rip cuts or angled
cuts the yank you cut transforms your
ordinary circular saw into a
high-performance track guided cutting
system that you can use to make straight
accurate splinter free cuts in plywood
MDF and other large sheets quickly
accurately and effortlessly and because
the enqueue cut is portable you can make
these high quality worry-free cuts
anywhere by taking your saw to the
material instead of having to bring your
material to the saw in most applications
you don't even need to clamp the track
down
thanks to anti slip strips that hold the
track in place exactly where you place
it that track guides the Accu cuts
Universal sled it accepts most any
circular saw whether the blade is on the
left or the right and mounting your saw
is quick and easy the universal sled can
also be used on the Craig RIP cut with
your saw mounted to the sled and the
precision guide track in place on your
plywood cutting with the Accu cut is
simple all you have to do is guide the
sled along the track grooves in the sled
ensure that the saw tracks perfectly
straight plus the sled positions the saw
blade so it hugs tight to the edge of
the guide track that way your cut is
perfectly aligned with the edge of the
sled the strips that hold the track in
place also provide an anti chip edge
that hugs tight to your saw blade that
strips minimize rough chipped out edges
by holding the fragile face layer in
place to prevent your saw blade from
lifting and tearing the surface as you
cut to make cutting even easier the Accu
cut is also equipped with a convenient
starting block it positions and aligns
your saw so you can start your cuts
confidently with these great features
the Anki cut makes cutting plywood and
large panels easy
predictable whether you're cross-cutting
Sheets making rip cuts up to 48 inches
long or you're cutting across the sheet
at an angle all you have to do is set
your saw on the track and make a
straight accurate splinter free cut

time spent on decks should be a time of
peace and relaxation not time spent

boards split ends and nails or screws

constructed with nails or screws driven
through the face of the board cause not

brand new angle on an old approach to
building decks utilizing tools and basic
skills that you already have this

core of the Kreg deck jig system is its
solid metal drill guides which allow you
to drill holes and drive screws at the
precise angle and perfect depth time
after time the angle of the guides not
only hide the screws on the edge of the
board but are optimal for maximum
holding power while the screw depth is
precisely controlled which eliminates
overdriving and blowing out the board or
under driving leaving exposed fasteners
and loose boards this process is made
fast and worryfree by the included depth
collars on both the driver bit and drill
bit that are set using the gauges molded
right on the jig once set just drill the
hole load the screw and drive it home
the Kreg deck jig is equipped with three
drill guides a center guide and two
angle guides using the center guide in
the center of the joist allows for the
most holding power while the angle
guides provide you flexibility by going
where the center guide cannot suggest
spliced or obstructed ends the fasteners
themselves are specifically designed for
use with the Craig deck jig featuring a
deep
KTX square drive that gives you solid
driver engagement which means no cam
outs self-tapping tip for fast easy
driving and they are built from case
hardened steel to eliminate bending or
breaking these screws can also be used
as face screws for a variety of outdoor
projects available in pro tect code and
stainless steel finishes choose which
one is right for your application

there the kit comes with sample screws
an instructional DVD and spacer rings
these 1/4 inch and 5/16 inch spacer
rings allow you to maintain consistent
spacing on your deck boards which not
only gives your deck a better overall
appearance but more importantly allows
for proper air movement which reduces
moisture buildup making for a
longer-lasting deck the system is light
built for rugged use and comes with a
lifetime guarantee rubber feet on the
bottom of the jig prevents slipping
while drilling and driving and the
oversized handle provides a comfort grip
keeping your hands away from the action

variety of easy to buy materials you are
already familiar with composites and
exotic hardwoods between 3/4 inch and 5
quarter inch can all be adding charm to
your deck
whether you are building a deck from
scratch are giving your existing deck a
facelift there has never been an easier
more economical way to have the
beautiful long lasting deck you've
