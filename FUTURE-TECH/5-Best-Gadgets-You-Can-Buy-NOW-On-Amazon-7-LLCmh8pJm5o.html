super strong waterproof tape Becket
instantly batch bond sealing repair flex
tape is no ordinary tape
it's triple thick adhesive virtually
welds itself to the surface
instantly solving the toughest League
Lee key pipes can cause major damage but
flex tape grips on tight and bonds
instantly Plus flex tapes powerful
adhesive is so strong it even works
underwater
now you can repair leaks and pools and
spas without draining them flex tape is
perfect for marine campers and RVs flex
tape is super strong and once it's on it
holds on tight and for emergency auto
repair flex pay keep this grip even in
the toughest conditions big storms can
cause big damage but flex pay comes
super wide so you can easily patch large
holes to show you the power of flex pay
I saw this boat in half and repaired it
with only flex tape not only the Flex
pays powerful ease of hold the boat
together but it creates a super strong
watertight seal though the inside is
completely dry yeah just cut
peel stick and sealed imagine everything
you can do with the power of flex tape
hey I'm Nate bar creator of the pocket
money here today to tell you about my
latest creation wild card the pocket
knife needs to evolve it's an essential
tool but it's bulky one more thing to
remember in the morning and it usually
falls out of your pocket and is lost
I wanted something better I asked why
not put a pocket knife in my wallet it'd
be easier to carry and harder
so I set out to design a knife to be as
thin as possible and the result is wild
card it's only two millimeters thick
only slightly thicker than a credit card
I was able to do this by reimagining the
blade to this most knives have a pin
pressed through a whole wild card has a
pivot unlike anything in the world
I call it fly off technology the three
wings of the pivot allow the knife blade
to remain rigid to the body a necessity
when wielding a sharp tool for safety
I designed the blade to lock open and to
lock close the blade tucks neatly under
two blade Barb's and it angles only on
one side so users can't accidentally cut
themselves and carrying the clothes
knife and here's the best part about
this design the blade is detachable I
designed this with the forgetful
traveler in mind when you go through TSA
with your traditional knife on you you
lose your knife but with wild card you
only lose your blade and on our website
you can replace it for only a few
dollars with pocket monkey
I used a monkey to represent the
personality of the tool with wild card I
kept that trend going wild card as a
wolf cut out that doubles as a bottle of
the wolf embodies the nature of the tool
agile yet powerful I wanted to pack as
much functionality as possible into wild
card
many people misuse knives in place of
other teams like screwdrivers and pry
bars
harming themselves or breaking midnight
so I added these tools to the night I
always wanted to challenge convention
because of that I spent the last six
months trying to reinvent how this
product is manufactured every
manufacturer I talked to it was hesitant
to produce such an aggressive design the
solution I kept hearing was take this to
China but that isn't something I'm
willing to do I want to create products
that embody the American spirit of
innovation and my solution was to create
a manufacturing facility in Maine
now we control every aspect of
production from laser cutting to
packaging and shipping so we can
manufacture the highest-quality product
while creating jobs in our community
help us make wild card a reality and
help us continue the American spirit of
innovation
measuring tapes helpless measure
distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation why
isn't there a single tool that lets us
measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and at work bagel has
three different modes string mode wheel
mode and remote my string mode is great
for measuring straight lines curves and
around corners wheel mode lets you
measure irregular or odd shaped objects
and it also makes taking measurements
with one hand much easier remote mode
lets you measure objects that are far
away and out of your reach after you're
done measuring you'll need a way to
record your measurements using pen and
paper can be a real hassle with bagel
you can quickly and easily save your
measurements with voice descriptions
just take your measurement push the Save
button and then tag a voice memo to it
dogs the future later when you're done
bagel will send your measurements to
bagels mobile app via Bluetooth this
mobile application lets you review your
saved measurement and share them with
your friends bagel is precise it uses
our patented technology to make sure you
always get an accurate measurement also
bagel has an easy to read digital
display that's viewable in most lighting
conditions in the past few years also
measuring devices have become smarter
and made our life easier smart scale
smart thermometers and even smart
watches but when it comes to measuring
size we still use a tape measure which
is more than a century old why don't you
know Veit the way we measure size so we
created bagel a smartie measure
we put a lot of effort into creating
basil our team works night and day
to make the best quality product with
the standard design we have our final
prototype that is ready for mass
production now we need your help to
deliver this amazing product to everyone
please help us bring this bagel to life
thank you

EDC is a beautifully designed series of
ultraportable writing instruments
designed to always be with you and ready
when inspiration strikes these go
everywhere pens are designed to be super
compact and fit on your keychain without
even noticing EDC is the acronym for
everyday carry and is a popular topic of
discussion regarding the need to always
be prepared a pen is one of the most
useful items to have with you at all
time
EDC makes this easy with its simple
rugged compact go everywhere design from
filling out forms to jotting down items
on your to-do list
EDC ink allows you to always be ready
even without thinking about it like a
meticulously crafted watch or handmade
pocket knife these precision machine
writing implements or a joy to use and
handle as a designer it's my job to come
up with new ideas and being ready to
write them down or sketch a fleeting
idea is crucially important this need
led me on a search for a pen that would
always be with me and not a bother to
remember or too big to carry nothing I
found really suited my needs so I
decided to create my own perfect go
everywhere pen the EDC ink pens are
designed around the standard d1 refill
this compact refill is available just
about everywhere I will be supplying
these pens with my favorite refill to
sketch with the popular and amazing
pilot hi-tec-c
it is ultra precise smooth and dries
fast which is perfect for us lefties the
refill is also very easy to replace
without the need for any special tools
EDC comes in two sizes the smallest pen
and the one I carry is the x1 at only
three and a quarter inches long it
virtually disappears on your keyring
while the x1 is a bit small for a
lengthy writing or sketching session
it's perfect for capturing an idea or
filling out a form
x2 is slightly longer at almost four
inches and would be better for people
with large hands that plan to do more
writing or don't mind carrying a
slightly longer pen after creating these
pens for myself I began to receive
interest from several people that saw
them and wanted to know how they could
get one it takes me about five hours to
make one of these pins so I decided to
design them for mass production and try
to make them available to everyone that
might be interested producing them and
larger numbers will dramatically reduce
the overall cost and allow volume
discounts on all materials as well as
the entry code so that's why I'm here
I'm hoping there are a lot of people out
there that love these pens as much as I
do and are excited about this project I
really won't be able to do it without
you thanks a lot for watching
