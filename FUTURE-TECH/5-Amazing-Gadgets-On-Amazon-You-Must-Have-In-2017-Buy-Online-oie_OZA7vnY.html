it's a whole new type of drone we merged
power and smart features making it easy
for everyone to fly and create beautiful
images the toughest challenge for us was
to find the sweet spot between form and
function when engineering the folding
arms we wanted to save as much space as
possible
we really wanted to make it quick to
unfold and leave enough room for the
powerful processors and system system
this took several attempts and many many
prototypes
in one of our earlier prototypes the
arms took up way too much space when
folded almost two-thirds of the entire
volume combined with the space that we
needed for the internals this meant the
Maverick was much larger than we wanted
and another attempt Yama's only took up
half the volume but there's a lot of
wasted space in between body and arm
eventually we felt this problem and
created an easy click to unfold
mechanism seemed from above the thin
onset flush against the body when folded
we card outs to index at the rear of the
airframe to fit the motors saving
additional space the rear arms fold out
in a three-dimensional motion it's not
in a place in one sweep with this design
you can have your magic Pro unfolded in
under five seconds powerful components
generate a lot of heat especially when
it placed close together so for the
first time ever on a DJI drone we
integrated a heat sink at the base made
from the museum aluminum a line and a
centrifugal fan behind the gimbal
the fan pulls in air from the front of
the aircraft and channels it across the
heatsink dissipating heat we wouldn't go
through all this trouble without making
sure you have a great camera we spent
thousands of hours trying to region air
and shrink the stabilization technology
found in our phantom series one of the
major challenges we ran into when making
a stabilized camera this small with a
stiffness of the electrical wires the
mechanics the structure and the
brushless motors had to be specifically
engineered to take this into account
plus it's the first DJI camera that's
able to rotate 90 degrees for portrait
shots we also wanted a remote controller
for thematic pro that would feel natural
and familiar in people's hands so they
would be more confident when they climb
that's how we came up with a small
controller that expands with a pair of
grips these grips also have your phone
keeping all of your controls in easy
reach the Mavic pro concentrates some of
our most advanced technologies into one
compact body it's an incredible tool to
turn everyday moments into fantastic art
wherever you go this is air bar a bar
brings touch to your new or existing PC
by projecting an invisible light field
over the screen and what's good about
light is that it responds to pretty much
anything so you can swipe with your
gloves or long fingernails pinch with
your chopsticks scroll while you're
cooking or why not use a paintbrush you
get the idea
with air bar you get touch gestures when
you need them it's easy to attach it's
sleek it won't drain your battery and
you can unplug it when you want to best
of all there's no manual no installation
it's plug and touch it just works air
bar plug and touch when you need it
introducing lab champ it turns any
standard lamp into a USB charging
station watch lamp champ simply screws
into any lamp socket and gives you a USB
charging port right on the lamp lamp
champ is safe for all devices it powers
and charges phones tablets anything that
charges with USB and the built-in switch
lets you charge whether the light is on
or off or on look but lab champ would
support right where you need it so you
can charge and talk lamp champ works at
home at the office in the hotel lamp
champ edits micro technology turns any
lamp into a convenient USB charging
station and it's so easy and installs in
seconds first lamp champ then the bulb
screw into the built-in socket no more
furniture move no more hunting for
adapters chat makes it fast and easy to
charge and still use your device in any
room in your home and in the morning its
charged and ready to go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
