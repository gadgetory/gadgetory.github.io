is it where you live
is it how you spend your day
is it the time you spend with your
family
with your friends
we invest in technology with the hopes
of improving our lives but so often it
doesn't feel like a part of us
we think technology should feel more
like an extension of you connecting you
to more than you've ever thought
possible Remo is changing the
relationship between people and
technology by using gestures you already
know see if more time
for what's important
because when things work seamlessly
it makes life easier
Remo helps you focus on what you're
doing
while taking care of all the simple
details
so you never miss a moment
it gives you time to be you while
effortlessly keeping you connected
to the services that you depend on
and lets you choose how you share your
moments
because at the end of the day
no matter where you go or how you use
Remo it's there to help you get more out
of life
for work for health for home for you for
life Remo
twelve months one week two days and four
hours ago we launched the revolutionary
device pyro we've condensed it into a
smaller more compact version and along
the way we've added crazy features I'm
happy to introduce you to pyro me one of
the big advantages of pyro mini is
actually the size right with this half
the size of the original pyro the
possibilities of this thing are
literally endless you can put it under a
spread of cards from the fire from that
hide it inside a card box hide it behind
your iPhone behind objects in your house
it's so small you can take a credit card
out of your wallet and hide it
underneath your credit card so we've
been jamming out with this thing all
week the TV and the things we've been
coming up with are inspiring to say the
least
USB charging no more batters you don't
have to go to the store and buy triple
A's rip open the packaging none of that
you plug it into your laptop plug it
into your car charge it on the way to a
gig if you want when I charge this thing
I personally get upwards of six hundred
shots before I have to recharge it
detachable wrist strap you now have the
ability to lock in an unlock pyro from
your wrist without having to remove the
strap you're at your gig you've launched
the fireballs you want to get rid of it
for the time being it's never been
faster or easier to remove pyro throw it
in your case carry on with your game
dramatically increase signal range we've
added an antenna that actually plugs
into the remote which gives you upwards
of 30 feet of range you can be in your
bedroom around a corner and fire it off
in the living room burst fire it allows
you to shoot two fireballs the push of
one button at the very same time the
perfect dramatic punctuation for your
favorite routine more fire more impact
everything we've wanted as team
illusionist built into a new phenomenal
device pyro mini
for the last year our team at Hale has
been developing a new technology that
once only existed in science fiction
today we invited our friends to
experience the magic behind you think
hey you for the first night
alright well let's talk about what we're
doing here today what if I told you guys
that you could control your home and
bring to life the space around you with
no screens no physical remotes and no
yelling across the room just this
Oh meet pea it transforms the space and
objects around you into a set of magical
remote controls with just a simple
movement of your hand
hey-ohh allows you to control lights
music television temperature and much
more set up is quite simple place heyo
in the space of your choice connected to
your Wi-Fi and the Hayao will
automatically 3d scan your space once
scanning is complete
using hyo's augmented reality app you
can create a virtual button on an object
or even in thin air to control any of
your favorite devices and that's it
wherever you live heyyo connects the
space around you with you whenever you
want for whatever you need
how would you feel about some music
right now
seeing people discover somatic being
here is an incredible feeling but this
is just a beginning we are integrating
new features another time
Haley will grow smart we need your help
to go through the manufacturing process
we want to improve here and we want to
bring it to your home please join us
Thanks and we're thrilled to finally
introduce to you puzzlebox orbit the
flying sphere you control with your
brainwaves
box orbit a helicopter the pyramid a
remote control system and an EEG headset
power up the controller slip on the
headset and start concentrate
your focus will make the orbit launch
from pyramid and start hovering in the
air as your attention fades the orbit
will end as soon as you're connected the
pyramid will display your concentration
and mental relaxation levels and red and
blue lights so that you can use
puzzlebox orbit and pyramid to measure
your focus which was recently filmed by
the wayside my ro has included the
design of part of experiment a universal
remote control for the orbit helicopter
the pyramid includes a microcontroller
which processes spring with data from
the headset and sends flight commands to
the orbit the pyramid features 12
high-power infrared emitters which
covers 360 degrees every corner in your
room so the onboard software can be
extended to operate additional toys and
devices such as cars and television
screens during the design of the pyramid
we use high resolution 3d printer from
type-a machines who quickly realize and
modify our design puzzlebox orbit as a
toy as well as your introduction to
neuroscience our software has already
been used in classrooms across the
country to help students do things like
control Lego Mindstorms robots and
practice with focus and concentration
exercises
puzzlebox has been producing custom
modified helicopters for brain control
for over two years we have published
step-by-step how-to guides complete with
videos and parts lists we've received
coverage from various media outlets
including Nova ScienceNOW Discovery
Science NBC ABC and Wired magazine we
have even established a new Guinness
World Record along the way using brain
computer interface and a 62 ton crane to
move a Volkswagen across a warehouse in
England with puzzlebox orbit we have
finally reached the stage where our
technology can be made available to the
public
people have toyed with similar ideas
before but nobody stepped up with a
finish this is a hard one to get right
but we're the right ones to do it no one
is more experienced than puzzlebox when
it comes to brain control helicopters
we've already finished our first
prototype and we're seeking you are
supporting to reach mass production and
keep bringing exciting discoveries in
neuroscience to you as freely as
possible pixee the ultimate finder finds
everyday things with unprecedented
accuracy right now she needs her keys
let's find them
start walking holding the phone in front
of you at a 45 degree angle that's it
follow the walking instructions on the
screen just walk in an L shape and make
turns when instructed aha
Dixie found that stop sign means stop
she can see where those keys are hiding
using pixies augmented reality rotate
and raise the phone to eye level and
voila
pixie reveals even through walls down to
inches so turn the phone back to
portrait mode and walk toward that arrow
now that's the precise distance
indicator it means she's within arm's
reach of the keys it's like your own
custom metal detector she would have
been so late for our date thanks pixie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
