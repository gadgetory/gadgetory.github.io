here today we're doing a review in
partnership with the part-time audio
file over there at wwp art time audio
file dot-com we have the new heed can
alot headphone and DAC combination here
the heed is typically known for their
can amp which came out a few years ago
and has been known to be very friendly
with the AKG 701 this one has some new
revisions to it as you can see here it's
obviously got a separate power supply
called the cue PSU located on the left
it's a separate power supply everything
comes over through the cord in the back
to the amplifier located on the right
this one also includes digital coaxial
input you can see it's selectable here
it's analog to digital this unit also
includes an additional headphone input
so you can see here that has two total
now the knob is a very good I like it a
lot it's got a good finish the overall
build of the unit it's pretty good I
like it it's solid the power supply is
much heavier than the amplifier as you
might expect and you can also see the
ribbing the slots here on the side allow
for heat to dissipate out of the unit
it's gets a little warm to the touch
it's a Class A amplifier so it does get
a little bit warm but the heatsink
definitely helps you know kind of
alleviate a little bit of that as you
can see from the back here there is a
obviously your analog inputs as well as
analog outputs you can see the optional
DAC card that's available input for the
digital coaxial here on the side as far
as overall sound is concerned
really I really did like this one it's
got a lot of punch it's got a great
sense of tone and overall subtlety
that's very nuanced it's very good
there's a good punch to it it's got
plenty of power to drive really good
headphones for almost every headphone I
attempted to drive this with great
results I never really got up beyond 75%
even with lower quieter recordings which
is definitely a good sign the overall
cost for the unit is actually $1,200 for
the amplifier alone the DAC card is
another $400 on top of that bringing the
total for the review that you see here
at 16 so it's $1,600 so it's a little
bit on the higher end of things for that
though you do get quite a bit of punch
you do get a like a pretty solid
dedicated headphone amplifier it's not
drying it by any means got a lot energy
it's pretty exciting as far as the $400
DAC card
I found the performance to be pretty
good for $400 it's not the best I'd ever
had I have Dax here that cost more and
perform more but for around 400 it's it
does the job it definitely gets the job
done the other side of that is there is
no USB input on this unit which is kind
of a drawback so you know unless you
already have an external DAC that you
really love or a great source that you
like to coaxial out to you might want to
look into USB connectivity for $400 you
know you could probably swing yourself a
pretty good deck with full interface so
you can just run the analog outs to this
hamp amplifier and you may be able to
see from this shot that actual sides of
this is a little bit smaller each unit
is roughly the size of like a two-pound
Velveeta loaf box so it's not a massive
size it actually both will fit kind of
well on any type of desk or AV unit that
kind of thing it doesn't take up a lot
of space it's a little bit bigger than
some
new compact combo DAC units out there
overall not the largest unit I've ever
had on the testing bench by any means so
all in all a good all-around kind of
more top-tier amp with great fun energy
it's very exciting kind of sounding amp
when you really get down to it you know
a separate headphone amplifier you know
is kind of the way to go when you're
looking at separates for personal audio
applications you can really get
individual DAX that you like it the
sound signature you want right invest
your money in particular products along
the chain where you know you can kind of
cater it to your tastes and your needs
and you can do each piece of the chain
one at a time that way so there's a lot
more versatility involved when you do a
separate headphone amplifier as opposed
to doing one that's combined and all in
one unit or even a headphone out from
one of your your components so that's
the this one is the he'd canna lots with
the optional DAC card in it this video
is brought to you in partnership with
the part-time audio file so feel free to
check out the full review on his site
