here this time a review of the DT 240
Pro by Bayer dynamic this is a $99
headphone which is pretty exciting why
you might ask
nine nine bucks doesn't come around very
often Bayer dynamic definitely makes
headphones that are more expensive than
ninety nine dollars in their dt proline
goes all the way up and down
t 1 at the top wonderful but this this
headphone is made for more of the
production side of things so for you
anybody out there with a podcast or a
gaming streamer these headphones do very
well in the sense that they are made for
more of a production style budget
oriented individual so what are these
guys all about really their clothes back
design as you can see so they seal
outside sound away and they also reduce
the interior sound so you can hear
things more clear and they don't bleed
going the other way so people outside
don't hear yourself so yes you could
listen to these on a subway or even you
know on a walk maybe but they're a
little bit big they're you know I
personally prefer im's or in-ear
monitors for that kind of thing or even
earbuds but for 99 bucks there's a
couple of cool features on this I want
to start with the way this connects to
the end here you can see that both of
these sides actually have compatibility
to attach to this detachable cable you
can go in either side here this one or
this one and it'll work with both ear
cups so you don't need two cords and you
don't need a lot anything more really
than what this provides you stick it in
and it plays music through both sides
through either side of the headphone
which i think is a really cool feature
not seeing everything on any head every
headphone it has a more production style
cable which stretches it gives you a
little more length also they
is a it comes with a pouch for 99 bucks
you don't get a heavy case but I didn't
really expect that either a pouch is
nice it's better than nothing and it's
not too shabby I mean the material is a
little bit fun and it works and it fits
your stuff and you throw in the back
which is important because we look at
these headphones there are plastic
elements to this this piece is plastic
this is the band the main band is metal
hearing but this is plastic and this is
a nice faux leather single band
suspension system across here but I
don't mind this as much this plastic
seems pretty robust and this turning
mechanism is good you'll notice both up
and down and left and right but even
more important than that they go flat
which is helpful for storage or just if
I mean sometimes when they're locked in
like this just because we're precarious
when we get set down someone steps on
them crushes and whatever it's not as
much of an issue with these in terms of
the sound we're looking at a pretty even
retrieval I would say that there is a
teeny and I expand I expressly say small
amount of a bass bump on the low end of
things small it's not like a bass head
headphone by any means but it's it's
pretty good I'd say it's very level mids
and trouble but if you follow like a
bass guitar as it goes up to scale it
goes a little bit higher than some of
the headphone other headphones I have on
hand so the mids are good the highs are
great they kind of have it has a nice
feel a nice vibe a nice energy and most
importantly it it drops you with pretty
good resolution I think these guys have
great resolution for a hundred dollars
it shows how far we've come at this
price point and just a very short period
of time so great resolution for $99
great sound if I did have any cons for
these headphones I would say starting
out they
have a quite a hefty caliper pressure
clamping pressure that comes in like
this to keep them on your head so if
you're doing a production style event
they would stay on your head very well
so that part's interesting the from my
experience though a lot of headphones do
stretch out after you use them for a
while so they won't be as heavy but if
you're sensitive to caliper pressure
then they might start out a little bit
heavy for you and you'll just want to
kind of put them on a basketball or
something to stretch them out but that
also gives them a really good seal and
like I said keeps them from falling off
your head these have been the dt 240 pro
