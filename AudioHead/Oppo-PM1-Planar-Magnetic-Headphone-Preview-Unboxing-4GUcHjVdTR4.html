doing one of our preview slash unboxing
videos we don't do this for every
product that comes in however there this
is a new planar magnetic headphone from
a company by the name of Oppo that I
think he's pretty spectacular pretty
special so far I'm still putting it
through all the tests and giving it a
critical listening so there won't be any
sonic observations on this so if you're
not if you're just coming here for sonic
observations go ahead and pause this one
we will be up and running with
observations in a couple of weeks no
problem there I just got throw it
through the rest of the paces
this however is gonna talk about what
the package is like that arrives and
also just some kind of initial
preliminary observations one of the
reasons I'm really interested in this
headphone is from an unboxing
perspective is the price point is a 1099
so it's $1,100 if you add a penny or at
a dollar to it compared to the other
products in this price range that
actually kind of lands near the lower
end so we have a new planar magnetic
headphone from a company that is known
for mostly their blu-ray players in the
audio file and video file realm but
they're darn good so I have previously
reviewed it's one of our top videos in
fact the Apple 105 and that is quite a
player that's the thing with a Poe is
that they really kind of bring in a
value they don't they don't kind of push
the price point of their products to the
very peak they land it right in the
middle I think a lot of good stuff and
this is another example that so we have
something that's roughly lands in the
middle to the low end of this type of
technology aside from obviously the
fostex t-50 RP which is um you know
heavily modded and those use planter
magnetic technology as well but this
specific headphone is not I wouldn't say
in the same
for one it is an open back design but
we'll get into that a little bit sooner
right now I just kind of want to go
through the packaging and what comes
with this headphone when you buy it
because this company does such a
spectacular job with their packaging
it's a step above I think what most
people can afford to do or care to do so
obviously once you open the package you
can see here there is a case that is
kind of a blue jean black blue jean
material very nice and then we have the
main box here on the right I'm just
going to open this up right here and
give you another shot so we'll come back
to the carrying case in just a minute
but I did want to show you the box here
once you take off the lid you're looking
at some literature here and this
actually very interestingly just folds
down like that one of the sides comes
down and we are left with there's a
there's a felt material on the side and
a very very nice heavy box would you see
that it has kind of a high lacquer
finish at a physical button here that
you can press in opens up again there's
a fabric a suede fabric material
covering a lot of the box on the
interior just well put together a little
thing more than I would ever expect from
a pair of headphones I guess and then
the headphone is right he's located
right here inside I'll give you some
close-up shots of that later and then
here in this box there is this I think
it's very well put together sheathed
cord goes to these
the like these smaller headphone jack
but mono of course into the back of this
headphone kind of a cable so it is
replaceable it's not the standard
balanced XLR mini jack to found on some
of the other headphones however it does
the job very well and the cable does is
replaceable it does come with an
additional option to purchase a balanced
cable with the four pins like kind of
your nice standard headphone connection
that plugs in very nicely with the
complimentary h.a - one headphone amp
the company came out with just a couple
of days ago so the box is excellent I
mean it's like it has like designed to
it it rolls out in a way there's a
physical switch I mean it's something
that you feel like $1100 should be
wrapped up in you know you could be a
thousand dollar bill in there boom the
box you know so in addition to that it
does come with like I said before a case
where inside this case you will see that
it comes with some alternate headband
head pads that have less of a leather
feel to them like these ones have here
and more of like a micro microfiber
micro suede kind of feel to them so you
have an option of what type of fabric
you want on your headphones pretty sweet
stuff and additionally this cable which
runs it stereo into a smaller headphone
jack like your iPhone iPad your Galaxy
s7 any case all accessories lots of good
stuff lots of
a variety and a great little headphone
so the first thing about this headphone
and I'm sure I'll revisit this in the
full review is the wait for a planar
magnetic it's pretty darn good for a
full sized over the head now it's not
the lightest headphone there ever was
made there's an it's not the heaviest
either though it's it's really kind of a
comfortable where I can tell you that
much you can see again leather pads on
this or faux leather whatever the case
may be a nice chrome design this attunes
to your head up and down and then
actually there's quite a bit of rotation
here it'll lie flat 180 degrees top to
bottom it rotates like I said very
comfortable wear pretty outstanding
build overall it feels like a really
nice finely polished pieces of
manufacturing I mean the I would say
that the hinge is maybe something
because it it's just us very kind of
well I mean the pin that holds this is
relatively thick so I don't personally
think that this hinge is anything to
worry about the diameter of the pin that
rotates is quite thick and this is
butter smooth as it goes across and you
know obviously the whole design metal it
feels a rock hard so I actually would
say there's nothing to worry about from
the breakdown standpoint obviously only
time can tell but the fact that the your
pads are replaceable you know I think if
you got this thing you'd have something
you can hold on to for a very very long
time everything about it
this is all leather covered on the top
very comfortable where I really like the
dark metal finish here chrome design
Krone on the interior and as I said
before it isn't open back design so some
does come out of the back so feeling for
a closed back headphone where sound
doesn't leak out you may want to check
something else but for the best sound
out there the most open natural sound
open back is really the way to go so
anyways this is the Apple new planar
magnetic amp
the PM one really fun pair of headphones
more to come I said for some sonic
observations but as far as packaging
goes a plus in my book really love these
