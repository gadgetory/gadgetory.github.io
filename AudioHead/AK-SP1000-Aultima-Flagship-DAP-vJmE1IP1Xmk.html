inaugural la audio show with Brian from
audio head showing off the brand new SP
1000 a brand new flagship model it uses
the latest an octa-core CPU so it's
going to be it's going to have some of
the fastest processing speed and
response time of any of our players you
can see everything refreshes very very
quickly it uses its a dual back unit but
it uses the AKM 4490 7eq DAC which is
the back that's not using any of our
other players brand new user interface
system it's a very user and music
centric UI it's a pretty big departure
from some of our other players so those
native DSD playback up to DSP 256 also
has a 5.5 inch display screen biggest
display of any of our other than any of
other portables we used now a volume
control key with integrate also a power
button as well also has USB type-c
support for much faster charging and
data transfers to so that's t1000 is
going to our brand new flagship it's
also available in stainless steel and
also in copper as well we have the
copper version here on this other side
but it will be available very soon
retail prices $34.99 for both the copper
and stainless steel models so what are
the upgrades on this now from
so it's got the octa-core CPU versus the
dual-core CPU on some of our other
flagship and previous generation models
much faster user interface still uses
the Android platform interface but if
you use some of our other players before
or your current Android device user
should be very familiar and also with
the USB 3.0 support and much larger
screen it is a step up from a previous
lecture fake a380 to what is the
difference in the exact same different
you know it's a different deck it's from
the same manufacturer this base psp-1000
uses the AKM 4490 7eq DAC versus the
4490 beef deck that's in dak 300 series
which includes the 380 320 and 300 so a
lot of the feedback we've received so
far that we've heard that the sg-1000
tends to be more on the musical warmer
side compared to the 380 but we invite
you to listen to it first and make your
own decisions on which one sound setup
so much no problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
