this is the long-awaited beats solo2
review I've set on my website and I'll
say again Here I am I'm not too
experienced with the beats lineup
unfortunately my experience with them is
very limited I haven't really listened
to too many of the previous models like
the solo HDS this solo to here is a
replacement for the HD it's roughly
around 200 bucks you can find it online
for a little bit less than that
but I have it here so I thought I'd give
you guys my thoughts on the subject
the beats solo2 is a closed back on the
ear model so it doesn't that go fully
around the ear rather at rest on the ear
specifically comes in a variety of
colors it also comes with controls for
Apple and on and off for Android in line
the cable actually surprisingly is quite
unique in that it matches the color of
the headphone at least in the blue case
of this blue one additionally it also
matches the color and I mean the color
in the texture of the padding on the top
of the headphone which is pretty nice in
that it is like leather ish like a soft
like to the touch but also kind of very
padded plastic type of rubbery plastic
so believe it or not out its kind of
impressed with that material cuz it
obviously feels fairly durable and also
cushiony so that's a big bonus and that
same kind of coating is a similar
texture with the cord that is detachable
and also surprisingly is a little bit
shorter than a lot of other audiophile
style headphones so the cord is a little
bit shorter but if you're just running
it to your pocket you should be fine I
think a lot of the audiophile headphones
are longer cords because they have to
run to a separate amplifier or stereo
somewhere off in the distance
where the longer cord kinda becomes more
useful and so the headband
it's cell
the clamping pressure inward is quite
significant I found it to be a little
tight on my head but my head is a little
bit are it larger admittedly it's a
little bit bigger but it was quite tight
so it wasn't really uncomfortable just
might be slightly fatiguing over long
listening sessions but I mean it's still
it's still workable it's not the
heaviest but it not by far not the
lightest pressure on the head I've
experienced this headphone also is
retractable you can fold it up into a
smaller travel like pouch there is a
hinge that bends inward to make this
thing kind of just like a little small
movable travel piece that fits in the
matching carrying case there has been
some worry online that the hinge breaks
over time but if you're pretty careful
with your oddity of stuff as I am I
don't think you might have an issue with
this at all you know any type of
physical hinge obviously can wear down
one time but this one feels really
sturdy initially it clicks in very well
and got to be honest with you compared
to a lot of hinges on a lot of the
headphones I've seen these actually feel
quite good so there is that in terms of
sounds so this is where things start to
get a little tricky because this
headphone is quite polarizing it's a
very powerful one a lot of people like
it first and foremost this is supposed
to be an update to a higher clarity
standard over the HD line according to
the company's copy so the drivers have
been redone from the solo HD and they
were shooting for clarity in part of
that projection so what do they really
sound like to my ears the first and
foremost again very basic as you might
expect there's a base forward signature
to the headphone that is not very far
from neutral so if you're a more of an
audiophile audiophile guy or someone who
likes a more flat response that's not
not to say it doesn't have a good
extension and robust
slam and really fun characteristics but
rather this is a straight inflation of
base
so it's not neutral with the inflated
base I do think that has a pretty good
fun texture to it and the boost itself
is is quite fun to listen to with like a
nice low-end grip at the very bottom
which is fun I think it adds a little
more robustness a little more thump kind
of feel to it so it the base itself is
fun sounding however inflated but the
problem really starts to happen for me
at least when you move up into the the
mids the mids are there right by the
low-end baits to the lower mids seem to
be a little bit recessed overall mid
clarity I found to be not so bad for the
price point the vocals are very clear
and you know things sounded to us to a
good degree with a higher fidelity than
my expectations for $200 but moving into
the treble I did kind of occasionally
get a waft scent of some weird texture
and like anomalies of textures so it
wasn't exactly my favorite in treble
region either however for the price and
if you like bass this is a headphone
that some might consider a match for
them again if those aren't your
qualities then perhaps you want to look
at another option but this is a
polarizing headphone there's a lot of
hate there's a lot of love for it out
there on the internet and for $200 it's
a respectable kind of attempt I think at
beats to kind of at least get there I
think there are more clear options more
neutral options out there in this range
there beast is one of the few headphones
that is permeated throughout all so many
retail establishments across the nation
so if you want to go out there and give
it a listen and try it on you
you know have that opportunity to do so
and that's not you something you can do
with every headphone so this is like
right so hey if you go out there you
have the opportunity to go actually put
physically put the sign listen to it for
yourself I suggest you do so to see if
that's kind of your cup of tea because
that's not something you can do with all
the high-end stuff they're hard to find
you have to go to audio shows or dealer
and and even then sometimes they're not
widely available on this place so this
headphone you don't have to take my word
for it you can go form your own opinion
and listen to it any store and say hey
this is good relatively speaking though
those are kind of how it lays and the
landscape and compared to other things
out there so anyways this is the beats
solo2 review thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
