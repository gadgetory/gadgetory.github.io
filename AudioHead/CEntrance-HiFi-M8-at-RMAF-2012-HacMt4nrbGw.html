here at the Rocky Mountain audio fest
we're premiering our new product the
high five mate it is spelled H I fil a
and you call it hifi mate it's right
here you can pan over we have in a glass
case here hifi mate is a portable DAC
and a headphone amp with two inputs one
is a USB input and the other one is an
iphone input so what this product does
is it allows you to plug in either a
laptop or an iPhone you can also plug an
android phone which is compatible with
USB audio the real attractions of hi-fi
mate here are balanced output connectors
with high level drive capability to
drive pretty much any headphones on the
market if you notice in this model we're
showing the combo XLR connector which
can accept either the quarter inch jack
in the middle or the big XLR jack so a
lot of balanced headphones actually come
with two XLR Jack's one for the left one
for the right so you can plug those in
or you can plug in to regular
quarter-inch headphones into this thing
and it'll drive them just fine this is a
volume control so that's the output side
of hyphenate this is the input side of
the hi-fi mate and I think that's the
more interested interesting site in
addition to the USB input and the iphone
input and a power jack which accepts
anything from 7 volts to 23 volts
allowing this to be powered from pretty
much any power supply in the market or
an external battery which you can strap
on to extend the battery life time we
have a number of sonic shaping switches
which basically control EQ and level to
allow to mate the hi-fi mate to a
variety of different headphones from
iems to over the head models it will
accommodate headphones with different
impedances different sensitivities and
also different frequency curves so let's
run down the switches real quick the one
on the left is the impedance which it
offers you three positions of different
impedances which allows you to match the
output impedance of hifi mate to the
input impedance of the headphones and
produce better
linearity in the frequency response a
more flat response to your taste the
second switch is a volume switch or gain
switch there's three positions on that
switch as well as little speaker icon on
that and that allows you to match the
level of hifi mate to a variety of
headphones from IEMs all the way to over
the head headphones such that you're
always listening at a comfortable
position of the volume knob and this
product so for example if you have
sensitive headphones you might
previously find yourself having to run
it right here and that's not a really
comfortable spot so by lowering the gain
by switching the the gain switch over to
the least sensitive position you are
able to bring the gain up here and run
the product in a very comfortable game
range then moving over to the right we
have a three position bass boost in a
three position treble boost switch so
these are basically EQ settings but
they're not just any eq's central's took
a long time to formulate the precise EQ
curves that would be necessary to bring
to life the sound of a variety of
headphones the best headphones to go
along with this product aside from a
variety of IMS are hot headphones like
oh disease headphones like Sennheiser's
headphones like bio dynamics headphones
like high finance our products previous
products such as DAC port and DAC mini
have taught us what our customers really
want in a portable product that port is
a is a $300 USB DAC that plugs into any
laptop and has a headphone output on the
other side we really learned what people
wanted to see in products like this in
the portable DAC products in terms of
output level and headphone compatibility
and with a hifi mate we're taking that
experience one level up we're really
giving you flexibility and impedance
control flexibility and level control
flexibility in tone shaping and also
most importantly the two inputs so the
last switch that I will describe here
for you today is the power switch and
that's which really has the left
position which is the iphone the right
position which is the USB and the middle
position which is the off position
this product is supposed to be shipping
in just a couple of months and we're
very excited about the potential hifi
mate is positioned at 699 95 and we have
several different versions planned
version with without the iphone
connector and instead the spit of
connector etc check our website at WM
transcom for all of the options and a
pretty extensive amount of information
you can read about the project about the
design you can read the blog that we've
been posting daily that chronicled the
development of the product and our
philosophy that you know of all the
thinking that went into making this
product or reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
