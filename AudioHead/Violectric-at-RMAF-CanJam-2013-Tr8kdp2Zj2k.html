Lake people respectively by electric and
we're here for the first time the USA a
show to show range of headphone
amplifiers day converter and mine cree
amplifier can begin here this is our
budget model this is the model v90
headphone amplifier with a hybrid
amplifier inside next model is the be
100 with the transistor rised amplifier
with four transistors inside next is the
181 which is made for balanced
headphones you can see it here on the
4-pin XLR socket with the for hybrid
amplifiers inside and next one is the v
200 which is almost sold model with a
eighth transistor amplifier inside this
can be driven by our famous da converter
DAC v eight hundred whether some nice
pecs we can pet store later about and
this is acquired new device our line
preamplifier 3v 600 with an optional
remote
our headphone amplifiers offer three
advantages to the customers which in
combination may be found anywhere in the
world first is we are working with a
very high internal voltage of plus minus
30 volt which is at about double as high
as most competitors to have a very high
voltage output the world output voltage
swing to enable best driving of high
impedance headphones second is all our
amplifiers offer a very low output
impedance which is good to control low
impedance headphones and the third
advantage is that all our amplifiers
operated with a quite low internal gain
of only eight DB which means factor 2.5
and thus offering a very black
background noise
one unique thing of our amps can be
shown on budget even on our budget model
v90 this is what we call 3 game we want
to have the volume control as wide open
as can be to minimize the mechanical
balls coming from
potential media inside and so to just
best the amp to the souls into the
headphone you can switch in different
pre-games with by means of the dip
switches on the back of all of our and
difference
prices from our models begin with the be
94 600 US dollar next would be the the
hundred where the price of 800 u.s.
dollar those the models V 181 and v200
are priced with a normal retail four
thousand dollars will be eight hundred
and the be 630 are both fourteen hundred
dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
