the theist of audio
I loved sound reproduction and music
even as a child probably getting into it
when I was about four years old and air
guitaring to the Beatles on my dad's old
Macintosh based tube system in high
school I worked at a audio retailer in
Sausalito California called music by
design which was a really nice high-end
retailers have a lot of audio research
equipment they understand loudspeakers
and was always a passion for me I
studied engineering in college to go
into audio but ended up getting into
high tech instead and while I had some
tangential work in audio video and 3d
graphics you know I was taken in other
directions eventually moving into
Internet security which I hope to say
was kind of a soul-sucking experience
and as I became less and less enamored
with high tech I started thinking about
my life and what I wanted to accomplish
and I realized I'd really walked away
from my biggest passion and source of
fun which was audio
lots of different generations of
Technology here
these were some of the original Mad Dogs
modified fostex t 50 RP headphones and
they were really a affordable fun super
reliable headphone I think we charged
$2.99 for them at the time a version
that came out that we really loved was
the Mad Dog Pro which was probably our
most underappreciated headphone it
really brought some of the fun of the
alphas out using a newly using the Alpha
baffle technology and design it just
pumped out a great bass heavy sound it
was a lot of fun for electronica
these are some of our alpha dogs and an
early production prototype with you can
see the resolution of 3d printing at the
point also some tuning holes that were
dialed in there is a way of prototyping
airflow these things are very sensitive
to having a small amount of pressure
relief for the cup so you can't make
closed headphones that are perfectly
closed but that allowed us to fine-tune
it eventually we got a patent on this
which is the variable screw for
adjusting air damping where the set
screw is built into the sidewall of the
cup and you can control the size of the
aperture with a wrench through here and
that allowed us to precision tune and
balance the bass so that each headphone
had perfect precision on that here are
some the original prototypes for the
ether this was a real crude first
proof-of-concept
and just wanted to make sure that it
actually worked then we began working on
the gimble design and original wires and
this was a steel wire before we hit upon
our nitinol wire design in here is where
we fabricate the electrostatic
headphones
it's a clean room which is operating at
class-one levels so you basically have
no measurable contaminants of any size
in here we have less than 10 samples
we're ten contaminants per cubic meter
it's a super big filtration system up in
the ceiling and then we also have
filtration of their work bench level
here so that in addition to having a
very low contaminant level within the
room there's very clean air being washed
across the production surfaces so that
anything like skin or dander or small
hairs that can fall off the operator are
being flown away from the parts and that
allows us to keep the parts entirely
free of contamination during the
production process and when I started
looking into closed headphones they
didn't really do it for me at the time
there wasn't anything that I felt was a
fun and engaging experience so I started
modifying headphones
after finding a couple of forms on head
by four people who were enthusiastically
making changes to some products made by
fostex the t-50 RP and so I started the
business to do that and left high tech
with the help and goal of making
products that would make people's day a
little nicer when they got the product
at the end of the day after coming home
from work find a headphone at their
house and be able to have a really nice
experience enjoying music in a way that
would be fun and refreshing for them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
