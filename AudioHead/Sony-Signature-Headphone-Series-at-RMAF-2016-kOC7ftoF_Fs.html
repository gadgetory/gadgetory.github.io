got a introducing our Signature Series
products here so we've got the z1 on our
headphones we've got the vh1 ES
headphone amplifier that's right yes and
then also on over here actually is where
the it's over here
that's the WM 1z music player so you can
see it's got a copper body if you over
here copper body so here's the original
kind of copper ingot you can see it gets
milled down to here so chassis starts to
take shape it gets kind of a layering of
gold plating on it and then there's kind
of the final outcome so yeah this is
really what we're kind of showcasing
here this is really the new stuff over
here so price on the Walkman right here
is 3200 price on the Signature Series
headphones are 2,200 this one year
that's correct
and then the price on the headphone
amplifier is also 22
so the new headphones you can see really
kind of top-notch quality build it's got
a resident resonance free housing design
you can see a stainless steel finish
here there's actually made with some
Canadian pulp on the inside and it's
kind of broken down into a fiber so to
create this kind of resonance free
housing so a lot of kind of attention to
detail just in terms of craftsmanship
they're made in Japan as well so you
give them a spin
after you're done and you'll really kind
of understand kind of appreciate the
sound quality of these things moving
yeah well I mean yeah balanced and
unbalanced but you can see it's got
basically every output headphone output
under the stars kind of thing so yeah
XLR over here kind of move down the line
just kind of its traditional things one
thing to point out this is a new four
point four millimeter headphone jack
balanced so again just kind of a yeah
new evolution oh yeah whatever the
headphones we're gonna be able to
accommodate unbalanced both balanced yep
