here today we have to Dax in from a
company called audio that's as she
s CH iit but it is pronounced the same
as the swear word today the two Dax are
the Modi to you and the Modi multi-bit
is called one on the right it with the M
logo on the top is actually the
multi-bit and the one on the left is the
over to Modi to uber today's also the
first day that we're using our new
recording device so hopefully the noise
floor is a little bit better I know some
people had asked about that and in case
you're wondering the recording device is
the zoom h4n show you guys here look you
guys in production may remember it it's
an older model there is a newer updated
version to this but does do even
high-res recording and it's kind of like
a field recorder for a lot of people so
we're going to give it a go
see if the sound quality is better hope
you guys enjoy that so a lot of you guys
might be interested in these Dax
they are separates they are small
however most importantly they're really
a budget amplifier so what we have is a
hundred and fifty dollars here on the
left and 250 on the right there's a
delta sigma type style DAC on the left
in the uber - so the second version
there's actually another model in the
Modi line the Modi to regular is has a
single USB input and is also powered by
that USB that's $99 but this is the step
up from that and then there's one more
step up to the multi bit which is
trickle down technology from the yagura
cell and their other like really
high-end
letter Dax r2r Dax is another term for
kind of a not the Delta Sigma brand of
chips and a lot of decks generally used
but more of a custom bespoke think it
requires a bespoke filter to get it
going correctly on the left there is an
AKM chip also a decent chip using a lot
of high-end players it uses in this
version an off-the-shelf default filter
so I'll give you my impressions of the
sound a little bit later but just keep
bear that in mind that there's a default
filter on the left and there's a custom
filter on the right but generally
speaking these two these two guys are
really interesting really interesting
for the money and in terms of latter Dax
this is probably the cheapest ladder DAC
produced to date for $250 they come with
a full set of inputs and the back so
three digital inputs the bait the main
ones most consumers use that's coaxial
optical and your standard USB they don't
DSD in this case but it's pretty rare to
find those kind of files for most people
who are shopping and this price range
might guess to be they don't own too
much DSD on top of it so not a big deal
breaker for for someone looking at these
the RCA outside your standard
single-ended outputs and there's a
simple on/off switch in the back 3-way
selector in the front to switch to
switch between the three digital types
now in terms of sound I was impressed
with the Modi to you the uber on the
left it has a good sound and it's
definitely step up from the jack at $150
I think one of the things that I found
is the decks can be very touch-and-go
below a couple hundred bucks there's a
there are you know maybe 50 on the
market total but many of them are from
small manufacturers and they're not
super focused on the high-end audio file
sound a lot of them are just kind of you
as Beach interpretations of things now
grant
you can also find a bunch of more
high-end USB stick style decks in this
price range but you're not going to get
the full connectivity of the three types
and a like a larger real estate
footprint that you get with this one on
the left the sound is defined it's a
step up from the headphone jack on my
computer and in my interpretation worth
the extra hundred and fifty dollars if
you're looking to get more fidelity
greater detail out of your computer
cool right adds a little bit now that
being said these are a little bit
different in that they are have a
separate power supply that needs a
separate connective wall wart to them
that design often helps people with
keeping the noise level down in terms of
design so it requires a separate power
supply but when you really look at these
it's it's it's a separate brought down
from two channel into a small component
that can be used on the desktop so the
intent here is pretty clear separate
power supply lower noise floor higher
performance in terms of the sound
difference between this one and the
multi bit you see on the right the
difference is pretty significant in my
mind the main concept I'd like to convey
about the sound of the multi bit in this
execution is that it sounds fatter
it sounds body or there's more meat on
the bones of the notes on the right
that's a pretty good thing that's like
kind of one of the elements that you see
in entire and really nice digital sound
is when the digital conversion just has
more of a lifelike full-body feel to it
one of the issues that that really high
in digital when they pull all the
information out when they really get
solid detail retrieval unfortunately it
gets a little it can get crispy
sometimes it can get granular almost
this has more of a nice kind of organic
feel and a fuller feel throughout the
mid-range while applying a nice smooth
high-end which is also pretty cool
smooth high-end from the USB port
not too shabby and then a nice full
round I would call base so a nice full
round base really rich mids and a smooth
treble I'll make it in my opinion at
least worth the hundred dollars extra
for the one on the right so for 250 it's
worth the extra effort I think almost
anybody even with untrained ears would
be able to listen to these two and hear
the difference it's not super subtle
like the differences can get with backs
this one is more pronounced in my case I
think it's a little bit better so it's a
win on that thing and definitely worth
the step up for another hundred dollars
you'll get a really interesting sound
from your computer laid out and you also
get some very interesting audio file
focused technology that you generally
don't see you know until you see custom
stuff way up the chain so really fun on
that the outputs are the same for both
these guys so again the Modi to
uber and the Modi to multi-bit 150
and 250 really cool if we look into pair
this was something you can just plug
this in right to your amp that's also
one more thing I just want to mention
these do not have headphone amplifiers
in them specifically they are just
individual breakaway decks so you're
going to need a headphone amplifier if
you want to listen to headphones or you
can plug this directly into your stereo
so it's a like an intermediary between
your computer and your stereo input and
that's how you get these going so true
inputs at a budget level pretty cool
stuff thanks for watching guys I'll
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
