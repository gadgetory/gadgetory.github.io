at CES 2017 in Las Vegas with two of our
brand-new products so here we have the
dampener one and the cr1 ceramic so the
Death Cap l1 is a portable headphone
tank and provide our very first non
headphone product something that we're
really really excited about a couple
years in the making
so a lot of research and kind of
development of this product to get it
available today so some features on this
dual channel processing so we use an ESS
saber 901 8 k 2m chip as the back and a
Class A B amplifier separate for left
and right compatible with a range of
sauce devices it's MFI certified so it
works directly plugging in through the
the lightning cable works with Android
Windows Mac Linux pretty much everything
there's also an optical in so work with
some of the big story of players coming
out the Asian market and that sort of
thing terms of outputs very standard
three and a half hours of
interconnection is it expected but also
this very kind of unique for us
this meaning balanced XLR which is
compatible with one of the cables on the
CL one which I'll come to this products
really kind of we wanted to create a
product that could deliver high
resolution quality audio on the move
inspired kind of by home audio so a
really cool feature we have these its
customizable EQ controls so there's a
twelve-step minus 3 to plus 9 on bass
and treble kinda gives that impression
of playing with your parents stereo back
in the day 3 step gain and this also
doubles as a power bank so you can you
can charge your phone or your your
tablet four thousand milliamp power
battery
8 to 10 hours battery life from a four
hour charge
that is the number one aluminium
extrusion is the process used to make
this and overall just a really great
unit which we're very very happy with
moving on to the cr1 so this is one of
two about the first high impedance
headphone models 150 ohm resistant
unique kind of driver configuration for
us it's a dual driver configuration we
have a ultra wideband dynamic driver
which handles everything below 8,000
Hertz everything above 8,000 Hertz is
handled by a ceramic plate transducer
which operates on the piece electric
principle something that we haven't done
before and something again that we're
really really excited about housing here
said it's ceramic injection molded
zirconium dioxide and the ceramic plate
and the driver is the same material so
you get a good kind of marriage of
materials there now the cool feature
these cables are interchangeable so it's
a MMC X connection which we've actually
added a little note to here to make it
secure so this doesn't twist and turn
the reason I've done that is to make
sure that there's no cable degradation
by this twisting and turning so a couple
of cables that it comes with obviously
as I've just touched on with the dark
amps we have this fully balanced four
pin mini XLR so you get a completely
balanced signal all the way through the
dark amber and all the way through the
headphone which is a really nice touch
and it also comes with a standard
three-and-a-half millimeter cable as
well silver core which is something we
haven't used before generally just used
copper and
available now 550 US dollars for the dad
camp without one and four hundred and
fifty dollars for the CEO and cyrillic
right thank you so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
