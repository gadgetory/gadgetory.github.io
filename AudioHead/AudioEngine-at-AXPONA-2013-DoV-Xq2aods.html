day on Sunday and we are in the audio
engine room with Brett and he's gonna
take us really quickly through the their
product line they have some really great
speakers out that we like so I'm just
gonna let him run you through it real
quick yeah so bobby michan is really
known for our computer speakers of a 2 &amp;amp;
a 5 plus but recently we've been getting
into all recently the last year year and
a half or so we were getting into the
DAC category and also wireless but
really our core business is the a 2 and
as I said a 5 plus so these are self
powered Class A B hands built-in to the
left side and the right side is passive
so a really simple set up really easy to
use and again you can pair them up with
a little USB DAC so they work great with
computers TVs even turntables really
personal products so the 85 Plus this is
a rear panel really simple setup 45 watt
class a PM and so all your inputs flying
control everything's on the left side
and again the right side passive so a 5
plus starts out at 399 prepare and
bamboo finishes for 69 a pair and it's a
really great entry-level system and the
a 2 is 199 prepare available black and
white so over here we have a pack so
this is a p4 and just a simple four inch
passive speaker so available in black
light and solid bamboo and these start
at 250 a pair so a lot of people want a
more traditional setup where you know
you have a separate amplifier and
passive speakers instead of the dams
built in so that's why we did the the p4
and 22 and this is our little desktop
class a/b and so 22 watts per channel
and it's got you know just all your
basic RCA an eighth inch and
a USB power and so then twenty-twos
$1.99 so for this setup starts out at
450 for the anthem and passes so in
addition with speakers as I said we're
getting into little small Dax and this
is the v1 it's really nice 24 bit DAC
it's got USB and optical end and RCA out
also a nice headphone amp so those sell
for 169 and so a really great system be
you know either the 80 or a 5 plus with
the d1 DAC so those have been shipping
for a year and a half or so and we're
gonna grow that category here in the
next couple months we'll have a new back
out and then you're and then you're also
growing your the category into internal
decks as well right with the release of
your new new smaller speaker that will
have a new a2 plus that should be three
or four months or so so we're looking at
this summer of this year and it will
have USB end so you can go straight out
of your computer instead of out of the
headphone output you can go USB out
straight into speakers and those are
retail for 215 and they come in this in
this size here yeah so same cabinets
same driver booth and I should also say
we we custom build everything we build
our own drivers so we designed all of
the components so couple our drivers
so don't Wieters and we like we like
class ibm's so better than just sound a
little warmer and so that's the line we
do have with wireless stuff as well so
we've got the the d tube which is a
wireless DAC a lot of customers were
asking for a good way to send 24-bit
audio from their computer out to
system that's why I did that d2 it's
24-bit over-the-air and we use the verb
round back in the receiver so you can
either use the built-in DAC and go RCA
out and your system or use the optical
out into your own deck so the d2 is
$5.99 per pair so you get a center
receiver and it's really easy to use
plug and play runs over it close the 802
11 so yeah that's a high-end Wireless
DAC basically so we have also the w3
which is our 16-bit version this
products a little more versatile so you
can use not only the USB input but also
though there's an analogue in on the top
so you can connect essentially any
source to it any replaces any RCA or
eighth inch cable so again plug it into
your computer to send out to any system
there's two there's two parts good
transmitter and receiver so it really
versatile little piece and and that's
sells for 149 repair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
