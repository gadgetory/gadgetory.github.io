cofounders of audio it's a lot of
people come by they see the name they go
who the hell is you know who the hell is
this are they serious that's like now
we're absolutely serious we're we're
growing like crazy the $99 products have
been amazing now it's like what are you
know essentially what are we gonna do
next it really came from two things one
is when we were developing the company
my my I was always telling my wife you
know I gotta go work on this I got
to work on that and then chase you
said well why don't you just call it
 because you just keep referring to
it as that and Mike and Mike Moffet my
business partner chimed in and he said
well everyone knows America can only
make anyway so you know it's made
in USA so let's just call it and it
it kind of stuck them you know it's like
it's the shits and you know happy as a
pig and sheds ape and we we've kind
of taken and run with it and you know
despite the name despite our kind of
cavalier attitude you know we are very
serious about the products themselves
it's just this is our way to get your
attention without spending you know ten
million dollars we're in advertising so
far it works we'll see maybe everyone
will get tired of it and that's
something that I think the thing to talk
about it this show is probably something
that's not even here because we get
asked about this all the time the
statement products which have not yet
been named or had not been released and
have not actually been shown anywhere
and a lot of people are like are you
going to have it here at the show it's
like well the answer is no unfortunately
we had a little bit of a fire with one
of them so it's not going to be out for
a little bit but statement products are
being worked on
and we anticipate releasing at least one
of them before the end of the year
statement products are an amp and a deck
the two separate products the amp I
think people know a little bit about one
is that it's an integrated amp that will
drive speakers headphones headphones
down to IEM it's balanced and balanced
out single ended in single ended out you
know it's a really neat product the
thing is that microprocessor control
system is still under development so
anyway that's the that's the one that
kind of had a little bit of a fire and
then there's a statement DAC that's
coming out and that one is we're
currently evaluating three different
analog sections for it analog deck and
essentially summing you know sections
for it and I'm hoping that'll be out by
the end of the year we'll see but I
wanted to have here I wanted to have a
really ugly prototype to hide under you
know under the tables but it didn't make
it but we are working on it guys and you
know so I guess keep the faith but we do
have is the full range from Magnum OD
which are $99 products you know made in
USA headphone amp and DAC also available
as the combo Magne and muddier as people
call him the stack which is $198
and that's our combo deck and amp button
by the way guys it's just in two chances
we also have Asgard - that's probably
our newest product here
Bifrost uber which is the the newest
version of Bifrost we also have let's
say that valhalla headphone amp and we
have Milner and junior as well so really
the whole the whole line 99 - 849
and you know everything's playing and
not catching on fire which is a good
thing for a production product anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
