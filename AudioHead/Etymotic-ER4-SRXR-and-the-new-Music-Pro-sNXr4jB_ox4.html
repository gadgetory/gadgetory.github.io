work for ED emmonak research in Chicago
I'm right now at the exponent show and I
want to talk to you about a couple new
products that we have coming out with a
company probably the most interesting
one we have here besides our new line of
ER fours the XR and the SR is what we
call a music Pro and we sell this a lot
to musicians that are looking for
additional hearing protection on stage
so when you put these little buds in the
first thing is you get a natural 25 DB
of attenuation and they're what we call
electronic hearing protection so as the
music gets louder they give you an
additional protection up to 15 decibels
now there's a switch on the back when
you flip the switch to the down position
you get 9 DB of additional attenuation
but the thing that's really nice is when
the music stops it actually gives you
soft sound enhancement so you can hear a
lot better and it gives you up to five
times your normal hearing enhancement so
they kind of act like hearing aids if
you will so we're going to be coming out
with a new version of this in July
basically a rechargeable version of it
with a tap switch on the back so it's a
lot easier to use and even this version
here so we'll be introducing it at the
NAMM show coming up in July so we hope
to see you there and certainly keep keep
looking at our automatic website at moto
calm because we'll have some additional
information as we get closer to the
launch what's the price on this the
price on these is $2.99 the new price is
going to 349 for the rechargeable
version leave on the original er4 back
in the mid-90s and it's been very
successful for us it's still the most
accurate in your earphone you can get in
the marketplace we have two versions of
it
one is what we call the SR the studio
reference and we also have the XR which
adds a little bit of a bass lift on the
low end and we call that an extended
response
as with all of our products it's all
about noise isolation so you get up to
from 30 to 35 DB of noise isolation the
sound is incredibly accurate and the SRS
you're looking at 92% noise and sound
accuracy each one of these products by
the way is tested by our engineers so
you get give or take one or one decibel
between the left and right side for the
most accurate sound you can get so we've
increased the sensitivity on it we also
have another feature that's very nice
they're detachable cables now and it
gives you different options for
different cable configurations that were
in development that are in development
right now metal bodies on these and
again the kind of sound accuracy that is
really they used to when you buy an
emotive type of product price of these
are three hundred and forty nine dollars
we're offering a show special over the
next two weeks the $2.99 actually but
yeah normally 349</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
