the sonic impressions of the new Oppo
pm1 this headphone I already kind of
revisited the packaging and some of the
other characteristics of it in another
video which you can find I'll flash it
up the link to the video up on the
screen here so you can go ahead and
check that video out if you're
interested in more of the fine tunings
for what comes with it and that kind of
thing the focus of this video however is
going to be what does this bad boy sound
like so we have a new planar magnetic
from Apple a company traditionally known
for really good blu-ray players that are
for the audiophile dollar a lot of bang
for the buck the headphone in this case
really kind of follows a similar suit
very very nice pricing on this at $1,099
now I know a lot of guys well for a lot
of people that is a lot of money but
when you're looking to buy some of the
you know best stuff out there and that's
what these guys are really shooting for
we want they want the best possible
sound those are the range that the
headphones start to get into but within
that range planar magnetics there are a
couple of offerings from high five man
are diseased fostex t 50 RP uses
utilizes a technology a little bit on
the lower end in a closed back form
additionally mr. speakers Mad Dogs uses
them in a mod form however in the upper
range this lands in a pretty good spot
at 1200 I think that it's not you know
it's it performs very very well for its
price so I know I say that a lot but in
this case the 1200 you know means that
expectations are much higher you're
looking for something where the response
has to be very linear very true to sound
and still be really fun and I think
that's where this headphone actually
does a very good job at it's quite fun
specifically in between the bass in the
mid so rising up from the base into the
mids there's a nice tone a nice texture
that's really fun and really easy to
listen to some people you've used the
word warm to describe that I don't know
if I'd go so far say is it's warm I find
it to be very very fun energetic nice
well executed based mid presentation as
you move up into the vocals the treble
the vocals are in a very nice spot
sometimes vocals when that frequency
gets boosted they push too far forward
in the mix other times they feel
recessed back so you can't hear them as
much they're right where they should be
right where you would expect for
anything a grander up in the headphone
area good sound good linear sound good
vocal presentation vocal accuracy moving
up right to where above the vocals are
in between the vocals in the trouble
there's a nice sense of air there's a
nice sense of breathing room cymbal
crashes things of that nature vocals
seem to have a kind of sense of space
above and around them it's more like you
know in a room where they can breathe
rather than I'm hearing this like work
but right into my ear so there's a good
sense of space around the the vocals
moving up to the trouble
the treble is not as forward as perhaps
some of the other flagship audiophile
headphones particularly the HD 800 I
think has a little more trouble than
this headphone but still a very nice
presentation overall look you put this
thing on you're like well you know they
got it for a plate of rag netic not
something that everyone hits right away
this is a Bose first the run right out
of the gate their first headphone and
it's a pretty amazing first entry for
the company
also one of my favorite things that I
doesn't necessarily have to do with
listening for this headphone is the
comfort for planar magnetic top tier
flagship headphone it really really is
comfortable it's lighter than a lot of
the other headphones out there in the
same arena and also the caliper pressure
seems just about perfect for my head at
least so the amount of tension that's
used to keep it on your head isn't like
crushing your melon or too loose that it
falls off in fact compared to a lot of
the other heavier planar magnetics these
headphones stay on your head and feel
more like a regular pair of headphones
without having like that huge audiophile
kind of weight coming down so big marks
big marks for oppo in that regard the
driver is actually proprietary they're
calling it a seven layer unique design
that's specific to them so you know I
think they put the time and energy and
R&amp;amp;D to really push out something special
the first time around excellent that
worked there one last thing I just like
to comment on the sound is this the
staging the focused articulation of
individual instruments so the instrument
separation combined with where the kind
of land and the soundscape is very sharp
it's it's almost like holographic where
it sits outside your head a very very
good way it's one of the most
interesting yet arbitrary kind of
characteristics of listening the
headphones is how do we get that sound
out of our head and more like we're
sitting there listening to a pair of
speakers I think through the treble the
accuracy and a lot of other factors
these headphones do that very very well
it's very nice characteristic to have
with the pair of headphones and I think
it achieves that that quality very
nicely
so really the highlights of this this
headphone are a very unique base to mid
presentation that I find very agreeable
and also the great sound staging as
instruments go from left to right or are
out there in the soundscape great great
job keeping those nice and tight this is
the Oppo pm1 planar magnetic headphone
available
now thanks everybody for watching man
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
