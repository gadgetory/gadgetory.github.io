we have ray Samuels here from Ray Samuel
audio and he's gonna introduce one of
his new products here at the Chicago hit
by me hi there this is the newest
amplifier and DAC combo that is gonna be
released within two weeks hopefully to
everybody and the nice thing about this
particular end is that it has a higher
gain than the sr-71 B which this one has
a gain of 21
comparing to gain of 11 that sr-71 he
has and the reason for that particular
gain to be that high is that a lot of
people use it with the iPod or they use
it with the computer where the voltage
swing for either iPod or computer is not
high enough and when you use hard to
drive headphones you find out that we
maximize the volume and you don't get to
the proper value of somebody one of us
are really very high with the gain of 21
it satisfies a very loud listener
people's including me and it can drive
with that also the very hard to drive
headphones which demand a lot of voltage
swing like the HD six I use this
combination the way it is right now
which you have an iPod classics of
course through the line out dock and it
is right now in balance as you could see
and I'm using it with a 300 mm HD 600
sanitizer and around 11 o'clock the
volume is even high for myself you know
but when I put the HD 6 I find out
myself I'm around 2 o'clock at very very
loud volume which it does really very
well with that one of course this one at
the same time just like the SR sexual be
it has a face splitter circuitry that
you can take the iPod output which is a
single-ended
and
through the face splitter you get enough
signal as a positive netting for
left/right channels and run it through
the for gain stages and for buffers and
you get a balanced signal that you'll be
listening to the iPod in balance at the
same time using it with the computer
you're listening also to your computer
imbalanced through this particular
amplifier which is of course called the
intruder I'm hopefully that people when
they listen to this one
they're gonna really enjoy a lot of
things features about this one the the
gain of course you have independent
games for left or right channel which
are right in the front of the panel and
you have a gain of 2 for in-ear monitors
just like I said you won't be the end of
6 just like a star center will be for
low impedance and even high impedance
headphone and of course the only thing
differs from SR security as we said is
the high gain which this one is a 21
compared to 11 or mice are set you want
a diamond V I'm sorry in the back of
course you do have a USB you have two
switches that you flip them up in the
USB when it is in USB mode the tiny
little switch which is over here which
chooses between single-ended and the
balance gate is is by pasture when you
use a USB once you flip these two
switches down into the audio input or
signal input then this switches becomes
involved in the circuitry then you can
choose either single edit on the left on
the when you're looking at the camera
it's gonna be on the right or the
balanced on the on the left side right
now we're listening because it's single
edit switch should be in the single
ended and this way the the two USB
switches are gonna be down so because
we're getting a signal out of the iPod
other than that we're using four
batteries in here which in balance mode
you're getting close to 32 volts of
voltage swing which is really really
high
for a portable amps and this is enough
to deliver almost one amp of current at
that kind of voltage to any headphones
which can satisfy any hard to drive
headphones
that's that should be about it as what's
involved in this particular end and how
it operates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
