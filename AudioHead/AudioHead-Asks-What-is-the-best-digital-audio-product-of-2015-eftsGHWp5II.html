us 4 2015 is the new elac us a little
mini monitors which I think are 229
direct I understand they come out later
in September but for 229 dollars a pair
I don't think you can touch them for
under 1500 maybe two grand amazing sound
design by Andruw Jones of Pioneer and
you know great speaker designer
literally they will rock you like crazy
so my favorite product of the past year
while controversial a little bit the
light harmonic company they've had their
issues as a recent and the past with in
a number of products without a doubt i'd
have to say that the geek out to would
probably my favorite one this year it's
harder than I its sound quality and
value in general my choice is the oppo
p.m. 3 these are a portable clothes back
planar magnetic headphone and they're
really cheap they're like four hundred
dollars well cheap for a planar and they
sound fantastic they're easy to drive
they are built really well and they look
really well and they're just like a
really great overall choice I think
these are one of my favorite products of
this year I think that my favorite one
of my favorite products of 2015 is the
quest√£o qp1 are and sounds pretty
transparent pretty clear able to drive
harder to drive headphones and custom
im's im's and sounds really really good
so there you go the future of headphones
is basically integrated deck and a fo
fire similar to the sony MDR 18 DAC or
the philips m2m 1l those have lightning
cable that goes straight to the iphone
in this case of the sony has a USB cable
that can go into your and
device the app is built into the cup and
the attack is also built into cup you
can use that with your mobile device or
you can use it on a computer the dcs
rossini DAC and network player 2015
let's see when was the Iggy release was
it released this year were last year
can't quite remember was this year right
so I'd probably say it's probably a geek
definitely yeah in terms of digital yeah
yeah there's no doubt about it it's just
just the club the price to performance I
mean get get a lot out of a 24 hundred
dollar back so I think streaming is the
future of audio I love to be able to
listen you know actually live streaming
as well like on periscope you know a lot
of bloggers are using that I personally
love that because you can really feel
like you're in the pulse of things it's
awesome and the answer is any and all
digital audio products that have helped
to bring in a younger younger group of
hobbyists a younger group of people to
have fun with this which means things
that are not priced in the tens or
hundreds of thousands of dollars and
it's being a populist by nature we need
to get more people into this hobby or
it's going to die just like the people
up in the towers of the shows that are
showing off their three quarters of a
million dollar system and they're all so
serious and
they just they're angry and I may agree
that there aren't more younger people in
so let's bring them in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
