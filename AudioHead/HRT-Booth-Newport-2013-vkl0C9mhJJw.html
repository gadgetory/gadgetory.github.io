Elite audio-video distribution out of
Los Angeles and one of our main product
lines is high resolution technologies a
full line of modern external sound cards
or DAX digital audio digital to analog
converters for use with both Macintosh
and Windows based pcs we also have a
specialized version in the HRT line
called the eye streamer that works
exclusively with modern eye devices
mainly with the advent of computer audio
coming on so strong a lot of people are
wanting to do away with playing physical
medium and you know having to handle CDs
and records and what particularly CDs
and DVDs so figuring that most people
have a preponderance of CDs in their
music collection if it's digital stuff
all the music streamers are made to do
the same thing they work with the
computer they intercept the digital
stream and then they decode it into an
analog music outboard of the computer in
a much higher quality fashion than is
what is built into the computers and the
i-screamer does the same thing with the
I devices with the exception that it's a
slave only to the I devices made by
Apple because they don't have USB buses
and they just do things differently I
mean we start out with the music
streamer to which is about a hundred and
eighty bucks and it has a high-quality
Texas Instruments DAC chip in it and a
high quality analog output section and
it's a very good choice for people that
have a smaller system or want to start
with a more budget component but it
offers actually very few compromises in
terms of sound quality and most people
that get it are completely amazed at how
much better it sounds than their
computer did and how how close it
actually comes sometimes to a really
nice CD player and then you can move up
line and get the music streamer to Plus
which is the same exact concept except
that utilizes a higher quality DAC and a
higher quality analog output section and
cost three hundred fifty bucks and if
you have a system that's a little bit
better than say average you can easily
hear the big differences better dynamics
better frequency extremes more 3d effect
that kind of thing and then we go to the
top of the line well first let's stop at
the at the micro streamer that's worth
the mention that's one of our very
newest products it's similar in concept
I guess to
the widely-recognized audioquest
dragonfly we do it a little bit
different and we don't make it exactly
like a dongle that plugs directly into
the computer it needs a short USB cable
and then like the other streamers it
gets its power from and is connected to
the computer via the USB bus and it has
two outputs one is an analog adjustable
output for headphones and the other is a
fixed level output for driving your
preamp some people even use the analog
output the headphone output and drive
amps directly and a lot of times you can
do that that's 190 bucks
then we have the top-of-the-line music
streamer HD which is brand-new in
January and it's a four and $50 retail
and it will actually pass up to 24 192
does 24 192 resolution if you have Audio
2.0 enabled on your computer Mac's that
have Snow Leopard or above are
compatible up to 192 Microsoft computers
at this point or can pass a maximum of
24 96 because they don't have Audio 2.0
built-in don't know why but they don't
the manufacturer is currently working on
a custom driver which is apparently very
labor intensive and expensive and he
wants to get it to work right all the
time once he has that then the HD will
be able to pass 24 192 information over
any Microsoft computer and then the
i-screamer which again is specialized
for AI devices actually has its own
external power supply because there's no
USB bus on any high devices they don't
allow you to draw a power you know Apple
doesn't let you draw power from them so
we have a separate power supply it hooks
up either with a 30 pin connector like
Apple use for many years and will also
work with the new lightning connector
that's on the new Apple products like
the iPhone 5 I guess and the iPad Mini
and and things like that in very similar
fashion they we get a chipset through
Apple that allows us to intercept the
digits take them outside and just you
know make them into analog music and a
much higher quality than what's built in
to the actual AI devices because let's
face it they've got wonderful interface
beautiful graphics nice to use they
didn't spend a lot of extra money on the
the DAC that's built into the device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
