representing Riga research at the Expo
in Chicago Show 2013 Riga have been
building high-end but recently priced
electronics turntables loudspeakers for
40 years we're probably best known for
our turntables we do have a range of
handle turntables from $445 up to $4,500
at this time and the system that we're
playing here at the show is has been
described as a bit of fresh air walking
up and down the halls on the digital
system we have the Apollo our CD player
which retails for 1095 as a complete
player the integrated amplifier called
the Brio arm which does include a phono
stage is only 895 and the loudspeakers
that we're using our our entry-level
floor-standing loudspeakers called the
rs3 that these are 1395 so strictly from
a for a digital playback system we're
totaling about $3,400 complete including
the cables for a hand-built further
system which is pretty cool this
turntable that were that were showing is
our newest RP 8 turntable which is a
skeleton frame design it is available
within outer frame to hold a dust cover
if you want a dust cover or you want a
more conservative look and this table
with the cartridge that's fitted on it
is about the same price as the rest of
the system $3,400 so we're having a lot
of fun in a very simple very musical
environment just playing records</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
