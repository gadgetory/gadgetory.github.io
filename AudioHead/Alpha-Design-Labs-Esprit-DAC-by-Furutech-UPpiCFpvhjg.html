design labs ESP RIT I believe it's
pronounced Esprit or East Britt Apple
Design labs also known as ADL has a
pretty awesome DAC here it's an
all-in-one kind of unit it's in the fact
that it has a headphone amplifier built
in with the DAC so you can plug it right
into your computer via USB if you so
desire and listen to headphones or you
can insert it into your home rig as a
regular DAC where you put a digital
input and have just the analog outputs
going out to your pre amplifier or
integrated to your speaker's you can
also just use it as an external DAC into
a headphone amplifier so it's one of
those kind of multi-use boxes that can
do a lot of different things this DAC
also has unlike a lot of other decks an
analog to digital converter as well so
you can put analog input into here and
put it out into the USB or optical cable
so there's an added functionality there
I didn't really look at that too much
review I did online and this one here is
centered around what an audiophile would
typically use the deck itself is not
powered through the USB it does require
a separate wall wart adapter to plug
into the back for full operation it has
a wide array of inputs in the back
including optical coaxial and of course
USB in addition to that it also has a
couple of analog outputs so you can use
this as a preamp because the output to
the analog outs is a variable that is
controlled by this knob here this
controls both the head foot output level
and the level
on the back so you can connect this
directly to an amplifier and adjust the
volume there in your stereo very cool I
really enjoyed the build and the finish
of this particular unit you can see here
it has this oversized plate that's kind
of common between a lot of high-end
components screwed out here it's quite
thick this direction but the knobs on
this are really really something special
there they're solid they feel good
machine the turn is good
I know knobs aren't the reason we always
buy audio components sound is the most
important thing but it's nice to see and
a manufacturer pay attention to detail
especially considering this unit cost a
thousand dollars roughly so it's the one
on the upper end of things as far as
your standard consumer pricing is
concerned and it does kind of elude that
with its building and in the amount of
inputs and outputs and I think that it
does so that's kind of a nice touch as
far as the sound is concerned I really
enjoyed this DAC all the detail was
there from other jacks that I've heard
in the price range for $1000 it is above
average
very much above average what you would
get for a $250 DAC let's say or if you
found one four five or six the
resolution is all there
the resolution competes with the DAC
mini that I also tested it against from
centrist which is roughly in that same
area it's a little bit less expensive
but it does not have all the inputs in
the analog to digital converter like the
C entrance has where this one really
stands out and its uniqueness is the
presentation of the resolution it's very
sometimes DAC resolution can get a
little bit edgy compared to a lot of
other DAX I come I reference this too it
was a little bit smoother the
presentation was a little bit smoother
and a little bit more organic and it at
a very pleasing easy to listen into
sound to it which is really great and
that makes it kind of a standout thing
it makes it a little bit more unique
because there's a lot of decks it sounds
quite similar
really detailed really punchy
in-your-face or is this one was just a
little more relaxed a little more easy
to listen to and and I think you would
cut down on a long-term on on and
listening fatigue so that's a really
great kind of bonus I think this one
that makes it stand out overall I really
enjoyed this DAC I think it's something
special in kind of the landscape it has
its place I think that if you enjoy kind
of that laid-back organic sound it is
definitely something for you to check
out let me know if you guys have any
questions regarding it leave comments in
the comment section on YouTube and I'll
get to them when I can thank you so much
have a great weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
