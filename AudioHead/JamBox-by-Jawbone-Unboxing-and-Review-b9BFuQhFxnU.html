to give you a quick review over the
jambox by jawbone as you guys know if
you follow the channel I'm big fan of
different types of packaging interesting
implementations for weight is you know
to transport products to kind of present
them I think Apple just a really good
job and a lot of cell phone
manufacturers are kind of catch on to I
think it's great really kind of a fun
aspect to marketing and everything well
this particular package i have here is
quite unique i think this is not a
stereotypical package that you will get
with the jambox this is something
special i got my hands on pretty cool
stuff this is the jam box box if you can
tell just by looking at it it's kind of
in the shape of a shoe box so it's just
like a shoe box but it has these
stickers here kind of identifying that
it's that is a jam box when you look at
it you can obviously read the text it
says that was then when you open up the
box it actually goes to this is now
pretty clever stuff as you can see here
this one is red with a black grille you
pull this out says the lift instruction
underneath as you pull that gives you
full kind of breakdown what's going on
underneath welcome to jam box by jawbone
as you pull this out you can see that it
comes full with the wall adapter the USB
charging a stereo plug and actually a
longer this is a set one foot and this
is 60 inches it's kind of good user box
this is actually a holder that goes
around with men magnetic kind of straps
to strap it down that's that's a cover
for this thing here as you can see it's
all just really well done tabs to pull
everything fits in there very nicely I
mean this is a pretty good gold plated
it's pretty good everything here so as
far as the jam box itself goes it's got
two speakers in here
it's really kind of a nice compact size
as you know it isn't it is bluetooth
connected although you can utilize a
direct connection here from the output
of your phone or stereo into this unit
on the tops of control very simple
there's an on and off and volume up and
volume down the side of this thing as
you know from some of the other audio
head reviews it this is a Bluetooth
device and unfortunately Bluetooth
device they're not really known for
their sound quality there you know quite
a bit seems to be lost right now with
the way the technology is currently
implemented in sound quality it's just
not quite the resolution that that I
like to see and it really doesn't really
compare as well to just wired devices of
the same price point but there are
certain application fist I think they're
great one of them being when you're on
the go in a hotel if you want to just
drop this thing down it does kind of put
out some fairly good volumes you know it
streams extremely well from an ipad or
from a cell phone one thing I did find
was that the source actually does matter
when you using this thing I got much
better song quality out of my ipod out
of the iPad then I did my cell phone
which is an EVO so I mean I found that
very interesting the quality was
definitely better from the ipad you know
this thing vibrates pretty good so i'm
not saying the bass is going to blow you
away but there is base to this tiny
little unit which is pretty fun also
included is a microphone so you can use
it just like you would a bluetooth
headset des and you can hear and you can
also speak into this online you can
adjust this with different voices if
you're so inclined there's a you can
pick like an English lady or a British
man or like a spy if you if you like
that kind of thing and the voice will
just tell you basically we
when you're a call is disconnected or
what the battery life is not a huge
there's not a large bunch of
functionality with that but it is kind
of a nifty thing the one thing it did
find is that there's a software upgrade
available online when you connect this
through the USB port here it will
actually let you add an additional mode
to this unit that allows a little bit
better song quality at the sacrifice of
volume unfortunately this isn't the
largest volume I've ever heard out of a
speaker already but it does improve the
song quite so if you're close to this
thing if it's like a desk type
application I you know I would suggest
checking it out because i did find
better results to the through that other
mode very interesting but overall i
really enjoy this unit for what it is
you know something that'd be great for a
desk something that gets by in a hotel
room if you're traveling a lot the
packaging and the external sleeve that
comes with it kind of do a good job it's
you know it's got a great rubber kind of
top and bottom to it so it kind of holds
up to travel so for travel you know this
is something fun if you if you're not a
big headphone person you're just looking
to kind of you know expand expand your
song just increase the base definitely
obviously from the ipad and your phone
you know this is kind of a fun way to do
it you know it's an enjoyable little
thing and i think these guys are doing
well i believe there is and dave even
made it one that's a bit bigger than
this there's a newer one with a size
increase offer same kind of
functionality so i mean i think they're
doing something right there's a market
for these things so if you get a chance
check it out it's kind of a fun little
unit you have any questions feel free to
shoot them in the comments section and
i'll try to get to them and subscribe to
the channel if you like it we got a lot
a lot of other reviews and to have a
good good weekend guys take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
