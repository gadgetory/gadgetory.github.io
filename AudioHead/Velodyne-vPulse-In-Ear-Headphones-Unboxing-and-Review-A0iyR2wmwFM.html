audio head here I just wanted to give
you a quick unboxing and review of the
Vela Dean V pulse in ear headphones we
have here
not too shabby at all very very
interesting sound signature from these
guys this time around as you see the
written here it's bring on the bass so
I'm just gonna give you a quick unboxing
first pretty nice packaging it's your
standard kind of shiny gloss it kind of
opens up here with another flap the
pulse price originally the headphones
were that came onto here but i i've
already looked at them once before so
you guys have pink inside this box this
is a pretty good little holder velvety
good texture we get into the real meat
over here it does come with one of my
favorite clips you know these clips
attach to your shirt and but the cord
through there can help reduce
coordinates as it bangs around on your
shirt all those kind of things make
noise as you jog on it just basically
holds it in place and it also you know
really helps with pulling them out of
your ears which can be really painful
especially these kind of these kind of
headphones so you don't want that to
happen to you in case case these are the
headphones here you'll notice that the
cord is a bit different design than
you're used to seeing it is flat in this
way and then wide this way it's a little
bit stiffer then you may be used to it's
not a bad cord I believe the design is
supposed to kind of help detangle
quicker which as you can see I just did
it's not actually might be but a little
bit better a little superior as far as
tangles are concerned which is it's kind
of nice it comes with a pretty fancy
right angle connector here as you see
from the three slots
is Apple friendly with the microphone
and then here on the other side we have
a volume up and down and this button
here clicks in the middle for play if
you look in the at the headphones
specifically I've applied the these
generously sized silicon earpieces
this is one of the things I was very
happy to see this is extremely large
compared to any of the other ones I've
ever seen in this unfortunately is the
size of my ear canal so I found needs to
be much more fitting for my ear
personally which is very nice I mean
it's nice that they are kind of getting
that bear because I bought buttons on
myself that were didn't have a larger
size they kept falling out so it's a
huge step for me you can see they have a
little bit more of a bend to them and
this is definitely like a brushed chrome
kind of feel on the top here and it's
light blue in color I think with a big V
on it so that's what they look like I
wanted to also show you the additional
accessories that came with you can see
the variety of tips so there is I
believe four different sizes in both
black and then white usually the largest
all the way down to fairly small so well
let's count them here one yeah four four
four it is has the very nice thing to
have I mean it's almost imperative when
you think about it when it comes to fit
for these she can be some kind sometimes
kind of an effort now as far as the
sound these retail for $89 for 89 bucks
you know belt line is typically known
for being a sub woofer you know they
don't for their bass speakers these are
some of the most interesting bass I've
probably ever heard really really deep
low stuff like low Rumble almost
artificial
rumbling your chest feeling which is
pretty unique I really haven't quite
experienced that with too many other
headphones the mids are not really too
crowded from the base which is always
something that's good there are I paid
more for a set of these and you had way
way worse sound signature than these
Valentine's show so these I mean the
mids they're not you know as much as you
would expect from a much much higher end
headphone but they do very well for the
price point the treble is is is pretty
good too
I would suggest these if you're looking
for a neutral sound signature these
probably aren't are the headphones for
you but if you like your bass and that's
really who the you know the lines going
after were these it says it all over the
box you know this is something you
should definitely try to check out if
possible the one some of the most
interesting low deep bass that I've
really heard in any headphone so that's
that's pretty fun about these they're a
very fun sounding headphone if you like
the low roam wolf like the bass you know
check them out they definitely have that
go on for them so if you have any
questions
