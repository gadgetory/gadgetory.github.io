audio head here I just wanted to give
you a quick unboxing and review of the
velodyne V pulse in-ear headphones we
have here not too shabby at all very
very interesting sound signature from
these guys this time around as you see
the written here it's bring on the base
so I'm just going to give you a quick
unboxing first pretty nice packaging
it's your standard kind of shiny gloss
it kind of opens up here with another
flap d pulse price originally the
headphones work that came on to hear but
I I've already looked at them once
before so you guys have pink inside this
box this is a pretty good holder velvety
good texture we get into the real meat
of here does come with one of my
favorite clips in these clips attached
to your shirt and put the cord through
there to help reduce cord annoys as it
bangs around on your shirt all those
kind of things make noise as you jog on
it just basically holds it in place and
it also you know really helps with
pulling them out of your ears which can
be really painful especially these kind
of these kind of headphones so you don't
want that to happen to you in case case
these are the headphones here you'll
notice that the cord is a bit different
design than you're used to seeing it is
flat in this way and then why this way
it's a little bit stiffer then you may
be used to it's not a bad chord I
believe the design is supposed to kind
of help detangle quicker which as you
can see I just did it's not actually
might be but a little bit better a
little superior as far as tangles our
concern which is it's kind of nice it
comes with a pretty fancy right angle
connector here as you see from the three
slots
is apple friendly with the microphone
and then here on the other side we have
volume up and down and this button here
clicks in the middle for play if you
look in the at the headphones
specifically I've all applied the these
generously sized silicone ear pieces
this is one of the things I was very
happy to see this is extremely large
compared any of the other ones ever seen
in this unfortunately is the size of my
ear canal so I found these to be much
more fitting for my ear personally which
is very nice I mean it's nice that they
are kind of getting that bear because i
bought buttons on myself that were
didn't have a larger size they kept
flying out so it's a huge step for me
you can see they have a little bit more
of a bent to them and this is definitely
like a brushed chrome kind of feel on
the top here and it is like blue in
color with a big V on it so that's what
they look like um I wanted to also show
you the additional accessories that came
with you can see the variety of tips so
there is I believe four different sizes
in both black and then white usually the
largest all the way down to fairly small
so let's count Amir one yeah 444 it does
has the very nice thing to have I mean
it almost imperative when you think
about it when it comes to fit for these
which can be some kind sometimes kind of
an effort now as far as the sound these
retail for eighty nine dollars for 89
bucks um you know valet line is
typically known for being a sub woofer
you know they're known for their bass
speakers these have some of the most
interesting base I've probably ever
heard really really deep low stuff like
low Rumble almost artificial
all rumbling your chest feeling which is
pretty unique I really haven't quite
experienced that with too many other
headphones the mids are not really too
crowded from the base which is always
something that's good there are I pick
more for a set of these and you had way
way worse sound signature then these
Valentine's show so these I mean the
mids they're not you know as much as you
would expect from a much much higher end
headphone but they do very well for the
price point the trebles is pretty good
too I would suggest these if you're
looking for a neutral sound signature
these probably aren't are the headphones
for you but if you like your bass and
that's really who the you know the lines
going after were these it says it all
over the box you know this is something
you should definitely try to check out
if possible the one some of the most
interesting low deep bass that I've
really heard in any headphones so that's
that's pretty fun about these they're a
very fun sounding headphone if you like
the low rumble of like the base you know
check them out they definitely have that
going for them so if you have any
questions shoot it shoot me a message in
the comments section and if you can
