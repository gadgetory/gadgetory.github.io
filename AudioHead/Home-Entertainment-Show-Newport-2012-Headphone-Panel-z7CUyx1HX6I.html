how you know how a headphone and sound
there's no reference you know something
that may sound good to someone may not
sound good to someone else yeah that's
so that's really what I embarked on
trying to get measured with a meaningful
measurements tile and head were effect
that you know a lot of those were
referring to the head of a frequency
response grass and that's you know
that's one dateable but I wanted to see
more and I thought why they hear more
because as a DIY speaker builder I
certainly knew what a lot of issues that
that that we run into mainly the thing
that I heard about that really hurt my
ears the lowest place residences and we
need and are there any folks here who
are into the single driver type speakers
high-efficiency exactly and you know
their challenges there with with us with
a full range drivers there's they're
swinging the higher quality is that we
don't have that are also advantages to
not having a crossover and George you
mentioned this headphones really give
you a very intimate experience yeah the
level of nonlinear distortion is very
very low you put on some of these top
quality
wow you're just getting blasted with not
necessarily blasted but there's all this
detail all this information that's
missing now you can walk around the
high-end ones here you know he's these
hundred-thousand-dollar speakers that
you may not necessarily hear that with
the best way $15,000 headphone center I
know it's rather crazy but please what
were you big that's where the room
really kind of becomes a huge part of
the equation exactly that room factor
Trump monitor you don't hear that um you
know there are a lot of great speakers
here but one thing I know it is thing
the rules are too small there's nothing
here that 60 Hertz group residents and
it's boom it's like oh he ordered that
come from so there's there's none of
that and so if I'm walking around the
air I'm really struggling and ideally I
mean most of us we don't have a speech
organic rooms and as those are a good
way to really hear what's on that
recording without the inter pares
but anyway so yeah as i mentioned right
now you know where are we at in terms of
headphones and I feel weird if we're in
the late 70s early 80s in terms of we're
heck more speakers were and that's why I
through this thing out here with the
scene in Boogie Nights busting England
you know maybe three or four more plus a
child you know we're getting there you
know there a lot of companies right now
I sennheisers done some good work Ozzy
has really made great that phone and
we'll start seeing what I'm talking
about we get to these measurements
that's the speaker I wanted 30 years ago
I had the opportunity here for years ago
i'm going to guess yep okay we should
mention before you go on that we're
going to have a guest to headphone
gameship anybody guess from the ground
which my point is we have 3d prices we
have some headphone amps and some eggs
to your own incredible intelligence
because this particular that phone as a
close fo i'll give instance even one
guess
we have some serious head boat good as
your keys here this is the CSD plot is
it does not cover the low frequencies
and only Congress previously from 50
curves
what would you do the computer finds bad
there's not very much meaningful
information below pie which occurs for
headphones it's just a matter of
interactions with the cops what Cutler
are using let's get the burning oh yes
he is i'm actually not using a double
yet the reason is i actually did try a
dummy head and there's some issues with
that dumb because you have the ears any
different yeah yeah then you've got you
know the really good ones happen to you
so and those create specific residences
that that don't necessarily represent
what we hear if i were to do a CSP
measurement with one of those couplers
there'd be all sorts of residences that
are inherent to the human auditory
system which i feel the brain filters
out so what I actually did was I built a
custom coupler well let you know more
about the details if you're interested
but I don't want to sidetrack it too
much but essentially what it does it
tries to minimize the effects of the
year the canal at the same time trying
to be realistic of what we actually hear
the human brain is very very good at
filtering them out no as I there some
math behind it and so basically
littelfuse out I'll gate convention
response and by gating it because low
low frequencies have a very long
wavelengths they're not going to be
covered and essentially
filter out there but i can i'll bring
some examples tomorrow you'll answer
that question it's better to show rather
than to try to explain so if you tell us
a little bit of what we're looking at
here in terms of the color the color
hues invade well the very left 200 out
its 200 Hertz is going up to 20 20 kilo
Hertz in terms of debris nations you
know a way to think of this is sort of a
frequent frequency response over time
it's not exactly like that but
essentially if this were a perfect
headphone at the very back you see a
wall and then a modulator they would
just drop a zero for the stretch marks
go go just go just be evolving and just
place your a walk along if I never
intend to kill any ridges any extra
information that's stored energy and
with with a measurement system that I
developed this it tends to focus more on
a driver rather than the enclosure there
are some enclosure effects is it
accurate to call whose residences yes
especially if their riches for this
particular headphone and I don't think
anyone's going to guess at this this is
the freedoms frequency response for the
head felt it's not very good it's
extremely Basie and its guys got a lot
of high truffle energy that's a monster
beef I've got monster it looks well it's
little worse than them but a lot of
hobbies enjoy the step come because it
sounds like a subwoofer attached to your
ear in Venice it's really sparkly on top
and the bid ranges sacr√© yea rather
sucked out going back to that sales for
illicit I would
is this is this that i dented d7000 it's
a closed headphone it is definitely
regarded as one of the top closes hands
a lot of aficionados what I websocket I
like that I actually all right little
brother who's a 25,000 and where I
really had a shoe which was the high
frequencies right there at 9k now that's
a really sharp reach there and the fact
that is really thin it's going to hurt
ending in her minders and I think most
most the folks here who are useless
speakers it's gonna hurt me to do be
clear I don't have your happy but is
this little right over there to page now
I write about a two minute now treasure
subjectively evaluated headphones you
pick this one's love it and then Apple
were times and Rob's not so good this is
exactly why it is there a checklist you
say okay I want to listen this recording
and it has this approach on Patroclus
information well listen to this
recording has this Lowell prequels the
information one listen to this recording
has female vocals or whatever you have
so like a checklist so when you going up
to these cams on start because both
who's jealous I do have a set of ten
reference recordings which I listened to
you before I take these measurements and
I like to look at my notes just to make
sure that you know these measurements
are reflective of what I hear and poorly
against the same the sacred under we
have a--your when you're damaged
speakers
measurements versus your you know
subjective perception of what that what
would it were that quick to put down
Iran so we've had your daily headphone
so I meant under certain measurement
that you prefer poorly you know some
things that you put up with you know as
opposed to you know other I mean I guess
my question is when you're evaluating
are you looking for free look at your
med res version no yeah so you're
putting on and taking how I eat and then
you and then you go get away around get
what I liked it exactly and over time I
started finding patterns things that
would bother me because that would it
you know this is this headphone has a
pattern that bothers me may not bother
other I'm speaker guy and I'm also a DIY
speaker builder and something like that
is completely unacceptable oh that's
interest for because I come from the
speaker world and yeah like I said I
like because that's it is all subjective
you said it really is I'm gonna side
measurement i SPECT but all you know and
i'll guarantee you you know with the
cluster will follow us all speaker major
like that it's you know i'd like to see
some comments let's go into the next one
here I don't think anyone's going to be
able to guess this one either this is
one of my favorite headphones it's very
bright and so open
anyone can guess pretty good hp's I was
actually an HP hundred okay so wasn't
fun it's an open headphone very clean
let's go ahead got a minor residents
there broad residents around 5 56 k some
folks I've mentioned I snare drums can
sound a little bit hard but overall it's
that it's pretty good it's a little bit
recessed as you as you head up towards
the trouble in that blue between 501k
explain what's going on you know that a
lot of those a lot of the area there
that's that's one of the major titles
one of the reasons like cut that area
off those tend to be ret effects from
the enclosures and it's that data really
is not eerie here you're coming so is
that mechanical vibration is not the cat
the capital residences within the air
yeah idea where this I was it back but
take a look at that that's close cut
phone so you see more of that effect and
these measurements kind of go down much
farther minus 36 that's four decimals
down definitely a a little bit more than
what you see in this very loud magazines
for something pretty deep to see what
the behavior is now how does that work
sometimes i do have six hundreds i don't
have them here just generally generally
what do you see with with the 600 says
there's a little bit there's a lot of
energy with the HD 800 from 5k out the
600 spend to be actually you know what I
don't have to 600 but i have no half
measures for the 650s which are which
are different which we're different with
your different do 720 I actually do have
700 I don't know i will see those or
will see those like I just gotta make
the next one here yeah this is uh that
little dip their that's a measurement
artifact these things happen sometimes
this is uh this is a headphone that has
very very good bass extension it's a
laid back towards the trouble on purpose
the designer of this headphone I assume
probably wanted to create a more speaker
life presentation because you know what
you got speakers in the room a jangle
little way but not blasting your ears
did anyone guess what this might be it's
an open it's an open headphones it's
very clean very very clean there there's
a little bit of hash there around eight
nine k's that is probably now this is
obviously LCD two guys up yeah I just we
don't take measurements the same way
little different the way you do good
most people i put my question is on the
marked on the chart we've got a red and
a green one daniela the two single life
Green is and red is left and left
upright okay and so you got that dip he
says artifact guess so you can disregard
that disregard that okay move the hip
bone centimeter and goes away move the
millimeter a millimeter and goes away or
volume half millimeter it's just it's
just the nature of measurements I think
that was caused by I played tone sweets
and I just couldn't hear it because I
mean I can still hear up there round 12
okay hopefully it kinda said Harrison
right i think was a combing effect from
the move that the microphone you know
that shows so hot pole structure you
know with with headphones uh you know
what i mean by measurement system iowa i
would I wouldn't give it I'd give it
plus minus and why this is sometimes I
might too I'm not too precise with with
with that you know just take it away no
salt but generally kind of headphones I
here within plus minus y you're not
gonna notice it's really really hard to
notice in fact these headphones on and
which one
minus for them or 40 the apartment in
two channels there and the low
frequencies yeah that's love frequencies
when you're waiting from around 500
hurts a little bit of a gap there
move on this one it's very well known it
fell the very popular even right now but
this was a couple years ago open up open
headphone really really fun it's got a
little bit of midday Sun midday stop
very interesting mid-range I guess
guitar players were folks really like
the guitar sound love this headphone a
few years actually it's a great artist
once and my god right after listening to
it's a fashion vintage bus where we show
there's an artifact room for which one
is in part especially our swimmers yeah
this is uh you know what when I started
out I had the artist once but i don't
think i had this particular bottle when
i had the artist once it was 1998 and
back then i believe it had to paint
drivers or something which are based a
little bit closer to the joe raedle
models for much more neutral I you know
these probably can last a couple minutes
before I really think they come up there
a fun have fun and a lot of fun a lot of
guys like them a lot of guys got their
start with with the Gredos I'm even
worked with but they do really well I'm
not too sure what they do well well well
those media see and then I'll exotic we
missed
live in the crash typically I should
have brought the video pulse response
for this it's a very lively very fun
headphone very forward lady just truTV
older style like the old cost pitbulls
that measurements for an old cost letra
stab at fremantle arm and that's that
measures very well so in terms of you
know using the graphs to choose a
headphone is there a way to how to
incorporate graft into your headphone
selection process well I like things
that look like that you know the LCD to
my way things that look like that d HD
I'm sure there is much cleaner they have
frequency response aberrations and again
as I as I mentioned going back to that
first slide in a lyric were the early
stages of headphone development I hope
to see no more better linear distortion
that is you know flatter frequency
response and as I said nonlinear
distortion is very good and a lot better
control with with the residences the
winning these these two are very good
examples I mean they're they're my two
favorite dynamic headphones right now
for a good reason so going back to your
earlier statement moving accurate to say
they perfectly neutral headphone and
that would exist would be that well
his brother Bobby the terms would would
be a wall and some people may not like
perfectly neutral drobo speakers tend to
be slightly dark when you measure them
I've circle how she's feeling you know
you said about her inner image he was so
careful measurement exactly so the
better you get Gail to turn to account
for all the residents of those do that
are not in hearing echoes of they do
feel that you're measuring easily a lot
more a lot better feel when you look at
measure down at me out like round pick
of headphones from now because right now
you're still developing my question is
for Alex another has a pet backward you
said you don't you don't measure like
this you measure a different way
the dummy head no we also then before we
install the driver ends in death poem
because your once you install the driver
and put that cup on your ear it all goes
away it's just one so we measure before
we put the driver into the cup we
measure on an IEC backbone to make sure
our QC is correct and everything is
within our tolerances once that passes
then it goes into the confidence
installed but when you're voicing like
well I can't speak your daughter you
know that's your voices are certain
things that you probably but if you take
that your consumers respond I guess Alex
White House a good inside there because
he's also a speaker military obviously
the Odyssey clerks they kind of other
started designing minorities becomes
that dummy head it's very difficult to
see what's gonna happen because even a
slight a screen position you're gonna
get different rizal he's not yet and
then everybody's here years here are
shaped differently are you are you
looking for certain that everything else
figures on the trade-off right so what
do you like when you're designing your
need for finality is far as imaging thus
far yeah but that's that basic you're
cooking for us we're looking to have the
fastest driver that would possibly can
you imagine item grafts were lit up for
consumer
headphones is I mean you can use them to
check whether or not you like you know
that there was a justification you
liking something but still they put them
on your headless I was going to say
correct ice how I always joke yet about
my hat on important I know if I get lost
in music and forget even that fun but
also for us I think we're the only
manufacturer that sends an individual
graph with each headphone that is made
by us for me there have been many times
I was like why are we doing this i'm
going to set up this because it takes a
lot of time to actually do that just
just send each measurement with the head
home print the measurement put it in
their lineup serial numbers so i picked
the special i was purchased for me yep
i'm joe from super boy it's a reference
it's just a graphical reference of what
that driver did as it was attached to a
dummy head okay so if i said i'm
listening to your home ladies gather in
the mail what channel is off do I just
sit it back to you you said okay you
look at the graph you're comparing I
won't look at the graph will just take
them apart while we re measure the
driver and a loan make sure you're happy
that's really article measure the driver
on the picture or pepper on both so
before it gets installed a a separate
yes
you can't say that because every time we
reposition the headphones on the dummy
had to change in say two minutes yeah
but you've been locked position you can
mark and walking fish doesn't help gotta
go no hot dog there's too many tiny very
tiny yeah kinda be amazed also in terms
of the headphone measurements that we do
with tile those are averages so in
essence Kyle will take position 1 2 3 4
5 padded room together and those are the
VFR specs bc ahead funcom so typically
there's four to six positions in fabric
together and some of us got our specs
that we show that again is got the
perhaps the ultimate way to do it
because you're certain or take
of those anomalies that you're you're
seeing their kind of averaging other but
it turns me being the most even keel
what you do it if I think tov uses his
approach oh my god alex says variables
in the inside of your ear everybody
everybody sigh hear your drum out silica
canal just like we thought we go and try
your luck on everybody has to change it
because you can't get it with it because
you're years older typical it took me
forever to find a great seal for my wife
method of being at a moment she is very
now air conditioned to her attack she
could be working and she literally can't
hear you had walk right up to our region
things that are we on years a lot of
folks will have one tip type of 16 on is
one ear a completely different tip in
the other in circles she might just guys
that I the alacrity true but 15 years so
talk even the gene how natural closure
what happens to the driver where it's
longer than is gone how much research
actually goes into the enclosure
development itself or try to get some
kind of standardization get some outcome
that you want for us it took about three
years to get the pad the way that we
like it so to fit over the year to have
a certain shape that can protect the
sound into the ears I mean it took a few
years for us but it really does the
shape of a pad on the headphone is
really going to affect the way it sounds
yeah it's huge and even the phone that's
used as either I mean we spent a lot of
money and time researching the phone
that we would use to the right amount
push-on place so human that basically
the measurement standards
for me personally I don't put my money
on the measurements even though I do
believe in measurements in an IEC
faculty so as the drivers standalone app
and clean my cup against it I do believe
in those measurements because those you
can get pretty standard you know you can
see a little lot less variation in your
measurements interestingly enough there
are headphone manufacturers of greater
particular who do not take any
measurements they do their headphones
tuning strictly by ear and once they
have the sound that John great oh and
this team like that's it they do not do
any measurements in fact typically the
measurements that you see fredo at
headphone calm or early months of cradle
head from
out there and it's not because John is
anti measurement necessarily just
doesn't think that they really impact
what he does it his shock anyone who's
visited greater at Brooklyn it's
definitely a home considering the size
of that plan it's a homespun operation
for sure mama bird well done sir but
he's w a manufacturer with a very strong
reach the measurements yeah you've got
kind of open the door here as to what
manufacturers are making in terms of how
they sound as opposed to measurements
and I get what you're doing here but if
I can just take maybe two or three
minutes here if you had five hundred
dollars only to spend on headphones what
will each one of you purchase and why
not let you or something I probably try
to find a used LCD to be honest they go
for more leather the webwork way
wouldn't find in a book yeah I'm not
just saying such a cat that but myself
as well I don't know there is don't know
is that maybe I try to get the baby I
try to get my father stacks with 500 but
I'll never happen well for me if you go
a little bit over 500 at 699 there's a
great pointer magnetic
finding called hd500 something really
good headphone in that point of magnetic
style and hi-fi man also makes some
other headphones that are very good as
well but I'd say they g500 his mother
Davis bad about George guy say I also
want to say like for me it's just like
anything else I'd buy you know I came up
in the visceral high-end experience you
know where I like actually touch me you
know i like to make that you know that
emotional connection I got indoctrinated
into headphones by being a DJ and so for
me all the variables matter meaning it's
hard for me to really handle you wanna
sleep you like someone asked me what are
the best half of five hundred dollars
well there's tons of variables that go
into that so if someone asked me you
know what would you recommend a 500
hours the first thing I would ask them
is what style music deal love you know
what what can you not live without what
you listening too often you know what
had ever you're going to be using all
these other variables and then I
approach that you know so consider a
ride here that I have at home and i use
it would be a parent you know that it's
locked in so i take all those things
into consideration from $500 DHD if the
hd500 i agree George I mean it's a
little bit more actually what about the
HD 400 that's you may also need an
answer those as well I thought the
format is it okay oh yes united with you
you know i was buying to actually like
the done on t 2004 349 su a bad can
discontinued but that was interesting
headphone with certain recordings that
had a certain synergy with others
perhaps not not so much but you know
what's that's been major question we get
a bedroom every day it will cause the
day what's the best headphone from that
point on he really had to kind of break
it down just like he's got the same you
have kind of asked books where they're
coming from musical taste is certainly
big butt butt so there's no awareness
are you on the moon where you're you're
listening is it something that you know
how are you analytical list are you
being a more got it just wants a TV kind
of sound you know we can kind of died in
from those perspectives but what what's
the best headphone that's always the
tough question to answer also what are
you plugging it into I would say there's
certainly is something along those lines
and when you listen to a lot of
headphones in a row you know they can't
tend to have I mean I'm not sure how
long focuses audio memory really is some
people argued so nobody second or two
the device will tell you it's a week so
it's always hard to do that that AV
comparison and had it really be an
honest a bee comparison we try to frame
it as such in audio tapes in this head
invisible but to the different volume
settings are so he is the subjective
experience obviously get a headphones
loud out the other your brain can't hide
out that's the better see those needy
comparisons and Stroke give you a little
bit tricky whether you come out to the
booth with some type of headphones in a
row or even you do so I think that's the
same kind of force becomes yes the
relevant food here is good Psychostick
to change it's a great question it's
like going to bestbuy trying to pick out
a TV if you have a large like 50 TVs
you're like that's the one I just have
that experiment really that's not the
one that's trying to say sir question
you guys going to take a oh that we're
advancing technology
the enclosures now we have any air
molded headphone you envision a time
water you could have we spoken closures
where they measure have some kind of
measurement of your ears and then as a
bachelor can give you the inclusion of a
perfect either that it might have
problems be aware headphone to the
certain pressure forces so I own a pair
that was fantastic you know sounded but
it was aliens watching the market hurt
you see somewhere that aligning that
would be the bathroom I see a exactly we
talking about think about four years now
as the personalized measurements and
grasp or for each user as well as
potentially taking 3d models of their
actual site of their face to make real
custom iphone just like they do with the
molds for your face yeah that's it's in
the work sexually but then again you
would think you are going to have going
custom old rules for me to have
completely different missions and the
custom mobile for this crap so these all
those you don't say what we're just
going to throw those measurements out a
window
and because it's still better than
slapping an artist named go that doing
what with the IEM stone we bought
ultimate ears by foot custom in your bed
Jerry saw and believed they just came
out they've announced some new service
where you can actually walk into their
offices at the point set of customized
that the frequency response team to how
you would like it I was it's really more
tailored for us studio interviews at
their office to run yeah the Georgia got
1146 I know if you guys want to do been
where price breaks one doesn't do
experience my life had closer decide
sometimes for a particular market or
global let's set a bike in her simple
like American sample of speakers
preferences shruti idea absolutely like
he just made reference or a certain big
company that attached a big baby artists
to it and they sold a ton of headphones
well when I got a pair of notes to
review when I listen to them were they
as good as my reference iPhones are far
from it but I said look there they
looked at their audience and what their
audience is listening to him and no one
could deny that they we can we can all
improve that big brand they look at
their audience the newer their audience
wanted they knew that they were driving
around heart pumping face that would
rattle you know my mini mine but you
know and it worked you know good or bad
no its business goes totally right is
your right is the guy you know i'ma get
high right through thing but yeah who
would be sitting here with all these
other head put my back into dancin
explode and you know Andy when i
reviewed two solos you know how you and
I laughs I said yet my favorite feature
was the control talks and I use a mess
headset but I said you know what in my
review I said I'd love to tell you what
he's headphones I would love to because
now I'm going to hear from all my audio
friends and I'm nuns but I'm gonna tell
you that they were designed for a
specific audience and work for that
audience and you can't deny that sales
and you're right what happened
additional got his load of fans t-shirt
if we know was the really good thing
happen a pic of minded is dre me as
important to his demographic yet and you
can argue whether or not
vinyl or whatever but all music slide it
makes anybody smile it's like okay I'm
just you're the only information he turn
these kids on to better sound than the
white earbuds my son now stole my uh
disease you started habit we thought
they were cool now is it so what's
better so I like growing growth here
here in the Chimera minister you guys
don't unity is actually the guy
responsible for infiltrating the beats
in the consciousness of North America
was about that trouble a little bit it
has pretty good effect there's not very
much information up there in terms with
national instruments while Liz it sounds
good it just lets you hear the harmonics
gives you at least in the sense of a
more detail or here and what's
interesting is you know Alex obviously
you know this is an American company you
know what do we like yeah you know let's
get some bass hanging up not just
trouble we want some bass so you know I
do feel there's a little bit of that and
what's really interesting is you go back
to the HD Hydra when it was being
developed you know I've heard rumors hey
while you guys been a voiceless
different voice it to to bother European
mark Harry you know when you bring this
over to the US reagan by going to voice
it for the US market and Indiana decided
not to and with many many the the
headphone fanatics I I think there was
only
a little bit bugged out the fact that
the HD hundred wasn't voiced a little
bit more to what Americans like Sir do
to xbox willing to go over latest
content I actually do have all the
stacks headphone measurements this one
in particular is the SRO 7 mark 2.1
thinking here that a little bit it's
definitely a very laid-back headphone
you can see the the lower trouble
permits are recessed very well it
performs very very well the 1k
aberrations there those are definitely
caused by the air pants in the haircut
that's right it seems like when you
listen to head sometimes you hear more
detail you've never heard George people
that's a little now is that real where's
the reception well it'll the resolution
of it
you're really in essence in certain
create headphones here are at that
mastering a recording session on us it's
as close as you can get to being inside
the museum these Tom can't see so we can
mediate Sam I think it is a more
detailed more resolved through the top
headphones I mean like those set before
those $1,500 sennheiser HD 800 or we get
that level of speaker performance you'll
probably be in that 15 to 20 grand
terrain if or so again the bank for the
above there's significant well agent
which speakers reproducing that bitch
getting Washington Post it's part of it
that's part of it but I'll tell you
what's interesting is to your question
has a music reviewer for years I just
relied on by reference system you know
what speaker is my entire my big plan
take system and I noticed recently
thanks to a deluxe you know others who
have really taken my headphone
experience to another level that when I
listen to an album in my reference
system you know obviously I get this
emotional connection which is the most
important thing for me what I want for
any system new headphone or highlights
to just get the hell out of his own way
and connect me and use it but I found
now that when I was into and out of my
system and then my honest mr. Niles on
headphones it's almost like I can tell
when some records are mixed for
headphone listeners because there's so
much transient stuff going on that even
though i have a very resolving system
how to say I do it's almost like now
when I review music i use both where
before i just use the references what if
you had make a choice Lucien speakers
your head from now on just personally
personally to be honest at this point
it's really hard to answer that but
because I'm still of the beta music to
me as a visceral experience meaning i
love having music you know hit me and I
love experiencing that because that's
how I promotionally now with headphones
i can connect emotion but i still prefer
that visceral experience somebody better
headphones now for giving me that same
experience which actually blows my mind
because I never thought I'd
I mean now what I'm hearing with his and
a decent headache you know that it's
blowing my mind so so Ted closer right
had four yet the reference systems but
what else so you don't think it's here
that it was your own you're always in
the sweet spot yeah when you were
missing speakers you have to be the same
spot here absolutely the great thing
about your hair's a little bit then
you're out you know you always want
wearing your head so it's always a sweet
spots and to make some measurements
tomorrow up between speakers drivers and
headphones headphones just have an
amazing low amount of nonlinear
distortion they're just so clean in
terms of being able to capture that
low-level information it's just all
their speakers you know the other the
other issue of speakers they're designed
to really move or move a lot more here
and now you know when you're comparing
miniature devices that are much smaller
transducers that are up here there's
definitely advantages in terms of a
amount of air that needs to be moved to
distortion but i will thanks everybody
for coming to its really kind of fun i
hope you guys enjoyed it what we're
doing it again between 1 and 2 p.m.
tomorrow and we'll help you know all
kinds of different questions and
hopefully a further a decision
