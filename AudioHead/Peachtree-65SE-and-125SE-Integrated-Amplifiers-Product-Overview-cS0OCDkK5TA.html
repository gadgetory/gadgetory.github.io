overview of two new amplifiers from
Peachtree the first is called the Nova
65 SC and the lower one here is the Nova
125 SC these integrated czar brand new
from Peachtree they represent an update
from the current Nova 65 and the current
Nova 125 the SC really stands for the
upgraded internals for these two
amplifiers that are different from the
past generations so the SC has what the
company is calling and continuous kind
of flow from where they were to where
they're going and it's trickle-down
technology from some other higher-end
models that they've been planted in this
series to try to you know spice things
up a bit get a little more lively or
more tight sound so kudos then to keep
the whole train moving forward
specifically the 125 SC is 125 watts
into 8 ohms and then the 65 SC is 65
watts into 8 ohms so that you can see
that's where the naming nomenclature
comes from there's a good amount of
digital inputs as well as a built-in DAC
that peach trees traditionally known for
one of the other things that Peachtree
is known for is the there tube pre stage
that is it allows you to turn it off and
on to your preference a pretty nice
little added feature there so the little
window on the front that you see on
these it can be turned on and off if
there's an LED a blue LED that lights up
to kind of show you if the tube preamp
is on or off and you can either keep it
on or if you're just more of like a
solid-state thing you can see the
difference and turn it off so it's nice
that you could have that flexibility
there
also included in both these amps is a
headphone amp you can see in the lower
right hand corner so you can plug your
headphones directly and as you can see
from the back there's a wider range of
digital inputs that peachtree is kind of
known for their classic into great
should have the analog in the digital
specifically with this we have USB 24
192 input all the way up that direction
also coaxial to optical inputs and also
you know you're straight analog inputs
the true obstacles are nice if you are
looking to hook into more of like a home
theater set up two channels they have
obviously the ps3s and some DVD players
and Apple TV they only offer our optical
digital so you can kind of see where
they were going with this integration as
far as the obstacles are concerned
another cool feature that the peachtree
SCS offer is a set of pre outs so you
can actually ho
connect a subwoofer if you want a little
bit of extra thump on the low end to
these amps and it'll also you know
correspond with the volume change in the
knob a lot of times with the two-channel
it's not always included but the seat
here is very very nice because you can
just add a sub at your leisure if you
want to add it just the very lowest end
so this has been the peachtree novo 65
SC and 125 s see the the 125 is
currently available for 1500 and the
nova 65 SC is a thousand dollars roughly
$9.99 on the company website you can
check out peach trees website for more
details on these and they also sell
direct so have a great one and see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
