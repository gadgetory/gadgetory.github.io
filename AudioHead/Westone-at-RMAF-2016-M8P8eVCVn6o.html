rocky mountain audiences we're out here
in the can damn tent
introducing the new WAV from Western was
really fueled to bring this product to
you it is an eight drivers Universal fit
earpiece that is even smaller than the W
60 which used to be the flagship in our
lives and of course a lot of people have
already read a lot and heard a lot about
the W 60 so one of our goals when
designing this was to improve upon the
high frequency content that the W 60
delivered and I think that we hid it in
a brand new package that has a familial
resemblance because it's Westholme an
ergonomics are ultimately important to
us and the fact that it stays in your
ear ultimately important to us but we
are so interested to and excited to have
heard some of the crowd's reaction to
our new earpiece
we pay particular attention to the high
phases of content
I wanted to increase the harmonic
content so that we could better define
the instrument where it was recorded to
space it was reported in and from the
comments we didn't hear today seems very
well received but of course as I said
organ omits are really important so
Chris who designs everything he makes
all the magic fit inside your ear spend
a lot of time working on how this fits
and how the acoustic paths work and all
that kind of stuff so we've got a brand
new housing here for our WAV which is
even more ergonomic than the W 60 which
we were really proud of we've
incorporated some new features in this
some secret sauce which I'm not going to
talk about but it makes a phenomenal
sounding earpiece and then from my
perspective since I'm the mechanical
designer an incredibly good fitting
earpiece the earpiece not only comes
with different colored Clips excuse me
I'm sorry the earpiece not only comes
with different colored clips but it also
comes with an MFI cable in the box and
then as a bonus there is this wonderful
new cable the hd8 from alo it's a high
silver content cable it sounds
absolutely stunning as a perfect match
with the w80 earpiece not only do we
have this new cable included in here but
we've also got usable print okay
we've also got a brand new case which
was designed to complement the W 80 and
actually enhance the audiophile users
experience with the W 80 so we've got a
ballistic fiber case we've got pockets
we've got cleaning cloths screens we've
got an open spot here this is all velcro
it's completely adjustable and even a
small case like a lifeboat so you could
just take your earpieces with you and
let me show you what the case kind of
looks like in you
so you know so you can you can customize
it to fit your player you can store
extra earpieces in here if you're like
our director of marketing he's got like
one of everything in here you've got a
divider to protect your player you can
put information credit cards money
whatever you want in here and you've
also got storage pockets three storage
pockets so you can store all your cables
and you know like you know whatever you
want to do with this whatever you want
to put in there it's a great new case
and like I say it's designed to enhance
the the use of the users experience with
the earpiece so we're really excited
about the the total whole package here
with the w80 it sounds great oh look at
this is this Manticore one so you really
we really wanted to upgrade musers
experience with this as well
we get this wonderful package all the
goodies come inside and it's a really
cool I think discovery process so we're
really excited about this product now we
had three specs we've had the sound that
it had to fit well at well and then it
had to blow your mind when you heard and
we're really excited thank you guys so
much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
