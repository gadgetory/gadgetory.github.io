Rocky Mountain audiences we're out here
in the can jam 10 introducing the new
wav from west on we're really thrilled
to bring this product to it is an 8
driver universal fit ear piece that is
even smaller than the W 60 which used to
be the flagship in our lives and of
course a lot of people have already read
a lot and heard a lot about the W 60 so
one of our goals when designing this was
to improve upon the high frequency
content at the w 60 delivered and I
think that we hid it in a brand new
package that has a familial resemblance
because it's west home and ergonomics
are ultimately important to us and the
fact that it stays in your ear
ultimately important to us but we are so
interested to and excited to have heard
some of the crowd's reaction to our new
ear piece
we pay particular attention to the high
frequencies of content
I wanted to increase the harmonic
content so that we could better define
the instrument where it was recorded to
space it was reported in and from the
comments were getting here today seems
very well received but of course as I
said ergonomics are really important so
Chris who designs everything makes all
the magic fit inside your ear spend a
lot of time working on how this fits and
how the acoustic paths work and all that
kind of style so we've got a brand new
housing here for our wa d which is even
more ergonomic than the W 60 which we
were really proud of we've incorporated
some new features in this some secret
sauce which I'm not going to talk about
but it makes a phenomenal sounding
earpiece and then from my perspective
since I'm the mechanical designer an
incredibly good fitting earpiece the
earpiece not only comes with different
colors flips excuse me I'm sorry Lee
repeats not only comes with different
color clips but it also comes with an m
fi cable in the box and then as a bonus
there is this wonderful new cable the HD
eight from alo it's a high sober content
cable sounds absolutely stunning as a
perfect match with the w80 earpiece
only do we have this new cable included
in here but we've also got use a friend
okay we've also got a brand new case
which was designed to complement the w80
and actually enhance the audio file
users experience with the w80 so we've
got a ballistic fiber case we've got
pockets we've got cleaning cloths
screens we've got an open spot here this
is all velcro it's completely adjustable
and even a small case like a lifeboat so
you can just take your earpieces with
you and let me show you what the case
kind of looks like in use
so you know so you can you can customize
it to fit your player you can store
extra ear pieces in here if you're like
our director of marketing he's got like
one of everything in here you've got a
divider to protect your player you can
put information credit cards money
whatever you want in here and you've
also got storage pockets three storage
pockets so you can store all your cables
and you know like you know whatever you
want to do with this whatever you want
to put in there it's a great new case
and like I say it's designed to enhance
the the use of a user's experience with
the earpiece so we're really excited
about the total whole package here with
the w80 it sounds great oh look at this
is this magic or what a nice packaging
so you really we really wanted to
upgrade users experience with this as
well
we get this wonderful package all the
goodies come inside and it's a really
cool I think discovery process so we're
really excited about this product yeah
we had three specs we've had the sound
of the federal it it had to fit bullet
well and then it had to blow your mind
when you heard and we're really excited
