today we're showing off a brand new
product for us called Union
it's a coax Driver based on a full range
driver so it uses the nanotech cone high
output motor but on this one we mount
the tweeter right in the center and the
tweeter comes in at 12 K so it's just a
little bit of the sparkle on the top
very efficient so you can run it with
low power or it also is pretty high
power handling so you can if you need to
rock out it'll definitely take care of
it Union it's 2 grand for a pair in
addition to the Union we're also showing
at the show our definition mark 4 which
is twelve thousand seven hundred fully
integrated from bottom all the way
through the super tweeter 101 DB
efficient it's a dome product as well
and this one goes all the way down to 14
Hertz part of the sub assembly on that
is this guy right here which is a 12
inch lab 12 from eminence and then we do
all the machine work at house everything
we do is made in Ogden Utah machining
our drivers are paint our nanotech
coatings you know pretty vertically
integrated as well as we make our own
cable assemblies and harnesses with our
own planetary gear that we use so this
sub assembly that comes out of the
definition is also used in our brand new
submission subwoofer and as you can see
that's that's part of the assembly it's
very similar in size to the definition
but totally different cabinet on the
inside it's it's a very clean subwoofer
it goes down to 12 Hertz with authority
for the amplification on this we mount
all the electronics in a billet case
that we also machine we use the hype ex
UCD 400 amp module and it does have
signal processing so it's got user
controls in the back that allow you to
adjust crossover volume phase infinitely
and it also has parametric EQ and you
can toggle that off so you can bypass
that if you're doing outboard signal
processing and then next to that is the
under tone subwoofer which is 2 grand
and same technology but we strip out the
expensive spot bits so we don't have a
billet case for the electronics we don't
use the billet bass but it does use this
same subwoofer and same hype ex
amplifier
so those are the four three new products
that we have the fourth product that
we're also showing here at the show is
the Union cube which uses the same
10-inch the same 10-inch driver in our
Union but puts it in a form factor that
lets you put this on any bookshelf
desktop car wherever you want to put the
thing it's it's going to fit but it's
also a very high fidelity product gets
you down to about 50 Hertz so for you
know real rock-and-roll you're still
gonna need to make made it up with an
undertone or some other subwoofer this
guy is twelve hundred dollars for a pair
that's about all we got going on for
electronics at the show we're using
Nelson passes new first wat si T
amplifiers ten watts per channel very
good sounding probably my favorite
transistor amplifier a little on the
expensive side but you know you get what
you pay for value wise we have the
peachtree deco 65 which is fully
integrated it's got a DAC in it you can
plug in your computer you can plug in a
turntable with a phono stage and you're
up and running so the system that we're
listening to right now is a technics SL
1200 with an audio mods armed with a Zhu
audio cartridge running into a knk phono
stage and then into the Peachtree
integrated if you want to hear it with
the the first watt easy enough to switch
out run it with the first watt the SI t
ones and let you do some comparison but
I appreciate you guys coming out and I
hope you like what we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
