Polaris here so when I say all you one I
mean only one it is not only a streaming
streamer and a power amplifier it's also
a dag a music server and a priam with
final stage so pretty much a pair of
speaker and one Polaris is all you need
for a complete hi-fi system and it's
available mid next month and it sells
for 3800 so also it takes 17 different
input including streaming and live and
digital inputs so we have one klaris in
black that has the top remove to show
people what it looked like inside and I
will hand it over to our designer and
CEO Shan Shan to explain this is the
inside of Polaris we pack a lot of
technology into that small box here is
his palm to our module we're going to
180 into four oh and 120 into 8 so here
is the analog input port and you can put
25 inch hard drive inside so this is a
slot so you can put it and so the man
board is actually covered by all this
component is here its downside so on the
top of this you can see the linear power
supply and this is our test like Hogwart
doing streaming functions so what the
Wi-Fi card that is AC standard and here
this is n log circle so hopeful packing
all these fantastic functions it's only
got $3,800 it's a very low available in
middle of November cool this power
amplifier module similar to some of the
other amplifier yeah they both from high
tax and very similar to
was am iraq our mama block there just a
smaller power okay that's very cool so
you're truly getting kind of an
integrated experience that is a
combination a coalition of all the
things that you've done previously into
this one small path yeah right sorry
cool do you want you want to talk about
the other piece that you have over here
yeah sure okay actually
yeah right this is actually is a new
iPad version of the lighting India's is
not officially available I wanna have
right now is was the one design back to
about three years ago so we were
redesigned the whole app and it's almost
done it's probably available in just one
month's time okay so the new version is
based on very popular iPhone version
which have got very positive feedback
and this is your local library
and you can go into the you can check
the albums and it also have title
integrations here look and here if you
go into title and what you do we do have
the function is similar like is ruin but
you got a rich metadata management for
example if I go here like this up this
sample here we can see that it is a
Rihanna Szabo and you can see the other
albums from the same artist and you can
we use you can wheel the artists it has
some introductions and a top track and
album and similar artists you also get a
detailed pel graphic of the artist and
there's are some links to the other
artist and album you can click and the
jump to the other one so it's virtually
like very like a room based software
very cool in this particular interface
the software it comes with all of the
streaming devices that you make are they
all is it the same interface for each
device this is actually the same
interface for exactly all of our
streaming device okay very cool
speaking of which I mean did you have
the other stream yeah right
so this is our second decision
this is altar which is probably being
seen quite a lot of times with this
product in the exponent this year and on
the bottom this is a MARAC this is our
model block which I just mentioned it is
very powerful it's 400 volt into fall so
we are using this as a secondary system
driving the rain speakers to show the
technology mentioned that's that's a new
from our latest firmware that updated
throughout all our streaming device
memory cache multi rooms so therefore is
trying to demonstrate here because
you'll see you're hearing the same music
exact same time let's go okay alright
thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
