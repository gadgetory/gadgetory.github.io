can jam la I think it's called can Jam
SoCal and what we have here is the zmf
icon and zmf Atticus this is the paddock
version one thing I do want to make sure
people know this is paddock and the
cherry version it's the lighter color
because I messed that up on the website
but we have the production version of
these are out now that we last showed
you with Brian and audio head at can jam
RMAF and the icon features that bio
cellulose driver the Atticus and
features of poly ethylene driver they've
been pretty popular a lot of people been
really digging the sound of the icon and
Atticus want to bring you over to the
deck where amps here now you'll follow
us and one thing we're gonna do coming
up that's really neat is we're teaming
up with deck we're which is also out of
Illinois and we're gonna offer a zmf
version of both the deck where C sp3 and
a deck we're taboo mark for the CSP 3 is
the OTL version of the deck where amp
and it features a 274 B followed by two
six nine two two stages for the input
and gain stage and it's just a 6000
output it really live-ins up our
headphones because it's got that 300 ohm
output and what we're gonna do with deck
we're with both the CSP 3 and the taboo
is we're gonna put matching bases to the
headphones they're going to have a
little bit of a different shape we're
gonna sell a custom tube that I picked
out for the rectifier and the input tube
there will be a 274 be Western Electric
replica going in there and then the kind
of showcase of the deck where stuff
right now is this taboo mark 4 which
just came out or first people showing it
at audio shows and it's got a lot of
cool features it's got ele 4 output
tubes it's got a deck wears proprietary
lucid mode crossover system which for a
first-time there's an amp that instead
of just having a crossover that's just a
switch you have a dial that controls the
crossover
so you can go anywhere from no crossover
all the way to full-on crossover with a
dial so if you want just a little bit of
that kind of expansive crossover sound
you got it you want a lot of it as well
and it's got dual volume knob so you
want to hear something a little more on
one side you're good to go and the
signal path was really cut down in this
am so it just is such a clean musical
sounding amp definitely my favorite to
vamp of the moment but yeah that's
what's going on at zmf right now and I
was good to see everybody in audio head
land and thank you Brian</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
