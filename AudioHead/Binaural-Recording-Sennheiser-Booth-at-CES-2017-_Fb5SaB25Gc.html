smart surround we have not a final
product name yet but it would be soon
announced so instead of working sample
and we presenting this as a concept car
and this is actually looking like a
standard phone set but in reality it is
a recording device at the same time you
will see behind this this metal mesh
they are microphones integrated which
enable us to do a binaural recording
this binaural recording is the most
natural type of recording you can think
of because it makes use of our
reflections of our ears the distances of
our hats the ears between the hats as
well as shoulder and neck reflections
and so we have a real VT immersive audio
experience when recording with its
devices at the same time we have a
transparent hearing functionality which
enables us to hear and monitor will be
record or to hear better better our
surrounding while wearing this headset
connected is whether I this control unit
which incorporates a ideally a
conversion which is partnered we are
partnering with two together with Apogee
a company well known for its adda
conversion quality and it's connecting
via lightning connector to an iOS device
Apple iPhone iPad or iPod together we do
extremely good recordings on your iPhone
device and can relive and experience and
share your experience you had out most
authentically with all your friends and
family or community so when wearing this
and doing recording you have the most
natural experience and can relive it as
often as you want to and share the
moments
they space exactly the same way so
seeing me now I'm speaking now behind
you while you turn around
and I'm standing next to you
device
