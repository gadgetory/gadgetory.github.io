we have the are 300 bookshelf from Jeff
KEF is the name of the company and
bookshelf is the size these rather
robust pretty large bookshelf style
speakers run about $1,800 so $17.99 and
that's uh not the cheapest speaker out
there but in terms of high end audio
it's not the highest either this
actually kind of lands in between two
other lines the reference line and the
cue line for keffe the our line is their
mid tier speaker line these also come in
variations of floor standards but the
main concept here is a 3-way design that
being there is a concentric driver for
high in trouble called eunuch Yu from KF
and then a separate three-way base
driver that kind of handles the low end
separately so it unlike the LS 50 which
is a very popular bookshelf style
speaker which only has a single unit
cube this one has a separate driver just
for bass you can adjust the the speaker
and wire it separate really for high
frequencies and low frequencies but for
my testing I basically kept it pretty
simple with just the standard hookups as
you would with an average stereo the fit
and finish of these loudspeakers is
absolutely phenomenal it's definitely a
step up from your average everyday
inexpensive one the walnut finish we
have here is a really nice very good
finish and it definitely feels like a
speaker that you pay two thousand
dollars for it's upscale and it's a very
very nice construction and everything
about the speaker says hey you know I'm
not just the cheapest materials out
there in order to make a cheap speaker
it's a high-end speaker it's a high end
speaker company and they do a really
great job for making them
speakers sound great and as well the
construction there are other speakers
out there that cut corners I think but
this is not the case with our 300 in
terms of size they are kind of large for
an actual bookshelf they are a little on
the deep side at over a foot deep but
they really can still do very well in a
kind of studio setting if you have room
to get them away from your computer and
also if you put them on stands and keep
them away from a wall you probably get
the best results if you want to look for
an application in terms of just making
these guys the mains for your to channel
or home theater setup you can definitely
do that as well they're rated down to 50
Hertz so on the on the low end of things
on the sub side they do exceptionally
well in terms of getting some pretty
good depth and punch especially in that
mid bass areas for general listening we
don't need to kind of like subwoofer you
can get it done with a subwoofer they do
get you could add a sub over to the mix
to add a little bit more depth that's
pretty common with a two-channel
bookshelf setup but in my testing these
guys have can really produce a lot of
volume if need be and that being said a
bass at high volumes is pretty intense
so it's not just the kind of a little
puny thing there's body and there's and
there's strength to that low-end there
really comes across especially at high
volumes I did some near-field listening
with these guys as well and in those
terms with dementia ality and the
reality and the placement of instruments
within the mix they felt really good and
articulate and focused in the jig in the
imaginary geographic location of that
they kind of placed within the
soundstage so they were really a fun
lesson at a closed setting as well as a
room filling setting I think personally
that these guys rock out and foot at
full volume in a midsize room they'll
just they will kill it I mean the amount
of output they're capable of you could
even do a large room but if you're
turned about you know sighs more you
don't want a huge floor standard that's
kind of where the bookshelves really
shine so they're wonderful little
recommendation I think for that size if
that's kind of where you're looking to
go in terms of overall sound these
loudspeakers are feel extremely balanced
and they don't have an emphasis
particularly in any one direction they
do offer as an exceptional addition with
a foam plug that allows you to kind of
adjust the base so the foam plug
obviously you put it in the back if it's
close to a wall that's a great chance to
put that in there because the base can
get big as it comes out the back through
the porthole but you can also take out
the core of the plug and it'll give you
another level another diameter to play
with and in my experience testing these
I actually found that to be quite useful
there was a situation where I thought
the base was a little bit big I could
regulate it very well with the plug in
at a certain volume at lower volumes I
found it to work better with the plug
out completely and I got a more balanced
presentation in any case it feels
balanced across the spectrum but with a
plug you really have a kind of a chance
to fine-tune the experience and from a
varied amount of setups that I tested
these out in it really came in handy so
that's a great little add-on and
something to think about while you're
adjusting these guys for your for your
stereo in your room so these are there
are three hundreds from keffe bookshelf
style part of the our line and it is a
great little thing I highly recommend
you guys give these auditions if you're
into bookshelves you into this size and
the price point isn't too far of a
stretch for you you really start to see
you know where high fidelity gets a good
good grip on on audio at this point
higher fidelity as we're all kind of
looking for I think so
is that a nice extra shelf that kind of
break through that barrier and get you
to the next level which is really fun
