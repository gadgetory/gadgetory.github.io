have the Estelle and Kern J H Jerry
Harvey audio Lela Universal fit in ear
monitors it's quite a doozy of a product
it's a flagship piece the newest latest
and greatest from Jerry Harvey kind of
encapsulating all of the technology and
efforts he's had thus far before we dive
into the details I definitely want to
let you guys know that this particular
set of earphones runs around $2,500 so
it is one of the most expensive pieces
of in ear monitor ever made on top of
that it's you know really really really
high up there with just headphones in
general full-size and the like so it's
very very expensive piece the good news
is however that it sounds pretty darn
good if I have to say so so what does
this thing this beast creation really
look like has four times three drivers
per ear that's a quad drivers one for
mids one for highs and one for lows in
addition to that it also allows you to
adjust the bass inline in the cords so
there is a frequency adjustment for the
bass as to how much you kind of like
right built into the chord that's
adjustable by a screw driver so that in
and of itself is unique and also very
helpful because the thing with in-ear
monitors is that they sometimes get a
little bit funky when it comes to other
Mountain the client ease of bass now the
seal on your ear matters a great deal
these being universal fit you have to
get the right tips that work for you and
the tips do change the response
foam tips silicone tips big small double
flange I have found small variances in
the frequency response and other things
in changing out the tips so get the
right fit so you can get the base where
you want it but on top of that there's
another layer on this particular part
that lets you pump it up or draw it back
now that being said I actually found
myself with these headphones I like it
just a little bit more not a lot more
this the amount of bass in ears is often
even with a lot of the audiophile ones a
little bit exaggerated a little bit
bigger than what I'd like to consider
neutral even just a little boost at full
that is all the way turned up bays I
found them to be really fun sounding
perhaps a bit north of neutral but still
really really good really really good
presence and the amount of bass there so
not really something that you'd want to
do in terms of like monitoring or if
you're really into a neutral sound but
you can just back it off so you can turn
the dial down I'd say all the way down
it's very very based light but the range
that he chose from you know zero to max
is a good range and it tops out I think
in a very very good sweet spot for bass
the main vibe for these things is
clarity and an out a sense of out of
your head playing for an in-ear monitor
there's a huge deal the the sound is
generated so inside your ear canal
doesn't have the outside of the ear to
kind of bounce around and give a sense
of reality or even just sense of air
it's like in your head so to get that
idea that it's like outside of your head
even just a little bit more is a really
big deal for in-ear monitors jerry has
been tinkering quite a bit with phase
and he has a product freak phased kind
of element to a lot of his headphones
that he's been working with and I think
you know if I had to say anything from
all the inners that it does have an
impact on that out of the head
experience and the cohesiveness in the
in the
tightness of the imaging which is
something adding another level with
these headphones there on another level
they kind of leave all the others behind
in terms of clarity and staging in that
out of your head experience which I've
already talked about so you know and and
I not in terms of frequency response and
that and that sort of thing they're very
tight as well mids are good the treble
is good and all of it is very balanced
from top to bottom which has not always
been the case with them within years
there can be very difficult to kind of
tame and maintain on the top end as well
so these kind of do a really nice
cohesive sound across from bottom to top
now this specific model that we have
here is sold by Estelle and Kern the
people who also manufacture the high-end
audio players like the 8k 240 the AAA
120 and they also have another high-end
flagship that just came out and what you
see here is actually a balanced cable
that connects to those players that
screws into the earpiece the connection
the cable itself is actually a kind of
an interesting custom connector it may
be used in a couple of other ear pieces
but it's it's somewhat rare for in-ear
monitors it's got a four pin screw type
connection that's pretty secure when you
get it on there even feels a little more
watertight than the traditional kind of
two prong connection that gives you a
little more flexibility when it comes to
the dry it drives the individual drivers
separately so that's how essentially you
get the base adjustment for only the
bass drivers or you could potentially
you can have mid and treble drivers be
separate in that case so as a whole one
of the best if not the best sounding
in-ear monitor I have ever heard on many
levels for many reasons including
obvious
balance with adjustment to the base
excellent smooth treble not overdone
nice rich mids and a fun robust
adjustable base and it gives you pretty
much exactly what you'd want provide
wide range of people all really were the
good things all pretty cool
technological advancements on a
relatively small niche arena very cool
stuff you know some of the cons for
these headphones probably would be just
really two points one the expense is
very high at $2,500 you could buy a lot
of really good gear for that but if
you're into the best this is pretty much
you that's designed for you know market
for that mind people who want the very
best so like I said number one it's
pretty expensive number two they're
quite large the carbon-fiber housing
sits outside of the ear pretty much it
hangs a little bit it doesn't quite go
fit completely into your the the outside
inner let's say part of your ear as some
my or custom fit jerry harvey sells
these directly as a custom fit which is
usually the way to go
although i would like to point out if
you do a custom fit its it affects the
resale value these guys you can sell
them if you get tired to want the next
best thing much easier than a pair of
customs because you know obviously
someone can just buy them straight from
you without having to fiddle with all
that other stuff so basically aside from
that right now there's very little else
to criticize these guys for because they
are just so sweet and so nice really
robust kind of feel all-around good
hearty thing and a really fun fun albeit
expensive piece to listen to let me know
if you guys have any other questions
this is the Jerry Harvey sold by
Alliston current universal fit Layla's
one little fun piece of audio no doubt
thanks a lot have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
