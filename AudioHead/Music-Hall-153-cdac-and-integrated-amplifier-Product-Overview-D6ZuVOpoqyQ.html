some really amazing audiophile budget
components here by music hall they're
kind of a matching pair as you can see
the first one on top is the c-dac 15.3
DAC CD player and on the bottom is the
matching a 15.3 integrated amplifier now
these two items run roughly 550 dollars
each so they kind of land right in that
sweet spot of audiophile budget the CD
player on the top actually functions as
a DAC as well with full optical coaxial
and USB imp input into the back so it
really doubles up just like the Oppo 105
bdp does which is you know kind of an
unusual thing at this price range you
don't see I said it's literally a deck
combined with a CD player the deck does
192 and 24-bit it's a Wolfson DAC the
amplifier has a full 5 inputs in
addition to a phono stage for those
vinyl spinners out there included is
also a headphone amplifier and a
separate line in right here for an iPod
or any other type of input you'd want to
do in the front I think it's a very
interesting proposition with this and I
really enjoyed the build is outstanding
on these just kind of the same quality
you'll find in even a higher price
component the knobs are all great this
is a digital kind of readout here at the
top these lights light up blue as the
volume goes up I really enjoyed that
good design there we really start to see
a lot of value of these components is
when you dive into the feature set
that's a cut that accompanies the
the deck on top is a CD player and a DAC
with multiple inputs I you'd be
hard-pressed to buy those two separately
and still get to performance level it's
really just a really tight all-in-one
kind of unit that you can flip through
CD player deck whatever so it's like a
nice switching digital hub at the top
excellent value and the amp as well just
includes like a nice round of inputs
line in phone headphone and head for an
apple fire your you know $1,000 and
you're ready to go a great point of
entry if you're looking to take a dive
into you know an audiophile
