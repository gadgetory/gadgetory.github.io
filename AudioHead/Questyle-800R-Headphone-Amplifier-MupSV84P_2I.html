the Q style CMA 800 our amplifier that
retails for around fifteen hundred
dollars so it's a little bit on the
higher end but the good news is it has a
little bit of a higher-end sound too
it's a very pleasant sound it has two
dual single-ended large headphone jacks
as you can see on the front here the
somewhat peculiar thing about this
amplifiers that it actually requires two
amplifiers to do true balanced input so
what you see just to the left of the
volume knob there on the far right is a
3 pin single ended connection you would
have to double stack these up throw down
the additional cash for two of them and
then you would run one channel into each
amplifier and out to your headphones in
a similar fashion this would require
just a smidge more legwork and that
you'd have to adjust the volume pot for
each channel so it's a little bit more
work and obviously the price tags a
little bit higher the good news is is
with this amp the single-ended is
actually quite exceptional I found
almost all of your standard kind of
evaluate evaluation characteristics to
be fully fulfilled on this being good
bass extension nice slam excellent
articulation detail high-end extension
nice dynamics so very very well-rounded
easy to listen to amp with very little
frequency colorization or even external
kind of color to make that make the
texture sound more fantastical than it
is it just has it all there playing for
your ears to hear now where it becomes
truly a great amplifier at least in my
opinion is this is the sparkle is the
energy is the realism that really just
conveys a nice fun to listen to sound
that is more energetic and more lively
than a lot of other amplifiers out there
we
out being colored so it's a nice middle
ground a nice perfect marriage of a
couple of things that make it sound
exceptionally good so as far as head
amps go this is one of the good ones
that are out right now I'm I am giving
this one my full recommendation I think
it's quite exceptional
for a head amplifier in general and even
though it was a surprise to me I didn't
know what to expect with this I think
that the outside casing could it's not
the sexiest thing out there there are
more fancy designs and things of that
nature but with this amplifier it's
simple stylings just I mean they don't
even compare it to what's inside the
current mode technology at distinct out
there they might be onto something
special with it because I really like
the way this thing sounds even through
the single-ended inputs so definitely if
you're in the range for head amplifier
in the 1500 range this is a must
audition if you're in if you're into
that they do show up at audio shows if
you want to get a live sample I've seen
them across the country in different
areas so they are out there and there's
an opportunity to get to listen to them
if you can get to a major city but I was
like I said before I was pleasantly
surprised with this one and I'm I think
it's a great little headphone amp and I
recommend it have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
