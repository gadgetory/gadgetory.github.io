loudspeaker review and the subject of
today's focus will be the sole mk2 by
Zhu audio it's a full range driver
system you can tell by one large speaker
drives most of the sound out of this
there's no additional sub woofer
included on this pair there is however a
coaxial tweeter
embedded in the middle kind of tricky so
that drives just the very top end maybe
12 Kayne above for the sound for these
speakers so basically most of it the
voice the bass and everything comes out
of the big one it was just a little bit
of like a sparkle on the top from the
tweeter in the middle as you can see
these speakers are actually not super
large they're for a full sized speaker
obviously a bookshelf is a little bit
smaller but for a full size they come up
to about just a bit lower than my hip so
they're a little bit smaller than the
company's entry-level product called the
zoo omen which stands just a little bit
taller also a full range driver setup
however the tweeter is located
separately right underneath the full
range driver with that speaker the sole
mk2 here starts around 2 grand now they
start a little bit higher but the prices
that you come down on them for 2 grand
what do you get what's a step up from
the omens and really with this speaker
it's all about the clarity the
transparency the way it relays
information from the original according
is just really fine the the accuracy is
very very fine and it's a jump up
it's definitely jump up so if you're
looking for more clarity which a lot of
you guys are this is essentially what
you
get for making that move up the product
ladder overall I found these to have a
slightly treble forward signature so
there's a little bit more on the high
end then some of the other speakers I
had on hand if you're really into home
theater may want to consider adding a
separate subwoofer if you really like a
lot of low end Rumble to your to your
listening they have good bass I think
it's very tight and accurate across the
board coming from the bass through the
mids like I said the the treble and the
details extra extra fine on these so
very nice kind of curve as far as
frequency is concerned I think if you're
into classical music and jazz these may
very well be your cup of tea
I think they fit very very nicely around
things that are vocal centric as well
they would also work great in a home
theater setup as the front two channels
if that's something that you're looking
for you know aesthetics are always a
matter of taste but for what it's worth
I very much enjoy the stylings and and
the external look of these loudspeakers
the the black on white chrome I think
really pops well and it looks classic
without being too overbearing all great
points they also zoo also offers a huge
selection of finishes some for an
additional charge but some even of the
base models have great color a blue red
this is the standard ghost black that
you see here what as I said I bleak
styling of these is pretty fun too
I just think that they look good there
there's very much understated but when
you see them you kind of notice them and
it's classic it's a nice classic look so
this is the zoo sole mk2 every tales for
around 2 grand it is a very nice
loudspeaker if you're looking for a full
range full size loudspeaker in that
arena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
