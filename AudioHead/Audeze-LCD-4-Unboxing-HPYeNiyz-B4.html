edition of unboxing at audio head today
we have the LCD for the brand new a
high-end flagship from Odyssey and we're
one of the first people have it so we're
very very excited to have this puppy in
house and unboxing just giving you guys
a quick starter shot here at the top
this is what it looks like when you open
the box up just open the top here but
this will be a fresh unboxing compares
to the LCD 3 the box is slightly
different it looks a little more robust
actually but it is still that travel
case style so it looks like here we have
the initial wrapping paper and then some
protective foam here on the sides the
case itself
like I said feels pretty robust it's got
foam padding on the sides a custom
cutout underneath here let's see if we
pull this tab I'm guessing something's
underneath here this is a plastic style
material we have some card information
including the model and the serial
number and I was just inspected by thank
yous I'm not sure I'll have to open up
this card to see there's a foil stamp
thing and then it looks as though we
have a blue single-ended cable with the
mini XLR jacks and this cable feels
pretty fun this is definitely more of
your kind of audio file style
cable with a nice heavy rubberish
sheathing so aside from the thank-you
card with the serial number
and the model and signature the package
includes this sealed envelope with the
warranty documentation and a small user
manual take the headphones out of the
cellophane you'll notice right away the
build of these headphones is always very
very sound it has been with lc3 and all
their lines but the step up on this the
difference really
aside from for some very special
editions on the LCD threes and even
maybe some of the on the LCD eggs they
never had this type of chrome work so if
you see here on the grill it's a very
shiny chrome has a really nice kind of
gloss chrome Sheen texture to it and
then the signage is even more visible
because the Sun it's black on the chrome
the emblem here on the side is a little
more prominence than last time around
it's late in there and this carbon fiber
headband split band up here near the top
the band itself feels further light
obviously LCD the LCD line hasn't really
made isn't made for like the extreme
mobile consumer that's what their ela
tis kind of designed for a little
lighter clothes back and open back
variations this is the audiophile phone
so the weight is still quite substantial
but as with the other models in the LCD
line the generally used and intended to
for really really high-end listening at
the home while you're sitting in a chair
and so forth probably wouldn't want to
work out in these but and also the at
least with this model these had ear pads
feel really good like legit top-end
leather the texture is very very nice so
pretty much exactly what you would
expect from something in this price
range
terms of build in the feel and and in
each of those sort of things it's it's
very high-end across the board they feel
extremely sturdy and having some
experience with this headphone in this
previous iterations the design overall
design tends to work out pretty well
it's not as super fancy as some
different design and engineer elements
have tried it's it's pretty standard in
terms of how it suspends it on your head
however you know the incorporation of a
lighter headband in this carbon fiber
that's a little bit of a deviation but
still a nice leather nice wood and I
would have to say the chrome is a just a
stunning addition really kind of gives
it a little even more luxurious look and
feel to it so this is the LCD for
unboxing video should be hitting the
market very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
