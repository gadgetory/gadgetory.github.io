special unboxing of the echo box
titanium medal of the stars the finder
x1 these are titanium shelled a pair of
in-ear monitor earphones which is pretty
cool and we're very excited to get this
this puppy open and unboxed for you guys
to show you what's involved with it this
is part of a IndieGoGo campaign that
just kicked off a couple of days ago so
if you're watching this in a timely
fashion of sorts you should be seeing
this while the program is still alive
should be live for another month the
package you see here is still wrapped in
the cellophane which is why it's kind of
like a diluted white film over the top
because that's just from the reflection
of the light but it is packaged together
in a nice small little compact box also
Silla fan raps so let's get this guy on
unraveled and see what's inside once you
remove the cellophane you can see that
the box opens and slides out from the
top or the bottom here inside is a
another kind of packaging that needs to
be addressed let me just slide the top
off here now as you can see this is a
universal fit in ear monitor comes
complete with silicone tips and double
and triple flange tips at the bottom
this package will also include a set of
foam comply tips in the final retail
package you'll also notice here that the
package comes with three sets of
adjustable filters which give you more
of a normal base preference or a treble
preference that you can swap out by
adding these little filters over the
edges of the ear tips if you remove the
internal box from the outside shell you
will find your standard-issue product
manual and worn
jacquard pamphlets inside hidden beneath
the back panel here there is also a nice
leather-bound carrying case for the
earphones that you can drop right in
with the filters if you want it has kind
of a nice mesh pouch that you can put
them in it holds everything nice and
tidy the in-ear monitors themselves have
a really nice feel to the the cable
that's attached and there's a kind of a
specialty connection going into the
earphone specifically to kind of help it
keep from getting worn down too much and
you know it fray and broken so that's
kind of cool
the titanium shell is really interesting
on these they feel extremely durable and
they're not too big that's a huge a nice
cone shape you know most of this thing
is really the tip that you apply to it
that goes in your ear the back is is
nice compact it feels very very durable
like tiny little bullets almost in your
ears that'll last hopefully a you know
very very long time the cables are also
terminated in your standard headphone
jack that will plug into any device
including the company's own digital
player as I said before the Explorer x1
is part of an IndieGoGo campaign from
echo box that is launching right now
it started on November 16th and it's
gonna run for 30 days retail on the
finder is going to be $1.99 but it's
actually starting at 79 on IndieGoGo
right now the Explorer will be for $4.99
retail that is the flash shaped digital
player that's they're offering in
conjunction with this and that will
start at 250 on IndieGoGo in combination
if you want to pick up the Explorer and
the finder those will start at $2.99 but
I believe most of those have sold out
already for like the pre-order perk
however if you get on there now I think
you can get it for around 360 to 340
somewhere in there
the combinations are both there's a
pretty significant discount on either
side of things if you go with the
IndieGoGo campaign if that's something
you're looking into I'll put a link to
the campaign in the description of the
YouTube video so you can click right
over there if you want to see how things
are shaping up and what's still
available thanks for checking out the
video everybody and again this is the
finder x1 titanium universal fit in here
monitor from echo box with an IndieGoGo
campaign live right now go check it out
