today we have the al alo
audio RX MK 3 B headphone amplifier all
the letters make it sound better anyways
unboxing and review for you this is the
box comes well packaged was the amp here
plastic good finish I'm gonna set that
down just go through the rest of the
contents real quick some instructions
underneath charging some of these things
to help you attach it to another
headphone amplifier if you so desire
I'm sorry another probably they offer a
a algorithm DAC rhythm deck which you
can attach to is the cipher labs
algorithms solo is roughly the same
shape and size of this so you can
actually stack the two together with the
bands that they provide it's gonna have
a nice on-the-go rig I'm sure so if you
guys are aware this thing's roughly
about the size a little bit bigger than
a deck a deck of cards this one in
particular does have something special
it has both single and it as you can see
and balanced inputs and outputs so that
definitely is something new I believe
there's only a couple other amps on the
market right now that do offer that kind
of versatility you can see here in the
back there's a switch that goes from the
single-ended to the balanced the
connector charger nine volt here plugs
right in the back while let's lit this
single LED light lets you know when it's
charging when it's done then while you
turn it out and it's also got a blue
indicator here
is the single ended output balanced
upward here and then the amplification
medium lower high here no the best bass
knob here as I've noted on my blog the
basement Nam is kind of unique for this
particular amp it's not as dramatic as a
lot of other bass effects you generally
are it's very subtle it's not bad in
fact it's quite pleasing I do feel that
it's a little more color than just
straight bass when I'm my turn the knob
up I feel like a the mids are affected a
little bit I wouldn't go so far as to
say that trouble is affected but it's
definitely an interesting mix that's
much different than a lot of bass other
bass amplifiers that are out there so
you really don't the main push doesn't
happen until so their end you can listen
to this thing all the way up and it's
not over overly bassy I think it's very
subtle it's very good though I like it
it's an interesting mix a different
change you know I prefer it at about Oh
seventy five percent or fifty if you
really want to boost it up though it's
not too much do it a hundred percent
interesting different you know just as
you still a great amp without any any of
the bass but you can you know color to
taste the finish is good it feels well
built there is definitely some way to it
feel it feels like it's filled with
things but um finger prints on the
finish are a little more noticeable than
some of the other ones as you can kind
of see but still I like the the feel
that it's good it's a decent size so
there's something at work or something
you actually want to take on the go if
you're on an airplane this this thing's
pretty spectacular it does retail for
around 650 currently so it is one of the
more higher priced amps out there as far
as the sound is concerned it is
extremely extremely well represented the
bass is good it's very smooth one of the
things I did notice on some of the harsh
or treble recordings that I have it
really the kind of smooth those out
there wasn't nearly as much really
high-end tweak enos to them I'll just
say that and the overall presentation is
is very very true that I really enjoyed
it
I think the bass the bass knob is great
this is like a great step in the right
direction as far as bass is concerned
because a lot of bass can is grossly
owed over represented and not done quite
well so it is for an audiophile
perspective this is kind of a nice way
to add some body to it aside from that I
really find that the sound be very clear
it is one of the top horrible amps that
I have ever heard especially for the
size and the fact that it is a
completely solid state amplifier I
really I really enjoy this I highly
recommend it for someone who wants the
best obviously price tag isn't for
everyone however I think it you know it
works it works well if you combine this
with one of their nice decks you're
gonna have one of the best you know kind
of portable rigs available to market
today all good things
great amp hope these guys keep coming
out with new stuff because they they
keep they keep bringing it I'll put it
that way so if you've any questions feel
