monster cable here today to talk to you
about some of our new and classic legacy
headphones today so check it out right
can jam here right here I got our creme
de la creme top-of-the-line copper
turbine pros these things are amazing
very flat response very great for in-ear
monitor quality reference headphones you
can check out just seeing the accolades
of these things they're beautiful don't
mix an album without these things
they're beautiful i love them if you
want to go something a little more
musical something that you want to
listen to have a good time hear your
music like it's never been heard before
check out the Gold's a little more
musical not as good for a reference
quality you want to listen to a track
you're mixing an album you want to hear
someone mess up on the track you'll hear
it with the coppers you'll hear a little
more music a little more forgiving on
the Gold's down the line here we have
our parole line of the turbines a little
more tuned towards pop music towards RMB
higher vocals very very good stuff there
there are base model the turbine blacks
like a subwoofer in your ear in your ear
very fun very good sounding headphones
going to blow you away moving on we have
our Miles Davis trumpets these are some
of the most musical instrument in
earbuds I've ever heard great for
replicating jazz the tones brass the
tones of saxophones of trumpets worked
very closely with a Miles Davis
foundation with his family with his band
with Sony records to replicate and to
make his music her like it was supposed
to be heard moving down the line we have
our gratitude worked very closely with
the band earth wind and fire as well as
our engineers and our CEO Noli to
replicate the sounds of a live band Eric
Clapton earth wind and fire jimmy
buffett fun stuff that's really really
acoustic and warm you know the fingers
on the strings of guitar is that bass
player using a pic is using his fingers
you were to hear that with this breaking
into our sport models we have our i
sport headphones here coming down with
the original the immersion and these are
great we saw we saw a need in the market
we saw need people were going to the gym
they were listening to headphones that
were just you know I'm gonna go for a
run I've got a crappy pair of ten dollar
headphones are going to break anyway
well monster we believe that life is too
short to listen to bat headphones so we
came up with
I sports customized clips that fit in
your ear instead of over your ear
optimum for if you're gonna wear glasses
or goggles different size tips it's
going to fit in and get that great seal
going for you light as a feather but
tough as nails with omnidirectional tips
those are going to move with you instead
of against you totally sweat proof
totally washed proof tosses in your
washing machine with your gym clothes
after you're done they're going to sound
great they're going to last for a long
time we have the different models of
those as well the I sport us a limited
edition the original black we have blue
as well the new I sports that had yet to
hit the market they should be hitting
very soon called the intensities we
developed a couple brand new patents
specifically for this model that allow
in the music to be heard beautifully
into your ear but all still out ambient
noise if you're running on that trail
you hear someone's behind you if you're
running on a street you're biking
letting them at ambient noise while
still not cutting any audio fidelity
right now to some of our over ears we're
very excited about our monster DNA
headphones as you can see they come
pretty loud awesome colors not only to
become an easy you can customize online
at monster products com very clear very
resonating very light polymer headphones
these are great stuff for more the
fashion oriented we have the diamond
tears and partnership with jyp the
Korean superstar as you can see those
things are absolutely beautiful very
clear great headphones edgy like
diamonds smooth like tears moving on we
have our inspiration these are going to
be V for the active noise cancellation
headphones for the business travel that
doesn't doesn't just want to sound good
wants to look good as well fashion is a
big big aspect as well as comfort they
sound amazing they feel amazing you can
bring in different I'll headbands

outfit very much so we come with an
active model and a passive model for the
more audio purist all right we're here
