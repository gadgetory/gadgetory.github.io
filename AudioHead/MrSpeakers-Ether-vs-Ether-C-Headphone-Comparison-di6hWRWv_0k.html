as still hard on head five we are down
here at the source AV Design in Torrance
California for the second event in what
is being called the summer series 2016
it's basically an excuse to get a bunch
of people down here and listen to good
gear and have a real community you know
get together and we're doing a series of
topics all summer long this event is the
mr. speakers ether versus ether see
comparison people will get a chance to
listen to both headphones and see what
they think they're tuned a little bit
differently and some people just
generally end up preferring one over the
other you know we went up to people
after they had a chance to listen to
both headphones and we asked them you
know what do you think of the ether
versus the ether say I like the ethers
more I like the the midbass but I did
think the ether sea was pretty good
because they had a lot more detail my
opinion I think the open back sounds
better than the clothes back it's a
little bit has a bigger soundstage
sounds a little bit warmer the clothes
back sounds a little clinical to me I
think I prefer that either see actually
they both have their clerks but the
ethers are probably better for like
country or jazz and stuff and then the
ether sea are probably better for
electronical music they have more sub
bass in my opinion and then more
soundstage they're a little harder to
drive but I just like them better
okay well you know originally when I
first heard the ether I thought that was
the most amazing headphone made and then
I heard the Seas the real thing when you
listen to the hood to them you see if
you go from the Seas to the standard
ethers it's not a small small going from
the ethers to seas you get into the Seas
see Sir tighter a little better bass
lower extension more natural mid-range
so if I just had the ethers I'd be
perfectly happy with it they're a
phenomenal headphone but in comparison
to the seas the seas are just
that much better I prefer the ether like
the more open sound stage it was I feel
like the difference between the ether
and ether see they're very close in
sound signature but the probably big
difference is like the ether I would say
is like more mid Basie and the ether see
is more sub AC so I just kind of prefer
the more big bassy sound honestly more
of the ether see but a thorough pin' was
pretty good too just didn't really care
for the highs I thought for actually I
thought they were pretty close but for
an Oakland I'm not a big open back fan
but I did like to open back a little
better than the seeds which I was pretty
shocked because I thought because most
of the open backs I tried
they sound brighter than the closed back
and I was really surprised that the open
back the ethers sounded a lot better
well maybe not a lot better but to me a
little better than the clothes back the
Seas so yeah you know I was prize</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
