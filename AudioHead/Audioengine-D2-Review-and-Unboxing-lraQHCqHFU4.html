audio engine d2 wireless deck and
streamer device as you can see from the
picture here it has sending unit and a
receiving unit here so you can wet it
wirelessly streams high-definition music
and audio files from the convenience of
your computer through a USB port or
speed if optical so we're gonna do a
quick unboxing here and we'll get right
to it
it comes in two super boxes as you can
see the first of which has the sending
units this is it here some literature
external power supply standard cord
there's a bag here
fits the unit not too bad and then it
kind of does come with a pair of RCA
cables sending unit as you can see here
it has a power pairing button in case
you guys get disconnected it also has a
volume knob and an optical this is an
optical input actually in case you
wanted to send something digitally and a
USB import input excuse me that also
powers the unit which is very handy but
in case you want to use the speed if you
could part from a separate wall wart
right here as well so in actuality this
thing does have a couple of different
functionalities to it aside from just
streaming as you can see here it does do
speed if USB to speed if conversion but
also will you know just send this
regular speed if and then be a regular
deck as well volume knob pretty heady
not too big as you can see it's a good
size like the size of a sandwich
basically a nice metal sandwich
the second box here contains the sending
unit in this box we have wonderful
christmastime
another power supply here another bag
think this is the USB cable it comes
with give you a better shot of that it's
again same size as the other other unit
basically here's the optical output and
then the analog and same power power
supply and the pairing button when I set
this thing up it was very very easy no
additional kind of software of course
was didn't really have to put any extra
software and you didn't have to really
do anything it didn't not even have to
hit this pairing button to get it
started if I plugged it in and that
thing was ready to go so that was really
cool I am did find that call it be
pretty good I mean I I compared it
directly today I don't walk outs of all
my squeeze box which is you know a very
comparable product in the way of
streaming and but that one does require
additional software load on your
computer since this one goes straight
into the USB port it's pretty convenient
and runs just you know simply all all in
any of the applications I shouldn't on
your computer that you could want so
that's pretty awesome I think it's
really versatile in that way more so
than the squeeze boxes as far as the
qualities and certain I did feel at this
this particular unit had an upper hand
to the squeeze box quality through the
analog outputs so a big plus for that if
you were looking for something for this
type of solution where your wireless
streaming is an issue and that's what
you want to do you know I highly suggest
you guys kind of check it out because
it's pretty versatile it has you know
the quality is definitely there
I didn't notice like a pretty good
clarity difference between the squeeze
box and of course the clarity kind of
lends itself more to the realistic sense
the vocal presence was much more
realistically represented I feel like
and you know adds well
three-dimensionally quality to the music
when the resolution is there you know
it's like see
I've seen through a window and then you
like wipe it off and it's clearer and
you'd even know that you know it wasn't
as good as before but now that you see
things much clearer it's kind of that
same thing clearing off the window but
you know with an audible kind of
response so that being said this is a
pretty great product I really enjoyed it
I think the quality is there for an
audiophile level transfer a does retail
for around $600 so it is more than the
Squeezebox costs out of the box but you
know I'm seeing more and more mods
available for the Squeezebox to kind of
up the outside output quality so I do
think that a lot of people are kind of
get its feeling the same way about the
squeeze box without the output for the
analogs could just be you know a tick
better than it is and this definitely
already has that out of the box so
that's a great plus to this thing like I
said plug and play go this thing fires
up so easily handles everything on your
computer so if you wanted to Pandora or
even like higher end streaming services
and of course this thing goes up to
24-bit 96 doesn't that go to the full
but it does do it definitely does the
high res stuff so anything you download
from HD tracks or any of that good stuff
that you rip yourself or should work up
to 96 across the USB port and the speed
up here so it's it's a pretty cool
device I'd recommend checking out if
this is something this is like one of
the few solutions available for high res
high quality kind of transfer that way
so I mean before you obviously get into
the price points where it's just cos
astronomical I think that this is like a
good middle ground if you're looking for
a high quality device that you know fits
your bill with the limited choices you
kind of so if you guys get a chance
we're gonna have a lot more products
coming down the pipeline so feel free to
subscribe to the audio head Channel and
you can also check out the full review
at audio - head comm and if you have a
question feel free leave in the comment
section the video thanks a lot guys
