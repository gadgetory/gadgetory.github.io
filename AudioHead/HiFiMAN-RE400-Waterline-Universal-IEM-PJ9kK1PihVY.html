audio had coming at you with a new
review we have a high five man re-400
waterlines here they are an in here
monitor style Universal fit you can see
here that I have some soft foams on them
right now and in the forefront here if
we can get it in focus you can see that
there's also some more rubber size
double flange tips there for those of
you familiar with the site you'll know
how often I try to stress the importance
of a good fit with the tip of a
universal in-ear monitor the the fit is
everything if it doesn't fit good if you
don't have a good seal it can affect
bass it can affect a lot of different
things negatively so getting the right
tips is paramount
getting that fit right really important
so now that that's out of the way I'll
actually get on to the re 400s here as
you can see the re for hundreds I have
an aluminum aluminum housing and they
feature a eight point five millimeter
titanium coated diaphragm that's a
single driver in there they fit of
course into your ear canal and they are
pretty easy to drive they don't have a
lot of impedance going on there since
they are of an in-ear dry in-ear monitor
design you can easily drive them from
any device without an amplifier although
I did find that these particular
headphones did benefit as many of you
can probably imagine from a better
audiophile style rig they did sound
better with a better source with a
better deck with a better amplifier than
just running straight out but they can
be driven straight out of a portable
device without any problem there overall
I think the build quality on these is
great the cable is actually braided at
the bottom and smooth at the top after
the Y split a very nice design and for a
cable it's you can see here it's not
actually interchangeable but for a
hundred dollars which is what these
headphones run not too bad at all
for the price point I did really enjoy
the sound of these in-ear monitors I've
had bad experiences in the past in your
monitors can sound horrible at the
hundred dollar range these that is not
the case with these these extra sound
quite neutral the bass wasn't over
inflated the mids were very decent
resolution and the highs weren't
piercing or crew overly crisp or any of
that stuff I found a very nice neutral
kind of delivery when you really could
with the ear tips that I used however I
did think a little bit of volume helped
them the most really bring out the color
bring out the texture so if you do add a
little bit of volume I find they perform
the best but once they're they're really
kind of a nice treat for a hundred
dollars you really kind of get what you
pay for and a little bit more with these
ones I think a great kind of response
resolution and a balanced bass section a
lot of times within ear monitors the
bass can get way too big it can sound
really muddied and crowd the mids not
the case at all with this very nice bass
presentation up into the mids doesn't
crowd those too much so I really I
really like that about them a balanced
presentation is really something special
and in a universal in-ear monitor of
this type and price range so for those
of you looking for a more neutral sound
signature with great resolution and kind
of a lively feel at a hundred dollar
price point
these are definitely something you're
going to look at the re for hundreds
then we gotta know if you guys have any
questions feel free to subscribe to the
channel if you can and have a great
weekend guys Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
