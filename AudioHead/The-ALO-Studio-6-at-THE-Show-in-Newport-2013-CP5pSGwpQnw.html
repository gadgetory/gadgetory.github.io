a audio lineout headphones are becoming
more and more popular high-end
headphones so it's great to connect with
home audio people and have them come in
and listen to our products and the
amazing sound quality you can get from
moderate headphones that you get to that
so it's really approaching like a very
very very high-end speaker setup in a
personal manner we give you another
dimension in music listening so that
wasn't available in a five or ten years
ago so and today we have our newest
headphone amplifier it's the desktop
studio 6 and it is a single-ended triode
headphone EO that features six tubes you
have a five AR for 20 BTW gas regulators
at six to sixty sixes and one success
and 74 sort of a tube rollers dream
there lots of different tubes it will
run for headphones simultaneously
without any degradation of the sound
quality from its topology so it's it's a
great tool for a reviewer or somebody
who has a large collection headphones to
me that the beauty of the city of six is
it's a the expansion the detail imaging
that it that it provides it's super
clean and a super grain list it's you
know very smooth very revealing a
neutral transparent so I've never heard
like a
8800 sounds so amazing or the Gredos or
the ah disease or just just really comes
along fantastic sound I actually was was
the person who designed the actual look
of a pond paper and then I gave it to my
engineer who who did the files in house
using a program called inventor and and
then we hired some people to help us
with some of the how it fits together
but I'm very proud of the design because
I actually sat down with pen and paper
and drew up drew up the design we sump
the Transformers into that closure to
give it kind of a sleek look and I'm a
big fan of deer Rams I don't know if
you're familiar with him but he's a
industrial designer and we wanted to be
very sleek and modern not noisy it's
going to sit on your shelf you don't
want it to be screaming at you want it
to kind of blend in and be very
minimalist and that's kind of what we
accomplished me feel with it and so
personally I'm really proud of the way
it look so we're going to stick to that
design with all our future future
products in the coming years</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
