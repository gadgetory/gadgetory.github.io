bringing you another headphone review
this time we have a deck and headphone
amplifier combination from ADL Alfa
design labs called the a1 the AE one
retails for around six hundred dollars
and is an upgrade or adjustment you
could say to the company's previous one
that looks very similar to this called
the x1 no while the x1 had Apple
compatibility directly so you could plug
an Apple device in there any iDevice in
and it would decode the sound for you in
amplify it to your headphones this one
the a1 is intended for and the Android
platform that being said this time
around they've also added on DSD and
double D STD decoding from your computer
so if you have a computer and you have a
DSD collection which is a very typical
audiophile file type typical net they
like to see and use it in the products
it's not so typical in that the files
are actually quite hard to find very few
tracks are actually offered in DSD but
it's something that a lot of the guys
use and they were and they like it for a
file type for high quality high
resolution recordings this one does
decode that which is pretty cool pretty
specialized does it through USB so it
also can connect to your computer to act
as an external deck and headphone
amplifier to your computer I used our
ivana plus and a couple other audio file
type playback software on the computer
and it worked just fine with those
connects plug and play with Apple
platform a Mac computer it's very easy
to get that stuff set up and get going
that being said this one does have quite
a few inputs and outputs given the size
while $600 is a little bit on the it
would say mid to higher side of things
for portable audio
these days it does have a battery it has
an optical in and an optical out
headphone jack aligned in a light out
combo USB for your computer as I said
before charging and of course full
compatibility now not for all Android
devices as some of those who you guys
are familiar with all the different
Android platforms of varies a lot so not
everything works but this one has an
approval list if you check out the ADL
site they'll show you what works what in
a couple of things that don't work but
for the most part a lot of the newest
phones do work I connected my older
Galaxy 3 no problem whatsoever which is
to say that's pretty exceptional because
frankly getting external devices from
Android have been a chore it's not an
easy thing to do that don't always work
for audio playback but that being said
the this particular device does come
with a cable that helps that process
along made for Android so if you have
the proper cable that comes with this
and like I said galaxy 3 plug-and-play
which is really an exceptional
experience considering all the other
stuff set out there but you might not
get that same experience for every
device because it varies so much its
follow as far as the way this particular
device sounds it's not bad at all
actually I found it to be very nice and
even through the frequency range
there's no bloated bass there is not an
external bass booster or or treble boost
in this case and also there is not a
gain switch so those looking for really
hard to drive headphones this one might
not work out but I did get it to work
fine within your monitors and regular
I'd say regular but average to drive
headphones so and that in that situation
it's it kind of works well but just back
to the general south so the frequency
range kind of is nice and even across
the spectrum no bass boost kind of like
an audiophile flat sound the resolution
is pretty good
dynamics are pretty good it has a nice
kind of general fine tone to it that you
might expect from an audiophile device
it's nothing too over colored in fact
I'd say it kind of rains in more along
and little lines than it does with
anything overly textured or or warm or
any of that I'd you know it kind of
lands in the nice clean technical
proficient kind of presentation when it
comes to its sound so this is the a1
$600 it's on the market now from ADL a
fun little device a lot of diversity a
lot of ins and outs for your inputs and
headphones digital source to act as an
external attack a lot of extra goodies
from the tech side including DSD and DSD
DSD too so all in all a fun little
package hope you guys enjoy it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
