bringing you another headphone review
this time we have a deck and headphone
amplifier combination from a dl alpha
design labs called the a1 the AE one
retails for around six hundred dollars
and is an upgrade or adjustment you
could say to the company's previous one
that looks very similar to this called
the x1 now while the x1 had apple
compatibility directly so you can plug
an Apple device in there any iDevice in
and it would decode the sound for you in
amplify it to your headphones this one
the a1 is intended for and the Android
platform that being said this time
around they've also added on DSD and
doubled estd decoding from your computer
so if you have a computer and you have a
DSD collection which is a very typical
audio file file type typical net they
like to see and use it in the products
it's not so typical in that the files
are actually quite hard to find very few
tracks are actually offered in DST but
it's something that a lot of the guys
use and there and they like it's for
file type for high quality high
resolution recordings this one does
decode that which is pretty cool pretty
specialized does it through USB so it
also can connect to your computer to act
as an external deck and headphone
amplifier to your computer I used our
teavana plus and a couple other audio
file type playback software on the
computer and it worked just fine with
those connects plug and play with the
Apple platform a Mac computer it's very
easy to get that stuff set up and get
going that being said this one does have
quite a few inputs and outputs given the
size while six hundred dollars is a
little bit on the it would say mid to
higher side of things for portable audio
these days it does have a batter
be it has an optical in and an optical
out headphone jack align in a light out
combo USB for your computer as i said
before charging and of course full
compatibility now not for all android
devices as some of those who you guys
are familiar with all the different
android platforms of varies a lot so not
everything works but this one has an
approved list if you check out the ADL
site they'll show you what works what in
a couple of things that don't work but
for the most part a lot of the newest
phones do work i connected my older
galaxy 3 no problem whatsoever which is
to say that's pretty exceptional because
frankly getting external devices from
android have been a chore it's not an
easy thing to do that don't always work
for audio playback but that being said
the this particular device does come
with a cable that helps that process
along made for android so if you have
the proper cable that comes with this
and like i said galaxy 3 plug and play
which is really an exceptional
experience considering all the other
stuff set out there but you might not
get that same experience for every
device because it varies so much it's
follow as far as the way this particular
device sounds it's not bad at all
actually i found it to be very nice and
even through the frequency range there's
no bloated base there is not an external
bass booster or or treble boost in this
case and also there is not a gain switch
so those looking for really hard to
drive headphones this one might not work
out but i did get it to work fine within
your monitors and regular i'd say
regular but average to drive headphones
so that in that situation it kind of
works well but just back to the general
south so the frequency range kind of is
nice and even across the spectrum no
bass boost Oh kind of like an audiophile
flat sound the resolution is pretty good
dynamics are pretty good it has a nice
kind of general fine tone to it that you
might expect from an audiophile device
it's nothing to over colored in fact I'd
say it kind of rains in more along and
little lines that does with anything
overly textured or or warm Ernie that
you know it kind of lands in the nice
clean technical proficient kind of
presentation when it comes to its sound
so this is the a1 six hundred dollars
it's on the market now from ADL a fun
little device a lot of diversity a lot
of ins and outs for your inputs and
headphones digital source to act as an
external attack a lot of extra goodies
from the tech side including DSD and DST
DST too so all in all a fun little
package hope you guys enjoy it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
