exponent ACOG oh and this is the zoo
room and this year we're excited to
bring out our our new line of furniture
slash audio
it's called zoo modern and here we have
the console the official name is console
number one for everyone and it's a it's
it's very inspired from mid-century
we're big Charles and Ray Eames fans you
can see some some dieter rams Braun
inspiration in the grill and it will be
available in a few weeks we're still
tweaking on some details just to get it
as good as possible for all our our
customers out there and yeah we're
excited about it I pretty much came up
with the idea and the design of it and
then Sean who's our Vanna White right
now he's the engineering and he's the
brains behind this thing the fact that
it floats
no one believes us main thing we got
going on engineering in this piece to
keep the vibrations at a minimum so that
you can put your turntable on the top of
the deck you can still have a rock and
party or really good as aggressive as
you want with your music and your needle
isn't going to go skate across your
piece of wax so we do have mag
levitation between the top console and
the base feature on the bottom
underneath here we have big ten at big
12 inch subwoofer system lots of bracing
with the feet placed in the nodal
position designed so that the feet are
well grounding of this this piece we
have some big neodymium magnets in here
that do you levitate this top piece
there it's a post and socket
functionality so it's easy to assemble
even though there is a lot of hype our
magnets stuff going on the loudspeaker
section is our coax right out of our
sole speaker and it's directly cabled up
and back and if you've got your
turntable on the top you still have
plenty of space for your Peachtree
audio gear integrated receiver in the
space between computer you know wireless
stuff phono stage whatever you might
need to put in here it fits quite nicely
and that's about it on the console as
far as the piece of furniture so here in
the Peachtree room we're shown with the
druid loudspeakers we started the
company with with druid they launched
originally back in 2001 it's on mark
five lots of press happening on that you
can check out the press over it
stereo file you can see it on scene it
you can see it at six moons lots of
stuff happening with with that but if
you're not familiar with our speakers
were high efficiency very different high
efficiency in that we use a 10-inch
frame on our main full range driver it's
about the same size as your head so as
an excellent tone of mid-range and vocal
information as well as deep tones of
bass the super tweeter on the bottom is
coming in at there just the top end of
the treble range at 10 kilohertz just to
compliment a little bit of the burnish
and detail on the harmonic structure of
instruments capable of that kind of high
frequency extension violins muted
trumpet that kind of thing yes the druid
6000 a pair really happy with them in
this uh this finish this you know
automotive finish that we also do
in-house
so I like the cheesecake more you go I
didn't got either if you get the yeah
the crumbly side because welcome come in
we're gonna start it up in about ten
minute not but all gotta eat</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
