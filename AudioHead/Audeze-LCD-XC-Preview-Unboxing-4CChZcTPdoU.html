today we have something we don't usually
do but we have a big product that just
came in to the lab I want to give you
guys a sneak peek or first look whatever
you'd like to call it of the new a
disease LCD XC that's the LCD line
closed back headphone I haven't finished
run taking it through all the critical
listening and I'm also giving a little
bit of burn into so the full review
isn't ready quite yet but I did think
this is a very big prominent product
that just kind of came out into the
field so I wanted to give you guys
something to look at to check out I'll
do an unboxing here to kind of show you
what comes with it and hopefully you
guys enjoy it and stay tuned for the
full review which will be coming shortly
as soon as I run through the paces so
the plastic shell case you see here is
the travel case that comes with the LCD
X C it's I really like it I have enjoyed
it and it's really you know pretty
rugged its snapshot it's a really nice
touch I think too for such a nice
headphone it really complements it well
holds it well it's a it's a great little
add-on I think that comes from the
company and according to the website
this does come with the headphone if you
purchase it the retail price of the
headphone is around 1800 that's $1,800
so it is one of the more expensive
clothes back headphones on the market
but they do a couple of nice finishing
touches here that come along with it so
the case opens up and inside you can see
they have a couple of additional things
this particular product does come with a
pair of balanced cable for pin as well
as your traditional single-ended that is
very very nice you can buy cable
upgrades later but the the like the mini
XLR component fits right into the end of
the headphone and the other side for pin
balanced comes in free comes with it
which is awesome because the
cables can run through lots of money so
if you really want to get going with a
balanced set up you are ready to go with
this also included here is some wood
care oil and a little cloth for your for
wiping it down with this this little
pack keep it loaded seem like lunch it
means a lot I think it really speaks
well to the market itself and also the
guys within this hobby knowing that they
need a balance or they might want to go
balance including that in there I think
it's a very nice touch inside here we
have the headphone itself here looks
pretty beautiful it also has this little
foam thing to keep the ear pads from
getting crushed together let's try that
guy so that stays in there and for
long-term storage I do like to keep them
in there you can also put them on a
stand to really get that do if you
really want kind of an aesthetic look
for them they're very very nice in that
regard I mean you can see from the cup
here aesthetically they did take some
time to really make them look good
shine so as you can see that phone
itself is very similar to the LCD line
the 2 and the 3 with the main difference
this time being it's a sealed back
design the wood cup here covers the
entire thing and helps keep noise out
the jacks you plug it in are the mini
XLR type very nice the headphone itself
is actually a little bit heavier than
the LCD three that I have on hand I
believe that one reigns in around five
hundred and forty eight grams whereas
this one the LCD XC actually comes in at
650 grams so it's slightly heavier than
the other headphone but as far as the
build and the construct it feels very
similar to that I really like the
headband that you can see here that the
Rings are have actually been swapped out
from wood to a more of a metal here on
the side of these rings I've switched
out so the metal cup itself is wood but
the rings have been swapped out for
metal so there is that change I'm
assuming
to help kind of even keep it lighter it
is kind of a heavy headphone but this
you know if you're in the market for
this type of a thing
you're probably not gonna run around
with it too much on your head it is more
of a design for a home listening kind of
endeavor
however the impedance has been lower
down to 22 ohms on this so it's actually
quite easy it's even easier to drive I
wouldn't say that the LCD 3 was hard to
drive headphone although it did benefit
from an amplifier these headphones
actually are getting down to the point
where you can drive them from almost any
device even an eye device so 22 homes
even even easier to drive them before so
guys that's just a sneak peek at the LCD
X C by all disease I hope you guys
enjoyed it more to come on this front
for sure but I just wanted to throw it
out there let you guys know is coming
and I hope you enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
