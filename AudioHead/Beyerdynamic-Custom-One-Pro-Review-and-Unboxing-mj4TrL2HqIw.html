audio head here today we have the Bayer
dynamic custom one Pro adjustable base
headphone this one's kind of unique in
that it is one of the very few were the
only one that I've actually heard of
that has adjustable base right on the
headset it's located on the on the lower
rim like a slider port I'll show you
guys in a little bit first I want to get
to the boxing obviously fairly nice
glossy bear dynamic is a bigger company
so they have a bit more packaging budget
to make this thing you know do it
upright
you can see everything here this thing
actually slides out it's also
customizable in more than just the base
you can change out the pads the backing
plates the bands there's a lot of
different customizable features you can
kind of see here on the inside window to
to the phone on the left typical back
and then on this side as you can see
they have kind of their own preset sound
patterns a graph laid out there to show
you kind of what the sound signature
would be like the response the frequency
response would be like for each of the
four settings and there's a shot of the
hole so you can kind of get the idea
idea what it looks like here it opens up
from this side mm-hmm you can see they
included a little enjoye tab they're
also here on the side this is the
there's a tool included to unscrew the
side plates detachable cable with a slot
here so you can only stick it in it
doesn't completely rotate you how to
make sure you get that slot lined up
good so it fits in here with the cable
screw-type adjuster for each headphone
sighs kind of a unique packages for a
headphone kind of fits in a little pie
slice there this is the headphone itself
it's pretty typical for a Bayer dynamic
shape and size for their around the ear
as you can see it's around the ear
headphone it's very similar to the 880
in in that these are metal this is
removable
that's not similar for the 880 but
definitely the headband is similar the
shape is similar the difference being
the 80s made out of a lot of metal here
and this is predominantly plastic on the
custom one Pro these are the sliders I
was telling you about earlier as you can
see they click up and down there's four
little three little portholes they get
covered up that allow more air to move
and therefore more bass each or activate
it separately as you can see the inside
there it's very typical of Bayer dynamic
these are faux leather pads not my
favorite in that sometimes they're a
little hot and sweaty they get a little
sweaty after long periods of time I
believe these are removable and you can
change them out with a different type if
you're so desire as I said before this
is removable customizable these unscrew
and this comes off and you can replace
this faceplate as well so there's a lot
of ways to make these kind of uniquely
yours if you like as far as the sound
goes I preferred the sound on number two
totally closed off was a little based
light for my preferences this one seemed
the most neutral out of the four I liked
very much
I didn't find them needs to be crowded
too much by the by the base at this
point which is really nice I'm a big fan
of the Bayer dynamic sound overall their
house sound so I was very pleased when I
found out these kind of shared a lot of
commonalities with that
with this particularly I think that
these the setting 2 is good 3 is even
more based obviously and 4 I found to be
quite booming a little bit of loss of
control at that point but if you really
like your booming bass it's all there
for you at this at the sitting for so
the first one a little bit light to
fairly neutral I would say with a little
bit of a bass bump 3 even more bass I
think I've read a some online that
people really enjoy number 3 on this one
so it's not out of control I do think
the bass is a little bit a little bit
bigger but it's still pretty tight and
controlled
whereas for it gets a little bit bigger
and a little bit boom yer but still some
people might enjoy that I mean I know
people love booming bass and really kind
of the market that these guys are going
at it shares a lot of common ground not
just from the fact that you can adjust
the bass but also because the price
point is $200 on these it's a kind of
treading that little area in between the
high-end stuff and you know kind of the
mass consumer I can get their hands on
these and kind of like make it like
unique to them so these are pretty fun
headphone I think that if you are
looking for an entry-level Bayer dynamic
sound and you know you don't want to
throw down the big bucks for the higher
end stuff this is a great starting point
um especially since you can adjust the
bass if you like that if you like the
bigger bass because you can actually no
change it from song to song on the fly
which is pretty unique if not the only
headphone I'm aware of that can do that
at the headphone level just like these
cans so pretty cool if you guys want you
can check them out
you ask me questions in the comment
section I can and I can respond and if
you get a chance to subscribe to the
channel that always helps me so until
next time guys thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
