audio fest and we are here at the v-moda
booth looking at the new crossfade
series m 100 s there a little bit bigger
than the last m-80s but they look really
good you can see they share the same
styling and we're going to get in a
little bit closer here to show you
exactly what they look like a very
similar to the originals however this
time you may notice that they have two
different inputs here you can actually
run the cable into either one of these
however there's a daisy chaining
capability with this where you can plug
the input from here the output actually
comes to out here and you can play your
music to another friend who has a pair
of these or any an interchangeable your
phone so that's kind of a fun little
thing as far as the styling and the
field go they are extremely similar to
the m-80s however they do have a larger
ear cup size and the faceplate on the
other side is a little bit bigger as
well but from my experience with m-80s
are extremely similar which is a great
plus I was kind of thought to build
quality on these was exceptional so
that's the v-moda m8 ms rm100 s here the
Rocky Mountain audio fest just zoom out
and get the whole booth here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
