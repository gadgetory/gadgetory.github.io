officer here with echovox audio we are
live at can jam so kal 2017 if you
couldn't tell by the giant orange banner
in the background which hope you guys
like it this is brand new it's been a
Singapore in back too which is kind of
fun um so anyways we've had an awesome
weekend here we've done a lot of amazing
things here at our own booth but also
there's some people doing amazing things
at other booths this has been a fun time
great turnout so thank you to everybody
who has come here and thank you
especially to Ethan and the can jam and
hi head fight team for putting on a
spectacular event like this we've got
some pretty cool things to talk about as
you guys are probably aware if you've
been following the development of our
company we've been making this thing for
a little while now it's called the
Explorer it's a hi-fi digital audio
player it runs on stock Android and uses
a couple really cool playback engines to
be able to play your music you can
either stream through Wi-Fi using title
for a hi-fi lossless streaming service
you can also download these tracks
offline and take them with you without
Wi-Fi and we've also partnered with the
USB audio player pro which is a fully
fledged audio file playback program to
be able to take your local music library
put it on the device and play it in a
very easy to use fashion that also adds
some pretty impressive functionality so
if you look on here quick rundown you've
got your standard artist and album view
but if you go into this little menu you
can scroll down you've actually got
networking API integration which is
something that's very intriguing
now the Explorer has Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
DLNA capabilities this app allows you to
give you utilize them to their full
potential so you'll see like a UPnP DLNA
server aspect here a little technical
but if you have a DLNA server you can
actually pour it into it and stream
directly to your device you also have a
network login functionality where if you
have a home music tower that's
broadcasting a cloud network you can log
into your network anywhere in the world
of Wi-Fi and stream directly to your
device so there's a lot of amazing
functionality components to the Explorer
that are able to be accessed using the
USB audio player Pro app we're very
happy to be able to partner with them
this comes standard on every Explorer
and it is at this point the official
stock music player of echo box so
anyways people have been
for some time now Sam when's the
Explorer coming out well I've got good
news for you guys we have an official
launch date June 19th it is coming right
around the corner our dealers and our
distributors globally are getting ready
for this event we're super excited on
our n we're ramping up some final
aspects of engineering to be able to get
ready for the full mass production run
of course prior to delivering to
everybody around the world we are going
to be first taking care of our IndieGoGo
and pre-order customers we did deliver
45 units of the IndieGoGo units a couple
weeks ago and when we first delivered
those 45 units we wanted to give it a
little bit of time to do some QC testing
the testing has been phenomenal in the
feedback that we've received has been
very valuable through it we discovered a
couple things that we wanted to fix so
we made the decision to hold off on
delivery of the remainder of the units
until we made them perfect I'm happy to
say that this unit that I'm holding
right here represents a complete unit of
those fixes with all of the updates
employed on this right we've actually
redesigned the PCB a increased Wi-Fi
shielding to eliminate any Wi-Fi
feedback a brand new battery because the
one that was in it was kind of glitchy
and we just said you know let's get rid
of that noise and just go for something
completely different so we did and it's
been outperforming the last one by a
mile and a half 4000 mAh lithium ion
between 6 to 12 hours of music playback
time depending on what you're doing
I actually eked out 16 once but I was
kind of doing you know sensitive
earphones and offline listening only but
it is possible we've also changed the
micro sd component on the bottom we've
actually updated the hardware and we've
worked with rock chip our chip set
provider we're currently undergoing a
firmware update with them to implement
better functionality and reliability for
micro SD cards and so right now I can
tell you for a fact that 128 gigabytes
across the board is fully supported but
anywhere up to 256 it's still supported
as well just a little bit buggy with the
new firmware update we're hoping to
eliminate the bugginess of that problem
and make it so that no matter what you
put in the Explorer it'll work perfectly
that's the hope fingers crossed we'll
make it happen
we've also solved the wood cracking
issue that was occurring on the front
fascia of the Explorer
had to do with the fact that the
Explorer CNC of the wood right here is
very thin when you make wood thin
tends to crack we've implemented a
couple pretty cool strategies to be able
to fix that but also keep the ergonomic
form factor in the design of the
Explorer the same we've increased the
internal metal structure so it's
actually braced on the inside which is
something that's going to help the
overall stability of the Explorer but
also eliminate wood cracking and we have
subtly increased the actual character of
the wood itself is a little bit thicker
these two implemented together have
created a really cool new solution to be
able to prevent any future cracks from
happening so you know if you drop the
Explorer it's totally different story it
is a wooden device but it shouldn't just
crack on its own so that's the Explorer
update for those of you that aren't
following us very closely to the final
thing I want to point out is that we've
actually gotten rid of the line out jack
on the left side and replaced it with an
optical jack
so it's full Toslink optical output full
digital signal it's pretty sweet and so
if you have something like a cord mojo
for example you can go into an optical
and it works beautifully also I did have
a chance to play with the poly the cord
poly I don't know if you're familiar
with that when we were over in Jakarta
Indonesia at the Jakarta a hi-fi show
there's a couple little kinks we're
trying to work out of the armour of it
because it was the first time we'd ever
played with it but you can use the
explore with that integrated network
functionality and USB audio player pro
to connect wirelessly to the poly and
stream the music directly from that
device so that was pretty fun um so
enough about the Explorer check it out
if you haven't gotten one already you
can go to echo box audio comm and
pre-order one today and it'll get
delivered before the June 19th delivery
or if you want to rather wait until the
stores have it June 19th
in stores globally so that'll be fun now
I have this fancy looking thing in my
hand and I want to talk about it a
little bit huge thank you to the guys
over at effect audio they designed a
beautiful custom cable for the Nomad I
think this is their Thor 2 silver cable
I gotta say it sounds absolutely
unbelievable completely new sonic
experience but this is the Nomad this is
our new flagship earphone we've been in
development of this thing for a little
while now and very happy to say that it
is almost done
this one right here
the final sound tuning we've done a
couple things differently from the CES
the last time the United out it we've
actually made the tip a little bit
longer this has done a couple things to
benefit it number one is fits in your
ear better and number two the lengthened
acoustic chamber combined with a slight
retuning of the pique diaphragm
dramatically reduces the treble siblings
and enhances the sound stages opens up
everything right and so you still have
all the low end all of the high end and
all of the mids just flushed in a little
bit more of an open soundstage and so
we're pretty happy with where that's
come alright this is set for a global
launch date of June 19th same day as the
Explorer this is going to be global as
well and try to help you guys out a
little bit we're doing an amazing
pre-order special on our website it's
$100 off from now until June 19th the
day that it launches so it's usually 399
you can pick it up for $2.99 pre-order
if this is something that you're
interested in or you have the finder and
you say to yourself I really wish there
was a grownup version of it this is a
grown-up finder this is the big boy
finder this is a really cool earphone if
you haven't tried it come check it out
or pre-order it on our website today so
if you haven't noticed already behind me
there's people stumbling around with the
thing on their head alright we've
actually partnered with a good friend of
mine from college his name is Amir
chairman say hi o Mir hello Amir Amir
has founded a company called rhythm of
the universe apart from being a
spectacular audio company are not
dedicated to making sound products but
actually dedicated to making music Amir
is a world-class composer and in many
ways that's the roots of his endeavors
however for the last four years or so
they've been in development on a brand
new virtual reality experience
it's called rhythm in the universe and
it's an entire mythology derived from
music it's an interactive experience
unlike anything else that's available
for VR it is unbelievably spectacular
the cool thing that we're doing here at
our booth that can jam we're actually
putting people on the VR experience
using the Nomad for the sound and by
pairing such an interactive experience
with such in-depth sound quality
especially with an in-ear environment it
takes you into a completely new level of
immersion it's very fun go on google and
type in rhythm of the universe or
I think it's wwr Oh to calm our ot you
check it out it is going to 100% change
in landscape of VR I'll leave it at that
I'll let you experience it for yourself
