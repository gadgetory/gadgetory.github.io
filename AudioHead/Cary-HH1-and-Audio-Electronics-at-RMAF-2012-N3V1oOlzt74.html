audio I'm the sales manager we're here
at the Rocky Mountain audio fest in
Denver the 2012 edition and carry audio
has entered into the headphone market
with a series of headphone amplifiers
that we're introducing and also a new
lower price line of equipment i'd like
to tell you a little bit about thing
we're most proud of is our h h1 it's a
hybrid headphone amplifier uses a tube
front end and single-ended like our very
expensive tube preamps and so on it's in
amplifiers it's single-ended technology
but using MOSFETs for the output it's
pure Class A all the way through it is
fully differentially balanced meaning
there's two of everything in Reverse
phase so the noise floor is extremely
low it's got quite a bit about the power
and it's very very stable and cable
capable of handling virtually any
headphone you can throw at it doesn't
isn't affected by the crazy impedances
of some of the very exotic headphones
these days and having the tubes gives it
a very sweet tweeter sound very lush
mid-range yet it's got very very deep
and very accurate bass and we're very
very excited about it comes with either
silver or black it's all handmade North
Carolina as all of our products are and
retail on it is 1595 we've had a couple
of reviews and some more coming and it's
extremely well received and we're very
very pleased with it we also have a
headphone amplifier that's pure solid
state under our audio electronics brand
name this is also balanced and it has
pretty much the same features but it's
not quite to the build quality of the
regular carry product and it's 1195 so
it's pure solid state all the way
through but it's also class-a and very
very nice sound just doesn't have quite
the detail of this and at 1195 it is an
excellent value and also will handle
almost any kind of headphone to these
days audio electronics is a brand that
carry audio had a number of years ago it
started as kits and then carry built
them as as fully assembled products for
people and now that economies settle
down a little bit and music has come
back to channels come back very strongly
hit with headphones and vinyl and all
that
we decided to bring the audio
electronics brand back in our first two
pieces besides the little Nighthawk
headphone amp are the constellation
preamplifier and the hercules power
amplifier they're named after after
military aircraft these are also built
here in America they're not Chinese
they're fully built by the same people
designed by the same people that do our
big carry stuff constellation preamp has
three inputs so it's very very simple a
matched pair of tubes it uses the same
type of build quality as we do in the
big stuff it uses WBT binding posts and
kimber kable inside it's just not the
level of sophistication in terms of
capacitors and transformers and so on of
the big carry stuff but it is hand-built
in America has the carry house sound
very very sweet and rich sound and
companion with this is 1495 so it's very
modestly priced for its performance and
we also have the hercules power
amplifier which is 30 watts of channel
uses el34 output tubes although it's
quite capable of handling almost
anything else as far as tubes in the
octal sockets it is as the preamp it
uses zero global feedback so it's
extremely quiet very good noise floor it
uses a capacitive bias system that
allows it to constantly monitor by us so
no matter what the tubes are doing keeps
the performance the same with all the
tubes and also keeps them operating it
their optimum level which extends the
tube life and again keeps the music
sounding the same as the tubes start to
degrade over time one thing Kari does is
in our power transformers in audio
electronics as well as Kari is we
tremendously over build them so our
power transformers are running at about
half their rated duty cycle the tubes
run at about forty percent of their
rated cycle which means we have very
long tube life typically most
manufacturers for power output tubes
will say two to three years ritu were
five to seven years and on our low level
tubes were ten to twelve years as
opposed to the usual five to seven so
the cost of ownership is typically quite
low
again you have the made in America very
very high quality very very musical
sound and we're very very proud of them
we will have additional pieces coming in
the audio electronics line the next
couple things that will be coming we
have a DAC coming very very shortly that
will do 24 192 over USB as we do in our
big stuff in cary and then we will
follow that with a phono stage and that
is kind of where all do electronics is
going right now we will have a number
more products but that's what's coming
over the next few months</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
