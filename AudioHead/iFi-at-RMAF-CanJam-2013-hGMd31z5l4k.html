we're just going to show off some of
their new products okay new at this show
is the mercury cable which is a new
single run of USB cable I fight develops
their own USB connector and their own
ferrets which are specifically tuned to
digital frequencies and we'd already
introduced the Gemini which is the dual
cable which takes power out of the left
port of our I USB power and the data
path is out of the right port so once
it's clean to the I USB it's in
separated and kept separated to the back
of our deck and then also new is the IPO
fire is a USB sized thumb drive that is
the last step of our cleaning process
from getting the sound from the computer
into your DAC and this is in the audio
path and it prevents ringing distortion
from the computer and so that's brand
new with the show as well as well we're
here is the new IDs d which is part of
our new nano series so this is a lithium
battery pack a lithium battery pack 25
to 30 hour battery life USB 3.0 input
with apple digital management rights
it's 24 384 on PCM as well as DSD double
DSD and d XD capable has a sharp and
soft filter settings for the DAC section
itself it uses a bird round chip who
even incorporates an SPDIF out so it can
be a USB to spdif converter as well has
volume controlled analog outputs that
are by passable to unity gain as as well
as a 880 milla wat headphone amp in it
so you could use this to take digital
out of your iphone or ipad into the DAC
section and then using the headphone
section out of this for the best
possible sound out of your phone or iPad
devices or use it as a desktop DAC to go
with that we have the new I can nano
which is a dedicated headphone out this
is a 100
50 milliwatts output full-size jack as
well as the ex base and 3d holographic
technologies get a 60 hour battery life
out of this as well it can run off a
wall power or or the battery analog ins
and 3.5 millimeter headphone in as well
the I tube which is in the rack over
there and in my hand here is a new
product from IFI it incorporates the GE
5670 vacuum tube which is basically a
premium tube version of any 68 69 to 73
o a tune it has the 3d holographic
technology which was developed from a
white paper written by Alan bloom line
so if you've ever heard any binaural
recordings that technology is what's
incorporated to this high and low
settings the high setting is for Near
Field or desktop listening the low
setting is for normal stereo room
distance listening it also incorporates
digital antidote which is a technology
again from a trickle down from AMR into
the I fine line which basically takes
any upsampling DAC and turns it sonics
into that of a new old stock Phillips
chip that was not up and over sampled in
concert with all that it's got an analog
vine control and adjustable game so you
can have zero or six DB of gain and
Devon control can be bypassed via dip
switches on the bottom so you could use
this as a full function preamp AA or as
just a tube buffer or anything in
between as well so this is the the
eye-fi retro executive system this is al
84 vacuum tube base with ec f 82 driver
tubes 25 watts per channel incorporates
the I dak basically so it's got USB
spdif and toslink inputs on the back it
has bluetooth rev 2 which can support 24
96 streaming capability as well it
incorporates the iphone oh so it's got a
photo section in built in so you can
jack your turntable directly into it as
well with moving coil and moving magnet
settings it incorporates the i can as
well with impedance set set in
it's four quarter inch and 3.5
millimeter headphone jacks and it's a
full almost a full wat of output out of
this product for different headphones it
incorporates the 3d holographic from the
eye to is built into this as well so
it's got foreign near settings for the
3d holographic as well as delete it
incorporates ex based technology again
from the I can for the Stetter that's
adjusted specifically for these speakers
Julie so the speakers can be placed
right up against the wall on X base is
off coupon if you're going to free stand
them on speaker stands the way a
high-end audiophile would the ex base
would be on high and it's got a medium X
base setting for any set up in between
dope paper mid-range silk dome tweeter
no crossover they developed the drivers
to function together without a crossover
there's just a cap on the tweeter and
that's it solid bamboo enclosure as well
the whole package is going to be under
2,000 okay the nanos were going to both
be under 200</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
