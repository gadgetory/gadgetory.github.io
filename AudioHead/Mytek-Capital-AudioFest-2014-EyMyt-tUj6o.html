tech digital and we're here at the
Capitol audio fest 2014 I am showing our
hifi line if you will there's our
classic tried and true stereo 192 DSD
deck and we've had a great deal of
success since we launched it we've sold
more than 3,000 of them now it was the
first affordable DST DAC on the market
and it's been loved and admired by many
impressive people but today we have a
good fortune to show our working
prototype right before a final launch of
the new Manhattan this is our reference
headphone DAC preamplifier it's designed
to basically be the center of your
listening world in a lot of ways it has
features that take from everything we've
learned about the stereo 192 DSD DAC and
upgraded both the sound and features it
has about twice the power on the
headphone amplifier and a lower
impedance we use our own proprietary
circuit and we've been working on it for
quite a while and I think it's quite
impressive and the Manhattans been like
designed from kind of like input to
output to be like so much stronger and
better at the very input from your main
power there is a power conditioner that
feeds our dual isolated power supplies
one for the analog stage and one for the
digital stage into the board we now have
we had more space so we utilize that to
tighten up our digital section we've
upgraded it with a new femto clock that
actually has lower noise and cleaner
consistency this really helps our
digital stages which we've worked with
for over 20 years we one of the first
companies to actually work with
analog-to-digital converters period
this goes into a much more upgraded
digital routing section the preamplifier
section of the Manhattan is vastly
expanded it still includes firewire USB
to USB one spit if a ES and toslink in
addition now as standard it has estephe
inputs for more professional and
esoteric DSD input only sources from
like a tascam as well as modified sa CD
players and then we have now three
analog input stages there is a balanced
input stage and to unbalanced input
stages but that leads us into our
options for the Manhattan and coming in
quarter one of 2015 we're going to be
releasing a phone a preamp card that's
both moving magnet and moving coil and
this will be a user installable very
simple but have the same excellent
pedigree of Sonics that we've always
tried to achieve in addition to that we
have the option for an optical estephe
input which will allow for sacd
transports that are compatible with emm
labs Meitner and playback designs I
think this is going to be a very special
box the sonic signature of it is
something just a great step forward than
what we've already been doing it's taken
about two years of development and we're
really happy with it it's a beautiful
design it's a steel enclosure wrapped in
aluminum and that helps to eliminate
noise as well as look beautiful I hope
to hear great things from the world and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
