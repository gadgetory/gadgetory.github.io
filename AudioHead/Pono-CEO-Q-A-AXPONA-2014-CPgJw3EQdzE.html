question I have for years since paano
isn't going to be actually mastering it
will be music before will you still be
exerting the influent quality control
for sale and in particular my interest
I'm so relieved you is acknowledged
allow the stores I want to see files
that capture all the original dynamics
that work for yep and problem is the
trend in digital mastered unfortunately
it's been not to me in this dirty secret
but not to make remasters sound better
to sell our and hit them to south louder
first have to crush this bush in it so
are you working social topics in your
question I think I know where you're
headed just an inch of time there's two
questions here one is sort of a best
practices idea for a recording the other
is Providence and we're really
understanding whether the report he came
from there I mean we have contacts that
all the labels guys like the Ebola steep
local ipsum Damian Lewis and people like
that that know where this stuff is
hidden I mean you can't just walk in and
ask for the 1971 you know highest res
version of Simon Garfunkel bridge over
troubled water unless you know which one
you want so we're
you spend a lot of time getting back to
understanding what the original
recording was if we can figure out what
it was made on in other suspect sheet on
that recording somewhere we can't do
that for everything in the catalog but
for the stuff that really are those
master recordings we will take care
about problems we care about the chain
of custody on that recording on the
other side of things we're going to get
into sort of a little bit what itunes
did ariana mastered for itunes which is
really a recommended recording
techniques so that if you want to play
on the phone here's the way you should
record or the way you should master the
way is your pants that's going to take a
few years to get in there I think people
are going to do it on their own the
Grammy Foundation crop producers and
engineers wing is a hundred percent
behind this on this deal got the award
from the graduates this year for the
artists most committed to sound balding
that's pretty helpful to three thousand
recording and mastering engineers in the
country so we're on it there's a lot of
stuff that won't be able to fix from the
past but remember we have the ability to
go back and get that original flat
master before the compression before the
dynamic ranch was squished it will head
it for me
scores of people know whether this is a
newly created a digital master what the
source safe was through the mask yeah
we're going to try to put as much
metadata as we can that day is a whole
other can of worms but anything we know
about it we're going to put up including
if we want God the only make the ability
to do is ask the studio's to make some
high res stuff for us that is in hi-res
yet to go back to the original analog
and put it in 24 192 with no compression
no you know no parametric EQ applied
after the master tape those kinds of
things this is the Kickstarter campaigns
to act unfortunately unfortunately
unfortunately it has ended in a week ago
Tuesday I say fortunately because if I
was it was like taking a red-eye every
night for those of us on the Kickstarter
but an edited she's day and a half to
two Tuesday's ago on the fifteenth of
April we entered on tax day just so we
made sure we got that 300 bucks before
people had to deal with their
to recharge that a yes Irish music
in terms of quantity yes so Warner
Warner has the most high resume in those
labels by pretty long shot you know
universals have a video-based of blu-ray
oriented effort and as you know Sony's
had their DSD effort that came from the
SAS a CD movement so both the other
labels have actually had another
movement in high res for many years
Warner actually under any word on the
juniors leadership was really smart
about five years ago they just started
archiving in high-res and in fact they
didn't do it because they wanted to
release a lot of my res they did it
because they were worried about the
archival of all of their precious
reporters so there's more material more
than anybody else especially at 24 192 I
think you're going to see everything you
know sort of next year and Beyond start
to be available you know at least in
24-48 and that's the big move getting to
24-bit recordings you know the sampling
frequency if we could have 96 or 192 we
love it but man if we can get everything
24 48 is a starting point that'd be a
huge move about for music so I don't
think there's any conveying that it's
going the right way and mounts to the
other part of what we did at most create
a business case for doing that you know
we'd like to give him a reason to do it
it wasn't very interesting to do
something 24 192 of your sony and mp3
on this side of the room has all their
questions answered for some reason I was
just I was just I was so much clearer
this happen smart to be set a string of
folks over here good one of the
residents we're going to have a
pre-order site the first of June on our
site we still have some capacity in
December what happened is we sold out
the supply chain rocktober of some of
the critical parts in kickstarter so
what we did is the last ones introduced
actually have a December ship date over
the last 10 days of Kickstarter we had
to stop promising anybody anything in
October we moved to December so for the
ones that we order as the first of June
on our own site they'll get to summer
shipments until that supplies gone by
early next year we'll be able to
stabilize this so that you can get one
you know but right now you can still get
one in December time for Christmas so I
was a first date thank you very much
what'd you get I got the Neil Young was
open
haha sorry about I had to get CSNY think
that's what I've got yeah yeah but
that's a great one I think we're going
to put dark the dark star album on but
they got go ahead nothing so the
question I had this hump it's in on the
first day of the phone outside actually
had a lot of descriptions about yet if
in here at they cute we're basically
saying you would support other high def
music absolutely you'll be able loaded
up however like one of the things I was
wondering about and really it's kind of
a philosophically cast off your for one
second that's a great point I'm sorry I
didn't make it this is life is not
proprietary if you have high res music
today and wav or aiff or flac plays
beautifully on our player you can play
your rip cds on here in whatever form
you rip them you can play our music on a
celeb firms and Wi-Fi man and whatever
so we did there's no wall garden here
our players completely open houses our
music I know to think that step further
yummy the idea of the ecosystem yeah
will the ecosystems support other
content sure other high-risk or je reve
it's a generator disqus it's a.j river
desktop and then so in this the
philosophy are you going to be a company
that's really
off the device or on the content and
then are you guys going to end up making
an end run if you get enough devices out
there you can actually have artists go
directly around labels and things like
this I mean you can really well it's an
interesting set of questions that would
take another hour to do nothing to you
but let me do a quick version all of
those um in the short run the players
important to kona because the music
store is going to take a while to come
up and we don't want to raise a zillion
dollars venture capital a whole bunch of
other things so you know we're selling a
player for a kind of the lowest price we
can sell it for and help the company you
know come up and be a company and be
funded the music start will take a while
to get up I think over the long run the
busted claro come down the store get
bigger it'll all work like that that'll
be great in terms of artists be an
unbelievable amount of independent
artists that came to us and said can you
just put my music on break there are
bands out there without a label
contracts you know small bands like
they'd been back don't have a label
drop seriously they have no contract
right you're going to summon the YouTube
revolution the whole of the record
companies are great but there's a lot of
people out there they just are
independent artists and you know to the
extent we can manage all that I don't
know if you want to become a label but
we're certainly open to any of that
music being downloaded and player player
doesn't require that it has a Warner or
stonier a universal badge on it to play
our honor player there's a ton of great
independent labels
out there we've had probably three or
four hundred inquiries from little nichy
labels that have 15-20 releases and they
want to make sure place on top so so
acoustic sounds like they went to
hybrids HD tracks you'll be able to like
go from their store directly and
download onto your device yeah everybody
listen my player day listen to my 50
tracks library thanks to normal data in
that going forward you get same thing
some movement one more question yeah
first date I've got the order the yellow
one yeah there's I thought the prototype
load was just the most fun yourself yeah
let's see I've got a fun right yeah the
question is going next when you put
together the business plan yeah vs where
you are today ah what's the big surprise
probably the interest in connecting to
the artist through the player that took
us by surprise I mean it was like kind
everybody gather my way I want the Foo
Fighters one you know you can put food
fighters on one of these two and it's
the same but it's not a Foo Fighter 2
player anymore so the connection to the
artist was the thing I think we were so
gratified you could just see people want
to do something that the artists done by
the way it's an interesting it's an
interesting validation of deals
credibility in the music industry we did
every single one of those limited
edition players within the description
on the side of the van and the right to
put through digital albums out there
without ever talking to a lawyer imagine
that now that's not like oh well I'll
call your lawyer will send over our
documents no we have one day to do this
so you know Neil's manager calls the
manager of eagles surveys off who
trained under Elliott for ten years hey
we do an English version sure we have
needles person out that afternoon so
that's fast meal spreadability in the
music industry will kill out of it
without ya what's your free time without
about right now this thing about seven
or eight hours but we haven't really
tested
because we are firmware is not maestro
power management yet but it's probably
longer than you want to listen in one
sitting yeah I'm going to be around
tomorrow depressed about I play the few
rooms i did forget my lungs glitter
caked up buddy hell thank you so much i
appreciate your patience in your
interest your honor being here this is a
really interesting then you have
exposure shall we want to thank all of
you for being here we have a lot of cool
things wrong to enjoy yourself
