audio and we're happy to be here in
Newport Beach
BMC audience actually manufacturer
offering complete solutions complete
lines this means you will see you see
here a product range starting from
sources like the very unique belt-drive
CD players which are very few companies
worldwide doing that we even do the
mechanisms ourselves know the digital
analog converter the DAC one which is
the heart of of the system here it is it
includes not only digital and also USB
inputs
it has also analog inputs as well and
it's taking over the job of a preamp in
older analog systems the m2 power
amplifiers Mona power amplifiers
there's also stereo version available
but in that case we show the model power
amplifiers with our exclusive lef
circuitry which is pretty different to
any other analog design on the market
and has quite a lot of advantages and
the recently just just read in stereo
file reviewed phono stage current
injection phono stage also a very
different approach again that delivers
better results by new ideas instead of
just material Wars you can see on the
very button and well this is combined
here with with the Hardwick turntable
with an ek dot on almond and L IRA Atlas
cartridge for the demo it goes until the
speaker this is the Arcadia speaker
it's made of a complete ceramic casting
compound material it's a new way in the
in production and manufacturing so parts
of it are casted others are are put
together by a chemical welding process
so it is getting one seamless piece even
the coating you see here is not a spray
paint it is way harder than that and
it's even hard to
with a car key will last forever so in
pmc in general we take care of the
balance of a lot of factors one is a
technology approach that really delivers
better solutions by new ideas better
solutions that are really experienced
about not just features better solutions
for the music reproduction second a
manufacturing manufacturing engineering
that is rather going into industrial
style like doing everything by true
toolings instead of just machining
improve the quality while keeping the
cost reasonable you know and the global
access to materials and global global
access also to have the facility we have
our own facility just in the places
where the whole industry is supplying
everything combined together with a fair
and short trade system is making
attractive products with a very strong
price performance relation and beside
the the reference line which we already
showed on several shows in the US and in
a lot of other places of this planet now
we are introducing a new line which is
the pure line which is in a different
segment and is also there to welcome a
lot of people that are simply music
lovers coming from other price ranges
most of them youngers and here we use
our very special and quite unique
position inside of this industry to
really deliver an almost unbeatable
value and great of value and innovation
so this is the first member of our new
line to pure line we call it as a pure
line because there is nothing missing
that defines high-end audio
but we do it in a fashion that actually
makes how it audio reachable for many
more people than our reference line the
pure DAC is a very central unit and very
versatile unit it has the main features
of course easy computer-based
audio reproduction simply by USB a
high-resolution USB interconnection
which supports all the standards PCM up
to 384 k-dst 64 DST 128 everything is
supported it includes standard digital
inputs like aes/ebu coaxials or Toslink
inputs you can connect the CD player
set-top boxes whatever is necessary and
take the benefit of this DAC align
section which is made by a new approach
we could call this also a power DAC we
don't have a preamp section necessary to
have a preamp functional output we do
this in one step we have a lossless
volume control inside which is very
different to anything else on the market
and we have a zero feedback LEF circuit
for the driving a pure and true balanced
output you can connect power amplifiers
active speakers and a reference level
balanced headphone amplifier also with
the power Jack technology and this is
simply because it's completely separated
also from the line section you can have
different volumes for that
for the headphone making party on the
headphone while having maybe just
background on the line stage everything
is remote controllable and we have an
MSRP of this unit of $1600 the pure line
will be completed soon by mono power
amplifiers in the very same look the
phone or amplifier with our meanwhile
quite famous current injection
technology including an analogue digital
converter
for archiving analog content in your
piece a speaker a matching speaker where
we use our know-how of manufacturing
with aluminum plus the ceramic composite
material I just introduced for the
Arcadia speaker everything also in quite
reasonable price ranges and a media
solution that you just can put there and
it's an absolutely audiophile solution
easy to use everything within a
reasonable time frame and the pure deck
will be start delivery the mass
production is just in June within this
month and so if you calculate a little
shipping it will be in the US in July
and we will always keep on pushing with
our ideas and ideals of renewing the
audio industry and I strongly believe
that there's a lot of space open space
in engineering and improvement for audio
reproduction</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
