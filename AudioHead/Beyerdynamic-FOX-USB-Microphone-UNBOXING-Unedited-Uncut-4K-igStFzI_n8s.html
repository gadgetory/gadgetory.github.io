the Fox professional USB Studio
microphone by Bayer dynamic we're gonna
start the unboxing with the on camera
microphone that's from my Apple iPhone
we're shooting at 4k this time out so
hopefully it looks a little bit better
but also you get a sense of what you
would get if the audio file is straight
from the camera and then I can drop in a
little bit from the microphone after the
unboxing so you can get a sense of what
that thing sounds like as well just for
fun 2496 is the resolution this guy does
it also retails for 179 so it's a little
bit more expensive than maybe some of
the entry-level USB microphones out
there but bear dynamic is a big brand
they've been around for a while they've
been doing microphones for a long time
they've been doing headphones for a long
time and this is their first entry level
getting out into this podcasting /
streaming USB microphone market and I'm
very excited to see count out what the
direction they go how does it sound how
things kind of go in this market in
terms of what they got so here we have
it plastic still on the thing we're
gonna this is bright fresh so the box
itself is of course really well done a
little bit of artwork some graphic
designers they have the branding for
this particular endeavor has been it's
been good everything looks good
everything looks sexy they put some time
into the idea time to the box packaging
right a little bit of visual design a
little bit of packaging packaging design
scene here we go
not a bad route to go I always think
kind I think it adds to the experience
when you have that some people don't
care they just like their stock a little
more straightforward
professional USB studio microphone user
manual here we are
obviously they'll be able to oh there is
a mouth on the bottom if you can see
that for a microphone stand or other
thing but this I'm surprised at the
weight it's heavy like oh like a regular
broadcast microphone that's fun on the
bottom this ring is actually rubber ish
okay it's a hundred percent rubber but
it is it's you know what if you bounce
it on accidentally kind of hit it once
or twice it's not metal down there
that's kind of a fun little thing and I
guess in a pinch even wallah but that's
not the case for all the time uh gain
high low not a bad extra setting of
course a USB see connectivity I'm bored
mute don't forget you can plug your
headphones directly into this so the
latency is lower obviously and it has a
headphone amplifier built right in it
also comes with an attachable windscreen
this is very nice if you don't like to
have a big ice cream cone kind of thing
going this is a little more design a
little more interesting look to it I
think braided USB cable included this is
an adapter for the microphone and that's
nice because I've had to buy these
online before so if you have a larger
thread and you need to go adapt to the
smaller one it is included with it
bonus oh and here we have the included
stand I bet you this will get you some
more articulation in terms of how you
want to set
as I said it does stand on its own but
this through the bottom now we have a
little bit of extra oh yeah there she is
she can't stay away from an unboxing
guys anyways so a little bit of uh a
stand for you I think she's gonna do a
voiceover for you oh my goodness so
anyways this has been the Bayer dynamic
Fox USB microphone all things considered
without hearing this just on first take
it is a beast I'm impressed
it's it's kind of got good weight in the
hand and a very portable size which is
important in the fact that it has the
stand makes it much like the competitors
but you don't need it this thing pops
right off it's not as clumsy it's a
little this size I think this form
factor is a little bit superior if
you're talking about the Yeti which
tends to be much larger than this and
also a bit more cumbersome when it comes
to like setting it up with other things
you know side screws and such so I'm
kind of diggin that thanks for tuning in
guys we'll have a little bit more in
terms of impressions and what this guy
sounds like in the very near future
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
