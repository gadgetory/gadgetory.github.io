going to do a quick walkthrough kind of
like what we did for Rocky Mountain
audio fest can jam just a quick tour of
the facilities so you guys can see
what's here or made any deep dives in
any products but I'll just kind of cover
briefly what's going on in each booth so
here we go we're going to walk in here
you can see as as soon as you walk in
sennheisers got a major major presence
at the show we really have on display
the Momentum's connected to my pads here
so just kind of really showcasing that
really fun all the different assortments
obviously they have a wide color range
for the Momentum's but also they have
the different around here and on-air
versions and see this one here is brown
and smaller than this one here that's
red and black so a pretty cool display
there's a bunch of them including this
little portable unit over here we also
have sony music as grace us with their
presence here we have that on the ph a
to the portable headphone amplifier
which also does DSD pretty swanky
looks like over here we have the PA cm D
1000 this is a high res recorder stereo
no less pretty fun stuff and then
obviously their whole head phone line AJ
ps1 is a 500 gigabyte high-res hard
drive in its a music player Class A B
amplifier to channel again DSD also
works with a remote app on the for your
tablet or phone pretty cool stuff I
really like to see this case kind of
improvement especially coming down from
Sony guys who really helped out you know
pioneered the DSD technology so it's
good to see some external support for
sony is also producing a separate
high-res deck separately the USB
high-res tax system here is called the
you da one headphone amplifier but also
supports obviously all the good stuff
including DSD and all the other file
types so nice to see you know Sony kind
of have a wide product swath here for
everybody check out Nobel audios here in
fine form and make a custom in-ear
monitor molds as well as a universal fit
they have a wide selection on display
and nice cross-section of almost all
their products they also are partnering
with Hugo the world's finding the first
reference class portable dekha hypernet
player according to sign here but some
and get her in focus for yes the things
pretty slick color changes as you move
the volume a little bit higher end
probably the most expensive portable one
I've seen in a while a 2395 so some flax
your stuff come out of here from the UK
company Hugo our cord rather side and
cord the name of the products you go on

on display as well as the AKA 240 a big
flagship that's been getting a lot of
press lately ramnath sho fo cal is here
mainly known for their upper ends
flagship loudspeakers they also have a
headphone line now highlight my three
models as you see here on the sign the
spirit one spirit professional and the
spirit classic this display here also
features some of their desktop stuff
it's been putting speakers and this
focal system here on its head fine org
and shows favorite mr. speakers with his
alpha dog line the the newest model

addition to his faustix t-50 RP mods
he's his news iteration very very sweet
sounding system here with the ax lauric
vega deck came to liquid glass to his
clothes back 3d printed headphone

room amazing our work is have to show
the Taurus mk2 headphone amplifier here
a pair of LCD threes connected to the
Vega DAC like once again really sweet
sounding neck also on display the Gemini
2000 and 3000 checotah headphone
amplifier and deck in the base of watch

located in the base they're pretty
presets and stuff that's good on your
desktop on some audio and catholics

well as the more flagship two headphone
amplifiers the HPA 3080 a 5000 here

a disease and mr. speakers mad dogs also

the femto which utilizes a femto clock
the Oh Bravo with a che mt1 and HPA one
they have it's a two-way headphone T
version includes the ribbon tweeter and
then the other version the HPT one is
here pretty cool stuff really
interesting to see a two-way speaker
with two different drivers interacting
at the same time you're fun like to see
these kind of changes in headphones
excited to see where they're going to go
also ZM f headphone mod company also
utilizes the t-50 RP with you a couple
of his new models yes some you can see
some of the older models here that
resembled the same backs but then it's
changed the form factor here to include
a wood backs and in further
modifications the name the Pope name was
the vibro on the new ones here with the
wood backs also on display we have the
new rodeo w a 70 with the separate tube
psu connecta to attend
XC headphones very sexy stuff people
been commenting under the under design
these all weekend on this side we have
the vega deck once again attached to the
king sound electrostatic headphones and
they look corresponding solid-state
electrostatic headphone amplifier then
ate the model is the h3 on the
headphones and the m10 on the amp a kind
of interesting combination that comes in
around a thousand dollars which is
considerably cheaper than other
electrostatic models like stacks which
tend to be quite a bit more than that so
kind of a fun find I've written about it
on the site how much I think it's cool
great sound good pricing as well we're
down here downstairs at exponent a bunch
of really great vendors all the way down
down the hallway but in particular the
woo audio room here as you can see
through the window there's Mike and I'm
gonna head on inside and just kind of
take a look at what Jack has on display
here we have the CD transport and silver
one of his sources that he that he makes
I really enjoy all to make of all of his
in product line some of the best designs
and durability really solid solid
feeling for the product is just really
heavy you feel really well built this
right here is what you may have seen
before the wa seven and silver this is a
solid block of glass on top here that
helps diffuse the heat and dragon and
just really elegant design with that
when I think they have it running right
here from the with a camera connection
kit from the app from an ipad so they
can also be used as a source you can see
is plugged right there in the back in
the USB here we have the wa seven but
also with the wa seven as you can see TP
that's the tube power supply so they've
been running here to a pair of LCD X's
is the LCD X I thought it was just the X
this whole time I've been calling it
something wrong over here we have the
WDS one odds the deck that also
complements the sea transport we saw
earlier in black connected to a Sony
source running I've reviewed this one
myself I really really enjoy it a little
extra power over the w/ei 6 this is the
WA 6se excellent yeah this is the stock
too but you can also get this Sofia up
to upgrade that's a pretty fun so a
really great am running single-ended to
a pair of LCD threes this is the WA to
single-ended headphone amplifier once
again is transport but you can see that
you know wide variety of headphones down
here on display I really love this
headphone as well it's the t1 by Bayer
dynamic a really great headphone a lot
of punch
and I'm really just a great all-around
sounding set up down you're very fun
