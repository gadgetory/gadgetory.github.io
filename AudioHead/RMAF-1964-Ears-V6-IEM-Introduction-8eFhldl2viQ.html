and we make custom in-ear monitors for
audio files and musicians today we're
actually debuting a new product at the
show it's called the 1964 v6 and the six
actually stands for six drivers and
basically the setup is a three-way six
driver earpiece that was really tuned
toward you know audio files for a
natural but yet very musical frequency
response so we what's what's a little
different about this product may be from
everything else out there is we're using
the very latest in technology from from
knowles we're actually using components
that no one else has on in their
earpieces because it's their brand new
they they go way past human limits of
human hearing so you actually get to
just hear all the richness and the and
the harmonics of of the recordings then
we're starting them off at 650
introductory price but if you're here at
the show we actually have free
impressions and we're given them to you
for 575 which we think is a steal so you
know it's we were just when we have a
product now that competes with all the
other six driver versions out there and
and we were really proud of this it took
about two years in development and so
you know if you can get a chance to
listen to them I hope that you can get
excited as we are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
