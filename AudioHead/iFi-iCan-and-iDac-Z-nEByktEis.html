today we have a review in partnership
with the part-time audio file that's
part-time audio file comm this is the
AMR ëifí I can and the idec we
actually have in the forefront here you
can see this is the I can the I can is a
headphone amplifier exclusive for 250
behind it is the I'd AK and that is a
headphone amplifier and a DAC combined
into one and that runs around three
hundred dollars so the headphone
amplifier see before you the icon is
actually a class-a headphone amplifier
it has two external switches on the
front the X base in the 3d switch these
have three different levels of operation
I found the X base to be pretty
substantial it is a really good job of
kind of amplifying the low end without
touching the mids and the highs too much
there's very little change to the mids
and highs and the bass kind of comes up
and doesn't really crowd the mids all
too much which is a really great thing a
lot of bass switches out there are not
to my preference that I think they do
way too much too hard this one does a
great job of analyzing both both the
slam and the frequency response without
messing with too much other stuff which
is really cool the 3d switch is also
three different levels off medium and
high the main things I noticed regarding
the switch is it pans some of the
instruments pretty hard to the left and
the right it does give you an envelope
in 3d experience it's it's but it's you
know it's a little bit of audio trickery
I think that it's a really fun switch
and both of these things you know blast
it all the way up are are quite
something to listen to everything both
switches make things a lot more exciting
but as far as resolution it's not a
substitute for a really good resolution
I think it feels more natural when you
have you know just really high
articulate natural sound but
for a good time call the 3d switch
because it is pretty fun and you can get
more of a surround sound kind of like
Dolby feel to it which is a you know
quite enjoyable in certain situations
the output from this but this baby is
pretty good and by pretty good I mean it
is loud for its size of all the DAX I've
really reviewed out there this one has
probably one of the most highest outputs
for the size in this price range that
being the $300 price range so it
definitely has more output for those
hungry hard to drive headphones that you
know with really high impedances
compared to like the dragonfly or even
the HRT you micro streamer that's out on
the market right now so the shining
point for this amp really is the power
output compared to a lot of other amps
out there for this price range so it was
this this particular one that I can has
more of a kind of class a feel to it
it's a little more organic sounding than
perhaps some of the other amps out there
so it's if you if you were something
with power and you're looking for just a
headphone amp for full-size headphones
this one may definitely one that you
want to check out I did notice that it
wasn't ideal pairings with in-ear
monitors the jump on the volume dial is
quite hefty from nothing to something
because it is amped up so big for so
it's more of a match for full size but
you could still use it for in ear
monitors in a pinch this fine piece of
machinery that you see here is the ID AK
this has a single USB input in the back
that also powers a unit which is a big
plus in my book I like to see that kind
of self powered stuff there's also a
camp companion a USB power supply if you
want to kind of change up and refine the
power itself kind
like a little bit of a line conditioner
for that thing they offer that
separately on the website you can check
that out but for the most part I was
really impressed with this in the three
hundred dollar range
similar to the I can amazing headphone
output on the on the bigger side of
things this also shares an analogue out
and obviously the headphone here as well
as far as the DAC is concerned it was
right up there on par with a lot of the
other decks in this range in terms of
clarity and overall sound staging but
once again the headphone amplifier was
above par in the sense that it drove
much more power than your typical
headphone combo DAX in this range so the
deck on this is actually quite
impressive I found the clarity and the
sound staging the detail and the impact
really clean with this particular
headphone and deck combination it's
maybe not as it's a little more
analytical I'd say than the just the
headphone amplifier alone but in a good
way really articulate really really kind
of a nice combination for $300 if you're
once again driving full sides headphones
is really where this thing sparkles so
those are the two decks really nice I'm
really impressed with how things are
shaping up in this category as of late a
lot of great options a lot of
improvement I really think that things
have improved vastly over the past
couple of you know not just in the past
year if you want to get into hi-fi you
can definitely do it in for two to three
hundred dollars you'll start to give you
a taste of some really good stuff so
that's exciting
thanks again forever everybody for
