is a monster a beast of an amp the wooh
audio waa
thirty-three skaia is not cheap the
standard the base model is right around
eight thousand dollars so this is for
those guys that have a little bit of
extra scratch in the pocket really love
the Hobby and want a state-of-the-art
high-end high falutin 2 headphone
amplifier with a bonus option of a
preamp for a full sized stereo or a pair
of desktop speakers this headphone amp
comes in two sections you can see here
this is the main power amp and this is a
connected power supply these two do not
separate they're connected together by a
little piece of tube here in the middle
that puts the cord in between the two
units this is a change from some other
the amplifiers where there's like an
umbilical cord it goes through the back
just like all the other cords connecting
the two it's a little bit cleaner now
also though they don't separate they are
connected together this amplifier is
very heavy it is like 50 pounds both
pieces move together it's not something
you want to throw around definitely
can't put it in your backpack but it's
solidly built 50 pounds of metal Anna
dies aluminum and it's feels solid the
knobs click good the volume knob has a
good resistance and it's just a solid
piece of American built gear for audio
as you can see there are tubes on the
top that drive most of the juice and
they take a little bit while to boot up
so I'm gonna show you here what happens
if you click this button flashes while
it warms up and you should always give a
tube amplifier a little bit of
time to really get everything going
before you start listening to it so for
those of you aren't as familiar with the
analog kind of old-school technologies
it takes a while for it to warm up to
sound its best so I always give it
plenty of time before you listen you can
see on the front it's a lot of inputs
and outputs we have two separate Excel
ours because this is a 100% balanced
throughput so you can put these stuff of
Excel ours into the back on the top here
and also straight out the front to
headphone the one that I have plugged in
here is actually a four pin stereo XLR
for headphones and then of course your
standard three sorry your standard
quarter-inch headphone jack yes the
headphone jack will work this headphone
jack will work with the balanced input
so it will take a balanced input to
there on the back side we have two
balanced inputs and a pair of single
ended inputs and a pair of balanced XLR
outputs for pre no single-ended for the
pre so it's a balanced idea here a
balanced all the way through it's
something if you're spending $8,000 on
you're probably going to want to also
invest the time to make your system to
make your listening rig balanced which
is not you know the case of every
amplifier it's not the case of every
system but this one definitely really
pumps into that idea and delivers on it
I think from a sound perspective it is
the number one concern I think a lot of
times if things get to to be too warm as
some people use that term the bass gets
a little flabby the bass gets a little
it's not the case with this amplifier or
really any wood stuff that I've heard it
has a nice firm bass tight bass but what
really brings is a nice full feeling
around the mids and really easy
listening trouble that's not to say it's
not sharp or articulate I'm just saying
it sounds relaxing you can fade right
into the music and it feels full it
feels rich it has a really nice robust
not overly analytical but still detailed
sound which if you ask me is a pretty
good sweet spot you can push the
analytical detail idea to the max but
then it doesn't sound as organic it
doesn't sound as real and it's not
sometimes it's not as easy to listen to
this amp is very easy to listen to also
very powerful perhaps the most powerful
amplifier I've ever had in the lab by a
long shot the total output is actually a
whopping 10 watts per channel that is a
lot not a ton for a loudspeaker but that
is a ton for a headphone amplifier it is
a push-pull class-a amplification
topology and it uses six c-45 two for
the driver to a three tubes for power
and all direct heated triodes it's a
heck of a setup and it's quite powerful
as I said as you turn this dial there's
high low gain settings but you really
don't need you never gets it never even
goes halfway with most headphones which
is very nice because one of my favorite
headphones right now is the odyssey LCD
4 and it has about 200 ohms of
resistance on the headphone side and it
some of the game it takes to go is I'm
like near the top of the of the knob on
some of the other full performance
headphone amps it's not even close on
this one it's perfectly right here in
this part right here that's with a high
gain to stage gain to stage impedance
options inputs and then of course pre or
headphone amplification so when you're
looking at this as a whole you're
looking to go big this is big this is
big but graceful smooth but refined also
very expensive but if you're looking at
something that's eight thousand dollars
that's basically a big man's toy you
know this is kind of the area you're
looking at it's fun it looks pretty cool
just sitting out it's a conversation
piece and it's really kind of a nice
holistic package if you're looking for
flagship stuff super fun option I hope
everybody in their life who loves
headphones gets a chance to listen to
this and own it it make the world a
better place
