the show at Newport and want to show off
some of our latest products and some of
our existing stuff so yeah I'm here with
Brian from audio head and we're really
excited to be here so got the a K jr.
this is our entry-level model it's our
single back model our lightest and
slimmest model a single deck wilson 8740
DAC 64 gigabytes of internal storage
space the high res audio support play
back up to 24 192 and single rate DSD
single-ended 3.5 millimeter headphone
output you can use it as a USB DAC a lot
of different ways that you can use this
you can use it with your car as well and
real thin real lights are most portable
and thinnest product and prices start at
$4.99 for the a K jr. and it's paired up
with our aka t5p headphone that we work
with biodynamic on it's based on the
original existing t5p
it's the non removable cable version 32
ohms of output impedance and cabled in
our balanced headphone output 2.5
millimeter TRS jack also comes with a
adapter for 2.5 to 3.5 so you can use it
with a wide variety of other devices as
well moving on we have the aka 100 gen -
that's our single DAC model as well this
one actually comes with the balanced tip
own output a revised user interface
based on Android 64 gigabytes of
internal storage space as well and also
a single DAC model which uses the Cirrus
Logic CS 43 98 DAC also you can use this
as a USB DAC as well and prices start at
899
the a k100 Gentoo moving on we have the
AKP
II's this is by dynamics very first
Tesla driver in your monitor
another collaborative product that we
were goodbye dynamic on very light very
comfortable this is with removable MMC
ex connectors and also comes with two
sets of cables for balanced and single
end at 3.5 millimeter jack next to that
we have the a k120 Gen 2 a lot of you
guys probably heard about this already
but this is our dual DAC model that
Achatz each Cirrus Logic 43 98 DAC to
each audio channel bringing wider
dynamic range and an channel separation
compared to our take a junior in the a K
100 models 128 gigabytes of internal
storage space Wi-Fi capable just like
our a K 100 was which I forgot to
mention and also has the balance depth
on output as well
price 120 is 69 you also have the a kti
you here again but this one will use the
balance cables that we work with crystal
cables on so this is a pure silver and
silver gold core that are cabled in the
2.5 millimeter balanced and of course as
a standard MMC a connector so you're
just not limited to just using this with
kid II's you can use it with a wide
variety of different MMC X connector
headphones and this is actually also
available in a 3.5 millimeter jack as
well so you're not just limited to 2.5
and they also crystal cables and Esalen
Kern also make
to pin cable as well for 2.5 and 3.5 so
you can use it with custom in-ear
monitors with specific to point
connection very cool and this is the new
guy right
no actually this one is the akq 40 Blue
Note edition so this was the part of our
$6,000 collection so this is just a
player from it but we will be selling
just the player itself with the entire
blue look like a Blue Note collection
loaded onto it very cool
75 Blue Note albums all in high res
preloaded into the player it just
doesn't come with the 75 separate micro
SD cards or the coffee table book or the
Jacob the big the stand for the microSD
card
this will run for $29.99 a standard 8k
240 will be $24.99 but if you try to buy
75 separate Blue Note albums that'll be
more than $500 in itself so makes a
pretty good value for a big jazz fan
it's cool a k2 42 for 256 gigabytes of
internal storage space also with dual
cirrus logic CS 43 98 decks creating the
dual mono output only different main
difference between that and a K 240 well
this one will play DSD formats natively
without conversion to high rate high res
PCM where the a K 100 in the 120 will
marry cool standard a K 240 will be
$24.99 the blue note and then there's
also a stainless steel version of the a
k2 48 which was a limited edition
release is they're both $24.99 now the
ek 240 is also connected with the t5p
and 2.5 millimeter balance - and next to
that is our brand new a K 300 yeah so
this is aa the US debut for the a K 304
for the Newport Show it's the it's a
single single deck model so it's we
considered that the entry-level model of
the a Kate 300 single single deck
version it's the AKM a cage 4490 DAC
from Japan this one will also have the
same balanced tempo an output 64
gigabytes of internal storage space as
well
updated slightly bigger screen the plate
ID the UI is a little bit different than
some of the other players but if you're
used to they came 100 and no to 40
playback players then this will feel
very familiar hmm
you can also use this with the cradle
the which is optional with the balanced
output so you can connect it to your
preamp and you can also connect this to
a power source so you can charge it at
the same time as well the aka 300
retails for it's going to be between
$8.99 and $9.99 prices should be
completely set by the end of this month
retailers and online very very soon and
this is the least expensive version of
the 300 line then is that correct yes
that is correct
very cool so moving on we have the akt1
P this is the biodynamic version of our
collaborative product with them it's
actually based on the original t1 p
except it's a 32 ohms of output
impedance where the original t1 p is a
600 ohm output impedance headphone this
one is based on their gen 2 t1 p so that
they do have removable cables and they
do come with a set of balanced 3.5
unbalanced and the adaptors for each
ones as well and the t1 p retails for
1,100
so we have another 300 here and then at
the end here is the a K 320 the 320 is
just like the 300 different body
finishes more of a silver finish and the
320 is a dual deck model just like her a
k1 20 128 gigabytes of internal storage
space it's got the vcxo femto clock for
a really low clock jitter as well and
also the 20 band parametric EQ and I
forgot to mention those two features are
also available under a cake 300 as well
128 gigabytes of internal storage space
and also features the dual deck which is
the same deck as a K 300 which is the
aka 4490 DAC from a KN and retails for
$17.99
so moving on in the back here we have
the entire product lineup of our a K 300
series with the a k 300 the 320 turn
that on here and then three different
flavors of their top-of-the-line a kuat
so this is the standard version the
meteoric Titan version which is the
Illumina duralumin version the black
version here and our top-of-the-line
copper version all the way to the right
now this is our flagship model it still
uses the AKM 4490 Dax but just like the
akt 40 will playback DSD formats
natively with that conversion to high
res PCM 256 gigabytes of internal
storage space vcx authentic lock 20 band
parametric eq as well and this will
playback DSD formats natively and PCM up
to 32 bit 383 82
so oh and I also forgot to mention we
have the entire siren series headphones
except for the Leila twos which which
will be coming for the show
so we have the Rosie's that Angie's the
rocks and twos the Angie T's by the way
and the Leila tooth which are supposed
to be right here but they will be here
for the show coming very soon
and another new product we have this
year is our aka recorder so the recorder
you've got to know vinyl turntable your
healthy turntable and this is hooked up
with the sim audios moon photo preamp
the diploma premium connected the RCA 2
mini jack or if you have RC a community
jack as well it'll connect directly to
the recorder here where you can if you
use if you connect it with the a kiiier
T and the recorder is compatible with
any of our 300 series but with the 380
you can record up to 32 bit 384 and 16
bit all day up to 32 bit and up to
double rate DSD as well while it can
also rip vinyl straight into DSD you can
also record live performances into DSD
or any of the PCM audio PCM waveform at
with the separate mic adapter to an XLR
mini XLR mics and take it to a concert
to record live performances if you're
recording your own performances you can
do that as well so very very flexible
type of DSD recorder saves directly on
to the player as a DSD format or PCM
format and can offload it save it on to
your computer or to a microSD card and
so forth so we'll have a different
couple of different options where you
can just grab the recorder to
use it as a deist vinyl rip or you can
grab the entire set up with it with a
mic the DSD am pack and comes in a
carrying case just like this with the
Pelican case pricing is still TBD but it
should range from the amp pack only from
$6.99 the entire kit I believe it'll be
somewhere between $8.99 and $9.99 for
the entire kit here so that includes the
tripod the impact of and the mic along
with the mic holders as well so the ant
the vinyl turntable that we're using
right now is a c-sharp with the same
audio component preamps and yeah that's
kind of the lowdown on our entire
product line as far as portables go
right now and we also have an attempt an
attachment room which is directly right
next door and that has our entire home
audio lineup that includes our akt1 and
RAK 500 and series set with the full
council for three speakers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
