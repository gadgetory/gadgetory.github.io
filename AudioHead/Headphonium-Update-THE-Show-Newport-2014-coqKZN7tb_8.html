Newport 2014 Michael Mercer and Warren
chief were very lucky to be here back
again with the headphone iam last year a
bat phone iam we didn't have that much
real estate to deal with but we got most
of the top players in this year we got
to expand so thank you to Richard beers
and everyone that supported us also want
to thank this man's as long as less at
this time so we literally tripled in
size this year and thanks to my partner
Warren and you know lots of efforts from
people in the head fly community as well
as the personal auto community
themselves luckily this year we've got
everyone from Odyssey to Darren Fung you
know who does some amazing software you
know you can go listen to the pendulum
'ok wireless headphones you know you can
listen to audio because they
literally make the and it's just
it's just been a tremendous event and
we've you've been having a lot of fun
and people have been enjoying themselves
at Southern California and what's just
great is that not only we back but we're
bigger and the truth is that everyone's
just smiling and enjoying music and
personal audio is not only the new
frontier but it's a frontier that's
bringing us closer to the music I think
yeah I mean seriously if you guys have
never been to this show everyone's just
having a really good time everyone's
super happy everyone is just completely
chilled out there's no stress going on
here at all and well I can't really tell
you what draws on tonight but if if you
happen if you can if you can come out
here and you can stay for the after-show
events you definitely want to do that
but yeah seriously we've got some great
stuff here this time we've got
introducing three new products they've
got the weird USB d screw or fire it's
kind of like I cans you know you fix it
the USB thing that kind of thing USB
power point they've got a phono stage
and a turntable Ridge they've got the
newly r2 on display for people to check
out the Ragnarok is there of course but
hifi man's dr h e 560 I know a bunch of
you been wanting to hear that they
that going on over there there's just a
ton of stuff to do this time around and
I'm glad we've got three days to do it
and if it were just one day like a meat
that wouldn't be enough time we just
told head fires that you know and the
cool thing is for all you asked on
current fans out there that you know
love your AK 108 k 120 as I do and you
can't afford a 240 or even the mark tues
Michael good minutes entrance under his
new glove audio line has come out with a
brand new dak amp for the AK 108 k 1 20
so it basically turns them into a high
res storage device and it's really slick
sounds wonderful it's going to be
moderately priced you're still working
on that and it just feels so stout in
your hand and it's centron sin gineering
all the way and I'm so proud of him for
doing that I think it's a wonderful idea
we love the A&amp;amp;K boys but the truth is
what this show about really is about
exposing people to the edge of the
personal audio arts that is the
headphone iam the show is actually a
high-end audio show and the reason why
we had it here is well Richard beers
wanted to bring the new frontier here
and younger people here but more than
that is that because this is a laid-back
show and it's not CES so people aren't
walking around in suits people aren't
trying to sell things it's really back
the community vibe you know like Warren
says after hours if you're ahead fire if
you're a manufacturer if you're a rep we
go to dinner afterwards we're out by the
pool like listening to Riggs talking to
each other about new music that doesn't
happen too often it's kind of like one
of our head fine meats but it just
happens to happen at this show so you
know if you couldn't make it definitely
make it next year because we have some
pretty big in store next year we both
want to give a big shout out to Jude
mansilla founder of head Phi you know
and all our fellow head fires you know
just lots of people there's so many
names that come to mind you know Andy
Reagan of Judge audio alex ross and
again I mentioned Deron fun with us out
of your head you know software Micah
pendulum 'ok on the guys at SPL you know
our friends alex and nina from y wires i
could take up the rest of this
of you doing shoutouts but the bottom
line is I'm so excited to be here also
with my good friend Brian from audio
head and if this is your first time on
audio head like I said last year in my
interview I'm serious if this is your
first time on audio had eat whether it's
just watching this video stick with this
block because Brian brings it he has his
own which is audio head and he's also on
our audio 360 org team for a reason
because he's a true community player he
everything is pro from the photography
to his sonic descriptions to the way he
describes products and we're all about
just exploring this new frontier and
doing it together and that's what makes
what we're doing different high-end
audio had that in the 80s and then it
became elitist and it broke itself so
far from pop culture but luckily ninety
percent of the world's experiencing the
music through headphones so we get to
turn people on to high fidelity whether
they move on to to channel really
doesn't matter we're just spreading we
love music so why not have great sound
and again if you miss this year be sure
to come next year because it's going to
get even bigger Brian from audio heads
going to be here we're going to be here
our boy Scott Hall from part-time audio
file is going to be here Steven rockland
from enjoy the music going to be here
our friends a positive feedback will be
here you know of course tile and tile by
the way you know you are the HP of the
personal audio community and you know
big love to you brother thanks for all
the wonderful support honestly I mean I
couldn't hug you enough because you'd
punch me in the face but bottom line is
2014 the show Newport and we're having a
great time so again big shout out to
audio head for the coverage in the video
you know we love what Brian does and
we're going to say peace calculator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
