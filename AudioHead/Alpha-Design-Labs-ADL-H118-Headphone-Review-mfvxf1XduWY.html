we have the ADL h1 1/8 closed back
around ear headphone the ADL has a rated
impedance of 68 ohms at 1 kilohertz so
you can drive it from pretty much
anything without having to have a
separate amplifier you can always add an
extra amplifier if you want to loop
behind the whole thing
this film headphone actually comes with
a detachable cable socket that is in the
shape of a mini XLR cable connection I
find it really nice I really enjoy that
kind of opportunity to have a nice
detachable cable and a standard size the
cable is a three prong on the inside
there so it's probably not going to work
for a custom balanced connections but it
will definitely do the duty for
single-ended what you see attached here
is another cable that you can buy they
cost a little bit more it's called the I
HP 35 series it's quite nice it's had a
really great connector to it that I
enjoy overall these this headphone has a
triangular shaped ear Cup which is kind
of a unique design compared to a lot of
the other stuff out there it's it fits
around my ear quite comfortably I did
enjoy it it was different but I didn't
have any major issues with it
it provided a good seal around my head
which is really important for bass good
positive bass response and it was
comfortable to wear over long periods of
time so I didn't mind that at all but
the caliper pressure the clamping
pressure that comes in is pretty pretty
good I would say it's moderate compared
to a lot of other headphones and the
weight coming down is rather light
pretty typical for something in this
size the retail price on this one is 269
$269 and for that you do get a pretty
good sound signature I would compare
these more closer to the HD 650 s by
Sennheiser with their more laid-back
signature so it's kind of have a little
bit more presence in the mid
and definitely in the Loews than you do
in the highs and while it does share a
kind of a similar signature it doesn't
quite share the same resolution I did
find the HD 650 s to be a little bit
more resolving overall provide just a
little bit little more level of clarity
but then again they do cost roughly
twice the price of this headphone so
it's not really apples to apples
comparison when you consider the price
of all these particular headphones I
found did have some accentuated bass
closers some of the mainstream
headphones sound signatures that you see
on the market today so if you like a
little bit more bass like a lot of
people do in your headphones these are
definitely along those lines for what
you can expect so really good stuff
there if you like a look a nice mid and
lower forward bass signature as opposed
to more of a treble forward signature
nothing's too overtly shocking like if
you may be laid back but it's not to the
point where you put it on and it's like
whoa it's pretty balanced with a with a
bass Boop in the mid bass area and then
following kind of a richness tonal
signature up into the mids so that's
kind of a fun thing if you if you're
really into that kind of stuff a little
extra bass never hurt anyone
I find the materials of this headphone
to be pretty good very solid it's mostly
a plastic type material however it seems
really solid all the joints all the
bands everything feels really good to
the touch like it's not going to break
on you very quickly very
well-constructed
headphone overall I really enjoyed this
headphone especially its construction
and its comfort both in the sound
signature and in the comfort of wearing
so I think there's a lot of great
potential for this headphone out there
if you have any questions feel free to
leave them in the comments section here
on YouTube have a great day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
