music oh and yes I'm the guy who decides
what products we sell more products we
make music off we've been business for
about 25 years and what we try and do is
produce and any we do actually very
successful it's produced entry-level
high-end audio we sell inexpensive
turntables amplifiers CD players that we
think of perform a competition in fact
sometimes we outperform the competition
you know by enormous margin the company
can start it that way selling
inexpensive turntables and loops or just
kept that theme
there is a sort of pompous rule that we
have in the company in that I wouldn't
sell anything or bring to market
anything that wouldn't own in my own
home so even our cheapest turntable or
less expensive speaker amplifier I'd be
quite happy to own if it doesn't pass
that test it never comes the market and
there's quite a few problems never came
to market we tried different things we
do we have a bench for a very small
company but we make our own turntables
we get the made a Czech Republic we make
our own electronics in China and we now
we have one speaker I've talked about
earlier or the marimba speaker which has
made is going to be the only speaker we
make because it just turned out in such
to be such a good little speaker we know
why mess with success and try and prove
on it
and it's kind of fun to do because most
most small companies can create their
own products and
it's one of the joys of doing this job
is going to a factory does getting a
product commissioned designed whatever
way we do it and then bringing it to
market and people buy that really gives
me a lot of pleasure I hate running the
business but having people call me up
and say they like it is always fun
anyway what do we have here what we're
showing here is our new turntable the
kora
which was actually designed by a
designer in Chicago
called James with some unpronounceable
last name beautiful industrial design we
want you to have a turntable to look
different from every other turntable of
course it sounds fabulous because we
made it
we're also exhibiting with the new Creek
integrated app which is the 58 850
what's evil 15 evil 58 strange name it's
a beautiful sounding amp and this
incredibly good pair of speakers called
the music called marimba speakers which
were designed by a genius meet and they
retail for $350 and they're just too
cheap are just too good and we're making
a great sound as everyone else will tell
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
