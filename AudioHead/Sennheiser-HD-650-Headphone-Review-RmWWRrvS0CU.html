audio head review this is what we're
calling the classic review series that
being a very classic headphone here
today called the sennheiser HD 650 one
of the top top kind of head PHY
mid-thigh headphones out there
very classic if you ask me classic not
only for the sound but it it lands right
around the $500 price point so used to
be Sennheiser's top-of-the-line
headphone no longer they have the HD 700
and the HD 800 as well however back in
today this was a mighty mighty phone
still is today if you ask me
really enjoy this I think in the price
range there isn't much better than this
one if you're looking for an over the
head around the ear kind of headphone
this one I find to be pretty comfortable
it goes completely around the air and
oval shape which is very nice in my
opinion it goes all around it's not on
the ear it's all the way around headband
is comfortable the clamp caliper
pressure or the the pressure going in
this way with this headphone it's a
little tight when you first get it I did
you know kind of stretch mine out a
little bit to make it a little more
comfortable it's kind of like how I roll
but you know to use own and that
everybody has a head as big as mine so
if you have a smaller head it might be
just perfect for you when you get it
this one also comes with detachable
cables here on the sides which means
well a couple of things benefit really
from this is that these get twisted
around you can easily unplug one and
untwist it that sounds like a small
thing but for some reason mine always
seem to get so tangled
so that being said I really like that
and it means you can replace these
cables with higher grade cables if you
so desire so if you want to really amp
up spend a little bit more to make them
real fancy you can get new cables from a
month to two different places online
these are pretty popular so they're not
too
they're not too hard to find with the
custom cables very nice as far as the
sound goes on these there's a bit of
back and forth you might see online
about being rolled off trouble roll-up
treble with for me there is a different
sound signature between these and let's
say for instance the grotto line if you
put a pair of these on and then put a
pair of grottoes on you will notice that
the trouble is is more accentuated in
the grotto line at least most of the
ones that I have heard I that's not so I
wouldn't go so far to say the treble is
rolled off with these when you put these
on in a vacuum they sound really good
too exceptionally good one of the main
benefits that this headphone does that
not few others many do not do is that
the bass is very very smooth and very
very extended all the way down I cannot
express enough how much I enjoy these
for the bass alone the trouble is sharp
and accurate it's not over accentuated
in the treble range the mids are
extremely good too
so I prefer this sound signature over a
lot of other song signatures out there
however it's not very one just like you
know everyone's going to try their own
hand at these things if you can get a
chance to listen to one that's my
recommendation to see if that's
something that you enjoy but if you know
not overinflated but rather smooth
extended bass is your thing this is
definitely one to check out because in
that region this thing kind of reign
supreme at least for this price range
it's really beautiful it's not exactly
colors I do feel like there's that this
headphone does kind of have a typical
sound to it I think that sound is
something that many people enjoy one of
the reasons for its popularity
so it's not the flattest thing I've ever
heard however the bass is in no way
accentuated out like a lot of the other
you know clothes back mobile headphones
are out there's many many of those like
not specifically the Beats but even the
other ones the portable ones the clothes
back they have a lot of bass that seems
to be a little bit bigger than what
these are much much less than that it's
more about the extension and just the
overall warmth of the sound signature
that really makes these different ah you
know I realize 500 bucks is quite quite
a big price jump from a lot of those
other guys and so you're expecting a
little bit more but honestly this is one
of the few pairs out there where you get
some value for your dollar back you know
being so expensive I think that there's
very few that compete in this price
range however you know you can find your
own tastes below this there's some great
phones for 300 you know this headphone
is part of more of the legendary trio
the Holy Trinity so to speak of classic
headphones this being the 6 the center
of 650 also in that group the AKG 701
which also has the Quincy version now
and then the Bayer dynamic 880 which are
all very nice headphones so those are
kind of like the three different tastes
that people like in this range work but
unfortunately these are a bit more
expensive than those other two
headphones arranged around 300 these are
five but for my buck I enjoy all three
of those so it feels greatly but this
one you know it's really kind of a fun
headphone if you're if you have the cash
to spare not top-of-the-line not the
absolute best out there you know I've
had much better at even treble and bass
extension with the LCD 3s then with
these they're I would consider the LCD
3s to also be a little less colored a
little more D
tailed but obviously those headphones if
you're not familiar with them are quite
a bit more four times more expensive
than this headphones so as far as build
quality goes I'm always been pretty
impressed with these they are they do
have a slight plastic you feel tuned but
they're definitely solid to the touch
and comfortable to wear for long periods
of time they don't carry a ton of weight
to them so you know that's kind of a
quick summary of these classic
headphones for audiophiles I mean the
guys love it I think a lot of people
really enjoy this headphone so keep the
chance definitely try them out see if
they're your flavor they're a lot of fun
to have and a lot of a lot of fun to
really get your reference point from for
a lot of things so if you have any
questions about the headphone feel free
to drop it in the comments section if
you have anything else try to subscribe
to the channel if you guys can thank you
so much have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
