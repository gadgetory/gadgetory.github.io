a pretty brand-new company we've been
around since June of last year this is
our second can jam we're super excited
to be here in SoCal we're based while
we're a new company we've been around
doing the audio business forever we've
got close to a hundred years of
experience I personally been designing
audio systems and transducers and
headphones for other companies for about
26 years now so this is pretty new to us
our brand was really created as a
passion what do we want to bring to the
world that says this is uniquely the
Periodic audio team so we decided we're
gonna create strictly IMS which is
portable audio if it doesn't fit in the
smallest pocket of your pants you can't
carry it around with the all time it's
not portable audio in our opinion IEMs
fit that beautifully to that end we
decided we're designing everything
ourselves in-house we did that we
designed every little component inside
we tooled everything ourselves in-house
and we did it in a way that allows us to
express what we really want to from an
audio standpoint we have three models on
the market magnesium titanium and
beryllium the run at 99 $1.99 $2.99
price points we chose those three
particular units those three particular
metals for a very good reason aluminum
magnesium have a very long storied
history and audio being some of the
first metal cones ever made
titanium came out much stronger and is
still the prevalent material in
compression drivers professional audio
drivers things like that beryllium is
kind of the new new kid on the block the
hot new babe in the in the booth kind of
a thing and so we want to show the
differences of all three to that end we
designed our very own 10 millimeter
dynamic transducer we're not doing
balanced armatures I don't believe in
balanced armatures I think they're of
the devil they were created before the
hearing aid industry for intelligibility
not for accuracy and they haven't
progressed much beyond that in my
personal opinion we don't do multiple
transducers one well designed
transducers all you need you don't need
complicated crossovers you don't need
lots of transducers just one good can
drew one good competently designed
transducers so the difference between
our models then became simply what
happens when we change the metal of the
diaphragm from a magnesium to a titanium
to beryllium what are the sonic
differences what are the measured
differences and we ended up with a
product line that has very very
different sonic signatures even though
99
the components are identical as a result
we've created what we have here these
are beryllium my own personal pair there
are 299 they come with three different
sets of ear tips single flange dual
flange memory foam small medium large of
all of them all the adapters travel case
everything together product is available
now it's available on our website we're
signing up dealers left and right we
just signed an exclusive dealer for
distribution throughout all of Japan so
that information is going to be going up
later tonight on our website we're
expanding quickly and we're super
excited to be a major force now in the
IM world as we're going forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
