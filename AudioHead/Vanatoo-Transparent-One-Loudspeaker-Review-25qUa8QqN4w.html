one by vana - this is a all-in-one
speaker DAC USB interface and amplifier
in a single unit as you can see here
from the back panel there's a wide
arrangement of inputs for you to utilize
with this thing it's pretty great the
price point on this particular unit is
around five hundred dollars for the
black and about 550 for the cherry which
this one is in cherry the transparent
one has a lot of different inputs it's
really great to see in something like
this all-in-one encompassing kind of
thing has an optical input a coaxial
digital input that you can connect
directly from another device if you so
desire however this one also has a USB
input located right here which plugs
directly into your computer now that
will give you a pretty good sound I test
it out I find it quite quite pleasing
and then obviously these speaker taps go
to the other speaker also really handy
in this model if you can see here is a
left and right switch which allows you
to move the source to either speaker so
if your computer is closer to one side
the left or the right you can go ahead
and run the wires that way very cool in
addition to that we have a sub out
located right here the sub out actually
activates with the DSP that's internal
on this on this device and allows it to
do a frequency cutoff so only bass
signals are sent to the sub woofer and
then the rest of the signals are
actually utilized for this for these
speakers when you do that it actually
allows it to kind of free up a little
bit of the the power or a lot of the
work for these speakers and hopefully
you get a little bit better sound
because they're handling less of the
frequency range so that's pretty fun too
I found the volume on needs to be pretty
adequate if you really want to power a
small room it's probably the best size
for these smaller sized speaker
they didn't blow me out of the water
with their volume if you want like to
have a raging party you might want to
step it up to a bigger speaker and a
bigger amplifier but for the most part
they worked exceptionally well when
powering small to maybe medium sized
rooms and definitely enough juice for
more of a near field listening so
something that's sitting on your desk
don't even worry about it they got
plenty of power they also have an analog
in so you can plug in your iPod or or
whatever you want right into it the
inclusion of a digital optical input on
this device is actually very cool
because it'll allow you to plug directly
into an Apple TV if you so desire or
even an airport Express output so you
can kind of have like a satellite
listening station anywhere you want in
your house it doesn't have to be locked
down directly to a computer these
speakers do not have built-in airplay
unfortunately so you will need another
kind of delivery device to get it to
there but once it's there it has all the
digital decoding built right in which
works out very nicely for anything you
want to do out and about the house as
you can see from the back here there's a
five and a quarter inch rear radiator
that helps with the base I found that
these speakers work best when they had
about seven inches or so of space behind
them when they're put up right against
the wall they kind of have tend to be a
little Basie you can adjust that however
with these tone adjustments here so if
it's too close to the wall you could do
this but for the tightest base I find a
little bit of breathing room is the best
actually when that was done I did find
these two have a pretty flat frequent
frequency response which is very nice
not too much bloating on the bottom end
and a nice nice texture on the top end
as well so give him a little space bill
where they'll work the best the overall
signature was good for five hundred
dollars they did deliver on sound
quality and volume they're not the most
acute the most detailed speakers I've
ever heard in my life obviously my
reference system here has a bit more
detail across the board maybe some high
maybe better extensions on the
in the bottom but for $500 not too
shabby
really enjoyed them they have a great
they have a great sound to them and
they're really fun so you can go ahead
and slap them on your desk tech desktop
set up if you want a computer speaker
plug out these are ready to go right out
of the box for that kind of thing also
if you want to have a satellite kind of
set up moon in your house these will
definitely outperform a lot of the iPod
docks especially since a lot of the
price points are pushing past $500 for
the fancier docks if you're just looking
to base straight up definitely something
you want it you might want to check out
because these do have pretty good
surprising base for what I was expecting
I mean it's thumping when it's on the
desk it actually vibrates the desk so
something if you like bass check it out
you can crank it up all the way and and
you might find something really
enjoyable for your taste feel free to
