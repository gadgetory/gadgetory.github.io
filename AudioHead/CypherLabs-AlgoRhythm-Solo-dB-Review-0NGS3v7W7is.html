today we have the cipher labs algorithm
solo DB this is a portable DAC that is
were the next generation for the
original algorithm solo this time around
we have balanced outputs in addition to
the ability to connect to a computer not
just an Apple I device for those of you
who are not familiar at cipher Labs
originally had made a solo with that a
connected exclusively to AI devices and
really was one of the very few dax out
there that lets you take a digital
direct signal from an eye device into
the DAC the Decker would then take the
information transport transform it into
an analog signal for you pretty good a
high quality signal and output it then
to your amplifier so this was not a DAC
amp combo for headphones but rather just
an exclusive deck so really the first
kind of step for component separates in
a portable setup whose one of the very
few there's only one or two others I
think that did that this being the
second generation they decided to up the
ante with even more kind of a stereo
component feel to it with balanced
outputs via the mini four pin balanced
jack this DAC is compatible with roughly
only two other headphone amplifiers in
that configuration be it a balanced
configuration race Samuels has a couple
of amplifiers that are compatible with
the four pin balanced output in that
configuration as well as the one that
this was designed to kind of meet
stylistically amplifiers put out by alo
audio the ARX mk3 be especially matches
this in style and in texture and they're
roughly the same size so they pair well
with let elastic rubber bands to those
so if you want to kind of have an
audiophile sandwich to take with you
when you go that's really kind of how
they're set up to be you wrap them
together in these silicon bands they fit
quite nicely together now through the
single ended output you can obviously
prepare this with any amp you desire it
it works extremely well there's a very
cool LED on the front I file and the
texture and the build on this to be
remarkably great something that you
would expect from a portable dies
something that you would you know pick
up move around heaven forbid you drop it
on the ground but for all intents and
purposes a very very solid build like
you would expect from something that
you're going to be mobile it also
includes a coaxial output digital so it
can just be a USB converter to a digital
signal so it does include an Ocoee axial
output I tested that as well very good
output there I didn't see like any major
deterioration in the signal from the
analog output to the coaxial so good
stuff on that front as well the input is
mostly a mini USB jack but this
particular package does come with a USB
cable to the 30-pin Apple so it is
sticking true to its roots where you can
plug an eye device into this and just
hit the streets the I tested the both
the USB and the Apple inputs from my
computer and it was very pleased with
the results I found the sound to be
exceptional for the price point this
does retail for around $700 so it is
quite an expensive unit as far as
portable devices go I mean seven art
allows for deck isn't just a drop in the
bucket however it I found it did perform
quite closely to its price point some of
the high points from me especially were
in the high frequencies I saw a lot more
extended highs than some of the other
decks in the lower price ranges and even
even jacks around the same price range I
saw a great high end energy from this
one particularly greater detail in the
high end symbols sounded more realistic
and also the mid-range was just a little
more liquid these are all very
small changes mind you this isn't these
are not major dramatic swings in quality
with Dax the the quality changes
sometimes harder to hear then with a
pair of headphones for instance but when
it does come to decks this one does
perform quite well for its price point
this deck does not charge through the
USB port that connects to your computer
rather it charges from the wall wart
that is supplied with it I also found
that this union did not wait while it
does work with Apple devices it did not
work with my samsung galaxy 3 phone so
those of you looking for that you might
have to look elsewhere for that type of
connectivity but overall I really really
was pleased with this unit its
performance right on par with what you
would expect in that range a very very
competitive quality for the price point
which is saying something because it is
quite an expensive DAC one of the very
few ones that connects with Apple one of
the very few solid portable decks out
there in general and one of the very few
that offers balanced output portable
connectivity so all those things wrapped
into one make this a very special unit I
did enjoy it a lot let me know if you
guys have any questions regarding it if
you get a chance please follow the
channel and I'll see you guys next time
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
