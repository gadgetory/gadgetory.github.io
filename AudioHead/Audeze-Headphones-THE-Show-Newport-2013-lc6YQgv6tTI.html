here at the show showcasing our
headphones the LCD twos and threes we
have the bamboo rosewood and subroto for
the LCD 3s we're also showing off a mal
valve amp and a bekhoon combo that were
coming out with in the next month so the
bekhoon combo is going to be bekhoon HPA
21 along with a custom klutz stand by a
klutz design and the LCD 3 what I think
makes odyssey special is that were do it
yourself from the garage company that
was embraced by the head high community
performance of our headphones are bar
none I believe some of the best
headphones in the world and best
performing headphones in the world and
we specialize in planar magnetic
technology I've been in this industry
since I was about 15 I got out of high
school immediately went into recording
recording cartoons of all things growing
up as a musician I just wanted to be in
the recording studio so got out of high
school and right went right into an
audio recording from there I got into
computers and systems engineers
electronics and met a few friends and it
was kind of a perfect storm to start off
easy what I love about the headphone
world is all the different components
that you can test out that aren't going
to cost you an arm and a leg you can go
and find the characteristics that you
like in a component and only spend about
a thousand dollars instead of spending
about ten thousand dollars so you can
try a lot of things out and it gives
users a lot of flexibility on what they
want to hear what they like to hear and
I love the community community really it
embraced Shankar and I and
from the first la head five meet we felt
like we're part of a great family I
think the attendees at least for the
area that we're in the headphone iam
they get a chance to try out all the
different components and see what they
like and see what they you know I guess
our gravitate towards in the subjective
listening they also get to meet some of
the people they might talk on the phone
with for support or or me or any of our
friends here my favorite partner show is
really seeing all our friends it is a
place to get together where people
travel from all across the world and
country and it's really just to get
together with friends and listen to
music</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
