and right now I'm introducing the
shangri-la Hetzel system this is a
headphone so it's like this have been
your cup your pan okay so this is a 50
thousand dollar pension system including
the headphone as well as amplifier the
it is a natural static headphone which
means it cannot be used by regular cell
phones or as amplifiers it has to be
drived by the electrostatic and finally
fires the voltage is very high around
580 to 600 volts why this is so
expensive first in sunny weather it's
all good I have to say this is the
product I meant for myself I'm satisfied
with this you know during the previous a
couple of years I was looking for a
perfect headphones this is what I got
the technologies to make it why it's so
good there are a bunch of new
technologies first is the diaphragm is
very thin as nano scale thickness and
we deposit the nanoparticles on the
surface of the diaphragm to make the
conductivity in certain range there is a
way it works
that is why vibrates in the electron
field okay
they diaphragm is so staying in light so
that the frivolously response can be
very high as high as 100 killed first
and there's another important technology
applied in the headphones there's the
steroids the regular stators is a in the
other natural steady headphones is like
a plate and drill a lot of holes on the
surface because it's pretty thick when
the Sun waves passing through the
skaters there are very harmful
reflections refractions something there
so we want to minimize those effect
so what are we done okay we are crazy
wheels the mental wire to make net to be
the stator the diameter of their wire is
only 50 micrometer very thing even
sooner than your here
because it is same the high-frequency
come 100% puffs rule the stator without
any harmful reflection think about the
wavelengths of 50 micrometer some wave
the we can calculate the frequency equal
to 66 megahertz
that is why they open why the headphones
sound so open the sunset is huge and the
detail is so much though now we talk
about amplifiers so this is a monster
that we've a very big there are eight
vacuum tubes on the top the input stage
are six SN 7 chilled the aqua stage are
300 be tilts the bigger ones we were all
custom like custom-made it for high
fiving the manufacturer called a full
music the to OEM for a lot of big names
we toned the tool by ourselves and we
want to make sure the sound best in the
whole system and also the benefit to
using they become tool in our prosthetic
that there's no transformers so because
welcome to output voltage is very high
they can tear free drive they have in
other words this system might be the
only system you can directly listen into
300 beetles without anything in return
and I also want to talk about the volume
control
you look at the volume control here okay
it looks like it's all digital but it is
actually not it's a relay based step
Antonietta for every step there is a one
relay control two resistors their
accuracy is point one percent this will
guarantee that they get the best sound
quality from the there's no distortion
there's no effect no harmful things
happened in volume control part and yeah
this is this is Earth no this is
something I want to emphasize about
amplifier overall it's a long process
for many many years we design this
headphone system the beginning is 2000
at that time is there's no high fiving
it's a DIY project and then after I
graduated
you know I set up a chemistry lab to
finish the coating technology on the
diaphragm that is actually 2010 to 2013
and then there are three years
afterwards every day we make a simple we
try to fix all the issues during the
three years so we made almost 1,000
samples we so right now we are very
confident that this is going to be a
reliable product and something very well
