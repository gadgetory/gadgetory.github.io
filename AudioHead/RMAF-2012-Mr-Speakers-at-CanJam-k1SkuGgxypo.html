produced the Mad Dog headphone which is
a modified variant of the fostex t-50 RP
that means it's a ortho dynamic or a
magnetic planar or planar magnetic
speaker depending on how you want to
describe it and the idea behind these
headphones is that what I've done is
tried to focus on two key areas of
improvement from the original design the
first is comfort and what I do is I make
my own leather ear pads are made out of
a nice soft lamb leather as well as the
strap here which provides a high degree
of comfort for very long listening
sessions it's a closed head phone so
that makes it really excellent for
applications where you know you're
traveling you're working in an office
you're working in an environment where
you don't want your noise of your system
to leak out or you want a little privacy
from the noise of other people around
you it's also an excellent all-around
listening headphone it's really designed
to be a neutral phone good for a broad
array of music the base is really deep
and extended it's not a base headphone
it tries to not exaggerate the base and
tried to make it so that it had a very
realistic and natural sound especially
with you're interested in acoustic
instruments or live music jazz etc the
last thing about them is I really tried
to make these an affordable product so
it gives a nice high-end headphone
experience but it's at a price of three
hundred fourteen dollars the fully
loaded version and you know I believe
that that makes it an exceptional value
in the market so hope you have a chance
to give them a try and if you're
interested they do include a 15 day
return policy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
