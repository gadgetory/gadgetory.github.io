in there so Cowell introduced things you
go to to the general public
Hugo - yeah first and foremost we've got
an audio improvement Rob Watts has
worked really really hard on the
programming of the FPGA to give you the
best possible performance that you can
confortable product what we've also done
is improved the form and functionality
of Hugo
whereas before and Hugo one there were
lights inside that you had to decide for
what the resolution was what input you
are on your battery status etc so you'll
notice here you've got your power button
and the light is blue so this is giving
you the battery indication charging is
now instead of a wall walk we're using
USB charging so we've gone a lot more
Universal it also has a smart
intelligent charging system where this
will work out that you are using it as a
desktop DAC so it goes into desktop mode
and changes to a like a very low trickle
charge here you'll see cross feed this
is a feature on Hugo 1 but now lit
through the button for these abuse
issues it off setting 1 to 3 off input
selection USB we've dropped the
driverless USB for the full residence
sticking to the full resolution micro
USB we've added
range on the Bluetooth so you might
notice this if you're familiar with Hugo
TT this window here is for the Bluetooth
a large applix aerial in there and we've
added that functionality to Hugo
so the Bluetooth on Hugo one was a short
range people wanted to use it in their
audio system at the other end of the
room so we've enabled that for you to
make life easier for you
now flush mounting on the optical cables
so people who want to use large bodied
optical cables and purred in anyway coax
we've gone to three and a half mil care
acts on this one the reason is for to
help with space-saving there's actually
two tri-axial inputs in there so you can
scroll between the tip or sleeve so one
or the other
maintain the analog output it's used an
awful lot on in audio systems for
desktop tax hypo systems etc one three
and a half mil and one quarter-inch
headphone output stage who notice the
form has changed slightly so the buttons
are on the top slightly squared off
edging it's become more of a desktop
device as mojo has taken over the full
portability but it's still portable
battery-powered etcetera etcetera and
used a lot in refining in office systems
another feature we've added to it as
well is its full remote control
functionality as well
so again looking for the consumer who's
using it in their and their hi-fi system
at home can now use it with remote
control
thank you so much okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
