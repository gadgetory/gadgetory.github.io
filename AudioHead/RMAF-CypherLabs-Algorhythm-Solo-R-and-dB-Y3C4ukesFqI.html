of cypher Labs I'm here at RAAF 2012 and
last about two years ago we came out
with the algorithm solo which is the
first ever portable USB dock for Apple
products this product retailed for 579
and had a spit of output and line level
output and paired up nicely with the ILO
mk2 amp the price on that was 579 and
did not allow charging of your iPod now
we have a new product a refreshed
version of that the algorithm solo - are
it does provide charging so if you start
with a fully charged Apple device about
14 hours later this product will be
exhausted and your Apple device will
still be fully charged we've also added
a really upgraded AKM DAC and this
product sells for $4.99 and we have a
second product which is the algorithm
solo dB that product retails for $6.99
it has all the features of the - are
charging Apple products and also works
as a DAC with both PC and Mac computers
it also has a balanced output so we can
go fully balanced from the Apple
products into the amplifier and here I
have an MK 3 eb amplifier and
automatically detects the source whether
it's your Apple device or your computer
the package is like this and that is
available online October 22nd we're
selling them here at the show a little
bit early the solo are will be available
in the first two weeks of November the
purpose of these products is to drive
really high-end headphones like LCD
phones that require a lot of
amplification and just get a nice
portable rig on the go
Dave maudlin for cyber labs thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
