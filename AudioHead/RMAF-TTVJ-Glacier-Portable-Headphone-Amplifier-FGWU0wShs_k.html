designer and builder of apex IFI audio
equipment we have a couple of products
here at can jam at rmaf till show you
this is a new portable amp called the
apex glacier it's a very thin small
package it has a USB DAC inside that
does 96 kilobits and 24-bit sampling
drives just about any kind of headphone
it has a battery inside that'll run
about 12 to 15 hours and it sounds great
has a digital volume control you can see
this the LED changes color with the
volume instead of a potentiometer it has
essentially a stepped attenuator I see
inside that the changes the volumes of
the channels track really well sure you
can see that there's a there's an analog
input on an eighth inch jack and then
there's two micro USB connections one of
them is just for charging the other one
is for the USB DAC inside you can
actually program it to charge from that
port like if you have it connected to a
computer or a laptop that can supply
charging current you can charge through
either connector but you can also
disable it so if you have something like
an iPad that can't supply enough current
to charge the battery you can use the
second port or even plug them both in at
once if you wanted to so it works with
either my iPhone devices it works I
actually haven't tested any of the
iphones yet it works with an ipad with
the Apple cck the camera connection kit
and that essentially gives the iPad a
USB host interface this is a USB slave
interface like what you'd normally plug
into a computer and does it is it
available right now yep we just started
chipping it think the price is 495 if
you call Todd and tell them you saw it
at the show I think he's given people
fifty dollars off
right thank you so much for your time
appreciate it all right you're welcome
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
