speakers I'm keeping myself busy and
this time I've got to model look to
models I'm showing that I'm playing one
of them is the first of a new range that
we're calling well it's a step up from
the debut and it's called unify and it's
unified because I've gone back to my
love which is concentric drivers I've
been doing concentric drives ever since
I was a calf over 20 years ago
and it holds something special for me in
the way it handles the music but I've
not been able to do it in the debut
series because they're at a lower price
point then I could really do justice
with designing a concentric driver so
now these bookshelves start at $500 a
pair and we have three speakers in the
range $500 for the bookshelf $1000 for
the equivalent Tower and then a center
channel at 349 so these are true 3-way
systems even with the $500 bookshelf
five inch aluminum cone woofer four inch
aluminum cone mid-range driver and a one
inch soft dome that's a development from
what I did with the debut but it's more
refined goes out higher in frequency it
goes out close to 30 K and the key is
not that it can do 30 K it's that it
hasn't started rolling off by 20 which a
lot of soft donors already do the little
dirty secret of high res audio yeah we
got the recordings that's supposed to go
out to 1,500 K but the tweeters don't
but it's all part of what I've been
trying to do recently which started when
I was a pioneer with those best 22
loudspeakers I've done speakers at all
price points all the way up to $80,000 a
pair when I was with T ad which went
into systems with electronics that
brought up the system price to two
hundred and forty thousand dollars
that's a lot of money I realize it is
and it's fun designing stuff at that
level but you often get the comments
well yeah but anyone if you got that
much money to spend on design can do or
should do a good speaker and yes that's
true
but you're still trying to outdo all the
other guys who are cooking $80,000
speakers so you still got a challenge
there and it's a very different
challenge and it's satisfying its own
right because you're really pushing the
boundaries of what's possible but it's a
very limited market clearly for that
price and yeah I won't go into value for
money because it's this law of Domitian
Returns that we understand but I've had
success with doing all price point and
there's a satisfaction of doing entry
level systems because we all you look
around shows and everyone's heads
getting gray we're getting old where's
the either the young people coming in or
the people with limited disposable
income you know people with families I
want people to be listening to music I
think we all do that's why we're here
but there's a limited opportunity of
good equipment at affordable prices so
that's become my mission right now to
try and give people that and give
surprising value we all get asked as
audiophiles by friends I'm thinking of
buying a stereo system what would you
recommend and we'll give her answers and
then we'll go I wasn't meaning that much
you know that's the that's rock bottom
for us we don't know how to recommend
often something below that because
either we haven't thought it through or
we haven't been exposed to it or we
realized that was there was nothing
available lower price that we could
honestly recommend so it's okay just go
and listen for yourself you get on life
get out my way so what I try to do is
give that choice give that value in a
way that
what I want is when you get the product
home knowing that it's been recommended
I don't want you to start listening and
go oh I see what Bob or whoever why he
recommended it to me
it is good yeah I want you to go well I
know Bob recommended this I didn't think
he meant it was that good that's if I
don't achieve that I think I'm I'm
failing and so I'm trying to work that
into all the speakers I do and certainly
it seems from the reaction to the debut
series I'm on to something
people are talking about exactly that
how surprising it is so I'm trying to
maintain that and obviously I'm going to
go up in price points because having
tackled entry level I want to do a step
up but not a ridiculous step up so if
you think of the debut it started to 29
and to $79 a pair for the b5 and the b6
this new one is $500 but he's a true
three-way with illumine cones and the
concentric driver so it's still
tremendous value and it is I feel and
again from the reaction here at the show
the first public showing it is a
significant step up in sound so it's
about double the price and it's at least
let's say double the performance and
that's not a normal reaction to audio
law of diminishing returns as you step
up in price yes the performance goes up
but not as much as the price did and I
think right now I'm the other way around
I can get a step-up in sound that goes
beyond the step up in price now I know
at some point that's going to flatten
out and then flip back to the other way
as we get higher on hiring price but
right now that's what I'm trying to do
so we've got the three speakers in that
range
and I'm trying to show its capability
and also play music that maybe is not
the kind of music I listen to
I'm listening to the people who are
listening
to what I'm demonstrating and comments
about kinds of music and obviously I
think attracting new listeners into it
we can play something other than just
jazz hit and octa-core self still female
vogue I love female vocal but there can
be other genres of female vocal that can
be used to show the capability but what
it does highlight and we all know this a
lot of music these days relies on really
good extended bottom-end for the drive
to the music and generally entry-level
speakers just can't do it so that's my
other goal in the design to give an
extended range from the speaker when you
design small speakers obviously this
small because we're trying to still keep
good performance but also a speaker
that's practical for most people to
accommodate in the listening rooms small
speakers don't normally I have base or
have base dynamics they often give that
up in order to get some kind of
efficiency make it easy to drive but
then you're missing half of the music
and so I'm going the other way around
I'm sacrificing some efficiency because
on the whole pair is a lot cheaper these
days than it used to be and we fixate on
efficiency and how many watts can it
handle how many watts as Miami Fire got
but most of the time we don't push our
amplifiers that hard yes party time okay
we do but most of the time we don't and
yet we always gonna miss the bass if we
haven't engineered that in so that's
what I'm trying to give people and I'm
using for example deadmau5 track to
illustrate not just that the performance
extends down low enough to do justice to
that genre of music but also it can do
it at a surprisingly powerful rhythmic
level
even from a 5-inch driver and I've even
been going so far the this show is the
public introduction of these new
unifying speakers but I've also got a
new ad let's say even more entry-level
speaker in the debut range we started
with the b5 and like I said that was 2
min $29 the last speaker had before I
joined elac was with pioneer the BS 22
and that was a four inch driver and it
proved to be enormously successful $129
a pair really unheard of performance at
the price point but starting with ELAC I
made yeah enough of a significant jump
to that price point because I needed to
differentiate and of course the pioneers
still out in the marketplace so why
compete with myself but now we've come
back down to fill in halfway with that
gap and this is the first ever showing
of the debut before so it's a four inch
driver same kind of style while exactly
the same style is the b5 just small the
box and same how my mid will first same
tweeter but in a four inch size
now four four inch small box you
wouldn't expect any bass and yet what
I'm demonstrating to people in directly
after I show the new unify which is
already surprising people with the
amount of bass and getting I'm getting
great performance out of the b4 and okay
it's not as good we'd expect that but
it's surprisingly good it's that wow
factor again and what I'm trying to do
as I engineer these speakers is of
course no fines driver can do everything
the five inch or six-inch or whatever
can do but it's got to do enough to
surprise people to give them most of the
music spectrum that they want to hear
and if it starts to fail let's say it
should do in a
easy graceful manner so that you're not
immediately drawn out of the music you
can keep listening kneel notice I have
the basis maybe not as clean or dynamic
when I really push it hard but it's
still there and I can still listen to
the music the worst thing is if it
clicks and farts and pops and ah what
was that and he's rushing to turn it
down so if it's the failing gracefully I
think I'm gonna be a master at failing
great say I did act so on did point out
after I'd said that he said that sums up
my life failing graceless oh can you
imagine that on your tombstone
so you know I am on a mission because
it's been a long time since we've had
enough people pay attention to this
market segment and I'm gonna do this
both for the speakers and for
electronics that are introducing and the
subwoofers both in terms of surprising
value and solving practical problems
that people have we have a tagline
expect innovation and that means we're
going to examine the market and it's not
just about can we make the same thing
but better value but let's look at what
are people not doing that needs to be
done and we've addressed that with the
new amplifier beyond the technology that
we've got in terms of it so what we call
the Bosch amplifier it's not a Class D
amplifier what it does is solve a
difficulty that people have in how to
connect a subwoofer into a stereo system
most regular stereo systems are not
configured to easily add a subwoofer and
if you try and cobble something together
you can't play any louder than you did
before because most implementations mean
that you're still running the main
speakers full range so you add better
bass extension you don't add loudness
capability now we receivers are
obviously in a home theater system
they're configured always to really use
a subwoofer you can put a filter into
the main speaker so you cut off the base
from that and feed it into the silver
but not so much for a stereo system so
we're introducing an amplifier which in
a very compact chassis because of the
amplifier technology we use not quite as
efficient as Class D but still pretty
let's say efficient enough to be able to
package 100 watts per channel into a
compact chassis but we've added DSP
capability so that we can find a way to
easily add a surfer into the stereo
system and of course that's easier when
it's your own amplifier our own
amplifier so it's got two dedicated
subwoofer output so just one simple
connection to the server but he also
allows you'd for a high-pass filter than
two main channel and so restrict the
bass that's going into there and put it
into a subwoofer
but then the combination of app control
from a smart phone over Bluetooth we've
got an algorithm that allows us to
measure what the subwoofers doing and
measure what your main speakers doing
and then perform an automatic blending
of the two you know the problem when
you're trying to add a su before you got
face controls you got fingers it
controls your amplitude controls and
basically we leave it up to the customer
to sort out how to add that subwoofer
into the main speakers and that's
because we don't have control of that
and we don't know what the customers
using but if you think about it as a
speaker designer my job normally is to
blend the woofer to the mid wilfer to
the mid-range to the tweeter and I ought
to know what I'm doing but it's still
not easy to do often to get that
seamless sound character how's the
customer an inexperienced person
supposed to stand that chance especially
when all the controls are buried around
the back of the subwoofer so you
constantly jumping up and down for me
listening see going over leaning over
the back of the subwoofer adjusting
controls putting all of that as an
algorithm
into the DSP containing the amplifier
fixes all of that and makes it very
straightforward and at the same time
with the trick we've got of measuring
near and near to the woofer and then
back in the listening position we can
use the microphone in the phone instead
of requiring a calibrated microphone
will kind of cancel out the effects of
the microphone but at the same time
we've now got the ability to do room
correction but it's not on any silver
for that you choose but it's not just
room correction that's limited to the
subwoofer because if you just do room
correction on a silver and you're
crossing that let's say 50 or 60 Hertz
it means you've got no room correction
above that and yet you need it if you
think you need room correction you
certainly need it going on above 50
Hertz and possibly all the way up to
about hundred and fifty hundred and
eighty Hertz we wouldn't take it beyond
that this amplifier gives you that
capability
it automatically blends and they've does
room correction both on the sulfur and
the named speakers and a hundred watts
Channel and it's six hundred dollars and
therefore another of these great value
propositions but one that solves a
difficulty that everybody has that they
haven't been able to get around up till
now without a lot of effort so that's
where we're going with the company same
with the music server that we're doing
dedicated music server that isn't a
computer that you've tried to plumb into
your hi-fi system now I know as old
folks we can use computers but we don't
want to have to use computers in a hi-fi
that's the hi-fi this is my computer and
I don't want to deal with crashes and
updates and all that kind of stuff
now obviously the new younger market is
totally comfortable with computers but
still we wanted a solution where it's
like a hi-fi it's just a component we
put into the hi-fi and that way we're
able to have a music server that's
dedicated and easy to use
but as the interface between the music
server and the user we use room labs
software and for those who are not
familiar with room you need to be when
we look at iTunes and any of the other
programs on computers intended to
organize your music collection and make
it available easily to use room just is
so far beyond pretty much anything else
as a way of aggregating your music and
understanding what you've got and what
would interest you the ability actually
listening to interrogate the metadata
that's all stored locally on our device
and it goes out catalogues your whole
collection but it's doing it in a way
that you've got so much information
available to you and just a simple thing
like I listen to a piece of music that
take a button oh there's the drummer I
don't know what else he does click a
button it scans your it both tells you
everything he's ever done but it also
scans your entire music library that you
have resident say on the hard drives or
available through tidal and tells you
every album that you've got access to
that drummer is on and then shows you a
new screen of just those albums and can
listen to those and you could just go on
and on and on and on spend hours just
exploring very powerful so that's the
the other product that well it's gonna
be available next month
shipping next month so it's this expect
innovation you'll see more we're going
to address the idea of it once again
that the new market of well do I really
want to bother with Dax and preamps and
power Emerson and speakers because what
I normally do is plug a set of computer
speakers into my laptop and I'm done
or I Bluetooth wirelessly to my speakers
what's all this other stuff that I'm
having to get to understand
so given we've got music server we're
going to you're doing powered speakers
that
wired and wireless take why I've already
designed and morph it into wireless
versions for that market to make it easy
yeah I remember when I first showed the
debut speakers with he like it was a
Newport Beach show last year and
compared to what I normally have to do
to set up a a demo or even to bring the
equipment to a show when I was doing ta
D speakers at feelin's Andy pounds and
live as a 200 pounds and all this
peripheral stuff I decided I'm gonna do
a simple system and I used an all-in-one
Bel Canto DAC pre power box one box
power cables to the speakers and I
plugged my computer in that was it I
actually arrived at the show with two
suitcases if half an hour later I kind
of almost set up I want that feeling I
want the feeling that you can get a
system that is open up and it works but
it gives that sound quality as well so
that's that's where we're headed and it
doesn't mean I've abandoned the high end
I still love the idea of how good can
you get and you know it's not just about
the speaker's themselves just in the way
I set up a system where I get the music
from everything about getting good
qualities sound I still enjoy that and I
will be doing that but there's time for
that what I want to do now is
concentrate on this more entry level to
get people excited about listening to
music in a better way it's not that
people are not listening to music it's
just we feel what those of us who are
involved in high-end audio or not even
hiring just audio files interesting how
to get the best out of music we want to
we see what people are missing in how
they
to music and we know just what the
musicians the recording engineers are
putting into making those recording us
and yet it's not coming out the other
end it's like a dirty painting you're
looking through a dirty window you don't
get the full benefit of all the efforts
of that paint and put your painting
we passionate about music as well as the
equipment or at least we should be and
we want people to hear that and go oh
wow now I understand that into play
between this and that because I can
navigate it
that's where I want to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
