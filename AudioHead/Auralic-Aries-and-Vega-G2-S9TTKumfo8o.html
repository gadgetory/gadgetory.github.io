Show and we're demonstrating zuv latest
Ares G to Vega g2 and there's a Mrak
drivings
YJ acoustic Carmel 2 system so the g2 is
orlick's latest and a reference product
line it gave you the original function
of the Ares but with more at once the
function like you can put a two
pint-sized harding in hard drive inside
and it also have cesium machined
hopeiess of illuminate chassis we call
unity chassis and you got a high
resolution true color display on the
front so you can see the coverage plane
also the machines are coming with full
function of the operation manual so you
can operate anything like the setup and
also to access your library and to
select rack for all your playback so you
kept an iPad you can play and you can
also play with a remote control and also
using the machines function so motion is
coming with already because the ladies
that galvanic isolation technology which
use physical isolator to separate the
audio circuit and the precising circle
to isolate the digital noise created by
the processing circle also the power
supply are coming with two dedicated
section to dedicate the transformer to
that you can regulator so they are
absolutely isolated so the son of the
original is pretty amazing
it sounds more an analogue more reach
and this is such beautiful the big g2 is
it's going to be the upper level version
of our new DAC is using our test last
streaming platform to create enough
processing power to
handle the digital signal comparing to
the regular tack we are using a
different design
it's actually a digital recorder is not
like a dad because we have a huge memory
of the processing platform we can record
all the input data into the system
memory and will remove all the jitter
from the input signal and then we apply
the filters we optimize the song then
silence whose attack which means no
matter you use a $99 DVD player or a
$10,000 CD Trent father they sound
exactly the same and absolutely is the
best the DAC is coming with the upgraded
version of the filter clock what we call
is 70 to 50 second clock comparing to
the previous one which is 82 so the DAC
is with a better cloth we also use a
customized attack chip with you you
cannot buy from the market because the
DAC is also working always in the master
mode it doesn't need to log into the
input signal to make it pretty unique on
the analog section we have our latest
r2r ladder network based analog wall in
control so we no longer use the Dax
digital control which we will compromise
the dynamic arrange the output stage of
the Vega g2 also use our audio classic
model which sounds phenomenal with the
original Vega version the machine is
also coming with a pair of analog input
which has a homestead for bypass mode
the analog input doesn't go into the
dock but directly called whose volume
control so it's not digitalize it works
like a purely analog pria one of the
most important function of the p2 series
is we invented a link called lightning
link is a bio direction of high-speed
connection to send post music data and
control command between the
devices so we the Lightning Inka we have
resolved it's a problem of the USB
connection for the instability and the
digital noise but it also carries a high
resolution music PCM after 384 and the
DAT to 512
let me demonstrate a simple function for
the Lightning link for example if you
chain which is a woman
it actually signed the command from
lightning Diaz to series but the woolum
is actually processed in the vague
attack sir is an analog of volume
control so we sell regular AES or USB
connection you can't do that
you cannot control because you turn the
volume and that's actually the command
only goes through the Aries but right
now we see the Lightning link we change
the number you see the number is it all
the way sink to the Vega it's actually
changing the video of the woman it's
goes the best way also we can change
like the settings of the Vega back
through a wider portal or through the
areas of these two using the single
control map manual so exactly I'm going
to turn the brightness of the display of
the baggage into 1/2 so you can see the
difference so so the aries remains
unchanged by the way dg2 it turns light
the G Series is going to be with four
pieces so air is G to the streaming
processor there is a series we called a
processing unit it will do the DSD of
something and the room correction and
there is also a reference master clock
is coming by the end of the year it's
called a layout g2 a master clock so
with a full stack of four pieces we're
going to make a world class reference a
digital source</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
