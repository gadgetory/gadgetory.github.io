here today we have thus entrance deck
port LX this is a standalone DAC without
a headphone amplifier that does 24-bit
96k USB connectivity so it's got a small
little box here it's a small little unit
you can generally use this for portable
applications but of course you can
always borne it straight into your
stereo at home inside the box you can
see that it comes with a USB to a mini
USB connection here that goes from your
computer also we have some paperwork
this is the unit here also comes with
this pouch for the units as you can see
this is us like a cigar-shaped very tiny
nice USB DAC the connector on this end
is a little bit different in that it is
your standard it looks like your
standard big headphone jack what is not
it is merely as a line out you can see
here on the back there's the connection
for the USB this thing's really got a
nice feature in that it is powered
solely through or powered solely through
the USB which is kind of nice if you're
on the go it doesn't require a separate
power connection to the outlet so really
a big plus for portability there you can
also see there is a single LED light
here to let you know that it's on so you
know in is as far as this connector goes
you can really you know use adapters to
change the connection if you wanted to
and not fit another thing but centrist
does sell a reference series cable I
believe this cable runs about a hundred
dollars here see it that fits obviously
perfectly right into their really solid
chalo I quite enjoy this one all the
connectors are top-notch excellent
sheathing and it's
very seems very very durable this
thing's a kind of a beast delicated so
for another hundred bucks you can grab
this puppy and they'll go right your
computer straight into your stereo at
home if so desired if you are on the go
you can also plug this into an adapter
or they are CA bet back of your favorite
headphone amplifier if you wanted to go
that route you can also use this for
your stereo applications of course if
you want to run your computer out this
is not include a headphone amplifier
directly in there there's the deck port
without the LX is included does have one
built in on top I find this one's pretty
nice though I like the versatility this
allows you to kind of run your USB out
from your computer into the headphone
amplifier if your choice so if you
really want to like do that up on your
desktop this is you know this is one of
the possibilities in order to do that I
found this on this is very smooth
sentence uses their own proprietary
jitter guard it's called jitter guard
for to manage the transfer of the audio
so it's not your typical asynchronous
however as far as G regard is concerned
I did not notice any issues it was
actually quite nice pretty much free
from jitter very smooth sounding at this
price point I do feel like this is one
of the better sounding Dax is really
nice it flows very well it's not overly
color in any direction I mean that would
be a verdict especially that would be
kind of a big no-no it's just nice and
clean like you expected act to behave so
very nice on that side kudos to you guys
at Sentra's for that um and it's nice
you know one of the did drawbacks I
didn't notice it did run a little hot to
the touch so if you do you know don't
stick this in your pocket when you're
using it because it gets a little bit
warm but besides that I mean that's not
that's not a big issue at all if you're
just sitting on your best leg so so
pretty nice unit I really did enjoy it
so um that about wraps it up if you guys
have any questions let me know in the
comment section on YouTube otherwise you
can also

stuff on youtube channel thanks again
