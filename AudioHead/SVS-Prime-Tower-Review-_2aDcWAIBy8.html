we are reviewing the SBS prime tower
floor stander this guy is priced out at
$500 per speaker so that's roughly a
grand for a pair and that is with the
regular finish the high-gloss finish
that you see here will run you a little
bit more per speaker but I think it's
very elegant the finish is really really
interesting it's like a nice high-end
piano gloss black a very sexy looking
the loudspeaker is kind of your typical
surround sound tower look however the
finish in gloss black looks just
beautiful I like it quite a bit there
are a couple of drivers doing the
business here creating sound for you and
that is a three-way designed with a four
inch probably propylene clone doing the
mids that you see and then two dual 6.5
woofers doing the low end and that is
all to complement a one inch aluminum
dome tweeter giving you the highs at the
top now it is important to also note
that this cabinet has two bass ports in
the back so a rear-facing bass port to
kind of give you a little more presence
there and I got to tell you with this
guy it's from a sub woofer company and
they really know they really they really
seem to know how to do the low end that
this tower does crazy
nice deep bass um for a tower unit it
reaches really low because you would
nice thump a nice thud I think the dual
drivers do an excellent job the dual
ports are doing something special from
my listening sessions at least of course
with the ports
you want to kind of give this a little
bit more room from a rear wall so try to
get these guys out a couple feet from
the wall don't just smash them up there
next to a hard surface but overall
amazing base for these guys I think it's
one of the highlights of the loudspeaker
is is a very tight very deep base that
they're able to reproduce for our tower
so no nothing lacking there the mids are
pretty good to articulate they're sharp
they're not the most warm or the most
totally rich I've heard but I think that
they definitely fit the bill and for 500
bucks they do an excellent job and then
on the highs I have noticed compared to
some other people there's very good
extension on these guys so the top end
feels like it has a bit more air as if
it projects vertically above the speaker
above more presence more kind of
expansive you could say stout soundstage
up and around the top of the speaker's
that project outwards from a nice Airy
treble so the treble is very extended
extended on both ends exist in it as you
go upward extend it down into the bass
so for a pair of $500 towers these guys
really kind of are sitting pretty they
look really good from where I'm standing
the grill is detachable and of course
you have your standard speaker
connections in the back so these are the
SV s prime towers from the sub before
compare company SVS very exciting stuff
thanks for watching til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
