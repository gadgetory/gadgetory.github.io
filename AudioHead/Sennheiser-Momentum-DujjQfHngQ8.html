momentum it's a relatively new headphone
from the headphone company Sennheiser
famous for a lot of the upper end
high-end headphones like the 650 the HD
600 and the HD 800 all fine headphones
in their own right today this one is
more of a like more of a general
consumer brand they kind of made some
efforts to make it a little bit more
stylish a little less audiophile
in style but a closed back headphone
also departure for more their audiophile
design so this one is a closed back so
sound linkage is a little bit less oh
actually quite a bit less I would say
then there's 650 or even the 800 which
are open back and some bleeds out freely
this is something you can listen to on
an airplane or in public transit it has
a little more of a refined look in that
regard as well this one is actually
brown there's also a black and red I
believe they even came out with some
additional colors but this particular
one is the was the first color that came
out and it is brown the casing is brown
as you can see there on the left the
headphone itself does have a removable
cable which is very nice the removable
cable lets you swap it out the one on
the picture here is just a plain cord
there's nothing on it the other one that
does have controls for your iPod or
other devices as well so there is the
your kind of on-the-go travel controls
wire that lets you swap in and out also
this one without pretty nice legged they
give you that option there is one qualms
I have is the wire is a bit light for
audiophile headphones I think it's
mostly a consumer-grade kind of feel to
it
it's not overly thin there's no real
problem with it I didn't notice any
auditory problems whatsoever I'll just
say that much but it isn't generally as
cosmetically thick as some of the other
cables that the audiophile headphones
carry so there is that but really like I
said nothing in terms of long term
drawbacks at all with the wire it seemed
completely fine as far as the stuff that
comes with it you can see this has a
wonderful case is very nice I it's
pretty small and compact for a headphone
it's not overly big it will fit in a
suitcase nicely and it does have a
separate compartment to store the other
wires and a couple other things in so
that's very cool
great casing you know great packaging
with this product as well they really
want the full nine on that as far sound
is concerned with this product I
actually really really enjoyed it I know
I say that a lot but this one I think it
runs around $300 and for $300 you do get
a pretty good bass sound for a closed
back headphone it is closed back so it
won't necessarily have the openness of
the HD 650 600 but it does have a good
even keeled sound which is really kind
of a hard thing to do with headphones in
general especially when they come too
close back so I personally from my
experience felt like this was a very
flat response which is really good but
still had a great bass response when it
needed to be there wasn't inflated at
any point and was definitely not shy on
the bass either but it definitely grabs
from a nice low spot if it's in the
music so that is the biggest plus for an
auditory standpoint you will see
fidelity upgrades as you go to
headphones like the 650 in the 600 and
the 800 obviously they do have a better
fidelity than this does so overall it's
not on par with those but then again
they cost almost twice as much some of
- obviously the 800 is is more like four
to five times as much so that being said
expectation wise 300 it's right on par
but the the frequency response is right
where it needs to be very fun headphone
to listen to very balanced not too much
grip on the highs sometimes the close
backs get a little too biting up there
and definitely no inflation in the bass
very natural sound especially for like I
said before clothes back I think
surprising to me the one of the best
features of this headphone is the
comfort now this may not be the same
forever everyone let me just state that
- but for this particular phone it was
probably one of the most comfortable
headphones I've ever worn I've really
enjoyed the comfort everyone's ears are
different and I and I've heard from a
little back from a lot of guys - that
not every headphone fits everyone the
same and not everyone's comfort is the
same for a headphone but for my ears we
might had designed these headphones are
if it's the bits like the pinnacle for a
closed back headphone as far as comfort
is concerned sometimes really right with
these something works really well with
my ear shape my head shape and these
headphones clamping pressure perfect the
pads aren't overly sweaty which is very
nice just they just feel really nice on
the head simple and plain so just
something to think about not obviously
the most important quality I think that
sound should always be the most
important quality but one that you
definitely can't overlook because if
they hurt your head or they aren't to
your liking comfort wise they they're
not gonna work for you so definitely an
important factor when you think about it
like that so let me know if you guys
have any questions you leave them in the
comment section thanks for checking out
the video I'll talk to you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
