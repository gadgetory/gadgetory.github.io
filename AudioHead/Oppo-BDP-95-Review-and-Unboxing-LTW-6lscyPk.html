audio head here we have an unboxing of
the legendary Apple B D P 95 there's a
version of this called the 93 as well
basically shares the same video output
as this one however it does not include
the output stage for audio like this one
has so it has us additional Dax included
in it
it also has separate power supplies just
for the audio outs so I want to do an
unboxing it's there's a quite a bit of
good good stuff that comes with this
thing and the review as well one of the
first things I want to show was you know
the well dressed polish as far as this
particular box and unboxing is concerned
it comes with it packaged actually in
this handy bot bag in the back I mean
none of this stuff is really essential
for audio listening but it just kind of
shows well-rounded packaging and
thorough thought into you know every
kind of an all-in-one package for all
the good stuff you get with it yeah
there's not a whole lot extra to buy if
you want to go there up you can always
soup things up by buying better cables
power supply if you want or you know
definitely including some maybe upgrade
the analog cables for sure but as far as
what comes with this thing it's pretty
impressive
I wanted to show you guys the power cord
that comes with this thing it is
probably I would say without a doubt the
biggest thickest power supply cord that
I've ever seen included for free with it
with a with an audio piece of audio
equipment I mean look at this thing it
is massive custer comes with a your
remote standard nuts nothing too special
here i mean it works that's really great
also comes with this box of supplies
here
pretty nice boxes it's included with it
HDMI cable here fairly thick very sturdy
that's always nice also probably one of
the most thickest and best I've seen
included with the purchase is a wireless
transmitter for for Wi-Fi axis so you
can hardwire this in but it also comes
with the adapter free so you have to
purchase that pretty great and we have
here connected to the USB port an
external USB dongle if you want to
attach another USB thing to it which is
pretty nice an extender because there is
a USB input into the back of this that
does a couple of functions you can also
in do an IR infrared extender if you so
wish I'll turn this thing around we're
going to show you what's in the back
here
as you can see as it is packaged all of
the component well at least the single
ended come out puts and inputs are all
covered with a nice silicone cover so
that's kind of a really nice thing too
attention to detail you know that's what
it's kind of all about when it comes to
a lot of these things I like it a lot
you can see here on the left side this
actually contains XLR unbalanced outputs
no I'm sorry balanced outputs for the
stereo out there's definitely a nod
towards the audiophile kind of player
that this thing really does cause it
does si CDs DVD audio CDs does the
high-res stuff as well as streaming and
you can hook up a stick with high res
files or even an external storage here
eSATA connections this thing's really
kind of does a lot of streaming Netflix
those things too you can see the outputs
for the surround sound lined up here at
the top very nice all analog outputs a
separate DAC for that so like I said
before this thing really if you're
looking for great audio output that's a
notch above what the 93 version has this
is really the way to go it has a lot
better power supply going into there and
I can tell you from experience I tested
these analog outs against the digital
optical here running into an external
deck even and I can tell you the sound
is better it is a little more refined
and and it's just a lot you can
definitely tell the resolution is is
better I found it to be a little more
detailed and that right around the vocal
range right underneath the vocal range I
found really nice sweet spot where it
was just a lot it seems a lot more clear
a lot more coherent across the spectrum
but especially around the vocals on this
one something really special with the
output on the analog here I know a lot
of people kind of refer to this as the
reference one it does retail for a lot
of thousand dollars
and there's a the 93 as I mentioned
earlier is 500 so it's nearly twice the
price but if you're looking for audio
output I can definitely see why this one
is so highly regarded especially for the
price point there are probably better
blu-ray players and Universal players
and CD players out there but after this
price point after the threshold of $1000
it starts to get really big and the top
brand audiophile companies kind of take
over and you see a huge increase three
thousand two thousand five thousand I
would have to argue although I have not
sampled all those that you're gonna
start to see the law of diminishing
returns kind of really piqued its head
in there so you for $1000 even though
this is quite pricey for some I start to
think this is where after this point you
start to see the dimension returns kind
of really take hold so there's something
think about when you looking at this but
if you're looking for a good DVD player
a blu-ray player are on the $500 mark
that people speak very highly of the 93
as well so as you can see this it has
two HDMI outputs a hard wired connection
on the left side it comes with a lot of
great things I was I thought the sound
person whose outstanding some of the
best I've heard out of a CD player you
could run this thing right to an
external DAC if you wanted to but more
likely you could just plug this directly
into your favorite headphone amplifier
or your amplifier for your stereo system
if you're ready to go for to channel
listening also has of course all the
outputs for multi-channel listening
through your stereo if you wanted to go
that route too but you know we try to
keep a lot of the listening on on the
youtube channel about to channel when
you really consider to channel DVD
blu-ray players and the high res audio
and not in just CD players as well you
know this is one of the best I've heard
especially for the price but I can't
stress that enough it's very very tasty
the only other thing that I would like
to mention about this one downfall I did
see and we just add on the end here is
that the the
DVD drawer the the blu-ray drawer it
wasn't quite as luxurious as some of the
higher and that's one room one place for
room for improvement that I have seen
there's no you know sustained vibration
reduction a little plate that you put on
it or anything really heavy-duty it is
your standard slide-out tray that
jiggles a little bit so I didn't have
any issues with it but if you're talking
about straight polish it would have been
nice to see a little upgrade to the tray
and kind of you know beyond to be on par
with the rest of the fancy really fancy
kind of players out there but I mean it
I didn't come into any issues with it
aside from that aesthetic so that's one
of the only downside I really seen the
other thing I'd really like to comment
is that you know even these feet you
know they have a very good shock
absorbing material so there's like a lot
of attention even more attention to
detail and you know to reduce those
vibrations because when you set it down
I mean there's like weight to this thing
it's got pretty good you know sizable
it's a fairly large one and in and of
itself by just by the size of this one's
the largest component that I've really
reviewed in a while but the fetus but
even the speeds like they when you set
it down you can know that you feel it
like the shock absorption right on there
so I mean that's a really nice touch the
whole thing really well-built
and I kind of like the styling too it's
it's subtle it looks good as we're fine
it's not too flashy looks like a good
piece of equipment sitting on your on
your rack so if you guys have any
questions feel free to drop them in the
