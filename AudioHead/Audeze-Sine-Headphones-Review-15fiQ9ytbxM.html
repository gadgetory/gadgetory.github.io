the Odyssey sign closed back on ear
headphone this is the least expensive
headphone a disease has ever produced
they are a planar magnetic technology
headphone company which means that it's
a little bit different than your typical
dynamic driver the average loud speaker
and headphone are you know comprised of
these dynamic drivers this is a much
different technology usually very
expensive they make very high-end
audiophile headphones but this is the
first time they made something or on the
$500 price point that $500 includes a
cypher lightning cable that connects
directly to your iPhone or eye device
which you can see here on the left so
that separates the DAC and the amp out
of the device out of the iPhone and into
this little chip that's embedded in line
in the wire you could have the headphone
without that with a regular 3.5
millimeter wire if you deserve $50 less
but this review is one of with the $500
version with the wire so as I said at
the top of the video this is a on-ear
headphone also close back so you can
wear it in on the subway or on your
community won't necessarily bother
people outside of you as much it also
does a pretty good job of keeping that
noise out of from the outside it's not
the most ceiling headphone I've ever
heard but it does keep outside noise out
so it gives you a bit better kind of
definition inside the ear cup if you
will instead of an open-back headphones
which can leak a bunch of sound and for
five hundred dollars it's a little bit
on the higher end if not the most
expensive closed back on here I have
experienced but for that price is also
probably one of the best it is highly
defined if not
par for $500 even a little bit above so
for 500 bucks in terms of pure
definition information retrieval
ITA's whoo it's way up there it is at
500 or not or not above compared to
other things you can get at that range
however from the clothes back design and
being on ear it can sometimes have like
a more closed in sound that it just
seems closer to your head then let's say
an open open headphone does which
projects out further that's a pretty
cool effect to have but you know it's
pretty cool really high definition in
that exchange it kind of gives you a
three-dimensional really articulate
really just clear clear picture of what
you're listening to I think that's a
very very good quality to have and
something that you know I look for in
every headphone top marks in that range
in terms of the frequency response
everything seems really nice so
everything's really flat basis and
overdone mids aren't put forward treble
is not ridiculous feel smooth the
transition from low to high is very very
even which is something that I think is
also very very important the bass has
punched the bass s land the planar
magnetics usually have a lot of good
punch a lot of impact right to your head
which i think is a great great feature
have in a nice headphone punch slam but
even non bloated bass that's what you're
looking at with this guy it compared to
some of the other oddities headphones I
actually think this has a more even kind
of signature as you go up into the
treble that is I very much like the
signature of a laid-back kind of awe
disease nice neutral easy to listen to
relaxed sound this is is relaxed but
also I feel like has a little bit more
in the treble presence so I was a little
more extension a little more a little
more air perhaps up at the top and of
thing so a little more trouble if you're
just saying a well as there's trouble
yes there's a little bit more trouble I
think
then some of the Odysseys other
headphones to me though it sounds nice
and even and these are very small you
know kind of changes they're not huge
some people might not even notice some
but full marks standing ovations for
this type of even-keeled delivery across
the frequency range with high detail the
only other drawback is that it isn't on
here so while I found the the headphone
comfortable for shorter listening
sessions on ear designs in general are
not my preference for long term when the
ear cup rest around your it doesn't make
your I don't know if in my in my
experience it doesn't make it as quite
as sweaty it's not like you know fabric
generally pressing directly on the ear
so it does the there are some drawbacks
in terms of the design that are
inherently here but if you're in the
market for on air like it doesn't bother
you which it doesn't bother everybody
this the headphone you know it's it's
probably one of the best headphones I've
ever heard in that department as far as
on the ear also the build seems very
very solid the leather headband feels
pretty high-end the design is somewhat
simple and straightforward but I feel
like the quality is higher the yoke the
metal band is all very very thick it
doesn't feel flimsy in the least it lies
completely flat for transportation and
portability which is also nice for those
kind of compact headphones because
really the around the ear ones don't
come in that really compact form factor
either so it's something you got a
balance as well these guys can be thrown
in a bag throwing in an you know in a
flat kind of layout which really makes
them kind of easy to transport so on the
go definitely something I'd recommend in
terms of the cypher cable itself I did
notice a little bit more fullness in the
base in mids but it was plugged in I
feel like the definition is slightly
better than what you hear directly from
the phone but all of this also include
a app that allows you to adjust the
frequency response from the headphone
from the piece in the wire directly so
it doesn't act as a source akyuu setting
but rather it is something that goes
directly and stays with the headphone
which is really cool so if you don't--if
let's say the hippo does not exactly the
way want you have a chance to adjust
that guy and it'll just stay like that
- exactly your preference from my
experience EQ worked really well it does
just as you expect it didn't really
affect the sound quality too much and
including that external deck and
headphone app we sounded much different
I think than just plugging directly into
the iPhone with the other cable but you
get to augment it a little bit you get
to make it to your preference so who is
it worth the 50 bucks I did you know if
you don't have an iPhone it's not a
question but if you do have an iPhone I
would say it is it's a nice cable it's a
thick cable it has these little inverse
hooks this goes for both cables by the
way that so if someone pulls on the
cable it won't pop out of the jacket it
has a capability just kind of stick in
the jack in it with its like a reverse
hook design but I'd say if you have an
iPhone and you're buying these
headphones you the EQ alone I think it
is worth it in that if you don't like
what you get her out of the box you can
really make it fine-tune it and for me
I did do a little bit of fine tuning but
I tend to do all my reviews just as is
so the review for this um I did listen
to the cable and listen to the
differences but most of the critical
listening I did was on my reference
system with the regular analog cable so
to really give it a good apples to
apples comparison with other things on
the market so this has been the sign
$500 on ear closed back headphone by all
disease great little by I'm so excited
to see things evolving in this range
bring you down the technology making it
more portable making it lighter and make
it easier to wear and
then really just making a full package
for those iDevices and and that gives
you just a couple of steps closer to
your favorite music thanks a lot for
watching see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
