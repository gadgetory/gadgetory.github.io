another audio head youtube video review
this time around we have the x1 by a dl
retails for around 480 dollars and it is
a DAC and headphone amp combination in
one small unit the footprints roughly
size of the new iPhone so it does pair
really well with that kind of a thing if
that's what you're looking for the
finish on the top is very nice it's a
nice metal kind of semi-gloss machined
black look which is very cool and the
sides are actually covered with more of
a rubber feeling as well as the back so
the rubber kind of texture is very
characteristic of like the Evo phone
they had a few years ago sometimes they
cover it used to cover them with a more
rubber like substance so all things
considered the build and the texture
very solid with this one for four
hundred and eighty dollars even the
price is a little bit on the higher side
but the quality of the build is kind of
up there as well with the guys that play
in that range which is really nice on
the top of this you can see that there
are resolution indicators that light up
with a corresponding feed that you're
giving it it's a really nice setup I
like it when a DAC tells you what you're
getting so you can verify it if you
don't have that kind of software on the
back end doesn't do the new audio files
audio file darling of the day which is
DSD but there's not really much of a
selection in the way of DSD music to
begin with so it's not that big of a
deal with this unit particularly I did
find that this the x1 drove headphones
in the mid-range really well there was a
slight buzz for it within your monitors
but nothing that you know didn't get
covered up as you turn the volume up but
for almost every headphone I tried it
with nine Coos LCD to even the 300 ohm
HD 650 which is kind of hard to push no
problem whatsoever the thing clear
sailing sounds great the DAC on this
thing is actually quite impressive I
really enjoyed it a lot you can connect
it to an external source via
and obviously the analog outputs which
is nice because you can isolate the deck
but also optical if you wanted to keep
going digital to the other side so
that's really versatile in that we are a
lot of different options there in the
front you can even plot analog analog
input into it so you have it you can
isolate the headphone amplifier if you
just needed that so I really really
enjoyed all the ins and outs of this
really kind of diverse applications you
can put it into all kinds of fun stuff
from the optical out like I mentioned
before to isolating the headphone
amplifier you can really do a lot with
it and it's also quite compact and small
I guess one of the biggest perks I
haven't mentioned yet is that it
actually does Apple compliant
connectivity so if you've got your iPad
or iPhone it connects directly into
there via the USB port in the back so
you can just plug the your cables you
already have right into there
now ADL also makes smaller lengths of
cable that are more appropriate if you
want to like latch these two together
somehow you can connect it to the micro
USB cable into your computer and use it
as up up to a 192 Hertz DAC which is you
know pretty good stuff both ways if you
have that kind of versatility plug in
both things and ready to rock and roll
just like that so it also charges
through the micro USB in the back so
when you connect to the computer it's
also charging I found the sound from
this unit to be really good really
really about the price point from the
headphone amplifier that you would
expect around this range detail was good
bass response was even vocals were even
they not you didn't push him too far
forward they weren't recessed back
everything was nice and flat just like
you'd expect I did think that the deck I
almost outperformed the headphone
amplifier because limited space but the
tach has pulled off very very nicely
this thing is an all-around great piece
if you
looking for a lot of different stuff in
one package that's also portable and
feels really sturdy in the hand this is
probably something you'd want to
audition all kinds of good stuff coming
in and out great sound great DAC on it
does a lot the really high resolution
stuff including apples so it's probably
one of the most all-in-one kind of
portable packages I've reviewed to date
really cool the company also makes a
head phone to partner with this it's
called the h-11 eight that we did a
review for which is kind of you know a
nice pairing as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
