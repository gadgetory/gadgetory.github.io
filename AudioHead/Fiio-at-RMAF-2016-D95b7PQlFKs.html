I should start with our newest product
it's the it's the 99 dot X in the
all-new x1 it's the X 1 2nd gen yes
exactly we actually have three one in
black Quentin rose gold and we also have
one in silver it's the silver one that
you're looking at right now so the well
the biggest there's three big things
that we considered new here one is the
build quality I am pretty sure in your
hand right now it actually feels pretty
nice nice smooth rounded edges and it's
actually all metal compared to like the
previous like plastic like construction
of the previous x1 um the second thing
is the touch wheel so now it's more like
the ipod classic wheel rather than the
scrolling cookie wheel that we had we
had in their older players and the third
thing is well at least it's more for the
general population like general public
it was bluetooth capability so you can
actually use wireless headphones with it
now and this will play all your D hi res
music files the only thing won't do is
DSD but I mean how many people have DSD
I mean the most people done so alright
um the other thing and then we also have
the x3 somebody's listen to that right
now which is your two hundred dollar
player it's a step up in sound quality
that's and it can also do DSD those are
the two main things i would consider to
be you know the upgrades over the x1 the
x5 isn't even is the next step up at
three hundred fifty dollars it's a the
band main features over the x3 would be
that it has a big a better and bigger
screen it has dual micro SD card slot so
if you put 200 two of these 286 gigabyte
micro SD card slots again 512 megabytes
of storage and good see it has it's
slightly even more power and then
finally we have the x7 the XY the x7 is
our top-of-the-line touchscreen android
digital audio player it's starts from
five and fifty you get the body itself
it goes up to 650 of you buy another
hundred dollars at module so besides a
touchscreen into android capability
which allows the Dino to do you know put
any streaming music
on it so you can do Spotify title all
these all that other good stuff the
other thing would be dishonorable aunt
modules the the switch so basically all
you just stick to take off two screws
unplug it in I'm talking whatever your
aunt Maude's you have in plug it plug
another new one in and then yeah so we
have like a bunch of different and
modules for different kind of headphones
so am 14 iems you know low not much
power but load very no low noise floor
am 24 medium power headphones and an am
54 really hard to drive like big
headphones and then you also have a m3
for people without their who have want
to use their balance heavens and yeah
one thing that we do we're kind of proud
of here is that we're demonstrating the
x 78 the balance and module damn door
and module with the abyss headphones
which are notoriously which are
notoriously inefficient and well well I
don't want to say too much but I think a
lot of people will be purses prize and
how well our little little player
actually drive this huge thing that's
cool yeah yeah and yeah well well hope
if you're here at the show hopeful you
can stop by our booth in and see what's
what we have we're proud of what we have
