here with another review this time with
the classic a K 100 by Elston current
this is a digital audio player a
high-res digital audio player let's come
out about a year ago I think now but it
is a phenomenal little player a great
step up from the Apple product line it
comes with a high-res playback obviously
one of the best it does all the way up
to 192 so it does as a wide variety of
file type playback you can also check it
out on the website they have a detailed
list of every single file type but it is
Fermoyle firmware upgradeable so that's
good so any changes coming out in the
future
they can definitely adapt to those kind
of things as you can see here the volume
controls is kind of unique from at least
all the Apple stuff and that has a
physical volume knob control here it's a
digital control but it works really well
and I kind of like having that there you
can reach into your pocket without
looking at the screen and just the
volume here and on this side let's see
if I can get this looking good you can
see three buttons the top one for track
up track down and then pause play in the
middle very cool because the once again
you have to pull it out of your pocket
you can just grip this thing and adjust
away
now you can also of course adjust things
directly from the touch screen they have
here which is pretty nice the track
forward track back play here is the menu
as you go back all songs album and
artist scrolls playlist john ramos
played mastering quality sound folder
setting
there's also an internal EQ available
that you can toy around with but for the
most part the interface is pretty
awesome maybe not as slick as some of
Apple's stuff up but I think it works
absolutely fine only the most nitpicky
or people who looking major Apple fans I
think would have any problem with it
whatsoever it is it works great it plays
great and most of all what you're
probably wondering is how does it sound
this particular I think sounds
absolutely phenomenal for in-ear
monitors custom in-ear monitors is one
of the best out there mainly because the
background is absolutely black it black
as it gets the details the dynamic kind
of contrasts from black to white as you
as you hear things is amazing it is so
dark
it sounds very unique in that regard it
sounds very special in how black and the
texture and just that kind of blank
space on which to kind of paint the
acoustic canvas if you all the canvas is
so nice and black on top of that the
fidelity is phenomenal when you think
about it you have a player straight to a
DAC and this end this particular chipset
is the wolf's t'en is a Wolfson brand to
an headphone amplifier so really you're
getting kind of a nice package for the
retail which is actually $6.99 so it is
a deal more than the Apple but you're
actually getting quite a bit for that in
in in that you get like a real piece of
high fidelity equipment here so as far
as moving up to scale so in ear monitors
they're kind of tricky you know they can
oh they always reveal a lot of
background noise that's that's the thing
that's what makes them really tricky no
problem with that so ever in fact some
of the best kind of sound quality you
can get from a custom in-ear monitor
with these in fact I've seen them used
that shows all the time from the big
guys as a reference so that says a lot
by itself but on top of that with a
little it kind of Lamoure the low
resistance headphones the LCD threes
driven
I've actually seen a disease use this in
a demo as well so there it matches
really well with those magnetic planar
headphone styles the AH disease that are
easier to drive so the he6 by - which is
a very high impedance kind of hard to
drive headphone will is probably not the
best pairing for this I don't think it
has enough juice for the that big boy
but the disease line especially the
closed back which is even easier to
drive than the LCD 3 the LCD XC oh good
match for these things if you are you
have a really hard to drive headphone
you may want to look at an external
amplifier you can plug in one right I've
done it before right here with to the
headphone amplifier and you turn this
all the way up to 75 at the top and I
just one more thing you could actually
see once you adjust this you can
actually slide the volume with your
finger as well so there are two ways to
adjust the volume just as a side note
any case headphone selection is is
pretty good I think the sound quality
with the right headphone is phenomenal
they have recently bumped up the product
line so there is one below this called
the ak10 one above called the aka
120 and then now just a brand new
flagship called the aka 41 I believe is
much higher so the product line is
really good and if that's any sign at
all is how this unit is doing I think it
is a very positive one so a really cool
product if you get a chance to check it
out I highly recommend it this is one of
those products that I actually I do
recommend in a big way it's a great
product if you can afford it I know
$6.99 isn't isn't in the pocket of
everyone but as far as something that is
a step up from your standard you know a
lot of people play on their stuff on the
phone if you want to step up from your
phone and got the money to invest this
is definitely a great place to start and
like I said if you really want to go
check out some of the higher models
because they even go higher than this
one but as a starting point you
really do see some incremental better
sound quality out of this out of then
let's say your phone especially if
you're looking at custom in-ear monitors
so really fun stuff thank you guys for
checking out the videos and subscribe if
you can take it easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
