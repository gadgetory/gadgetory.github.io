at the ADL alpha design labs by furrow
tech booth here I got some really cool
stuff some stuff that's just been
announced here at the show and has not
been released into the wild quite yet
but we have the new h 118 headphone
located right here that should be due
out in a couple of months additionally
we have the XL I'm sorry the x1 portable
headphone amplifier it does well 24 bit
192 it also has a headphone output and
it also connects to Apple devices
similar to a lot of the Apple compliant
dax we've seen as of late which is
really cool the x1 deck runs 5 50 and
the headphone runs around 300 ADL also
has their previous implementations of
the deck market on display we have the
ADL GD 40 which is a really great
headphone a player in deck and then the
east Brett's that we did a full review
on just last week looking an excellent
job very laid-back sound really enjoyed
that one as well the cruise is more of
the portable side the company also has
the stride which is not on display here
so a nice full array of dax a different
price much to choose from</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
