sennheiser urbanite on your headphone
the urbanite family had a pretty funny
ad campaign that came out a while back
its main competitor is the beats style
headphone presumably the beats solo2
right now so it's a very interesting
headphone like I said it's belonged to a
family of homes there's an XL version
that goes around the ear it's also a
wireless version now but this is the
regular old vanilla wired regular
urbanite pretty exciting fun stuff for
you know those mainstream consumer
brands it retails for around two hundred
dollars but I've actually seen online as
low as 100 dollar so that actually makes
it kind of you know pretty inexpensive
headphone a hundred bucks on amazon I is
really you know putting this almost in a
different category but if we kind of
evaluated along the lines of two hundred
dollars in the competition in that field
at least for a starting point I the
first thing I'd like to say about this
headphone is that it is extremely
comfortable to my head to my ears on
ears aren't exactly my favorite I
usually prefer a round but this
particular one on the ear there's a nice
plush velvet lining and then the
headband is basically made of this
rubbery substance that seems pretty
resistant to like head grease or sweat
that you could wipe off but the outside
styling on this one at least this is the
sand colored version has like a canvas
stitching across the outside band all
very cool touches in the hand it feels
sturdy the hinge specifically feels very
very sturdy as well it flaps back and
forth pretty easy it feels robust it
looks you know pretty good for 200 bucks
and there's like a nice highlight trim
so just overall the build the look of
styling feel like time was taking and
it's not just kind of like slapped
together last minute with cheap parts
now for the sound on this one we're
really looking at another like the beats
line of headphones something that is
accentuated in the base it's a little
bit inflated there's a little extra bump
little extra thump a little something
extra that makes you jump however this
particular hydrophone I felt compared
directly to the beats solo2 did have a
little bit more of the low-end drive to
it it hit a little bit harder with bass
drum beats there's a little more
thumping a little more to do in your ear
which translates to me as being a little
bit more fun even though it's not a
neutral headphone like a lot of the
audiophile ones it did have a lot of
thump and a lot of pick-me-up kind of
get going gvgv kind of music so all
those fun qualities fun energetic
visceral qualities to have in a
headphone the mids on this particular
review sample that I received were
backed off a little bit maybe even a
little bit more so than the beats solo2
so they weren't quite as forward vocals
weren't quite as forward even as the
beats were so in in my opinion they were
a little bit recessed and then the
trouble kind of came out a little bit
now not overly extended like a really
high-end headphone maybe like that high
five man 5 60s kind of extension but I
was not necessarily even that
disappointed with way how organic it was
for a two hundred to one dollar
headphone the organic kind of natural
sound of treble was pretty pleasing even
though it wasn't the most extended that
I have heard so you know impressive for
both sides up and down when it comes to
the frequency response overall if you're
into bass-heavy frequency response this
might be a really fun headphone free
listen to like
it's it feels energetic it's not neutral
not meant for studio monitoring but uh I
mean if you're into that thump this
might make you something that you like
so the other thing is X does come with a
carrying bag and it does fold up pretty
easy into a smaller size smaller
footprint so you can stick it in a bag
and whatnot without having the end stick
out it also comes in a couple of
different versions but this one had a
flat cable with inline media and answer
calls and nothing for your cell phone so
like the urbanite name kind of hints to
it is intended for being mobile going
through urban environments commutes that
kind of thing and that in that regard it
seems well executed as well so just to
recap the Sennheiser urbanite regular
not excel the wired version here and
it's pretty interesting really a really
kind of a fun little piece coming out
from sennheiser if you have any
questions hit me up in the comments
