we're here at the gerry harvey booth
these are the No Roxanne's its flagship
headphone with the adjustable base 1599

the carbon fiber face plates very cool
they had 12 drivers on each side so
they're kind of a beast of a headphone
but from everything I heard at the show
here and they sound awesome
yes

with momentum on ears we have a wide
range of your colors on display to the
left here we have on the sony display
they have this pretty interesting deck
here it's an all-in-one $1,000 does
double DST drives amps drives speakers
through the amp brother sorry headphone
amplifier external it also has a hard
drive on it that lets you not as good
playing music right off it like a music
sober difference in that and that's the
H the APS 10 this is the H was that you
said pata to the HPA to and it'll be on
the market next year does double DSD
what's the retail five to 99 599 at for
an amplifier a portable dash
worth the audio booth here is the
Ragnarok prototype as as you can see
1,500 will be the price also a head
headphone amplifier and speaker
amplifier there'll be a matching DAC
release much later but this one is still
just a prototype so that's coming out
looks good sounds good too from when I
heard balanced 4-pin output for the
headphone in the front as well just
single into speaker taps in the back
they also have a new smaller headphone
amplifier that is tube 119 as you see
call the valley or maybe volley like the
magni and modi it fits a smaller size
and also
a smaller price point so this is
interviewing at the good / specular but
it's quite small prepared to a lot of
the other amps out there now we're up to
woo audio stand here this is the
fireflies wa7 it's pretty popular right
now with the head 5 crowd what you see
here is actually a separate power supply
for it that he's coming out with so the
