feet above earth and sky
so totally different than the five the
five and the six are going to be round
in parallel production the six the druid
six is completely new it's also twice
the price of the Eldred sorry about that
but what you get is you get new
composite cabinetry which is much
quieter than the old one a new housing
assembly which is part of the
construction so if you zoom in on the
bottom you never lie on the bottom this
is part of the driving house so the
housing assembly for this is totally
different so the you know even though
we're high-efficiency we still only have
you know a 10 percent power transfer
from the diaphragm into the air so 90
percent of that energy which is still
quite a bit is still having to be moved
in damp in the cabinet so that happens
in the framework transferred into the
base
we got lower extension we got better
highs it got better mid more snap more
shove more pop yeah it sounds pretty
awesome I don't have any articles
I didn't bring stuff to show you Rob
hearthrob parts are actually pretty cool
to look at but what we do is we sandwich
the tweeter the whole tweeter assembly
is sandwiched into the cabinet so it is
a stressed member to use motorcycle
lingo or car lingo the full range driver
frame this trim ring is actually part of
the housing this is you're seeing the
housing and it's a conical fit so it's a
45 degree or a 90 degree conical fit so
it seats into a 90 degree socket into
the cabinet and then again in the back
this is the compression tension element
so it both puts it under tension and
compression and makes it the focal point
the cost will pop on our drivers for
hundred percent it's so the membrane is
the same profile the surround is the
same surround but everything else has
changed
on this drive unit so the membrane is
still paper core but we're doing some
and here I have to talk secret sauce
because everybody says carbon nanotubes
this carbon nanotubes that this is real
cool stuff I can't talk about what we're
doing but it makes a sonic difference
that's the main thing and we can repeat
it we do it we make everything in-house
that whole thing is made in ogden the
machine works done in ogden the
steelwork eminence does coils eminence
does magnet eminence does on this Radian
does the back half of this so the
gradient in Orange County down here
they're doing the tweeter assembly so
we're using an off-the-shelf radiant
drive unit and we're using a custom
diaphragm it's still there aluminum
alloy which we think is special we're
not using the beryllium but we're also
skinning that with some some stuff yeah
yeah and if you have specific questions
we do pick up our phone we'd love to
talk text we're happy to talk text we
prefer talking music but we're also
happy talking technology and there's a
lot of things to I think in high fives
that haven't been said or there's wives
tales but we chase or rabbits we chase
in hi-fi that end up leading you down
the wrong path so if you if you want to
find out where those dragons live you're
