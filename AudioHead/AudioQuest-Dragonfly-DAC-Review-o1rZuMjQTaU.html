very cool kind of new little DAC today I
want to show you it is the Dragonfly by
AudioQuest it's a 96 24-bit USB DAC
pretty simple in execution very tiny
size as you can see here the top just
comes off like that
it's about the size and roughly of a USB
thumb drive you're kind of traditional
ones I know they got some like really
short ones coming out these days but you
know back in the day we had these longer
USB sticks just like that kind of heavy
good rubberized coating that I really
like single kind of mini headphone jack
output the Dragonfly also has a really
cool additional feature that a lot of
other guys don't have and that this
little dragon flight here will change
color based upon what the sample rate is
for the file you're listening to so if
you want to know if you're getting all
the output that you're kind of shooting
for in McGlone different colors green
amber that kind of thing so that's like
pretty that's a pretty fun little extra
that I like a lot this thing it does
headphone output fairly well for it in
ear monitors the low impedance kind of
stuff it's not really that bad of an
output
great like great clarity and you know
sizeable volume of course through really
low an opinion stuff however with the
big boys
full-size headphones it didn't quite
have the push to make it all the way so
that was a little bit of a downside but
I you know it really takes a big
amplifier to kind of push the big high
impedance stuff anyway so I didn't
really expect this thing to but it also
does a line level output for your stereo
you just turn the volume up all the way
to the max on both your laptop and the
device volume output that's kind of also
another thing I want to touch on is the
there's the best results ourselves when
the volume was all the way up on the
computer and then with the diff you had
a device output volume you can adjust it
from there it's incremental and stepped
but it's done in the analog domain not
the digital domain so a lot of people
think that that really contributes to a
little bit better sound quality which is
kind of a nice thing I happen to like it
a lot I think the Sun quality was really
good in fact this thing retails for 250
dollars and for 250 I find it to be
above par in its output it's not the
best i've ever heard in my entire life
there's much more expensive better kind
of solutions to DAC output however for
what it was in the sides that actually
outperformed quite a few of the other
$250 decks that i've heard to date which
is really great thing i like to see that
kind of price to performance quality a
lot and there's been quite a bit of hype
about this little guy and i do think
that it kind of does live up to a lot of
what you may or may not have heard the
quality for the price is really
something that i think a lot of people
can get into along those same lines it's
you know just quite the metaphor when
you plug this into your computer
and at least with my macbook air there's
like the volume headphone input here and
then right next to it there's another
volume input and when you plug it in
back and forth between those two I mean
you notice the difference it's much more
balanced I find a lot of the computer
headphone outputs the raw ones they have
to be very overly bloated bass the bass
is much much tighter and the clarity is
just there so if you're 250 dollars
there's nothing you don't obviously
shake a stick at but for 250 bucks you
do get an upgrade over the hem put out
and put the headphone output of your
computer I mean there's something to be
said in that if you're you know if
you're in tuning your monitors this
thing can be a perfect match if not you
can actually take this thing out to your
bigger headphone amplifier if that's the
kind of thing you have and you'll get
better results than just your standard
output so there is value to this whether
it's worth 250 that's you know up to you
to decide but I do think that there is a
definite upgrade in the sound quality so
that's really fun I kind of find this to
be a nice solid observation for this
thing I mean it's something even maybe
your non audiophile friends might
recognize which would be kind of cool so
that being said you know this is
something if you get the chance to check
it out at the audio shows or maybe even
on display somewhere in the retail I
suggest you give it a go because I kind
of found it to me where the fun
especially for 250 that's unfortunately
the starting point for a lot of decks
these days if this is your first
starting point for a deck I think that
you might come away with some really
good stuff so let me know if you guys
have any questions in the comment
section have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
