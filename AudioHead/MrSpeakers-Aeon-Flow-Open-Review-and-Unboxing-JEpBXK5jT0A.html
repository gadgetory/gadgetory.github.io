the subject of our scrutiny will be the
mr. speakers Aeon flow open-back
headphones there is also a closed back
variant of this that is a very popular
and has been well received as well you
check out all the details on that review
on our website in addition to the review
of this headphone now we have both in
the case of the open back variant it is
seven hundred and ninety-nine dollars
retail mr. speaker sells them direct on
his website and it's a pretty darn good
headphone in terms of its price point
the main two reasons for this are its
comfort level and its sound quality the
included accessories are pretty
interesting there's a case some damping
pads and of course a removable cable
that can also be upgraded to balanced if
that's the type of amplifier that you
used there's also a pretty nice case
that's included and that's nice to see
because it's not always something that
manufacturers give away for free with
their headphones so this is included and
it's pretty nice and it works very well
and considering the price point of the
headphone it's probably something you'd
want to use on a regular basis
they included damping pads I found to be
very interesting they come in a black
what you're kind of used to seeing on
most headphones and then two white
damping's that have notches on the top
so you can actually add on more damping
to the overall effects so you can
customize the headphone if you want to
go through that trouble I found it very
interesting I preferred just a regular
black but if you add some more on it's
an interesting experiment cuz it doesn't
just affect the level the level of
treble like an EQ knob it has a kind of
a different spatial effect as well so
something to try out something to adjust
like I said I prefer just the black ones
but someone might very easily prefer the
option that he provides with the
headphone in terms of comfort
this headphone does a very good job and
I tribute this to two things it's
triangular shape and its suspension
system the clamping pressure was very
good on my head not too much not too
little so it falls off but also it fit
my full ear all the way around so it's
the head the ear cup is just big enough
to fit a good sized ear in there and I
really liked how felt on my head it was
not too overbearing in any direction in
terms of the sonic response this
headphone is a taste of what mr.
speakers does and the higher end and
that taste is a very good spoonful of
sonic mr speakers has a very good ear
when it comes to the tuning the EQ and
the clarity that he provides he
demonstrates in his products this one
really has punchy low bass balanced mids
and non fatiguing highs I would say it
doesn't have the most trouble of the
popular planar magnetics it doesn't have
the least trouble it actually hits kind
of in the middle of a lot of stuff
that's on the market which is very
interesting in terms of stepping up to
his higher end stuff mr. speakers does
kind of offer a little bit higher
resolution and maybe a little bit more
sparkle in the vocals for what this
headphone does at this price point it is
pretty convincing that there is value to
be found now I realize $800 is probably
a lot of money for almost everybody but
if you're into the Hobby and you're
willing to spend the funds this might be
something you want to look at in terms
of resolution natural vocals organic
sound with good tight punchy bass as is
kind of inherent in a lot of the plainer
magnetic technologies that differs from
dynamic or some of the other ones it's a
fun sound signature it's a reliable
sound signature it has a nice neutral
even keeled response that I think will
appeal to many people who are into the
Hobby as much as I am thanks everybody
for tuning
this is the mr. speakers Aeon flow open
back headphone subscribe to the channel
if you can and thanks for watching we'll
keep you updated with even more
headphones in the very short future we
have quite a few in and we are looking
forward to kind of giving our
impressions for each chairs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
