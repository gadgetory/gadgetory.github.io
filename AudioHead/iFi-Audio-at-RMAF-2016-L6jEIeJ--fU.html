so if we start off here this is our all
new Pro Series the in the middle is the
pro I can I'll start there because this
has been a release for a few months now
so what's really cool about this product
is that um this is one of the first
amplifiers that can go between solid
state and tube in real time so you know
it's not a hybrid it's purely solid
state or purely tube with just a flick
of a button so as I mean that's
something we're really proud of and you
know we can work on it for quite a while
so this is looking at around seven
hundred dollars and then this guy in the
top you know I personally been excited
about for the longest time and it's well
our engineers have worked really hard
and it's been delay forever but we
finally got it right and we're hoping to
launch within a few months so this is
our ID EST pro we're looking at a Ford
dak trips inside dual mono fully a
balanced natively
it also comes with a headphone amplifier
if you you know if you need it but we
like to say that you know it's more
attack than anything else and it's
really designed with that in mind first
and this will run around two thousand
dollars and at the bottom is kind of a
cool little product the idea is that we
can make any balance headphone amplifier
or speaker amplifier into a another
electrostatic am so we call this the I
energizer and you're able to tune the
voltage to whatever specific setting
that you need it for in this case we're
actually running the mr. speakers uh
electrostatic prototype and it's a
honestly a pretty sweet sounding piece
and we're really excited that we have
this we bought the mr. speakers a lot
and got a lot of their products we love
them so yeah and we're so when running
this guy at a 5 80 volts right now and
it sound fantastic so hoping that this
will run around four hundred dollars or
so cool yeah so this is our Pro Series
and then we got these two little gadgets
there are fifty dollars a piece you no
one messes with the jitter gets rid of
some jitter noise and this will you know
fix any noise with the ground loop
awesome so if we keep moving on
this is our our micro series these have
been out for quite some time now the i
can s-see is quite a popular headphone
amplifier it's small but it's powerful
it can drive just about anything from
any air monitors to the HD 800 no
problem and then down the middle is the
I tube so if you if you're looking to
add a little tube sound to your
solid-state a little more tubes down to
anything you're really looking for this
piece is a really nice job just adding a
little bit more warmth kind of getting a
real little getting rid of a little bit
of that digital sharpness if that's what
you're looking to do and then keep
moving down we have to I'd act too it's
also quite quite a popular piece it's
kind of our more simplistic product it's
a deck and an amp mostly a DAC similar
to our IDs d and that's pretty much all
it really does and it does a good job at
it and then finally at the bottom is our
I USB 3.0 which we just got the enjoy
the music award which is really awesome
to get you know nice little plaque from
them it's really more designed for very
high index you know we're looking at a
few thousand dollars but it also no
fists really nicely with our system so
we do keep it there and you can see it's
kind of interesting because we have two
USB ports into it what it's actually
doing is separating the power and the
audio signal so you're getting an
overall cleaner sound
and that's sort of a quick rundown of
our micro series with the exception of
this guy which isn't really part of the
stack because this is kind of all you
know does it all all in one devices are
I DSD its I as a battery it runs about
10 hours depending on how you use it
it's got all kinds of inputs and outputs
and it has x.x base 3d which is also
featured on our Pro Series products as
well as the eye can and we have a cool
little system we call ie match it
basically allows it to power the most
sensitive in your monitors all the way
up to you know something like the HD 800
even more difficult to drive headphones
and then one of the new things were also
sort of demoing now is this little guy
this is a really good for people who use
phones you know sources that are a
little bit more noisy what this is doing
it's not quite an impedance adaptive but
what it does is it lowers the overall
game you know you lower the overall
noise and it's um also pretty
interesting that we were able to run
this in single-ended and balance balance
3.5 unfortunately so it doesn't quite
work with a cell and kern but it'll work
with some of our products and you know
hifi man and other apps that use a 3.5
balance and you know just a flick of a
switch and you can switch the balance
and then we also have a nano Syria which
this gentleman is using here we don't
have too much of a nano series out just
because you know people tend to want to
play with the big boys you know our post
series in a micro but they're similar to
our micro series products downsized a
little bit for more Portability and
the last
so this is a very interesting product
this is our retro stereo 50 it runs from
$1,500 but we also have a nice pair of
speakers to go with it this is kind of
our all-in-one device you know it's a
DAC it's a phono stage it's like
bluetooth it's an amplifier basically
anything you want likely it'll have the
only thing that maybe it doesn't quite
have is like Wi-Fi connection or
something but other than that this guy's
pretty much got you covered it comes in
a really nice bamboo chassis it's got
tubes and it's just a really really
interesting and a diverse product that
you know fits in a fist in your home and
whatever you might need whatever you
know whatever your preference is changed
you know you still have that kind of
input or output to go with so yeah
that's a quick rundown of our products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
