today we have the TZ AR I believe
they're pronounced are 90s from air
audio this is an in-ear monitor that's a
universal fit meaning that you can
replace that replaced the tip with
different tips but it's not a custom
molded thing to your ear as it comes out
of the box so Universal and near monitor
the nominal impedance a 1k for these is
actually 90 that's how it corresponds
with the title the name bizarre 90s they
also offer another version that has even
higher impedance the Czar 350s that are
very similar in shape and design as the
ones you see here so I'm a really big
fan of these the shape and design of the
the universal drivers on these very
similar to the a4 I that was previously
done by the company still available they
have a couple of different headphones
available in the perdon this price range
which is roughly three hundred and
seventy dollars and the 350s actually go
for four hundred dollars the they fit
quite nicely in the air they have a nice
shape and they kind of hold firmly
another big plus for these they have
interchangeable cables as one of your
more standard in-ear monitor type of
connections that you can pull the ones
that you see here out and replace them
with a fancier cable or even balanced
cables if that's kind of your thing as
far as the fit it really depends on the
tips in the seal very very important you
can see here I have a double flange
style on there but it does come with
of different tip sizes in the box but
you can also buy many many more online
to get the feel and the fit that's right
for you it's very important to get the
fit right as a directly affects base and
also trouble and even the mids to a
certain degree depending on what you got
going on up I found the double flange to
be one of the more comfortable styles
for my ear but I have a rather light
your canal so you really that's kind of
the tips aren't that expensive so you
really need to kind of get out there and
figure out what works best for you in
that regard but as for the overall tonal
signature of these I really think that
it has a slightly forward a slightly
treble forward presentation that kind of
complements the detail for the price
really good detail across the board they
have a low-end kind of grip to the base
that brings it that brings it in so it
does have some thump if you get the
fifth if you get to fit right however
the general tone of it to my ears has
more of a trouble forward slant if
that's your cup of tea then these are
definitely something you should probably
give a little listen to their very
detailed in that regard but they do have
slowed a little bit more trouble in the
top end then let's say a pair of Gerry
Harvey JH 16s which have bass emphasis
or even the 5s in that case have a
little a little less trouble than these
do but that doesn't mean that it's not
the right choice for you it just depends
kind of how you like your your tonal
signature it does come with a pretty
cool box as you can see here in addition
it has like I said a bunch of different
tips that you can change in and out with
you guys have any questions for me leave
it in the comments section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
