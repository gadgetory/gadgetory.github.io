with another headphone review for you
today the subject is the fostex th five
zero zero RP that's the th 500 RP
retails for roughly six hundred and
ninety nine dollars and ninety nine
cents so it's a seven hundred dollar
headphone pushing up a little bit from
the bottom from the big kind of grouping
of three to five hundred dollar
headphones that are currently on the
market if you're looking for a bit of
like a mid tier obviously there are
higher flagships in out there but you
know a nice mid to your kind of section
to be in kind of Rises is the seven to a
thousand dollar area this is a planar
magnetic headphone similar but not
exactly the same to the t-50 RP
the technology is the same however this
is obviously a vastly different from the
classic kind of modded headphone that
fostex is primarily known for the
difference is right off the bat being
the price of course it's much more
expensive it's also an open back design
for the first time as opposed to the
kind of closed plastic back of the t-50
RP that everyone mods so there's some
major differences there obviously the
quality of the build is has definitely
been increased this time around you can
see that it's a pretty plain open panel
on the backside singular round and the
the pet band in the fields is nice I
actually found this to be really light
on the head I found the wearability to
be really really well done in this case
there's a slight plastic bracket in a
kind of an interesting way that it turns
around the ear cup I'm not really sure
how that's gonna last over the long haul
but I mean on the head this thing feels
good it looks pretty decent it's not
like total flagship feel but it isn't
flagship either
is a really nice kind of solid easy to
wear for long listening sessions kind of
headphone the clamping pressure is very
light at least in this review pair that
I got you know that can vary and
obviously the size of your head can vary
so those two kind of elements may change
for you but for me this thing wore
really really good especially when you
consider that it's planar magnetic
technology and a lot of these guys when
they make a headphone with this tech
it's very heavy and cumbersome this not
so much I thought it was very probably
the best feeling headphone on the head
for a planar magnetic that I've kind of
reviewed to date so there's that great
job there you cannot disconnect easily
the wire cables from the headphones so
it's single-ended connector that's
pretty much what you're stuck with no
fancy cable upgrades for this one at
least unless you'd like a soldering kit
and like the disassembled stuff it's a
no easy way to change the cable up
that's kind of a drawback but I mean for
the most part it's it's a good kind of
build over it overall and the headband
is izla it feels good and it's got lots
of good stuff now as for as far as the
sound is concerned I did find these to
be pretty close to the LCD 3s the are
diseased LD LCD 3 is that I liked quite
a bit in that they don't have too much
of a treble forward presence a lot you
know you can these guys can build a
sound signature however they like but
quite often it becomes is it trouble
forward or is it trouble not in a lot of
situations this one happens to be more
laid back to my ears in that regard I
have it to like that kind of a signature
a little bit more but if travel is your
thing then you may want to check out
other ones the treble is definitely
present it's definitely good I actually
like I said before prefer this type of
signature or anything that's too trouble
forward but it's a it's a nice little
headphone in that regard I also found
that this headphone DRO
at about the same power as the LCD 3 so
it's not a really hard headphone to
drive other planar magnets that I had on
hand were harder to drive so obviously
for for the most dynamic and the most
kind of robust sound you would want to
use the addition of a headphone a
specific headphone amplifier for this to
get the best out of your headphone these
are definitely the type of headphones
that are made for that kind of a thing
but you can get by by just plugging into
a regular source and be able to get draw
a little bit out of it if you know not
ear-bleeding levels but you could
probably get there if you wanted to so
it drives pretty easy overall well the
base on this is also very good planar
magnetics are kind of known for a really
good base
I found it low very good very thumpy not
too woolly or overcast you know there's
good definition not the best that I've
heard out of any headphone but pretty
good overall speaking there was kind of
more defined out of the Odyssey LCD 3
but that is also a headphone that costs
you know more than twice as much almost
three times as much as this headphone so
for the price nothing bad in the bass I
really like the kind of reach in the
grip that it has now as for the mids
that's kind of where this one was a
little bit different I felt at just that
times that I got a hint of congestion or
maybe a little bit it's like got a phat
sounds but the tone and texture if you
like kind of more of a fat sound I think
that this is might be the way to go for
you but if you're looking for like the
the pristine super clean more trouble I
also looked at the new high five man hg
560 which is about $200 more than this
at the same time I did it a side by side
evaluation and and that one kind of had
more of that sound signature so if
you're into texture and fat tone you
know give this one a listen but if you
are more of like a straight clean cut
Ã¡ndale
kind of a feel you may want to check out
that other one that's just to $200 more
that HG 560 from high five man it's kind
of interesting little twist on around
the same price point you know but like I
said it wears really well probably good
for long listening sessions and overall
you know a pretty good snapshot of what
we're getting to at this point in the
planar magnetic market because it's it's
starting to the price is starting to
come down a little bit more and the
quality is starting to come up so
anyways thanks for watching bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
