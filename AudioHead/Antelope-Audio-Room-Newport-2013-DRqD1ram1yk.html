director of sales and marketing from
North America and we're here at the th e
show of the show for a 2013 Newport
Beach we're introducing two new products
at the show we have the zodiac platinum
which is a DSD and PCM capable dita a
converter that will handle two channels
PCM up to 768 kilohertz and it will do
DSD up to 256 times the sample rate
which we believe is a industry-first we
also have some new technologies DSD
upsampling in the zodiac platinum so
zodiac platinum has all the features of
our previous zodiac models and all of
this new technology all in one we also
for the Sonics to have the lowest noise
levels that these chips are capable of a
true DSD texas instrument burr-brown
chip we use a quad DAC chip design so we
have two chips running per channel in
parallel and the reason that's done is
the noise averaging benefits allow for
3d be a further three DP reduction in
the noise floor of an already already
amazing spectat circuit so we're always
our engineers are always trying to push
the envelope and we believe that this
product sets a lot of new bars and
breaks new ground for a two channel D
Day converter there's also remote
control from your pc or mac and we will
be introducing app control for that
product as well the other new product
that we've shown it a couple shows
before but we're actually demonstrating
the sound for the first time at the show
which is the Rubicon and the Rubicon
adds all of our pro features and more so
when I say you know we're known for our
atomic clocks and our clocks and the
mastering and film scoring communities
especially we've taken that technology
and put it in one chassis so it used to
comprised of four or five six products
to accomplish the same task you can now
do that in one attractive single unit
chassis and that product has the
built-in atomic oscillator a heat sink
which is what you see on the top of the
unit and also
wireless DLNA streaming it also has an A
to D but when you can wreak you can
digitize an archive your record
collections because there's a built-in J
Fett transformer phono preamp stage on
the input or you can go straight in line
level or any of the multiple digital or
analog inputs as well so it's got
built-in preamp stage so what we find
this one by consolidating these
electronics into one chassis we're able
to speed up the transient response times
much better and you don't have the kinds
of smoothing or or which can become
subjective some people like a bit of
that you can certainly use an external
preamp or two preamp with this device
but we built this to take advantage of
the benefits of being able to construct
one unit that has all of these things in
one it also has a superb I was actually
up till six o'clock in the morning if I
look a little ragged it's because I was
just listening to the phone opening up i
do like listening on atc speakers that
were demoing here but i also love
listening on headphones and i was going
back through just my almost my entire
favorite the record collection or
digital digital file collection and just
hearing things and hearing things in
ways and it's a very palatable sound it
doesn't sound digital you just forget
you're listening to digital playback and
at that price point which is forty
thousand dollars I think that's the
expectation and what I my initial
response to that DJ is it lives up to
the expectation which is a beautiful
thing the zodiacs range in prices from
2,000 to five thousand dollars and then
there's the optional volta cos power
supply which which again the power
supply technology didn't even get into
that is also incorporated right inside
the Rubicon as well so it's inside the
chassis they're available at dealers
near you I mean our dealer network is
still growing paradigm on the west coast
I know it's one that's done well for us
and that you know there are sound
science cat Neil van Berg does a great
job for us he's been our top US dealer
for the past couple years so it's a
growing list and we there will be
readily available upon release then we
appreciate everyone coming out we hope
to see at a future show and
we'll have more information coming soon
about the new products but I've been
with antelope since nearly the beginning
for eight years I've never been more
excited to represent this company in
this line I think we're we're pushing
the envelope for what digital audio can
do and can be and raising a lot of
eyebrows i can i can tell you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
