we have a review of the Andromeda 5
driver balanced armature driver
Universal fit in your monitor from
campfire audio which is a subset of alo
audio audio line out it retails for 1099
dollars so right around 1100 as I said
before five drivers per universal fit
triple bore technology one hole to
transfer bass sounds one for middle and
one for high it's a pretty sweet piece
has a cnc'd from a block of aluminum
casing with three set screws on the top
that kind of give it an industrial feel
I like the clean lines I like the the
texture the finish it's all very more
hard lines than a lot of the acrylic
shells but still an interesting look
it's the same look that's shared with
the rest of the outer space galaxies
live from campfire which come in at
varying price points but this one is the
highest price point so it's the flagship
as a as of now it comes with this handy
dandy leather camp ish dark leather
carrying case a little bit of wool
inside fun little aesthetic to nod to
the campfire to camping it also comes
with a pretty sweet lint cable they're
called copper silver plated wire MMC X
connection at the end and it's kind of
the cable that you would see in an
aftermarket hobbyist kind of thing so
it's it feels and looks like something
that you buy they usually cost quite a
bit of money but they're aftermarket
replaceable cables there's a hobby
dedicated to this it's pretty fun but
this guy and every one of the line
actually comes with one of these lens
cables so the retail on the site is 150
bucks so they threw in probably one of
the sweetest cables stand
I've ever seen in a package so pretty
pretty cool I like that very much
overall the sound tonally is very rich
and does a really good job in the mids
and lows and the extension is actually
fairly good too it has a sound signature
a frequency response that I have liked
very much not too much trickery in the
top-end with a ton of treble trying to
do detail it has good good detail
partnered with really good tonality
which is a kind of a hard thing to do
sometimes when you go for massive
amounts of like micro level detail you
kind of get these weird analytical feels
where it sucks the life out of the
middle it makes sound hollow tube ish
just kind of you know bored out this
does not suffer from that whatsoever
it's a great little presentation with a
nice linear top to bottom frequency
response great detail and great sound
fun energetic
lifelike good good stuff on this one
very impressed with it of course the
price is you know over $1000 which is a
lot of money for almost everybody
however in the field of universal IMS as
they've developed they've gone much
higher than that so they didn't swing
for the rafters on this guy it actually
lands for flagship at a very good price
point at $1,100 when you see products
that come cost much much more than that
in the field so all being said very
impressed
it's the campfire Andromeda I am you can
find more information on the website
campfire audio calm until next time guys
