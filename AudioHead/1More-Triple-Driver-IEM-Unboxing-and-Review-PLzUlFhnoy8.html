triple driver universal fit in ear
monitor from one more I wanted to go to
give you guys you know more of a sense
of what the unboxings like for this in
your monitor instead of just a review
with a shot of it because the unboxing
is pretty exciting I think for a $99 in
here and it gives you a little you know
some of the company's personal Flair
expressed in there so we're going to
give you a rundown of the full unboxing
and then we'll get into kind of what
this guy sounds like so it makes the
triple triple driver special in this
case is that it has actually two
balanced armature drivers and one
dynamic driver all working in unison to
kind of make the sound come out so
that's a little bit different than what
usually see a lot of times you see more
all balanced armature drivers and
usually for this price point you see one
single dynamic driver made of different
types of materials in this case there is
a kind of hybrid conclusion to the story
and it's $99 which is the biggest kind
of point to make here where you're
seeing a little more innovation than you
generally see for a price point that
admittedly is not cheap but in terms of
audiophile price points out there is at
the very lowest it goes and this guy is
actually not even the lowest I am that
one more makes that should make some
that go down to $20.00 so the company
kind of has this audiophile thing in
mind but it's still operating very much
consumer level consumption so if we get
into the details here let's just open
this guy up
see that there's a little metal piece
here on the sign and it kind of opens up
like a book and inside there are
aesthetic sketches and you know it's all
packaged on the right side here like a
book so you grab this little tab here
you know open up and see everything is
labeled I'd say it's like a little bit
Apple like which is kind of cool clean
lines little indicators where it goes
but the headphones actually rest in this
compartment on this side and that I'll
open up here take these guys out
we'll take a closer look at these in a
little bit so either side for now as you
dive into remember $99 here it comes
with a wide assortment of other boxes
and then the this I think it's also
pretty generous in terms of ear tips
foam varying sizes silicone varying
sizes so we got a lot of options to get
your your fit and your seal that's right
which is obviously vitally important for
earphones of this type to get the bass
right and to get all the response right
and also to get a comfortable fit now on
the idea of comfort there is something I
think very special and unique about
these headphones in that that they feel
extremely comfortable in the weight is
well distributed there's an angle piece
an angled piece to the ear to the stem
that kind of comes out that has the
drivers in it and it not only works very
well with the design and the curvature
of your ear but it also really just sits
nice in and on your ear so there's not a
lot of pressure directly on your ear
canal and and actually the stem that
comes down to the wire straight down
works very well for at least my ears I
was very happy with the way in a comfort
level for these IMS definitely above par
in that respect and even though sound is
important for this particular type I
think comfort is a very big deal so the
fact that they in my mind nailed it at
99 bucks is a great great sign in terms
of the accessories that come with it the
there's one of the boxes holds on the
literature another one holds this
airplane adapter along with a clip which
is very important for microphonic so the
clip is a really nice accessory helps
reduce the sound of the wire bouncing
around inside the headphone from the
convective cord when you work out those
type of things that this becomes very
important because it reduces all the
background kind of physical noise so
it's very cool that's not always
included it's a pretty cool ones
included with this airplane
after and then of course a black and red
stitch carrying case leather-bound with
red stitching and I got to tell you guys
I'm a sucker for black leather with red
stitching on it so this Tim he was such
a fun fun little fine you just drop drop
them in there and you got a little
carrying case it'll be crunched of
course I think you can always just stuff
them in your pocket but that's a nice
touch for travel you don't lose them
they'll you know else reduced all the
tangling and the pulling on the wire
that's a fun little exercise accessory
now in terms of sound I found these two
eyes to be very detailed for the 99
dollar range they're not really overdone
in the bass which is another problem a
lot of $99 earphones get into where they
just want to accentuate the bass to kind
of compensate for the fact that it's all
in your head and you can't feel any of
the you know the vibrations on your body
these guys don't do that
it's up it's I would say a little bit
boosted over neutral like audiophile
neutral however I don't think that it's
overdone over cooked or even kind of
intrudes on the mids which is all the
problems that you start to get but don't
really see with these headphones it's
good really good especially for 99 bucks
once again they also feel a little
rotund it's a nice bouncy style of bass
and it's very interesting and rich and
kind of a fun little sounding low-end I
think the mids sound equally detailed
they sound really good and articulate I
was really impressed with how how sharp
and pretty smooth they are on the way up
to the treble overall a pretty good even
keeled piece as you go across not nearly
exaggerated or cartoonish as you see in
some more commercial mainstream
headphones so all good things there
and like I said coherency and detail
above bar is for the price point and
really I think they really nailed it in
terms of going up to another level in
order to kind of beat these guys out you
can get a lot of funky stuff at 99 bucks
even though 9 bucks I think is a lot of
money for something this sound the
coherency the detail can all fail these
do not do an excellent job of keeping
that all together and it takes quite a
bit of money to try to get up there and
get more for your money so that's like a
great saver in terms of jumping to the
next price bracket it kind of like takes
a leapfrog over the next one and really
goes into the audiophile stuff before it
even gets better so really nice really
nice stuff from this company and the
fact that you know the budget is I think
within most peoples disposable income is
great and you know it's a great
opportunity for this company this
company do you grow even more kind of
bond that bridge between the auto file
and the mainstream really good stuff
so this has been the one more triple
driver thanks for tuning in and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
