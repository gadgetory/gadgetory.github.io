together a little workout package for
you guys to check out I really like this
thing it served me pretty well over the
past couple of days and just want to
give you you know a quick rundown how
its how its put together so this thing
is basically constructed with an iPod
Nano this is chosen because of this line
out accessibility here the shuffle is
actually a little bit smaller than this
but it only has a headphone out which
really doesn't work put out quite the
quality of the line out there is a vast
improvement between the line now on the
shuffle that I have if you run the
headphone out to an amp compared to this
line out dock specifically here so this
is called an LOD a line out dock this
one's by file but there's other more
expensive ones on the market if you want
to go that route this it run basically
it takes the line out from the iPod Nano
and puts it into the input here located
in the back the unit that I've kind of
selected here as an amp for the
headphones is the Ray Samuels this
shadow this one was selected because of
its good pairing it's a great pairing
with in in ear monitors such as the j
j-- fives that i have here and also its
size and the build the build is is quite
solid you can take a little bit of
jostling no it also has you know it's
the smallest one out there that i could
really find there might be a couple of
other ones that are there's also the
pico slim but that one ends up being
quite a bit longer and just where if you
are in the market but for the size and
for the power and for the the really the
blending the synergy with in-ear
monitors specifically i think this thing
works just beautifully so i would have
liked to added another DEATH in between
here but obviously since this this
thing's going to be bouncing up and down
and moving the weight was kind of an
issue there's the wells of size so the
amp itself is not that not that heavy it
works it works it's it's you can feel it
but it doesn't it's nothing that can
really like pull down or tug on your
pants too much a while you're running
you can see here that it actually
inserts quite easily both both of them
you put your put this in your pocket and
actually hangs on the fabric like this
so the weight of the unit kind of drags
on your pocket and that actually leaves
an opportunity for these cables to kind
of stick out to the side so they don't
get knocked around too much inside your
pocket and you can still access the
volume knob here that's how it turns on
and you know I think this thing works
really great sound this one if you
double-click on this button here while
you're running it just moves to the next
song so you put a few put it workout
mixed together it works really
eloquently in that regard because you
can just have that workout mix or any of
you don't want double hit it goes to the
next song and that's all accessible as
it kind of appears from the top here I
attached this to the unit using some of
these silicon bands that are available
this one happens to be from AOL audio
but you can use other other bands I
believe you can also use the ones that
you buy and put on your wrist as well
some people have said that that works
too if you have some of those lying
around like the charity fundraiser ones
are basically the same kind of make up
in order to attach them to the Nano I
actually double wrap them so they've
been twisted once and there's two of
them in play here three times underneath
to prevent scratching from this unit
touching the amp and then just a single
band that goes across the top through
here to attach it to the two together
find this technique works quite well I
haven't seen any scratching and this
thing is it's very very solidly stuck
together so um it leaves enough room for
the fabric too many way you could add
another one here but I'd be worried
about not having a fabric grip here so
if you use running pants or any other
pants with thin fabric there's plenty of
grip here to kind of keep it in place as
you run as far as sound is concerned
this this is one of those things where
actually the transparency and the
resolution of the unit he actually you
know makes you want to kind of upgrade
to higher
Ellucian mp3s you can start to really
hear the difference with this unit and
also it really you know so there's
definitely a transparency they it
bounces extremely well with the more
sensitive in ear monitors kind of gives
you a better sense of soundstage when at
the low levels just you can also see the
shadow review the full review that I did
will give you more of the basics of the
amp but overall you know it has great
bass emphasis and really clear solid
bass and everything is basically more
clear overall so I really enjoy this
unit if you have any questions feel free
to hit me up in the comment section and
subscribe to the channel if you get a
chance audio head and the website is
audio - head comm so i few guys soon
