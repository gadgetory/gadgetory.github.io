officer Crackerbox audio and welcome to
the echo box CES experience at CES 2017
we've got a lot of cool stuff for you
guys at CES this year it's a really
really interesting time for us we're
launching a brand new line of products
including two new earphones the traveler
and the nomad up until now I'm sure you
guys are who are familiar with our
company have seen this earphone right
here it is the finder x1 made waves with
this thing over the last year as a solid
titanium earphone using a peak dynamic
driver diaphragm on the inside it is
nine point two millimeter peak which is
Paul yet they're out there ketone the
cool thing about peak material it is at
a high tensile polymer it is very very
very strong but you can also cut it very
thin now that works for us and an
earphone is obviously we can make a
super thin diaphragm you can pump an
enormous amount of energy into and it's
not going to distort it's not going to
blow and it's gonna reveal an enormous
amount of detail and dynamic range and a
very very broad spectrum of frequency
response this earphone the traveler and
the nomad all have the exact same
frequency response range 15 Hertz to 40
which is absolutely spectacular fully
high-res certified if you've heard them
you don't really need the certifications
to get the high res aspect of it you'll
get it just by listening they are
spectacular so anyways I want to talk
about the new products here so let's
start with the traveler the traveler is
is designed very specifically to be an
introductory audiophile earphone for
those people that are a little bit more
unfamiliar with the world of eye-fi
audio and don't want to really make it
very large price plunge to be able to
get into it these are priced affordably
at $99 full MSRP they come in three
different colors available right now is
Blu rose and the signature echo box
orange right here there are solid
titanium housings they use a tin plated
copper cable and a gold connector for
ultimate transduction and noise cable
lish miss IVA
know the word but just they sound really
good there's a lot of very high quality
components that go into this they come
in two different available models both
with microphones one of them is Android
certified the other is iPhone certified
so no matter your device you can find
the right one for your taste
each one of them features comply to 400
memory foam ear tips thermal dynamic
thermal reactive memory foam ear tips by
comply which actually go into your body
if you're unfamiliar with them they go
into your ear canal and work with your
body heat to contour to the inside of
your ear for a perfect fit they're
spectacular they're very comfortable and
for this new range of earphones we've
also partnered with a really phenomenal
company out of the UK called snugs
snugs are right over here with their 3d
scanning station you can see their scan
ologists hard at work scanning the
interior of people's ears with a really
really crazy new scanning technology
that they're pioneering with the help of
a lot of very cool technological
companies what it does is as a
non-invasive scanning procedure that
replaces the traditional injection
molding experience that a lot of audio
files are familiar with to be able to
get custom earphones instead of getting
this giant waxy substance shoved into
your ear and filled it up and pulled out
for a really uncomfortable suction cup
kind of aspect this is a non-invasive
technology they simply have a little
scanning gun that uses light emission to
capture the entire concave of your
interior ear built a 3d profile for it
which they then send back to their
factory and 3d print a custom molded ear
tip that is made to fit perfectly in
your ear just as any custom monitor
would and snap on to any up number of
our line of three year funds so what it
does in essence is it takes any of our
ear phones that are universal in nature
and turns them into a perfect custom ear
very very cool so check out snugs if you
go through their website I think it's
snugs Kota UK slash echo box or
something along that line
they're actually doing a discounted
offer for anybody who buys echo box ear
phones to be able to upgrade to
custom-fit from their Universal so check
them out
let's get into a little bit of what
we're got going on here so the traveler
$99 audiophile introductory year phone
sounds amazing very simple very cool
check it out
Nomad on the other hand is our new
powerhouse this is our new flagship
product we've worked very hard on making
it and we're very proud of the results
that we've accomplished so I've actually
got one around my neck here
these are snugs that are on it you can
kind of check it out how they look just
turns it into a completely custom mold
and they just snap off it's very easy
it's really cool so as you probably knew
with the finder the Nomad also features
our signature after system after system
is acoustic filter tuning the way that
it works is you unscrew the little
nozzle on the end of your earphone and
you screw a new one back on and just by
changing the filter it completely
changes the dynamic response of the
earphone itself the sound profile will
just be adjusted the way that it works
is through passive noise filtration it's
a pretty simple concept to be honest you
have certain densities of material made
in different types of material that
allow certain types of frequencies to
pass or be blocked so the silver one is
going to allow more bass to come through
and be the base filter the black one is
going to be more of a reference
audiophile sound more flat and the
treble is going to be red and it's just
whose treble to your heart's delight I
would not recommend the treble for
anybody that doesn't love treble or have
some upper range hearing loss because it
is very treble II ship standard with the
bass on it I honestly prefer the bass
over everything but to each their own
and that's why we do it right
the other cool thing about the Nomad is
that it's an ergonomic design the way
that this is done is to fit perfectly
into the interior structure of your ear
so that it doesn't have any type of
address abrasive pressure you can see it
when I put it on right here over your
cable style and it just sits for the
concave of your ear kind of like a
kidney bean shape it's extremely
comfortable and as you've probably
noticed full range of motion on the
actual cable and if I can get it off
because I put lotion on my hands a
little earlier there we go
replaceable MMC X connector in life
right now we have three cable options
available for the Nomad we have a Apple
certified microphone cable an Android
certified microphone cable and a non
microphone cable over the next three to
six months we will be releasing a
lightning cable a USBC cable and an apt
X Bluetooth 4.0 cable which we are
working with our in-house bluetooth
engineer to develop our own proprietary
protocol for to hopefully I say
hopefully because we're not on 2%
confirmed on this but I have tested it
and so far is working well hopefully do
a full 24 192 lossless transmission over
bluetooth we'll see what happens but if
we do wouldn't that be exciting be very
exciting so right now it's at the very
least Bluetooth 4.0 which sounds really
great for Bluetooth I've actually been
testing a prototype cable for the entire
duration of the show the battery life on
it's amazing the range is spectacular
it's comfortable to wear and the sound
quality is definitely up there there's
definitely a difference between the
standard cable and the bluetooth but
from what I've noticed so far it's the
most minut that I've ever experienced
publish you of course being MMC X you
can also buy any number of third-party
MMC X cables that are currently
available customized to your heart's
delight
so this is the Nomad it is available for
399 dollars and it will be launching in
February the traveler will also be
launching in February so stay tuned
check out for updates on our Facebook
our website social media all of that and
you will see when these two earphones
are coming out so if you familiar with
our company at all I'm sure that you
have heard the word explorer and the
word delay associated in the same
sentence a number of times well we are
here to tell you today that the delay
and the wait is over the Explorer is
here and we are very very proud to
announce the launch of it
welcome to the Explorer high fidelity
audio player it is a $600 player encased
in solid hardwood it's absolutely
beautiful it does not come with the name
salmon and I promise you this just mine
four different wood types there's zebra
wood mahogany maple and ebony it runs a
stock open-source Android 6.0 operating
system completely customizable and very
clean
there's no bloatware on it they're only
three programs that come pre-installed
on this operating system APK Pierre is a
third-party app store very much like the
Google Play Store but not um however it
works in an almost identical fashion
it's extremely easy to use you get
featured apps new year apps games on and
so forth you can search them down though
and just like you can on the Play Store
and keep your apps updated see exactly
the same functionality it's very smooth
through that you can put as many apps as
you want on the Explorer I've got on
this one Netflix Facebook WeChat
facebook Messenger you know play around
with it it's it's fun the other two
programs that it comes with our title
and USB audio player pro title I'm sure
you guys are all familiar with is a
hi-fi music streaming service very much
like Spotify but it streams in black
it's unbelievable there's over 47
million songs in this library currently
and they're adding more by the day you
in search go through playlist sort by
genre
there's an entire music video library
which is actually a very unique to title
which is phenomenally fun to look
through and plays in beautiful
resolution on the 720p screen of the
Explorer and my favorite functionality
of title is the ability to save songs on
offline content and take them with you
wherever you go without the need for any
type of internet connection so seamless
functionality especially in offline mode
you can save your music for on-the-go
listening without Wi-Fi great for long
distance travel I use it on you know 12
hour flights overseas it's got a four
thousand milliamp hour battery on here
so depending on what type of listening
you're doing it'll get anywhere between
10 to 20 hours of music playback it's
phenomenally long so title is really
cool I highly encourage you guys to
check it out you come with three months
of free title hi-fi subscription when
you purchase the Explorer and after the
three months trial period is up you get
a discount so instead of I think it's
like twenty-seven dollars a month right
now is what title is charging you get it
for twenty bucks easy on your pocket
really easy on your ears so we've also
partnered up on the Explorer with a
company called USB audio player pro they
are a powerhouse of a company out of the
I think it's the Netherlands that makes
an unbelievable audiophile music
playback software they have customized a
completely for echo box for the Explorer
reskin it with this nice wood background
appeal and tweaked the functionality of
it so that it works properly on this
device in a flawless functionality there
are a couple amazing things about this
that I kind of want to go through not
only do you have your standard artist
functionality genres playlist every type
of sorting thing that you possibly want
to do present it in a beautiful layout
that you can switch between album view
or list view depending on what you want
to do it's beautiful when you start
playing it you've got the album in the
background this will actually fade out
really nicely once the song starts
playing yeah
but the coolest thing about this app is
for people that want to get really techy
with it it's got API integration so on
the inside you've got a whole bunch of
different networking options you can log
in directly through the app to your
title account cuba's shoutcast radio so
on and so forth
or if you have your own home network
server you can port in directly to the
app using DLNA UPnP or any other type of
network protocol that you could program
into it so it's fully integrated for for
in-home streaming options as well as
local playback options and through USB
audio player pro it will actually allow
you to play DSD files they are software
converted to PCM because we have a PCM
DAC inside of the Explorer but it will
play the DSD files they sound absolutely
spectacular I've got a Pink Floyd album
on here that was remastered in DSD and
it sounds great it just gets converted
in losses Kuantan a to PCM it's really
cool so check out out USB audio player
pro or UF PB for short the explorer
itself a little bit about it 64
gigabytes of internal memory storage
comstock with the Explorer it also has a
micro SD slot which you can take up to a
200 gigabyte SD card at least that's
what we've tested I know that they
recently came out with I think it's like
a 256 there's somebody that SD I'm
pretty sure it works in here because
it's an Android 6.0 operating system but
I haven't tested it so I'm not gonna say
it it definitely takes it to hundreds so
you can put up to 264 gigabytes of music
on this thing and swap out the 200 Giga
SD card to your heart's delight USB
connectivity for data transfer over your
computer and when you use USB audio
player Pro it will do USB audio output
I'll be Explorer so if you have a cord
mojo or some other type of outboard DAC
that uses USB connection you can do that
on the top of the Explorer you have a
standard 3.5 millimeter or yeah 3.5
millimeter headphone jack for analog
output and on the left you have a 3.5
millimeter optical Toslink output for
digital out this is awesome it bypasses
the DAC of the Explorer so you can use
it as a source for your home system go
into your own DAC with a full digital
signal that's not compressed not
deterred from anything that's in the
actual Explorer device
going to your home system and just
Network it to your heart's content it
comes with a docking station so use it
at your home then pick it up take it
with you
lossless quality everywhere you go so
the Explorer is retailed for $6.99 you
can pre-order it right now on echovox
audio comm and it will be shipping out
in February so it is done hardware
software is finished there are some
tweaks that we'll probably have to make
because we've discovered a little bit of
bugs here at CES it always happens when
they do a QA type thing we will be
shipping to our indiegogo backers and
our pre-order customers from the website
in January we're working very hard to
make that happen over the next couple
weeks and we'll be communicating with
them to keep everybody up to date on
that but you can expect a full global
rollout of the Explorer sometime in mid
February to early March you can also
check us out on Facebook Twitter
Instagram at the act echo box audio
social tag and if you go to hashtag echo
box CES you can see everything that
we're doing here at the show I think
that about covers it for the products we
love you guys thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
