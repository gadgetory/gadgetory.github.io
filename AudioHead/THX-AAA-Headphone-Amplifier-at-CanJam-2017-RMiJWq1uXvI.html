technology in triple-a triple-a is
designed for anything from wireless
headphones to anything with a with a
headphone jack all the way up to powered
desktop headphone amplifier solutions
and so on this little battery right here
we can run 200 milliamp battery for 100
hours this is the headphone amplifier
it's this middle piece in here and then
so we have two different things
this is for mobile solutions and then
this one is our high powered solution
and so this one is for like lowest
distortion in the world negative 180 DB
we're not actually building thx branded
products it's a b2b product so we're
making it available to other partners to
be able to build this
into their mothers and obviously the
using the solution and their products
under that gives them quality they also
give them the ability to
as a thx
assistant how people perceive so this is
the desktop solution this is just the
demonstration it runs off of a small
lithium battery once this is in a chip
anything with the headphone jack
anything with a headphone output input
that's that's could be wireless
headphones it could be bubble known it
could be a laptop for example because
that has a headphone jack but it can
also be used in high res audio digital
audio players can be used on desktop
amplifiers anything and what is it that
makes it special why would someone look
for that in their product lowest noise
and distortion and combined with battery
consumption savings so someone who's
very interested in something that can
last a long time but also has the high
quality premium fidelity and that's what
we're looking to provide</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
