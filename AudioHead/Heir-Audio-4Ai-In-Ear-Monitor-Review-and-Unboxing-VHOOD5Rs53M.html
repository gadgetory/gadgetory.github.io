everybody audio head here
today we're doing an unboxing and review
of the air audio for dot a universal
in-ear monitor let me get right to it on
this one
take her out we have a very nice box in
this case a little bit larger than I've
seen before and some other in ear
monitors but um really nice build
actually I think this is one of the
nicest cases that has come even though
the size is relatively larger the build
the handle just a box in general its
above and beyond what a lot of the other
guys do as you can see here it's got
foam padding on both sides what came
with the box we have two elastic bands
branded with err audio now there are
quite a selection of ear pieces that
came with this it being a universal
driver right these are the ones that you
slide over the end piece and gives you
different fits different sizes there's
actually different styles in this one as
well you can see here hopefully these
are more cone shaped
these are more of your typical size here
and this one actually comes with a
cleaning device as well and some more
sizes with a separation piece in it
through the ear canal in this so those
are the universal dryer those are the
other site those are the universal tips
that come with this the headphone itself
fits in your ear and then those go into
the ear canal these views for balanced
armature drivers which are pretty nice
that's two for low one for mid and one
for the high frequencies they are in the
style of more like typically what you
will see with a custom in-ear monitor in
that they go in your ear and then this
top part is actually interchangeable
like a lot of the other ones and it goes
around your ear like that it's pretty
nice you can see the wood faceplate on
here that is standard with this and this
is a purple shade with some small
sparkles in it the design of these is
very light I like that a lot if fits in
your ear much better than a lot of the
other in your monitors that are
universal that I have used which is
really nice the sound for these is for
my to my ears just a little bit treble
forward compared to some of the other in
years that I have however nothing too
extreme on that front a lot of other
reviews have said that they are straight
flat and that could definitely be with
depends on your perception mine just a
little bit trimmer for but not in an
unpleasant way great extensions
throughout the top end and the low as
well I found a little bit of volume
didn't hurt these guys really brought
out the bass a lot really nice texture
there additionally there was a lot of
great top-end air and detail with these
for these run $400 and for $400 you're
getting some very
solid fidelity I would dare say you know
some of the best I've seen in this
brought in this price range around 400
and in universals in general you know
with a custom and air also just sell
this version in the custom for $300 more
you'll generally get a better fit
because it's obviously molded directly
to your ear and then you might get a
little bit more bass I have not heard
these with a customs so I can't actually
make any direct observations for the
sound signature however based on the
universals a lot of greats happened a
lot of detail for the $400 range and
really great presence throughout the
frequency so these come with one of your
typical cables so if you actually wanted
to swap this out you could exchange is
for a better cable there's a lot of
custom cut cable makers out there for
this style of this type they also you
know make them a little more robust they
do kinds of crazy things and some people
think believe that they change the sound
quality as well so if you're gonna
insist Watkyn cables this is definitely
something you can do that with my chose
the medium tips here they come right off
like that I don't know if you guys can
see this clearly but there is in case
you can't they are it's a dual bore
design so the frequencies come through
two bores located right through here
these just slip back on like so I didn't
have any problems with these coming off
or anything like that
and then easily interchangeable for
basically anything any size you want
depending on your hair canal big small
my ears work quite well with the mediums
that came with it which is kind of nice
but if you did happen to have larger
ears there was a much larger size that
was too big for me so there's I think
there's a range for just about every
type of tile style of your candle out
there so really nice stuff I really like
to build on them if you're looking for
uh uh you know uh slightly treble focus
sound around $400 in ear monitors you
know this is definitely something you
should check out great sound great build
and you know really comfortable or that
kind of universal fit and if you love
cases you know over Lena's case too so
that is the air audio for dot ai4 stands
for the number of bounce armatures in
here for each year and the I am assuming
stands for the universal fit
so that's them guys if you have any
questions feel free to leave a comment
in the comment section I'll try to get
to them and if you get a chance as
always try to subscribes I always help
that helps us out here so have a good
week you guys take care
fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
