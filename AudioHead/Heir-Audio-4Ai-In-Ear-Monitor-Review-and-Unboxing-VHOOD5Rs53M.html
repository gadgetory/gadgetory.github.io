mmm
everybody audio head here today we're
doing an unboxing and review of the air
audio for dot a I Universal in-ear
monitor get right to it on this one take
her out we have a very nice box in this
case a little bit larger than I've seen
before and some other in ear monitors
but some really nice build actually I
think this is one of the nicest cases
that has come even though size is
relatively larger the bill the handle
just a box in general it's above and
beyond what a lot of the other guys do
as you can see here it's got foam
padding on both sides what came with the
box we have two elastic bands branded
with air audio now there are quite a
selection of earpieces that came with
this being a universal driver these are
the ones that you slide over the NPS and
gives you different fits different sizes
there's actually different styles in
this one as well you can see here
hopefully these are more cone-shaped
these are more of your typical size here
and this one actually comes with a
cleaning device as well and some more
sizes with a separation piece in it
through the ear canal pneus so those are
the universal dryer does the absite
those are universal tips that come with
us the headphone itself fits in your ear
and then those go into the ear canal
these use for balanced armature drivers
which are pretty nice that's two for low
14 mid and one for the high frequencies
they are in the style of more like
typically what you will see with a
custom in-ear monitor in that they go in
your ear and then this top part is
actually interchangeable like a lot of
the other ones and it goes around your
ear like that it's pretty nice you can
see the wood faceplate on here that is
standard with this and this is a purple
shade with some small sparkles in it the
design of these is very light I like
that a lot if it's in your ear much
better than a lot of the other in your
monitors that are universal that i have
used which is really nice the sound for
these is for my to my ears just a little
bit treble forward compared to some of
the other in years that i have however
nothing too extreme on that front a lot
of other reviews have said that they are
straight flat and that could definitely
be with depends on your perception mine
just a little bit trouble for but not in
an unpleasant way great extensions
throughout the top end and the low as
well i found a little bit of volume
didn't hurt these guys really brought
out the base a lot really nice texture
there additionally there was a lot of
great top-end air and detail with these
for these run four hundred dollars and
for four hundred dollars you're getting
some very
solid fidelity I would dare say you know
some of the best I've seen in this bra
in this price range around 400 and in
universals in general you know with a
custom and air also does sell this
version in the custom for three hundred
dollars more you'll generally get a
better fit because it's obviously molded
directly to your ear and then you might
get a little bit more base I have not
heard these with a custom so I can't
actually make any direct observations
for the sound signature over based on
the universals a lot of greats happened
a lot of detail for the four hundred
dollar range and really great presence
throughout the frequency so these come
with one of your typical cable so if you
actually wanted to swap this out you
could exchanges for a better cable
there's a lot of custom cut cable makers
out there for this style this type they
also you know make them a little more
robust they do kinds of crazy things in
some people think believe that they
change the sound quality as well so if
you're going into swapping cables this
is definitely something you can do that
with my chose the medium tips here they
come right off like that I don't know if
you guys can see this clearly but there
is in case you can't they are it's a
dual bore designed so the frequencies
come through to UM boars located right
through here these just slip back on
like so I didn't have any problems with
these coming off or anything like that
and then easily interchangeable for
basically anything any size you want
depending on your hair canal big small
my ears work quite well with the mediums
that came with it which is kind of nice
but if you did happen to have larger
ears there was a much larger size that
was too big for me so there's I think
there's a range for just about every
type of tile style of your candle out
there so really nice stuff I really like
to build on them if you're looking for
uh uh you know uh slightly treble
focused sound around four hundred
dollars in ear monitors you know this is
definitely something you should check
out great sound great build and you know
really comfortable or that kind of
universal fit and if you love cases you
know over Lina's case too so that is the
air audio for dot a I that for stands
for the number of balanced armatures in
here for each year and the IM assuming
stands for the universal fit so that's
them guys if you have any questions feel
