have the noble 5 s custom in-ear monitor
what makes these kind of special is
they're made out of silicone as opposed
to the normal material that a lot of
guys use right now which is acrylic it's
harder so these are more of a flexible
feel flexible mold they still fit
roughly the same size they're done
through a process where they take a mold
of your ear so basically they're kind of
the same thing as acrylic just injected
with a different material that's more
flexible unfortunately due to structural
restrictions the number of balanced
armature drivers that grace these
headphones is usually smaller than
what's possible with acrylic this is the
top-of-the-line flagship buy noble that
is five drivers that's two for high two
for mid and one for the bass frequencies
the bass frequencies are not thinned out
by any means with just the one driver in
fact a lot of that has to do with the
way they're tuned and the way they're
designed and engineered in the case of
these particular in your monitors I'd
say the frequency curve the refrigerants
a response curve tends to be more
v-shaped just means that there's a
little bit more of a boost in the bass
frequencies and also a little bit more
boost in the trouble just a little bit
of sparkle on the top end however the
bass on these is accentuated a little
bit more it kind of drops drops up a
little bit higher than your some of the
other in your monitors out there if you
like nice big full bass
these are definitely something you want
to check out it has a nice robust it
kind of follows the bass guitar a little
bit farther up this scale then some of
the other in your monitors that I had on
hand but all the same if you love bass
it's very inert
sound and at no point does it really
crowd the mids or infringe upon any of
the other frequencies so it works in
this space that it's given the way its
distributor works very very well it's
just a bit bigger than neutral the
design on these is a custom design from
noble they can work with the artwork on
these to put kind of whatever you want I
think there are some restrictions but
they do a really good job of the artwork
some of the gold flake stuff I've seen
online and things of that nature are
really really spectacular looking so
they're definitely flexible and speaking
of flexibility I can show you guys how
this exactly is way more flexible here
is the tip to my delightful ear now you
can see it's actually way more flexible
the whole thing is kind of flexible in
general I really wouldn't recommend
pushing these things too far you can see
there's components and also obviously
ear channels in different tubes which
the sound goes through so I wouldn't
roughhouse to think too much but
needless to say they are more flexible
in that regard a lot of the other
headphones made I have a crook there's
there's no budging whatsoever they're
rock-hard like little pieces of ice just
very very tight
first and foremost though if you're
going for comfort fit is most important
if they don't fit right they're not
gonna feel good regardless of what
material you choose to make them out of
however if you get it the right fit and
you think silicone might be a better fit
from you I did find the isolation to be
a little bit better I have a several
pairs of ear plugs actually made out of
these this material as well and I find
it works really well some people might
prefer acrylic others might prefer this
like I said that's kind of a choice just
like base is often
choice it something you need to decide
for yourself perhaps if you're really
interested you can look into getting
some custom silicone ear plugs they
don't run too much they're basically the
same thing as this is just completely
filled with silicone and see how those
work out for you and if you like those
fit better or worse than acrylic that
might be one route to go but overall a
really good sound the sound scape and
the detail is excellent for a flagship
these do run a little bit more they
actually $12.99 that's twelve hundred
and ninety nine dollars so they are the
flagship silicone from noble but in
response to that the detailer is very
very acute it's very sharp it has a nice
wide soundscape to it the soundstage
spread really nice and even across that
I thoroughly enjoyed them if you like a
little bit more bass
this is definitely something you should
be looking at and for a silicone
flagship this is really kind of where
it's at - so if you have the option to
check them out definitely do so they're
a wonderful little piece I'm a big fan
of in-ear monitors for portable
listening I really think it's kind of
the best way you can go if you don't
mind sticking things directly in your
canal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
