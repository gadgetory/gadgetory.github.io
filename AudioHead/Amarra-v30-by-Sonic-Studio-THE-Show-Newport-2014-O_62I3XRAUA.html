at the the Newport the show and we're
looking at a brand new piece of software
from Sonic studio called Mara 3.0 just
about to be released later this month
right around the 15th 16th of June so
you get to see it first okay so if you
know anything about Amara Amara is
really a hotrod engine for iTunes what
it does is it installs Sonic's mastering
level audio engine on top of iTunes so
when you play music through iTunes what
you're do is you're actually bypassing
the core audio engine that comes with a
Mac and you're playing through the same
mastering engine that's used to create
seven out of ten CDs that are in your
collection
in fact most vinyl out today has
actually been mastered with the
soundblade mastering system from Sonic
studio Amara it uses that same engine
for playback Amara 3.0 this is the new
blue version that you're gonna see out
later this month in June about 16th or
17th this month includes some really
cool new features including DSD support
it has a capability of going up to 384 K
PCM it includes new functionalities such
as a our integrated impulse response
correction system that we've developed
in conjunction with direct research in
Uppsala Sweden some of the modes that
Amara features are cash play as well as
our playlist mode as you're seeing here
that allows you to run even without
iTunes many of our customers say they
like it that way the best along with
Amara 3.0 we're releasing a brand new
application for streaming content it's
called Amarra sq Amarra sq essentially
is our our Amara processing engine and
for band EQ and it essentially makes
every streamed service sounds so much
better in this case we're using with
Pandora
but you can use with Spotify beats
YouTube Netflix any streaming content
service will benefit and sound
significantly better when using Amara SQ
here's what it looks like you get four
bands of multiple filter types of EQ a
graphic pick up and grab move around
type of presentation for picking the EQ
you want you've got a if you're using
Spotify for example this is super cool
if you're using the free version of
Spotify you can't mute the ads actually
Spotify will pause and wait for you to
come back this allows you to mute and
Spotify will keep playing
so Spotify users will love that EQ on
and off it's got correct dithering
engine so that means that it sounds
super smooth on the output Amarra sq by
self is going to be a twenty dollar
application and it literally makes every
streaming system sound significantly
better it's a part of Amara 3.0 which
comes out in June sixteenth or
seventeenth and and they upgrade if your
Amara owner is $30 it'll include sq and
and you know we're absolutely sure that
this upgrade is going to be one major
event in the industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
