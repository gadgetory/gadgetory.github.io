here the review we have in front of us
is for the our pack by our cam this is a
headphone and USB DAC combination in one
little unit it's pretty cool I'm gonna
give you a quick unboxing first and then
we'll go into a full review you can see
from the boxing here that it's got some
nice packaging I just like to do quick
touch on that I think it's important to
show the company's effort to how things
go
we obviously have four sides of printed
material pretty high gloss pretty cool
velvet bag pretty standard issue but
still nice to have these days warranty
literature you can see here we have a
USB cable that comes with it also your
standard free looking RCA this is the
unit here as you can see it's quite
small it's relatively heavy for its
sides I wouldn't have to say very heavy
it's very much like a hockey puck I said
in the for review rubberized coating
very good non-slip grip on the bottom
the small headphone jack on the front
two physical buttons here that control
the volume and on the back simple USB
input which is also how the unit is
powered and just a single RCA out very
nice I like it a lot I think that this
thing is one of more durable kind of
heavy feeling DAC combo units I've
encountered in a long time it's it's
very heavy I would say but it feels
solid sitting on the dead
it's not gonna tip over break I'm not
saying it could take a blow if you
dropped it very well but it feels like
you could so there is that the sound
firmness
I found the price point is 250 right now
online I found for that price point that
the sound is fairly accurate for the DAX
section so USB input to the DAC output
for 2 round to 250 it's pretty much on
par with the other decks in the price
range I didn't notice any major external
coloring clarity was good right around
the 250 range and not too many other
issues with it pretty much your standard
sounding to 200 maybe you could get up
to like 250 sounding you know audio
digital to audio translation clear non
colorized very acceptable the headphone
output on this was worked great with
in-ear monitors and easy to drive things
the amplifier was very comparable to
anything else in that range for any of
your monitors however with full sized
headphones it did not quite have the
same kind of juice that I would expect
and along with that I kind of felt like
there's a little bit of clarity lacking
in the overall quality wasn't as high as
I expected so if you're looking at this
for full-size headphones I would
recommend pushing it out to an external
amplifier by these guys right here and
you'll probably go a lot better results
I know I did when I did that situation
so I feel I feel like overall this is a
great little DAC for just your stereo if
you wanted to run this straight out to
that also in ear monitors work quite
well but full-size headphones this might
not be your bagga-t
but it's definitely something worth
checking out if you're using low
impedance in your monitors because that
did work well or just a small footprint
because
you can see this thing is really not
that big at all and the build quality is
probably the best I've seen in a while I
mean it just feels extremely durable
buttons click good there's also an LED
light in the front here that glows green
and flashes when it's going up or down
as you hold down these buttons and then
it goes solid when it's reaches minimum
or maximum level the the internal
amplifier here along with the full-size
headphone kind of thing it they didn't
really have a ton of juice to spare when
it came to really high impedance
headphones so that's something to think
about when it comes to like really the
really hard to push stuff you're gonna
you know in most cases like this anyways
you're gonna need a bigger full-size
more powerful headphone amplifier when
it comes to like things like that bait
bear dynamic 880's like the 600 ohm
stuff mm-hmm
you know it requires quite a bit of
juice so that's it for this deck we have
a couple more coming down the pipeline
which is nice let me know if you have
any questions in the comment section and
it always helps me out if you can
subscribe to the channel on YouTube so
have a good week guys bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
