unboxing from audio head here today we
have the Pan Am by Al
alo audio that's a headphone amplifier
and a USB DAC as you can see we have
quite a few boxes to go through with
this unveiling so let's get started the
first thing I want to show you is the
amp itself as you can see this is just
the top unit it is a tube driven
amplifier with headphones out you can
see it has the small and large volume
control high and low gain and this is
the on/off switch with an amber light
here on the back we have a selector here
for two analog inputs the RCA's and the
mini jack and this is the entrance to
the USB for the internal DAC here we
have the power supply in addition to
plugging into the supplied wall wart
this particular unit has the options to
have an external power supply called the
gateway here and the passport being
external battery that actually stacked
below which I'll show you a little bit
later just to give you a feel what's
inside the box for this one we also have
to tube covers fit over just like that
so if you don't want to burn your hand
or you want to do a little storage for
this thing while it's on your desk those
do come included with the package which
is nice
so that is a next I'll show you what
comes with the accessories as you can
see with this I'm actually really
impressed with the way the packaging if
you guys follow the channel you know
that I'm a big stickler for packaging
really nice packaging I think it's one
of the lost art forms in marketing
that's left but maybe a nod to Apple
which I always think does a really good
job these guys have really bumped up the
packaging on these ones too you can see
the fonts a little better branding there
it's kind of interesting each side
magnets actually hold this paper down
this is like a nice heavy cardboard
stock with a matte finish black very
very cool and the whole thing works
really well and I external sleeve as you
can see here covers it and I said before
magnets allow it to open so it's pretty
fun this is the accessory box this is
the the power supply that comes free
with the amp so this is your standard as
you can see in there Walmart
that's basically the kit that comes with
just the head just the amp if you use it
this power cord goes with the external
power supply here the gateway which I'll
show you just a little bit so that's
what comes in the accessory box
the Gateway here as you can see each box
contains a small pamphlet with some
additional information and then a user
guide out in the back this is the power
supply has your standard switch and your
standard power input there and then this
is the twelfth volt output that can go
to the Pan Am
it also comes included with a couple
varying lengths of these connectors to
the power supply so you have short one a
long one and a medium one as you can see
this puppy fits neatly on top of this so
if you were to let me not try to drop
this the standard small length actually
fits perfectly this length from here to
here
so now I just like to comment while I'm
on the Gateway that within ear monitors
I did notice a blacker background and
less humming and noising with the use of
this external so you know I can say if
you're gonna use the within ear monitors
I would suggest picking up either this
unit the Gateway if you like to plug it
in or if you want to go with a battery
the passport these actually will daisy
chain into each other so if you want to
go the full mile you can get a triple
stack and go external power supply into
the battery then into the unit itself
we'll just kind of fun they'll stack on
top of each other here so let me move
this thing out of the way the last but
not least the passport
as you can see card user guide same type
of packaging same type of look you can
see the three power cuts are also
supplied with this unit to the external
battery so that's nice you get with both
this one's a little more just standard
this interestingly enough has an input
and output from both of these power
supplies so you charge it into here but
you can also plug the power into here
indirectly back into the unit itself so
this one is input and output for power
however if you're going to daisy chain
them together the power supply goes into
here and then you take the longer cord
and put that output into the back of the
PanAm i'll put together the stack really
quick quickly here for you show you what
it looks like from the back
so that is the stack let get some light
over here so
this is what it looks like from the back
if we rotate this around this is what
looks like from the front so it's a nice
neat little thing it doesn't the
footprint I don't know if you guys can
get a good perspective here but this is
not a huge unit I mean as far as two
bands go this thing has got some great
scale to it
very nice um as far as the sound is
concerned I just know to noticed doodles
of detail really great texture and in
really great bass response as well as
balanced bass across a spectrum really
even highs really nice meds very lush
I'm extremely impressed with the way
this thing performed I really like the
deck itself it does a decent job I
compared it to the deck mini it's it's
it I would say it it's it's very nice
it's a little more larger than than the
deck many however I did think that the
deck manie's DAC section was just a
little bit a little bit of an edge over
the deck section here but really nothing
you know you've probably ever noticed if
you're just using this thing on your
desktop so it is a beautiful lamp it
does does land on a bit of the pricey
side the top unit here alone is seven
hundred dollars retail currently so it's
not the least expensive unit out there
however it is fairly nice I really enjoy
this line is from the sound if you have
the spare change it might be something
you want to look at because it really
performs pretty pretty well with both
in-ear monitors really the high
sensitive things that you can plug
directly in there and then full-size
headphones I drove it with a pair of LCD
3s and I've heard that it works up to
600 Romed phones without much problem so
if you're looking for an all-in-one
combo unit a DAC integrated with a
pretty good headphone amplifier this may
be something you really want to kind of
give a test run if you get the chance
for what it does it is one of the best
