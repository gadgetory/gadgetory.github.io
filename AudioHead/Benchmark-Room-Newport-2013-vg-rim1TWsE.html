media systems out of Syracuse New York
and we're here at the home entertainment
show at Newport Beach showing our latest
generation of deck tube bats D to a
converters as well as a reference
preamplifier both the deck to D and the
deck HGC
for hybrid gain control the deck to HGC
adjusts digital volume in the digital
domain and adjusts analog in the analog
domain both of these units will accept
up to 24 192 on the USB as well as in
the coax input
they both will playback DSD for those
who have DSD downloads and would like to
be able to enjoy those in addition we
give word length and sample rate
indications so if you're playing a
24-bit file 192 you know it is helps you
adjust your software because a lot of
mistakes we make the software settings
you click one box on a 16-bit and it's
going to do all kinds of things so our
24 192 might get down sampled 244 1 and
that's not what you're looking for
we also include a headphone amplifier
unlike many headphone amplifiers ours is
a zero ohm output which is what you'll
find in a power amplifier a zero ohm
output will control the driver will give
you a great damping factor you haven't
heard headphone listening unless you
have tried it a benchmark DAC with a
headphone amplifier all of our decks by
the way include a headphone amplifier we
have from our DAC one series to our Dec
2 series
now the nice thing about the deck to the
newest thing is we're using the new DSS
Sabre chip we found that after using our
other one for the deck one series for a
number of years which has been the true
benchmark and acts we're now into the
next generation we think this is the
next 10 years in deck performance in
fact the performance of this unit will
outperform basically any preamplifier or
power amplifier in addition on the as
far as features go we have polarity
invert this does a complete polarity
inversion on both left and right channel
there are some people who are sensitive
to polarity and there are known to be a
number of of disks of CDs which have
been issued in reverse polarity so now
someone can sit back with a remote
control and make that adjustment on the
back side and I'll show you the
differences between the back to HDC on
the deck 2d which is our latest one what
we have done is we have dropped the
analog inputs on the DAC 2d we had a
number of customers who said to us you
know I'd love to get one but I have I
don't have any analog sources it's all
digital so we brought this unit out and
it sells for a little bit less starting
over over here these are our outputs we
have three sets of analog outputs you
wouldn't find this on a regular
preamplifier usually at the most you'll
find two we have two sets of unbalanced
and we have one set of balanced and then
as far as the inputs we have two sets of
stereo inputs for analog so if you're
playing an FM tuner or if you want to
incorporate a turntable in this you can
also do that coming from a phone a
preamp stage to coax digital in to
optical in USB and 12-volt trigger so
now you can use this to start up an
amplifier or the rest of your system it
will power it up and power it down going
up to the deck 2d as I said we've
dropped the analog inputs we've also
dropped the 12-volt trigger the DAC tune
of HDC in 1995 the dec 2d 1795
we manufacture in Syracuse New York made
in USA five year parts and labor
warranty both the deck to deck to HGC
here we have the power button you can
either hit it once for a standby which
means in about four minutes all the LEDs
will go out you'll be in a standby mode
it's still using a little bit of power
or you can hit the power button twice a
little complete shutdown over here we
have the dim mute button for muting the
entire signal or dim would be a lower
level let's say for instance you're
listening at a higher level of music and
you want to carry on a conversation or
maybe you're running your television
through this you hit the dim button on
the remote or on the face panel it'll
bring it down to a lower level so you
can carry on conversation the polarity
button is for that polarity invert that
I mentioned both channels reverse
polarity can be done on the front panel
or on the remote control input selection
your two analog inputs USB and then D
one through D for all your digital
indicators and you toggle the input by
these two buttons here and then HT for
that home theater bypass or high
throughput over here we have the sample
rate and word length indication 24 or
16-bit 4448 2x and 4x would be your
multiples of 44 or 48 to give you 80 896
176 and 192 if the top to the 4x and the
2x are illuminated that means you're
playing a DSD file now you can create a
playlist on your computer and you can be
mixing DSD and 24-bit 16-bit and as
you're going through on your computer
software program this will automatically
switch for you and then here we have our
two headphone and
and volume controls both of these units
have what we call HT in our HT
throughput we can stand for home theater
bypass or can stand for high throughput
what this allows you to do is to
incorporate the htc model into a home
theater setup you have one room for your
home theater but yet you want to have
the best stereo playback possible you
can put the HTC model between your pre
processor or AVR and your main stereo
amplifier on the on the deck 2d that
becomes a high throughput which would
just give you a fixed output level like
you have from a CD player so for the guy
who insists on keeping his his
preamplifier he can take this out as a
fixed level from the deck 2d or the deck
to HGC and go right into his pre
amplifier in addition both of these
units have full function remote control
all of the inputs can be selected from
remote control as well as mute button
volume and on and off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
