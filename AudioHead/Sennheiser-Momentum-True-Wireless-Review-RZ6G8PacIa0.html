called the momentum true Wireless the
reason they are called true Wireless is
that they no longer have like the Apple
earpods wire connecting the two
earpieces together like we see here in
the Forza metallo wireless from v-moda
previous generations had this kind of a
setup to allow more battery power and
antennas and that sort of thing in a
dongle or some type of attachment with a
wire now we're all moving towards what
Apple kind of set the precedent at
initially with a piece it just fits
straight in your ear with nothing else
connecting it that means in turn that
there's less battery space which then
equates to four hours of playback with
this particular model now the case has a
battery in it which also charges the
headphones which gives it another 12 so
there's a compromise there four hours
compared to the motors design which can
give you up to ten hours of playback
time all by itself one other thing
that's really cool though about this
headphone is its functionality basically
they have it set up to four with the
touchpad at each side of your head which
you can the right side control phone
conversations and connecting to your
assistant like Siri and then the left
side you touch it once to play once to
pause that kind of thing also broken up
is the volume control touch the left
side for volume down touch the right
side for volume up so I'm kind of a
slick apparation but one really
interesting thing is one of the features
that I'd like to see in all kinds of
headphones that are coming out which is
the ambient listen feature double tap
the right side and you can hear your
surroundings through the microphones
that's not something you see in every
headphone but they did choose to include
it here another thing that I'm really
impressed with this particular model is
the weight the weight of the piece in
your ears is probably one of the
lightest that I've seen even with in
your models customs that you tend to be
a little bit weighty add that cable in
there it's even more this particular
headphone they pop right in and they are
very light so you can kind of run around
and do your everyday
with them in and it's not too much of a
drag on your person especially becomes
important when you're it's into your ear
canal just so a lot of weight on the ear
canal can get irritating after a while
so that's a big plus in my opinion they
also fit really well into the overall
ear and the weight is distributed really
well they're so good fit is important
and they kind of did a good job here in
terms of the overall sound quality I
found it to be pretty good for Wireless
I have a caveat with that of course that
if you're really into hi-fi high
fidelity you're gonna get better results
with Wired things the codecs are just
not up to par right now with Wired
sensibilities however if you're just
gonna go on the go and listen in a noisy
background these might be a great fit
for you the main thing is that the
background is not as black as wired so
details don't jump out as much that
being said practicality loud
environments they're not too shabby
they're seal well and like a typical I
am to me the bass has a good splash a
good punch to it when it's just bouncing
around your ear canal it's not the most
natural thing but if you like bass
that's kind of there it has that nice
punchy low-end it's on par with what we
heard with the v-moda option in terms of
amount of bass so it's not a ton it's
not over at blown it's not too thin if
you don't get the seal nailed down just
so you can lose some of that on the low
end however I did find that the V motifs
had a little bit more treble to them
overall both headphones sound pretty
good and tend to follow the same
signature that you find in a lot of IEMs
around this price range not overinflated
bass
not too much craziness up top just a
nice listenable kind of signature i also
compared them to the very expensive
ultimate ears live with their bluetooth
dongle where I found that to have a
little bit more overall smoothness even
through bluetooth then both of these
things combined but with their price
point of over $2000 that's hardly a fair
comparison but I did want to let you
guys know what was out there in terms of
possibilities and the flagship UE live
actually had a little bit less trouble
than both of the other headphones so if
you're looking for
something in your portable lineup of
audio products the Sennheiser true
Wireless I am is definitely something
you should take a look at if you're
looking for something on the go to
complement your other hi-fi gear that
you already have it captures
Sennheiser's know-how of creating good
sonic signatures given the materials
they have and the price point to deal
with that also has a real kind of
homerun in the functionality I from a
digital and just kind of interactive
perspective there's a ton going on here
they have great volume control it's it's
comfortable its lightweight there's good
design elements yes there's only four
hours of rated battery life but you can
get some more with the case so they're
kind of overcoming these obstacles that
you run into as you go along
and as the entire kind of technology
evolves these are a good place holder
for what can be had in terms of right
now
you know they perfect know are they
really good attempt at what they can do
yeah I'd say yeah and even though it's
just my opinion on this one I do think
they look a little less awkward than the
Apple stem sticking out of your ears
they sit in your hair like a silver
piece of jewelry a little less
inconspicuous and that's so blazingly
white and you know projective and true
Wireless I am from Sennheiser runner
about $300 and you can find them on
their company website ascend Heiser and
all the local retailers they sell in
that so thanks for the listen guys have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
