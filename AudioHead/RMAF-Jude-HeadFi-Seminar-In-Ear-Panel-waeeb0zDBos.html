mental regularly they've been doing it a
long time one of the more interesting
things I've seen and now dr. sonoda is
here from sony home now and he's head of
the headphone development at Sony I
wanted to talk to you now because you
guys actually made some balanced
armature here's a couple of models which
I actually quite light especially the XP
a three relatively affordable something
tell me what's the XP injury three
hundred bucks you know their belts and I
think it's a wonderful piece I put it in
our buying guide because I recommend it
but you gots to be an interesting route
I mean you haven't been doing balanced
armatures a long time you just started
but unlike everybody else that I've seen
you actually developed balanced armature
drivers on your own rather than sourcing
from somewhere else why would you have
done that and how did you do it as you
did well ok so what's going to talk
about the air so far down summative why
do we decided to treat to start
producing d that's about how much are
driving it as hell in the past with the
weak ones believed for some time with
two abilities is award since they are
versatile person and everyone is suppose
beer so but the doesn't Drive anything
to have a slightly softer diaphragm and
if which you know which will offer
support air to either your ear channel
and then focus of all of that big driver
realities is a lot more ideas of
solution partner but there's a row after
we we have seen this over but we all
market the 60 days of these guys as a
world like it's all 28 years ago look at
some other for sure some kind of those
manufactures harder to be are a simple
very good start so much driving its head
Iran's and so yes so what we have seen
as an opportunity for that this is
another opportunity does in the bigger
the parties opportunity but they usually
quality opportunity as its all those all
kind of this bounce how much driving it
sugar it's a great good isolation from
environmentalists out to issue you can
and then photos of our we thought as if
this is good for mobile use so then we
decided to go we decided go to us
without supper to drive a weird and then
once a month end we needed reading we
did Carter and launched this product
it's very intuitive there is a recent
years either other one we wanted to
control everything such as well from the
years of this we scratched to these and
fun profit then there's a one that is
very issue is a subtract minute so if we
don't promise be traffic by ourselves it
doesn't mean we cannot so we cannot get
the earth ideal society characteristics
or without that they did was we decided
so whilst on the card it starts pragma
by factoring
what you're dropping well yes that goes
against I mean you actually are
developed at that certainly is not an
inexpensive way to do are a spoof of
your own belts are but nobody else is
will develop into a balanced armature
drivers so that's pretty cool you've
obviously invested line that will we see
more products balanced armature products
from selling yes so one of the show I be
got my digits also possible like us is a
sin city so Sony is a big company and
say what we have made as a there is a
big investment for these two have to
produce these about so much of traveling
then if there are one of it is a key is
out there is only but motivated are the
production line for the advance on which
is rightly that's the key also
affordable insist on something tonight
how much are driving but so I'll repeat
it to heaven when it is a compromise
ation on the years about the design
movies about some photography fantastic
all right well that's you know I wanted
to love being that this is a hype I show
and there's a lot of extreme I by here I
wanted to transition into some of the
higher end stuff and a lot of people
don't know in the audio world is that
some of the best sounding headphones in
the world regardless of our Factory in
my opinion anyway are some of the top
notch custom in-ear monitors that are
available and that's where we have Gerry
Harvey Carl card right from West down my
thigh a small tears Gerry Harvey now JH
audio is really the guy who sort of
invented the multi driver custom in-ear
monitor and actually there's a really
interesting story behind it
helping jerry can share that he were
good actually the guy next to my left my
left here and I we kind of work together
from what 94 95 about 2,000 so we were
kind of a real team I would push Carl
the gold stuff and I will be out in the
field I was doing van Halen to Taemin we
decided he answered a phone one day and
I call me decided he work with me so I
owe a lot of what happened to Carl great
guy and we were a really good team in
the early years so you know we developed
a lot of good stuff together I would
push you but you know I couldn't have
done anything without him we were a
great team so where did the idea come
from you know like initially with Alex
yeah well in ear monitors been around
probably for at least five years before
that because first company called on
Carla radio stations and they actually
were the first professional in-ear
monitor mugler company the gentleman
named Marty Garcia that actually started
in ear monitors but his idea was to take
a diaphragm put it in a mold and that
wasn't you know the in-ear monitors so
the hardware was very good ear piece was
really horrible so that's why you know
faculty 95 I started working on a
earpiece so I would be fired
decided to make it sound better and
that's what it all came about for that
call karls you know Carl said I can mold
it and work kind of web app there's you
know all the people all people two
people were trying to do in the air
monitor at the time had only dynamic
drivers they were using it as you know
with any magnetic Drive need to have
space you need to have been ting that
old tunes it makes examine right well
back in the early 90s I worked with Bill
Chrysler for a def leppard tour a rushed
or not that I was on the tour but they
were having problems with so much stage
volume that you know their ears were in
terrible shape because they were using
dynamic drivers for the monitors so we
switched them into balanced armature
driver your pieces which essentially
give us a solid earplug so a solid fully
attenuating earpiece could be developed
then Jerry and I got together and we
said well okay you know volume and
destroying these dynamic drivers and
trying to be better outlet out of them
was
the general is facing so we work
together and kind of solve that problem
along the way built a couple of new
ideas a couple companies and okay
probably ninety percent of the companies
that build any air monitors are both
some of the stuff we worked on 95 98 but
yes so that's kind of how it went and I
just looked up at the PA system and I
was like I knew how to tune a PA system
I knew how to you know how you know big
systems work I just thought I'd
miniaturize it and put in an earpiece I
decided this common sense that there
should be a low driver high diver not
just a broadband single balanced
armature because I believe that it's
really almost impossible for one
armature to do the complete bandwidth or
one diaphragm to do the complete
bandwidth so you really have to start
using different-size components to
actually do the proper bandwidth and
split about you know 283 way through we
works about the two ways also acceptable
otherwise everything to do is just
compromise okay you know when we do
multi driver things we have compromised
but everything is compromised you know
the less components that kind of thing
I'm sure you bet same thing working with
these drivers can be very Ward rewarding
and very difficult to front me exactly
what you want himself so gay bi G
original question again once the state
was said with all my drivers it was the
market that really helped crack the
sounds that sound was interpreted the
companies involved because the market
with musicians always seeking another
level of perfection more clarity or
death or some competitive that kept dry
in this market and it wasn't ppl apart
support the kids will all disappear
so so years and years of gives you know
perfection speaking of every right sound
signatures with all the best years
industry kid for consumers are to get
hip in the early early early information
at by first colony members internal we
started to gravitate what about using
this version these pro technologies for
a consumer-grade business experience and
that was this next level of generation
harmony and network third iteration
where you have created problem using to
consumers and it's still you know I mean
as far as the prospector consumers on
the custom side sill few people that I
rm2 even know what they are yet they're
familiar with the fact that the favorite
musicians use them how many in here
actually ever had custom in-ear monitors
made so in this room actually about
third and get these yeah but mostly
people rented to never use them or even
thought about it but never played with
the back to musicians use it not
realizing that the fact it's been
favorite artists are using some best
sounding headphones have been
professionally for years I found in
general custom in-ear monitors to have a
substantial sonic advantage what they're
done right versus any of the best
universal bits i've got any way I think
you might try out my 357
good as a top magic I say the best the
best generic good one the high for me is
the sheer 535 and doesn't hear from me
900 I like 25 35 you know I have a
question that how much of this stuff
came I'm talking about all the sound
reinforcement stuff but what about from
the hearing aids I and mot can you
notice Oh etymotic wasn't really
involved in the professional sites they
have seen about the storage of the art
or so me actually kind of launched into
these he was the first person to
actually take a balanced armature make a
broadband to your case it was originally
developed for a piece of tested with it
just so happened that a guy in the lab
was going you know bored one night he
was bumped some tunes the address
microphone and that's where the art for
Cain so you know when you said clinical
that this truly is if the Air Force I
still get peace no disrespect meant yeah
but it would be nice that beat killing
you know you're better but but yeah
that's LSPs but so what what what gives
if it is same if you go along with me
the way i feel i think customs do sound
up in the university it's a try what
would give a custom the advantage i'm
just trying to understand wat you know
what what what are some of the real
estate in an outer space to work you can
arrange a components properly you can
you can do things
now most of the generic earpieces
there's a compromise in the board
structure is always a high-frequency
lost you don't have that in a custom
piece because you have you can put two
three boars whatever you need to do to
get the frequency response to extend out
I mean it also has obviously do with
driver you know design those kinds of
things but basically the real estate
works in your favor and a custom all in
more places to put components in you can
make the tubes of proper links things
like that and as manufacturer protests
and managing universal codes of
universal disabilities
real estate that
you know everybody's ears is unique is
there okay and we can all use language
to talk about what we hear but we'll
never hear what each other so then we
can make advantage of the canal except
to open up the sound to get early grave
with depth if you will into the impaler
closer to the TM then you could with any
kind of universal design I think there
are distinct advantages there that we as
manufacturers can use to make this
particular model Sam faster you know
Jerry was talking about different sound
boards different lengths and force
different there's all kinds of things
that come into play that you can use to
improve the quality of central I think
we're going to see now going forward the
next five years we'll see another
we'll catch up to the customers are now
well but the demand are going to you say
still so unknown custom side the demand
is going to create
20
just going to drive the parking spaces
drive quality so i think it will be
Oh
whistles may also see the same tensely
those companies here really driving the
market universal sign when you can get
more massive fuel
those years
we're going to see another way
yes Oh Carl you mentioned that you do
universals and customs does the custom
does anything you learn from customs
have any relevance I mean does it pass
down is it like the formula one where
the technology can action find its way
to Paris eventually yeah it definitely
works that way into anything that we
learn we would use to our advantage or
as much of that particular theory
practice or whatever did you can
physically fit into a custom product and
you know I also think you know earlier
you talked about entry-level products
and stuff like that I still think you
know I remember Jerry I first talked too
sure about a universal in your monitor
and what they were going to do versus
what we did for them you know we even
brought up the fact that you know
there's a whole consumer world out here
but that world needs to be educated
because quite truthfully as you guys
probably know most people don't know
what good soundings because a bit
inundated since birth with this look our
scenario sounds like this
sounds like and this is what your ear
about set by the mass market stuff out
there those groups like this and
manufacturers and magazines like this
that are actually raising the level so
that people out there will start to
expect more I mean you know if you look
at a car from 40 years ago and all the
features and stuff that it had actually
can apply every six months now you can
apply it every six years okay and so
consumers are becoming educated they're
willing to pay more for the things that
offer all this up and i think the
balanced armature driver gave you the
finer things you had one that a
completely new balanced armored car
driver from the scratch I mean that
that's really exciting kind of late but
I'm figuring those things really
exciting and I think they do show that
you know even his fist cases of our
phone bills up and people are going to
expect better and better and more and
more and it's going to comfort comfort
for us to keep on but in our camp exact
exactly i mean it's like ike remember
when I you know I a little bit of a
crappy musician when I played my first
game it was like 200 wat PA and for 10
inch speakers on each side of the stage
now I mean it laughed out of it even a
small group of them with that so
everybody sucks more everybody expects
better than I think that you know some
of the companies up here you can
continue to deliver the high end of what
other people will respond God Chris yet
sup y'all talk I'm sorry I just thought
it might
back to part of the question you asked
for me
bring the party
which is why I invited Syrian
hey guys our research leads us believe
sonic reality if you
isn't actually the same
humans and our research
because who we are
there are clusters of ideas of what
neutrality would be in an in here so
what we'll do is we'll go platform you
basically never get here and a series of
filters that match those curves that we
believe me the most common ones
plug-in Phil 3d or see see what times
with your sense of hearing blah blah
we've got neutrality for you next you
woman next to perceive things
differently
they can pick a different filter and
then they'll be happy so i think that
idea makes the water intuitive sensing
and what dessert comes out of this
what I find is a little review product
try and reactions will be all over the
map this thing really can't stand wow
this thing needs more eyes and beds Wow
the high end is hotter than molten glass
I need to trim it and you kind of think
issues who the same product not this
thing they have been they've learned a
lot of live music so I mean it's not
like they just fell from space what's
that they're literally trying to chase
realistic reproduction but it's not
coming out so what it's worth that's
like
meow
decided to build its mega uber universal
fit in here not one of the Affordable
phone app when they felt their cave 3003
they use very similar hopefully the
other thing that sometimes universal fit
hol on a date on your shoes so that
they're able to me
I but it's not an axiomatic universal
fits actually kind of art or so legends
and
probably ignore this yourself these are
really comfortable trying rather stay
open
Oh
guys make guesses about
University customers solve the problem
freeway
I would agree that experience with the
ear
multiple
here's is looking
when we first started to our university
of west on laboratory
probably the largest man
pause for a year
Oh
I've been there for
sorry
supplies customer
so it's kind of thing
I would agree that experience into your
particular universe is most critical I
mean every area can he go with the
generality every year from the aperture
accountant genetic memory is
approximately 25
every years Arsenal TC symbolic from
earpiece to TM I can tell you from
reality that's not necessarily
game company that
general broad guidelines I know Sydney
office here is my brother Chris parties
also long-term died here harvest and
stomping yeah
everyone that has a universal fit that
is a comfortable that should thank Chris
because he designed that for sure
brother so yeah I was going to say his
design is probably the most copy design
on the planet as a matter of fact I was
on Amazon the other day looking at here
pieces and there's a new company out
that's talking about their revolutionary
teardrop did but you know when when we
decided to design the universal we had
years of experience with Beauty discuss
appearances and so we could visualize a
log of what we'd seen the best and as a
benefit we have access to thousands of
human ear impressions and we you know
spent like two days with a notebook and
rulers and dividers and all kinds of
stuff in the weed measure and came up
with what we thought was the optimum
shape or aim
if you haven't tried I mean yeah sure
brothers products are kind of based on
that designed west end products there
are a few others now that are kind of
wasted but if you're looking for
universal go any few years is and also
the bodies up so maybe it has been an
influential thing
and that relationship with here is both
these gentlemen sent us really
there's something to work or not talking
about and that's the human side of them
so we can we can all talk about it here
we can talk about the ideals but if the
pieces are other way that they're big
but they're funny nobody's inviting you
make it sound a to ask them one of our
first Universal designs which was one of
my favorite sonic signature look like
franchise owners and it and so so we can
have all the data points we can say this
is what an earpiece should look like but
if it doesnt sit flush if women don't
gravitate to it it's not going in there
if it's not truly universal and I mean
Universal and all the spokes what people
buy something sounds good looks good it
feels good it's not going to be a
successful product and so what we're
seeing right now is we're seeing a bird
of all of these things and we're seeing
it Luna to where it is consumer friendly
customer accepted our new universal 900
in my opinion are one of the nicest I've
ever seen in a bit right of the year but
should
what's happening now so we're really
seeing and we will continue to see that
direction loli begs to differ the noble
does beg the differ because he's got
earphones that are shaped like trumpets
and triangles and all sorts of stuff but
I can tell some whole hell of our and
that's nice actually like confidence
okay I'm just saying I mean it's coach I
mean right Olivia yeah but looks like a
trumpet but but it having sounds good
for university but alright so before we
because I want to end with the custom
guys again cuz i have some point i want
to make I got her my not here blackberry
by JH audio Matt for any specific reason
other people see them easily to black
but before we move on I wanted to leave
the manufactures out of this one in
toxic tile Chris and say so we were
talking about universal fit
recommendations I want to start with my
first we're talking about that I'm not
saying he's here this is the sony x ba
three I really like a tech that's three
hundred dollars or there abouts in
Ultimate Ears UE 900 feet right those it
yeah I like those a lot the Westone 4r
not just good these guys are sitting and
they happen to be some of the best in
your manufactures here the shirt SZ 5 35
are mine and the Phonak extra the DfE
232 I think like you know like them know
a lot of your reputation why I first of
all I really hate anything that's
piercing right anyway what's which one
of those bright it virtually all really
yeah I think I don't like the Sony's I
don't i sure's are spinning up her for
universal fit I like the peonies that
Chris mention the and the cheap ones she
wants yeah they're not very they don't
have very much bass in them either a
little bass shy but they're very very
clean sounding they remind me a lot of
the edamame PR course if you're trying
to get a lot of isolation that etymotic
ER for PE offers more isolation and it's
not anything bugs organ arming in a lot
always just really able to shove it very
feature I like it's just happening oh
yeah that's how I didn't sound and all
the other one so we disagree on this
choice what about a guy from know so I
tend to like smooth sounding stuff and
fundamentally that's really really hard
these tend to be a little
so the SB 535 20 yeah so the SE 535
where it goes in the real force the
swagger real voice to beat their
dynamics they're not get down yeah then
Isis has to get it dad or what about you
Chris oh there's a shrimp was point for
the magazine you'll see free copies of
these around and the writers got to say
as open your phone anna has on section
and so
well sort of
to which is the lesser
classic
the corporate interests yeah that's good
there it is really comfortable
that'sthat's of a time yeah I have my
favor of monster cables
some for
they are appealing
really feeling well field that day
I
too bright never lose the filters move
alright so now we were funny when i text
i want to get back to customs because
that even though they go deeper I
finally be more comfortable do you talk
that much what about your comfort and in
addition to that baby sound but they're
also a lot easier to put in so you don't
have to roll so this is left your piece
it's in and then when you want to take
it out
and it isolates very well I found that
it causes like this devil appears that
you just ordered a 16 so yeah so these
are changing speeds here I black the
sound of do-gooder easy to see but there
they go and using AC little well they're
very comfortable because they don't
place a lot about the press releases if
you get a proper bit under year canal so
from a conference standpoint are also
anybody wanted anything about comfort
sound advantages with the customs well i
was just going to handle the comfort
you know some people go well
maybe it's hard plastic and but you know
it's just like a super
ok
back
the wall mr.
and some of that is you
follow me
we all have our secret sauce
he's in treatment brushes don't be
different
and that is to authorize what we get out
of the earpiece so google number scalar
persons
pression talking about
they're not just an impression taker for
no reason at all longer than they have
to be in the mall and you were close we
can exhibit this serious thing but if
you take the right steps all
manufacturers
we'll have the most amazing sounding
comfortable
and if you're going to invest in
thousand dollar in ear monitors it
doesn't hurt you to call the
manufacturer because you just tell where
you live and be looking for an
audiologist so just to make me fear that
reminds me I don't know who knows what
we're talking about your get to shooting
silicone impressions of your ears today
Jack's silicon interiors develop the
whole ear canal that's how they get
discussion you're here and call the
manufacturers and ask for a
recommendation they might have in your
area if you would have been a really
rural area might have to kind of find
them on your own but in most major
cities these guys have recommendations
specific audiologists a big they might
recommend and which say it's good idea
guys to go i would i would say one of
the best place to get your impressions
don't you f bestows because yeah look at
what they're doing you know they know
you're there doing when we get done
resident show so you have at an extra
set of buried in your head phone case of
great listed if I man I don't know what
you are but I
in our booths here and so you can if you
just want to come by and talk to
somebody about the tools and the
materials and the circuit pressures at
least you can get an idea ever watch
them any other scale how much is a
typical set of impressions or so but if
you buy one pair 50 75 meters and now
but Terry you know so the impressions
things interesting like your booth you
have a technology that's being shown
call ya there lantos technology it's so
any or scanner so first quarter next
year hopefully this will be launched
after through their FAA approval and so
we're hoping it within the near future
that the impressions will go by the
wayside because in the back side we're
already using a sewing machines to print
shells and three shade programs to
detail the shells of the UV world you
know UV material so we're going to be
launching with hopefully when it does
we'll be using that stuff next course no
quarter of next year to try to move over
to digital world to get rid of some of
the impression taking
connecticut for all the efforts of
lawlessness absolutely
it is really amazing because they
in any way
Oh
same thing will apply to individual
we're all using for different reasons
and different purposes
the last step will
you should look at impression standard
more suit
I'm not really sure what their business
model is but is going to be readily
available and it will be cheaper than
taking impressions it's like cumin
dollar reusable little balloon that they
put on there that has a couple different
guys in it so well it doesn't use lasers
except their uses did you know it's an
MIT spin-off the design does Lantos and
really the center scanner has been
talked about for the past 15 years we'll
see it in 18 months we'll see it in 18
months while other a few companies that
actually are covering it to market but
the way I think it works and i'm not an
expert on it is that there's a balloon
that actually inflates it has a couple
different color to dye in it and then as
you pull the scope out it's stitches
together the image as it comes out of
the year there's so many points of
reference in there and I guess that I
could be no I'm just giving a broad
stroke I don't know the details of it
but if you want to speak to the lady at
our booth she knows in depth of how this
works if she could be able to details
it's very
there are several different models
scanning technology will be kind of it I
mean for us as manufacturers it'd
probably be ideal if you go to little
supporters booths in call and say I want
a UV 7000 you know carbaryl 78 whatever
it is and you know that's transaction
that takes place instantaneous and bad
that all of us are looking at ways to
make this work as a convenience thank
you because all of us will be customer
otherwise we would be doing the custom
thing now universal is a different
business model but you kind of if you
match the mall store idea in a universal
you know where the doctor Scholl's
Custom she winks our booth I kind of get
probably were some people think that
this is headed
in distribution of better fitting better
sending stuff and a lot of Education
which and then get by itself this
episode because at the end of the day
custom is a hard product to acquire you
have to really want yeah there's some
hurdles and salutes you have to jump
through there I can't think of many
other products that exist that are so
difficult to achieve is that really
shorter than staff and it brings custom
much closer
I think customs are going to become more
confidential we talked about this
actually the pan and panel last year I
think you can start seeing kids wearing
the more of day when I was an extra
coming there is really cool Packers
programmed in with musicians wearing
them so i think the other favorite
artists all burner custom in-ear
monitors when the artist first started
wearing them they were doing that in
like blush colors so they didn't think
they're wearing hearing aids but now
they want you to see you know so i think
i think cousins are going to actually
become more like recipe there you go
kids are always looking for something
the next thing the next cool thing he
also tend to like things are expensive
and clearly expensive so now they do
what they do right if you know that
you've got this you know custom in-ear
monitors name from you're communicating
and you know it's the hundred dollars a
thousand dollars and I think the kids
are going to kind of dig that aspect of
it but it also happens this out that has
to be a good pair so we look at the
success that they've kind of beats
because it's just a cool thing to have
more than anything right I mean what's
cooler than the Beast is actually having
something its design you know custom
whatever color whatever you know we want
bling on a don't want laying on it and
that's even cooler than a set of beads
because it's actually custom view is
kind of status symbol because no one
else has that exact you know it's going
to be a totally personalized custom
earpiece I think that's a lot better
than having the same thing everybody
else has with white headphone right
Brad Brad Brad yes I three more about
what do you think times you think
they'll become too high I the thing that
keeps on coming back to my head is said
that the at the high end of headphones
the custom ten years are so
you know I really can't think of the
head
normal price all night
21
but the days 13 and I have heard of
custom when I'm sorry with some of these
customers are at the top end or just
spectacular and jerry has just flushed
his brain and figured out a whole new
variant if you get a chance to listen to
the Jade's their teens in the it is
booth over there there be coherent sound
not not like anything I
again actually try yes 52 I know I
gesture teens are easy recommendation
we're well into n I've got some of the
ACS is and I've got some of the you erm
and they're all very very good right
back grow in so one of the so the thing
that gets me is that yeah it's expensive
but they're small and really worthwhile
and then yeah you get a pair and it's
like man I have heard like i'll give you
that aggregate how many of you have a
number
the guy's boss
safer
the noise is to be present
and speaking person
well
cone of silence
oh that's what drivers sound like you
don't have air conditioned
TV noises are
forget
way more there's missing here is just
being his I hadn't
her first
thank you off the check yet
yes
and welcome
she just said
I don't know
music
sound coming but not really is that good
I mean the custom drill you got that
kids I guess we'll go to Q&amp;amp;A now for
everybody let's simply guys anything
they want to close with Kim a comment
question those do not get have customs
are pink end up getting a precise case
you won't have
send them back
you get a hot spot either here or
something like that ask you guys about
how
it'll probably all have pretty much the
same if we would like to have you talked
to us remember earlier I said you need
to talk to the tailor you know I mean
did you want your slacks to hang a
certain way you know whatever it is you
need to talk to us because we will do
everything to make sure that your
experience is the best the communication
is anything from the simple mask tell me
it feels big or you know and i will try
any questions let me personally but
somebody much better at it than me will
question you about okay let's let's
let's get a little bit more than
specifics and we'll work through that I
mean even down to if there's a sore spot
in here put some hypoallergenic lipstick
on it put your piece in and send it to
the lab we're going to do the best thing
we can because you know we believe in
tensile in this personal audio
experience does that does that not mask
acquires
that I leave Omori products
yeah oh I think you really need to come
by both to the center here and take a
listen the two different approaches to
to audio you eat as their approach and I
have my approach the thing I can say
about the 16 and the 13 is there the
only earpieces on the planet now that
are actually face correct took me 15
years to figure out how to do it and i
find it did so you're here in my
earpiece you'll probably have a little
bit more bottom in in a reference
because it's more of a flat-bottomed NL
that might speak to that but what I've
been working on is having a very musical
sound leader piece something that you
know as a pleasing audio signature very
wide frequency response and believe it
or not between the tubes and ten and two
o'clock area that is really critical to
have perfect fit that's where you can
really hear the articulation in the mix
all the pans those kinds of things so if
you come and listen kind of live with
them for a little bit and kind of listen
to the separation the articulation and
then you know everybody has occurred
it's kind of like you know salt and
pepper basis kind of like spice right
some people like nobody some people like
more bass and you can stand so I think
more of they're both going to be good
sound an excellent summit earpieces
think a lot of it will be your personal
taste of what you like
and you know the audio signature fine
posted it sort of answer your question
with a question who's your favorite
