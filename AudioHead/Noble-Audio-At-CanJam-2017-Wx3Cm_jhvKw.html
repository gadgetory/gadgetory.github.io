at la live new venue it's been great
we have a few new products that we're
showing that we haven't shown in the US
with the exception of you know Ken Jam
New York in February the first is the
Kaiser encore
which is our ten driver earphone that
replaces the kaiser ten the kaiser
encore is really cool it's almost a
cross between the katana and the
original ten in the sense that it has
the airiness and the extension that the
katana has up top and then it has the
weightiness of of the ten it's been a
really popular piece for most popular
model and we've kind of also changed the
design a little bit with the the
scalloping along the edges and kind of a
blue gray blue gray color as opposed to
red it's a little bit more muted
pepillo the more neutral also new is our
noble act which is a product that we did
in collaboration with mass drop and the
noble X is really cool because it's a
two driver earphone and it's the same
construction as all our classic products
meaning that the cap is precision
concede aluminum and the bottom is ABS
plastic
it's to driver which you know we have
had to driver products in our line
before to the stage is $600 the X is
$250 and it does come down with pared
down packaging but you know a product of
this quality at that price is kind of
unheard of for us and everyone seems to
be reacting very positive good value and
falling from Apple's announcement to
kind of ditch the the headphone jack in
their latest generation of iOS devices
we also have a lightning cable which is
which is our same cable as their
standard black black cable installer
products which is this really nice
Kevlar shielded cable super strong super
durable but instead of having three
point five millimeter termination we
have the Lightning the Lightning jack
and what's really cool is that you know
from noble inception all our products
have always been to Penn and they've
always had the tactical cables so anyone
has ever bought a noble product and now
buy this cable to $80 and they're
automatically compatible with all of all
of Apple's latest and greatest and yeah
man that's about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
