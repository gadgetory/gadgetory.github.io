the lowly came out of doing some R&amp;amp;D for
another project it never came to
fruition so I worked for maybe 14 months
12 to 14 months probably almost the
whole last year with multiple dynamics
and then what I found is that the
dynamic drivers you know everyone uses
them for Low's like when I invented the
first hybrid earpiece in 2005 when other
adult summiteers
I used the dynamics the lows and a
balanced armature for highs it hit there
was phase issues it was really hard to
put it in phase so basically through
trying to do this multi diaphragm piece
I found out that the sweet spot of the
dynamic drivers actually the mid range
between 203 K so that has this tonality
to it measures the same as a balanced
armature but it's just like a microphone
a condenser mic versus a big diaphragm
microphone it sounds different even
though it has the same frequency
response so if there's a depth and a
warmth and a space in there that
balanced armature doesn't do it's
actually the best earpiece I think that
I've ever built even though it's not the
most expensive your piece I've ever
built so it's not as analytical as Aleli
it's more analog sounding so basically
what I've done is I've taken two four
point nine millimeter high output
diaphragms put them in an opposing
opposing cartridge and what this does is
if I control the volume of air between
the two dynamic I can set those the
frequency response of the high mid and
so it's very critical the space in
between these and the other thing that
happens is I ended up and creates a band
pass that starts to roll off at 3k I
hope it out a little bit so basically
it's a total point we call it dumb so as
the dual opposed I don't know what there
what do we call it don't
here we go again I didn't name it I
didn't create the damn thing both on
it's a dual opposed mid enclosure so
basically it's really the the heart of
this new sound of this low low so it's
the first hybrid that has dynamics form
is everyone else uses them for lows and
I think a little sloppy for lows so
that's why we did that so anyway it's a
dual low sub that you know nice beef
roll off and then it goes from 200 to 3k
and then we have the Layla high end from
3k out past 20 cakes so it's kind of a
departure from what we usually do no way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
