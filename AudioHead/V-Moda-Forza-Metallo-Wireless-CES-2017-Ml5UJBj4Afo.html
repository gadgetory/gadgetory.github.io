introducing the Forza metallo wireless
and with a it's a the best form factor
for in-ear wireless headphones you know
you don't want to lose your the head
earbuds
you don't want to lose them you want to
wear it all day long but you don't want
to look like it's pasted ring around the
collar this is the ultimate design so it
has it features a chap lock mechanism
which makes sure that you can wear it
all day and you can really and it never
falls off
we even test it lifting weights doing
situps it really is amazing we tried
over 20 different economic designs is
titanium inside of it so you can really
its flexes with you and as you see here
it's a very minimal design so so the
control pods the control pods are barely
visible when you were in a collar and
this is great so you can wear it all day
long and once you get used to it it's
just something you don't even know it's
there so you can wear it for community
and working and it has a bucket it'll
actually vibrate when you have a call
coming in so you can just put in one ear
and then take a phone call or if you
just want to use your voice assistant
like okay Google or Siri you just hold
up the button for 3 seconds and ask what
the weather is it has two microphones
that noise cancelling microphones so
that these are really functional so it
actually gets a really great sound for
your core microphone conversations and
for voice assistance and one of the
coolest things is that they're actually
customizable so this is actually I'm
wearing a lion head here and this is a
vintage microphone so it's kind of like
your cufflinks you can really if you're
gonna wear it all day long you might as
well get a nice custom cap for it or we
also offer even sport Sport fins which
are a little bit more for that are male
rubber that come inside the box and then
we offered a variety materials just like
we do for our over your headphones in
the caps from HD acrylic rhodium
gold-plated and and all the way up to a
platinum so you can really choose the
style that fits you that 50 best we have
really cool designs like steampunk the
wine head
just vintage microphone and other
designs will be coming out soon and then
also of course we're showing you know
the the v-moda what cross trade wireless
headphone which is won many awards it
works great in analog or in wireless
mode
they won while wired headphones best
wireless headphone ironically if one
gives Moto's best braless headphone and
also just recently won USA Today
reviewed calm best Ross headphone as
well of 2016 so really great product and
it's really amazing that you can also
use it in analog mode too so as soon as
you put in the in in the 3.5 millimeter
it turns off all electronics so you can
get zero latency virtually identical
sound for for gamers and for musicians
and DJs this is essential to have zero
latency a lot of a lot of other brands
actually need batteries when they're in
wire wired mode and they artificially
tune the sound ours has we call it art
where we actually analog to tune the
sound and make sure that it's good just
as good in analog mode or wired mode as
you know many people may know that
roland acquired 70% of you moto so we
really are always about this analog and
make sure that it's a very versatile
headphone for musicians djs and audio
files alike and this is really and now
the emerging trend to is gaming so you
need low latency for gaming and as you
see here here's a customized 14 karat
gold-plated headphone right here yeah so
forza and for some Italo wired models in
both Android and iOS 3 button versions
which is new that we have Android 3
buttons they're already out on the
market now and they go for $100 for the
Forza 130 for the Forza metallo and
they're high res audio Japan Japan audio
Society certified high res audio so they
go for 40 kilohertz the Forza metallo
is coming out in a few weeks we
announced hit a little while ago but
we're fine-tuning little details to make
it perfect and
and such as the nano-coating so that
it's sweat-proof
not only water resistant but sweat
resistant that's really important
because sweat really kills electronics
they'll be one sixth shine and they came
out in a few weeks and the cost of all
have been out now for about a year it's
great its it ultimate every day while
said fun we've tried all form factors
from the ear hooks to the to the little
ear buds but truly the best you don't
have to carry dongle you don't sure you
check the card the charge case get 10
hours of battery life you don't even
know what's around your neck and you can
wear it all day long you have to worry
about putting losing it putting on your
pocket it's really the ultimate form
factor in wireless headphones and that's
what means the most I mean there's novel
and then there's useful and this is
really the best you know the best of
being the most useful and versatile of
wireless in your headphones</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
