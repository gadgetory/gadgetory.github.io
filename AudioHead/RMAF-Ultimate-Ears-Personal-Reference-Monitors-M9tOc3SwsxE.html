we're here can jam and I wanted to tell
everybody about our new personal
reference monitors in the tuning box
here's how this works you get to
actually design your own sound curve you
start with a curve that we've created
and you tailor it to suit your own
hearing profile you're not making wide
eq sweeps but you're making subtle
adjustments so it hits your profile
exactly as your ears hear music you
think of it is the best way to the best
analogy is when you buy in Armani suit
you go to the tailor and before you
leave its fit right to your body and
then all the lines are perfect all the
creases are perfect and it was made
right for you that's what this is you
start to adjust after you're listening
and you make some subtle changes to the
left hi we make some subtle changes to
the left low maybe your right ear is a
little bit more sensitive in the mid so
you turn those down and as you're
turning as you're listening you're
tweaking in the sound until it comes
just perfect for you we've locked these
in we take your measurements we build it
and in about 10 days later you have you
have a in your monitor that was its
unique as your fingerprint it's the only
sound signature that exists and it's all
yours and these are these are the shape
that you get no this is just a testing
piece so as you're listening you're
using these as the test and then a
finalized piece actually comes in a wood
burl finish absolutely beautiful the the
entire process the final product is
about just under two thousand dollars
you have to go to an authorized place
where you can use this tuning box
whether it's at one of these types of
shows in our LA office or New York
office a couple other places around the
country give us a call and we'll set you
up with a place to go to do this
very cool right thanks so much for thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
