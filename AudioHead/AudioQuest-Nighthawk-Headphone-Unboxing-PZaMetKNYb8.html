AudioQuest Nighthawk headphone it
retails for $5.99 it's around the ear
headphone knotted in-ear around the ear
kind of lays on the head with a headband
and such we're gonna just give it a
quick early glimpse to see what it looks
like as you open the box this baby is
fresh never opened so if something's
missing or broken in there I don't even
know we'll both find out together I
guess but this is the initial kind of
outside cardboard box that greets you at
least a day when I open my review pair
here inside the box there is another
layer of protective material here can
you just go ahead and take this out a
fairly nice leather carrying case here I
kind of knew I was expecting I did some
other design elements online and so
forth
however yeah nice carrying case and not
a lot of really nice headphones come
with a nice carrying case so this one is
full on leather it feels like at least
very nice kind of package and that looks
like they took some time just like a lot
of other AudioQuest endeavors do a good
job with the packaging obviously a lot
of thought process into it pretty felt
graphic going on let's unwrap this puppy
and see what's inside there's actually a
little bit more branding on the leather
impressed into here so if you go into
the airport it's settled enough I don't
think anybody notice but use that's
pretty cool
there's also looks like there's a piece
of plastic holding these two together
I'm have to break open here a second
alright now that that is open let's
get into the main event here again the
internal padding here is actually pretty
nice
seems well protected this is probably
aside from maybe your more luxurious
wood cases I gotta say this was a good
one on box because this is probably the
nicest travel case that I've ever come
across I mean a lot of times you get
pouches and other things a little bit of
padding or the folding ones of the hard
case but look at this there's like an
edge of padding this is lined where they
with a separate material and inside here
we have the illustrious headphones the
Nighthawk it's a bit of foam wrapping
around the edge and a bit of more
storage and transportation stuff to keep
them nice let me pull that off real
quick
so that's it's got kind of a unique
smell to it
actually it's a kind of smells like a
combination of leather and barbecue
sauce I don't know why but from kind of
the research I've done online - this is
the cup ear cup here is made I have a
specialty liquid wood they're calling
its I think the design is pretty funny
er this is it not a massive band here
this is actually more of just a wire and
this band at the top actually contracts
in and out so it might be a little bit
cooler and not so much material
obviously light being light light on the
head is always a good thing when it
comes to headphones and long listening
sessions but definitely a an upscale
feel on the pads as well the connection
for the detachable wire is one for each
end so you need to plug one side into
each a headphone ear cup Aria Quest is a
cable company so I would imagine that
this is a pretty darn good cable as far
as cables go I've also been really
impressed with the company's efforts
into the DAX that are out there they did
a small portable deck called the
dragonfly which did really really well I
think in my opinion for the price so
this is more of like another extension
into personal audio here and as far as
packaging and construct is concerned I'm
very impressed
the design is kind of fun it's not
that's definitely different this is a
WoW the Cu Cup is actually like
suspended by four points if you guys can
see that I didn't really realise that
when I first saw it so it moves left to
right up and down but isn't that hard
wired with a pivot point like most
headphones is actually fully suspended
by these rubber ish plastic ish for
points
that is um actually very unique I've
never actually seen another headphone do
that so full points for a construct and
design on this a very very unique
headphone not to say that this finish
won't get fingerprints but straight out
of the box it looks pretty darn gorgeous
I think the finish the polish is it's
very shiny and very very upscale looking
the whole package is upscale looking I'm
impressed
I'm very impressed with the with this
unboxing I'm kind of glad that I didn't
do it beforehand to even check it out
because it feels good like I said
leather pads feel good wood the
construct just feels solid let me try it
on the head here so the ear cup actually
fits very well around my ear this is a
good ear cup shape I don't have any my
ear doesn't touch this in any any
direction around there and I have fairly
large ears so I'm I like this design
here it's not exactly oval it's not
exactly circular either but it fits well
with the ear I mean looks like a little
ear shape kind of design all by itself
I'd say that the weight it's not nothing
but it's definitely not the heaviest all
the planar magnetic magnetic headphones
are probably much heavier than this even
I mean some of the newer ones aren't so
bad they're getting lighter but it's
just far as weight on the head it's
fairly light it's fairly good and the
caliper pressure closing in on my
somewhat larger head is probably in the
range of moderate to light straight out
of the box that can change over time you
know some headphones like the scent
hazard sennheiser hd25 at I think to my
preference too much is always bad
moderate to light is good and this
hits that sweet spot just fine yeah very
interesting headphone very different
design I mean I've seen this type of
suspension before but not this type of
your cup design so that's pretty cool
that's pretty fun stuff on the other
side there's some instruction manuals oh
and a cleaning cloth and one of these
silicone things I think you're supposed
to eat yeah this is a treat a green
treat so cool this is the AudioQuest
Nighthawk headphone unboxing $5.99 is
the retail price should be interesting
little piece I'm excited to hear it
