new brand new review for a ello audios
new international DAC and headphone
amplifier combination in one tiny little
package you may not be able to tell from
this initial shot here but the size of
this is actually a hair smaller than
what they usually do for their
components which is really great
considering they have packed a lot of
great stuff into this there's a balanced
input and output for this as well as a
24 96 DAC that plugs through a USB
connection into your computer it also
has single-ended inputs and outputs
which is a great thing to have for a
headphone amplifier it's portable on the
go and the battery life is supposed to
be really good with this thing I can
tell you from handling it that's quite
heavy so if that's any indication of how
much battery is in there I think you
should be good pretty good I actually
really enjoyed this unit both through
the single-ended and the balanced inputs
it has quite a bit of power believe it
or not for its size it really powered my
Odysseys LCD 3 headphones with no
trouble whatsoever and inversely it also
does a really great job with in-ear
monitors the lowest setting there's a
three gain setting of low medium and
high the low setting actually delivered
a really nice black background for
in-ear monitors that means that there
will be no hissing no background noise
at all so you can lay that canvas of
music beautifully over nothingness which
is really kind of a trouble spot for a
lot of different headphone amplifiers
they work really well with the big stuff
in big headphones but when it comes to
powering little guys they just have too
much background noise so this is not an
issue with this amp at all which is
great the size is smaller and the knob
is really great too I the fit and finish
of this particular unit is is
outstanding I really like the sheen the
the texture of the unit
it feels really solid in the hand as far
as the overall sound goes for this
considering the size I've really enjoyed
the bass impact
the bass slam the overall feeling of the
bass is really good tight and accurate
sounding the dynamics across the board
were very impressive as well a real
sense of lively kind of accurate realism
came through very good to this amp
especially considering the size as you
can see here the back it is does charge
from a separate wall wart charging is
not available via the USB al says that
this actually helps with the sound
quality and that it's not drawing
directly from another source it's just
relying on the battery supply from my
experience that particular notion has
paid off in terms of quietness
additionally the DAC does not draw power
from the from the computer or whatever
device you're connected to which is
different than rates Samuel audios
intruder which actually draws additional
juice from the DAC so it is separate
from it that way the other main
difference between the Ray Samuels
intruder is that this jack goes up to
24-bit 96 Hertz whereas his tops out at
the CD the highest level of CD quality
16 and 48 Hertz overall I really enjoyed
this piece I hope you guys get a chance
to check it out it sounds really good
even though the price points a little
bit on the higher side at $600
it's definitely kind of pushing the
envelope forward as far as what we can
do in the portable realm so it's really
great stuff thanks for watching guys if
you have any questions feel free to hit
me up in the comments section and file a
channel if you can thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
