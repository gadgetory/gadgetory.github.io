in
with the notion that look everybody's
got different tastes everybody's got
different rules different kind of
furnishings and it's a very fine way of
changing the compliance of fundamentally
of the response of the class leaders and
our efforts freeze and reference fires
clickable and it's something as simple
as this we have option
which I'll replace them
yeah the long ones
the short ones
we are going to play two minutes of your
face and nothing change not change the
volume and simply change the port tubes
I'll explain later what is actually
technically going on but then ask you a
bunch of questions that are please it's
non intelligence the test if you don't
hear the difference that you're not sure
at a time but okay let's go did you pick
the four tubes and of course it's like a
camera bayonet fitting you must let any
air escape for the camera life because
it's quite a difficult piece of
engineering but now we're putting the
long for kids and there's no cheating we
have not traitor volume or anything and
from the top between one or two who had
a preference
okay who preferred the first
we preferred the second
okay select majority for the second
would anybody like to volunteer who
preferred the first in your own words
why those who prefer the number one
short tubes in your own words okay okay
yeah yes good works for me it was I got
to be a bit unkind here the way I
listened for me that was music and the
second one with high flying let me
explain what actually goes on if we
measure that change the compliance when
we use the short pause the that the
first the the response if this is high
this is lows response is linear to a
lower frequency and then the drop off
the curve is quite steep so in the
absolute lower base there is less energy
if you like there is more mid-range
presence using the longer Port tubes the
it starts to roll off
gently at about 150 Hertz and the curve
remains gentle and ultimately we have
more energy at the extreme low base but
it's maybe a bit of an exaggeration to
say that in the second we have a bit of
a mid-range suck out I am particularly I
love voices and mid-range and all that
it irritates some people because I think
it's muddled so there's no wrong and no
right it is very very marginal the
differences are depending on room
anything from as little as half a DB to
a DB that certain frequencies but it's a
correct way to do a very simple idea and
we've all got different rooms we've all
got different tastes with all these two
different sorts of music and that's just
on the reference once that's on the on
the on the towers we've got double ports
and you can do mix and matching of the
visit and it really is very interesting
just a last word and then we'll carry on
with some some some music we had a
majority for the long haul didn't we so
we'll keep the long 40 its occasion you
know you're the guide you're going to
buy me flowers because answers but we'll
keep the long ports in but just a little
word about reference we do a whole bunch
of loudspeakers and the kept reference
series reference is not an empty words
just slung onto it you know
hey you know what this is my reference
wallet best leather and you know and
just adding the word reference means
that the guy can charge me more for it
but at kept referencing the methodology
what does that mean
each loudspeaker is hand-built what it's
done production line one man builds one
pair one man is supplied with Cree
matched down to component level and is
responsible for assembling a completed
loudspeaker pair of loudspeakers very
close compare match to an absolute if
you come to our factory there is the
reference one line standard and it has
to within the audible bandwidth with a
very close tolerance plus or minus half
a DB match and if it fails we beat in
the distinct arm you know it goes back
then there might be a problem air leak
or something like that so it's extreme
quality control more expensive to do and
it's dare I say part of the
justification of these speakers are not
cheap they're eight thousand dollars a
pair but it is a very unique approach
very interesting to see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
