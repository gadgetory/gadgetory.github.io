high-end headphone amps from my company
Cavalli audio my first headphone amp was
liquid fire liquid fire is what I call
an embedded hybrid headphone amp that
means the tubes and the solid-state
components are all blended together in a
single DC coupled amp the liquid fire
has powered since its introduction
probably a hundred sets of headphones
the next of my amplifiers is a liquid
lightning which is a solid-state
electrostatic headphone amp you can see
it right there with stacks SR low nines
and the third and newest product from
Cavalli audio is called liquid glass a
liquid glass and liquid hybrid and
liquid fire are both hybrid headphone
amplifiers but they're very different
the liquid fire is a circuit where the
tubes in solid state are blended
together and it's not really designed
for two rolling it's designed to
emphasize the quality of one particular
type of tube whereas the liquid glass
handles or rather can roll probably over
a hundred different tube types so unlike
other amps where you can roll two of the
tubes of the same type but different
vintages and different manufacturers the
liquid glass will allow you to roll many
different tube types so on the table
here we have 6s and 7s and 12 au 7s and
6g u 7s and bt 180 ones and at least a
hundred different types of tubes can go
in this amp it's self adjusts and the
interesting thing about it is that the
output buffer is transparent to the
sound of the tube so whatever tube you
put in there whatever it sounds like is
what the sound is that comes out the
back end of the amp so it's a really
cool lamp for somebody that has lots of
tubes and wants to do some - rolling I
think it's the only one of its kind on
the market today so this is my stuff
and I hope you all will think about it
you sure I just want to sure
so we'll just step through it I'll just
turn it off and you can see that there
are octal tubes in there now you can
just probably see barely behind that
there are no vol sockets but if I pull
one of these out it's going to be a
little toasty you can see the no vol
sockets in the back so if I want to
change to a 9-pin tube I just pop them
in make sure that the heater voltage is
set right which in this case I know it's
already correct for this tube and you
also may notice that there's kind of a
physical interlock so that if you put
either one of these tubes in one channel
you can't put the other one in because
they simply physically block each other
so you can't make the mistake of putting
two tubes in one channel so here it is
we'll just fire it up and it'll come
right up it has the classic Cavalli
audio heater warmup delay time so you'll
see it it won't apply the the high
voltages to the tubes until the heaters
are warmed up and then has an offset
delay detection system so it waits until
all the DC at the output settles before
it connects the headphones and it's just
about through its cycle and in another
15 seconds it'll be ready to go thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
