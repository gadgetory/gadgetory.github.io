is a unboxing of the new wa8 from wood
audio for those you guys who don't know
it is a portable headphone amplifier
that includes tubes from the renowned wu
audio company they make awesome
well-built tube amplifiers mostly so
they don't really have anything solid
state they do you know they do the
analog thing and this is their first
kind of product reaching out into the
portable field all the other stuff is
pretty heavy I mean they make huge big
amps for all kinds of fun applications
but this is their first portable one and
we got it here it's brand-new not even
out yet and just please keep in mind as
we do the unboxing here that things are
bound to change I don't even think this
is finalized packaging or even close to
being it this is more of like an early
kind of review model so this is probably
not what your consumer experience will
be when you open your box when it's
finalized but for right now it'll still
give you an idea with what this this guy
kind of looks like it feels like and
that kind of thing so mines come
packaged just like this and as I pull
the curtain away you can see this it
runs off of a separate power supply here
and then there so it's gonna have an
external power supply and you this has
in this case is kind of interesting we
got it wrapped and there's a foam case
in a very heavy duty box but you know
right off the bat when I can say this
guy is a little bit heavy so it's not a
pocketable kind of scenario however it
is extremely portable you can take it
from office to home and back again and
that kind of thing but it is not one
that you can you know attach to your
cell phone right off the right off the
bat
and run with it or anything like that
but it portable yes
mobile maybe not so much just picking up
its feels really heavy just like a lot
of other woo products are made they're
very heavy and they're very well
constructed and I always like to feel
gives it a more high in feel so as you
see it here
the wa8 Eclipse has three tubes here in
the front and there's actually a
selector switch right here on the top to
go between two and three tubes there is
a solid solid little knob here oversized
very smooth roll I know it's a little
thing but those little details to me
make a difference when the nut you know
all you have really to touch and feel on
an amp is the knob and this one rolls
really smooth solid it's big it's good
everyone turn when you let's see if we
can get this guy in focus there we are
so you can see on the side here there's
that DC power plugs in there the power
supply there's a physical and off switch
for the power and then this does have an
internal DAC chip set to drive a digital
section so you could plug your computer
in directly your USB here and then of
course your analog line and if you want
to just utilize the tube section of the
amplifier and use your own source if you
didn't have something and DAC wise you
could always plug it in there so it's
you know kind of a simple input but then
again it's just a small portable amp
as you can see on this side we have a
small headphone 3.5 millimeter jack and
then your large headphone jack here as
well so both styles and that is it for
the tour around the amp straightforward
ins and outs in one side amplified sound
out the other like I said it feels
really solid to the touch I like to
finish a lot I think you know Jack and
the guys that we will always do a good
job with their design if it has a look
and feel that's unique to their company
even though there's so many others on
the market you can kind of tell hey this
thing is a whoop rock and that is
reflected in this product look you can
pick it up you look at it you feel you
like it you know
feels like a wool product it feels good
it feels solid so this is just an early
unboxing the wa8 eclipse there's some
indicators like lights here too on the
side I didn't point out earlier so
you'll get some type of light up
communication there anyways
wa8 eclipse I believe it will retail for
$17.99 for silver and black and 1899 for
the gold finish so that there you go
enjoy and I will talk to you guys soon
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
