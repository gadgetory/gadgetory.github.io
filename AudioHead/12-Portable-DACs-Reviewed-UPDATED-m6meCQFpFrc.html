hood we have a very special edition
today the 12 portable decks reviewed
this is an updated version of another
video 9 portable decks reviewed which
you can see the link right here if you
click on that link it'll take you to 9
portable decks reviewed which has a
wider range of other ones this is an
update to that we got a couple more
decks and so are up to 12 total here on
the portable front the only deck that's
the main that's our benchmark is the
dumb the Dragonfly right here this one
was included in the previous video I'm
kind of just using it as a little bit of
a benchmark for these the prices for
these specific DAX we have the HTR micro
streamer here it comes in around 180
this one is 250 then this is one that
did appear in the last video called the
dragonfly by AudioQuest it's a really
good DAC for 250 this is the I Phi eye
DAC that comes in around 300 and this is
the alo international that is 600 so I
have them online to buy price here in
order I've decided to include the
audioquest dragonfly as our point of
reference in this video it does a pretty
good job for 250 dollars and it kind of
gives you an idea of where things go
from there up and down the first deck
I'm going to start out with here is
portable powered by USB it's called the
HTR micro streamer as you can see here
it is quite a tiny design one of the
more smaller decks out on the market
today you can see that it's even it's
about twice the width of the Dragonfly
but not much
wider this one does connect with a USB
cable however not it doesn't have the
straight up tip that the dragonfly does
to pull up directly and so it does
require a separate cable so it is
different from the dragonfly in that
regard like a dragonfly which also has
the dragonfly color changes to indicate
file you can see here the file size is
located along here with writing and that
it lights up on the side there so this
one does actually let you know what file
size you're driving into this the DAC
here you also notice the difference from
the dragonfly here with them there's
actually a line out and a headphone out
so they're separated whereas the
dragonfly combines those two functions
into one thing and it complicates the
output and how it interacts with the
software just a little bit so that might
be a bonus the Meridian explorers the
same way the other new deck that's out
it has two separate jacks which I prefer
so you don't have to mess with it on the
software side too much it's a little bit
more plug and go but you know it works
either way with this streamer it aligns
pretty much with the price once again
along these lines performance is not as
shiny and crisp as the rest of these
decks however I did notice a very
distinct upgrade from the headphone jack
in my apple macbook air laptop so it's
not the best performer of this punch but
there is a value to it in that it is an
upgrade from your standard headphone
jack on a computer which can have a
noisy background but most importantly
the resolution was just a lot better and
is very good in terms of matching for
in-ear monitors and more
low sensitivity kind of headphones it
didn't quite have the power or the other
drawbacks but didn't quite have the
power to drive really too hard to drive
headphones as you can see from the size
it's not meant for giant full-size
headphones it will work but it's not
ideal so if you start to get like really
really high impedance hard to drive
headphones this one is not the perfect
match fat so those are the two main
drawbacks but then again it's the
cheapest of these three and like I said
before I definitely found it to be an
upgrade from just a standard headphone
jack so that's pretty cool it's pretty
exciting a great way to kind of dip your
toe in the water if you're looking to
just kind of see what happens when you
do this and also with the extra line out
and indicators those are two big pluses
in my book I like that in a deck as I
said the Dragonfly here is a benchmark
for everything else we have on here it
is 250 and it offers really good value
for the price and is obviously one of
the great performers because of that
single output through that Jack that
also provides a headphone amplifier as I
said before this dragonfly light here
will actually change colors depending on
what file resolution you send to the
device which is also pretty cool because
it's not as blatantly obvious as this is
kind of more of a subtle fun thing
because the colors change so I think
that's a great not too good design once
again that you can I'm gonna put the
link up here to show you the full review
with the other nine Dax where this is
included in that so you can get a little
bit more details there in regards to the
scope what's out there now in the middle
here you can see we have the I Phi DAC
called the ID AK it's a little bit
larger in size it's the largest one I
have here but it is powered and it's
important to mention too that both of
these are also powered and including
this one through the USB
port which I find to be a nice kind of
almost a definition of portable in my
book because if it needs a wire it's not
it really knocks it down on how mobile
it can be so this one same deal
poor power completely by this the signal
comes to there the power comes to there
very cool a little bit bigger has three
indicator lights here these do not
indicate resolution however they do let
you know if it's getting a signal if
it's connected and it's powered up which
is all nice to know on the front we have
a 3.5 millimeter input for small
headphone jacks the volume knob and then
these two line level outputs so you can
see we're kind of moving up the scale
here in terms of what you can output
these are more general RCA so if you're
going to a stereo you won't need to have
a separate adapter pretty kind of cool
if you want to think about it like that
the main difference between this one and
this one and I will say this this one
cost fifty dollars more than this the
performance in the DAC is is more than a
matter of opinion than it is necessarily
a this one is better than this one
they sound slightly different I think
the Dragonfly has more of a unique sound
but this one for the reef or the region
it's in the three hundred dollar range
the deck does perform at that level if
not a little bit above I really enjoy
the sound of this thing overall crisp
clear the main benefit the main plus
over the dragonfly first one is that the
headphone output is much more this is
one gain stage similar to these two but
not this one this has three gain this is
one gain stage and just the volume knob
here so the drawback is also part of the
plus in this case the plus is that it's
got a lot of gain so it actually drives
harder to drive headphones louder than
the other these these other two even
though it's close in price point it's
got a lot of juice the downside to the
one gain setting is that it doesn't
matter so well with sensitive in your
monitors so there's that it's a I
wouldn't recommend this pairing for any
air monitors
this one does pretty fine and dandy even
the in-ear monitors that's nice so
there's not a lot of hiss these are
better for in your Manos this one is
definitely more for full-size monitors
which if that's your thing it's gonna
work out great
it's a nice kind of clear clean sound
overall between the day between the deck
and the headphone monitor on this one so
for the size even though it's a little
bit larger I think it kind of works it's
it's kind of like fits with a bigger
head saw headphone size and also they do
sell this is one of the products that
has an appendage that you can buy for
even more that actually has kind of like
a small power conditioner for the USP
where the power comes in and then it
cleans up the power supposedly to it so
there's a companion piece of this one
that's kind of interesting that you
could potentially stack on top to have a
double stack on the far right here we
have one of ALS newest entries and of
this bunch it does cost the most but
it's also my favorite pick of the bunch
it comes in around $600 occasionally
it'll go on sale for $500 but right now
I do believe it's priced that's 600 for
$600 this actually has quite a bit more
features than the other three but then
again it's you know almost twice the
cost if not more than that this one has
a battery supply inside of it the fit
and finish is great on this thing I
think it's very polished and nice I like
the black quite a bit
nice stylings nice knobs switches are
solid nice design battery-powered USB
input here but also you'll notice we
have balanced input which is quite a
different change for everything else not
too many on the portable front have
balanced inputs actually there's very
few relative to how many others so
that's a huge bonus if you're into
balanced humor in something balanced
into here now you'll see this is the
input USB input and here's where you
charge it on this side we actually have
the input for single-ended which is
similar to well none of these actually
have that
so there's another feature on this side
you actually see a single ended input
which is unique to this particular amp
none of these other ones actually offer
analog single and an input into them and
out so this is more of a combination of
a dedicated ham and import amplifier
with a DAC which is you know pretty
exceptional because it's way more
versatile in that than these other three
now you can see here in the front
there's actually a three gain switch so
we really start to gain a lot more
versatility in terms of what headphones
can be used with the three different
gains that are available I did find in
ear monitors this is matches extremely
well within your monitors at the lowest
gain setting actually clicks on here and
on the highest setting there's you know
quite a bit of gaming you can really
drive almost any headphone with this so
the versatility is there inputs and
outputs it even has balanced headphone
outputs I run with an adapter this to my
LCD threes very very good I do believe
that there is a difference between the
single-ended and the balanced connectors
here at least with the LCD 3 it seems a
little more obvious to me as if it's
your if it's better or not that I think
falls more under terms of preference but
for the most part most people I kind of
talked to agree that the balance at
least with the LCD 3 is kind of a fun
thing to play with in terms of overall
compactness you can see the size is even
smaller than these guys this one's a bit
heavier than the rest because of the
battery that's included with it but
overall really great dynamics on this
unit I really enjoy it a lot the base
impact is pretty slammin I think that
the amp itself is a notch above the
other three featured here and the DAC
the DAC is is pretty good too it's
definitely not the best I've ever heard
but I think it's befitting of the
of the amp that's in there so as for all
in one package this thing's pretty
spectacular as well but to me really
that it's the headphone amplifier that
shines the most on this puppy so it's
pretty good but like I said $600 there's
a lot of trunk which is a pretty big
chunk of change to a lot of people so
you know it might be something that is
in your range or not if not there are
many fine alternatives coming all the
way down to the 180 so this is my one of
my favourite portable amplifiers at the
moment things keep coming in and going
out as you can see we're up to you know
twelve Dax right now so it just keeps
coming and coming but right now this is
one of my favorites here and it's not
just for the amp it's I mean the balance
the inputs and outputs are very fun to
play with it kind of adds a little more
color to the Hobby so that is what I
have on tap right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
