head here today we have something a
little bit different this is this is a
pair of speaker stands from Music Hall
they currently run around 250 they're of
an all wood design and they also come
with a spiked feet as you can see here I
have quarters underneath so it won't
scratch the floor but spikes are kind of
good if you have a carpet to minimize
vibrations and help with all that good
stuff overall these speaker stands are
pretty good build I am really impressed
with the how sturdy they really are
they're solid wood solid design going up
and they don't really tip Waiver I mean
when you pick them up to some real heft
to them and they're really balanced so I
really like the way these are kind of
set up for two hundred and fifty dollars
you know there are some cheaper
alternatives thinner alternatives that
can be found out there but on the other
hand they can speaker stands of the
audiophile quality can actually go quite
a bit higher than 250 they can go all
the way up and I think these stands by
Music Hall strike a nice middle ground
between the really luxurious you know
over priceless of high-end audio and and
the kind of the bare-bones
you know thin wire stuff that you can
find around other places just set your
stuff on I find these to be just about
the right height for my listening habits
they work really well with a pair of
bookshelf speakers they're about two
feet tall so that kind of works out and
you know speaker stands in general are a
really great way to go if you're
listening to bookshelves or even just a
smaller monitor stock
speakers where you want to get them away
from the walls to give them the best
atmosphere that you really drive the
sound the best way they can so that's
really where speaker stands become so so
helpful you can place them anywhere you
want you can really get your placement
right in a room and they help the whole
speaker breathe all the way around they
really make it sound the best it can
sound so these are the music-hall
speaker stands they run around 250 there
are brand new item that just came out
really recently so check them out if
you're looking for a better speaker
stands these might be the right ones for
you they come in solid black and they
have a slight texture to the material
which I kind of find very appealing it's
very cool gives it a nice piece of flare
on the on the semi-gloss black finish so
pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
