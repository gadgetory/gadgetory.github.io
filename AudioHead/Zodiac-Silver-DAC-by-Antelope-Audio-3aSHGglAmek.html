quick review of the Antelope zodiac
silver DAC it does 192 24-bit through
all of its inputs it also doubles as a
headphone amplifier you can see there on
the left that's the main output on the
right you have a separate headphone
volume control and two outputs this unit
retails a little bit on the higher side
it's around 1900 for the whole package
it does come with some really nice
cables including an optical cable in the
USB cable so there's a couple of fun
little frills that it comes with for
that price but it is a little bit on the
higher side the quality of the DAC is
good - very good I really enjoyed I
found it to be quite nuanced has a nice
smooth texture to it but yet it's very
refined it definitely competes with
almost every other deck I have in in the
lab as far as the headphone output is
concerned I was very impressed
it has great output keeps the same type
of refinement in detail that you find in
the deck throughout the chain so it
doesn't fog up the amplification stage
at all so that is that's impressive in
and of itself for an all-in-one unit
it's it's very sharp
it's very articulate I would have to say
that it leans a little more to the
analytical than the warm side but that's
not necessarily a bad thing it's on you
know a little bit more of your your
preference I think at some point but all
together a nice all-in-one unit if you
can afford it it's a little bit on the
higher side it's not really huge it
doesn't take up a large footprint which
is also
really nice I kind of enjoyed that it
has a display that I very much enjoyed
it tells the resolution of the input as
well as acts as a volume control for the
analog outputs in the back now this unit
does have balanced outputs which is a
nice feature something I would expect
around this price range that are
variable that can be controlled from the
knob and unbalanced outputs those
outputs can be Dru's sent directly to
another powered amplifier if you want or
even powered speakers separately so this
unit in this session essentially run to
kind of cut out the preamp stage and act
as a preamp pretty efficiently I think
that you know that's a great kind of way
to keep things small and compact just
like this unit is small and compact so
just keeping things tidy not having too
many units go all over the place for
desktop applications but you definitely
run it in the same manner with your AV
rack you wanted to run things into it
very nice kind of setup there the third
thing that the display does is actually
help you do this source selector so you
can see what input you're going through
and there are quite a bit of inputs
digital inputs in the back for this more
so than your usual deck may have so
that's good to have kind of roll through
the different options there so a very
cool very compact all-in-one package if
you're looking for something in the
price range if you have the spare cash
it's definitely one to evaluate and just
kind of see if it's your flavor it's by
all means if this thing was a hundred
dollars everyone should have one so it's
really fun it's a really great thing
please subscribe to the channel if
you're able and have a great weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
