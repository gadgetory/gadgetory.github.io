of one of the classic Holy Trinity
headphones the Bayer dynamic dt8
hundreds these classic headphones come
in three varieties the first being a 32
M easy to drive the 300s I'm sorry 250
ohm which this pair happens to be and
then the much harder to drive 600 ohms
pair the difference in being mostly I
haven't had a chance unfortunately to
demo the 600's but I do believe that
some people claim that they are tighter
in the high region but then again I have
not heard them myself I would assume if
any changes were in the varieties it
would probably be miniscule if anything
I don't think it makes that big of a
difference but these are the 250s a
really really great pair of headphones
classics right alongside the sennheiser
650 and that AKG 601 or 602 sorry so
there's gonna be an unboxing and review
so I'll just start by prying this bad
boy open this is one of the few
headphones that actually comes with a
case you can see here however the case
is not exactly travel size it's quite
large I've never actually used it myself
it's pretty big but if you need to
travel this will definitely do the job
you can see it comes with a pretty
simple setup here in his eye
have fun themselves crinoline cord not
to the court itself is not that big I
expected something a little bit wider
but it does then does the job the end
piece here is one of your typical screw
types it's a larger jack this is the
headphone here fairly decent sized
headphone most definitely goes around
the ear and quite a circular comfortable
pattern
what am I caught these into work one of
my co-workers I said it was like having
two pillows gently push the pendant up
on your head I have heard some people
claim I all look like this some people
claim that this velvet seal around the
edge does not provide as an adequate
seal as some of the leather types and
then therefore somehow affects some base
response I had not experienced this
myself
these don't have of all three of those
headphones he's had probably the least
amount of bass considering however I
don't think it's in relation to these
beds I personally find these to be the
one of the most comfortable headphones
out there as far as the pads are
concerned one thing I will mention
however is that the clamping force the
force that pulls inward just like this
is quite significantly it's not
something that would you know crush your
skull or anything of that nature however
it is not nothing it is something there
is pressure that puts in this way but
you know that may help you know
obviously gives you better seal when it
pulls in and therefore a little bit I
would assume helps with the bass when
when this what you have a really good
closure going on aside from that I
really like these headphones I would say
that they have a treble a slight trouble
skew to them slight they're a fairly
neutral I think that of the three people
do claim
these are the most neutral of the three
of the Holy Trinity so to speak but from
my experience they're very neutral they
have a great I think they have a great
neutral sound from base to mids equally
perfectly well representatives are so
clear so great I will say though I have
compared these directly to the flagship
on this for Bayer dynamics flagship that
t1 and that one obviously cost quite a
bit more four to five times that this
this particular pair does and compared
to those the trouble is a little more
pronounced the t1 happens to be one of
my favorite headphones of all time this
however is a phenomenal headphone by
itself especially for the price range I
think it's one of the leaders if not the
leader of that price range right around
you should be able to find this pair for
around three hundred dollars maybe less
depending on where you look so for that
range of three notes definitely one to
check out definitely one of the leaders
in my book as well and as far as comfort
goes if you can if the clamping pressure
is an issue for you these are two you
know just really really comfortable
I like the styling that obviously the
ear pad is quite large and it sticks out
a little farther you may get a couple
looks I wouldn't and you don't see too
many people wearing these out in the
subways or anything like that but I
definitely do like the styling it's all
metal the constructions totally totally
legit solid all around so if you guys
have any questions feel free to shoot me
