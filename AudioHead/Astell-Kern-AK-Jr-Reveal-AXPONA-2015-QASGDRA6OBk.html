booth here with the new player the a K
jr. it's a smaller version and less
expensive of the group of players they
already have on the market it's brand
new just came out well it's not even
really out yet but this is the first
kind of viewing they've had publicly so
that's pretty fun as you can see it's a
really tiny fun little unit this is just
the back we can see the dials a little
bit of a deviation from the other models
most notable you'll note that it is a
bit smaller and thinner than some of the
other models but just I was while I had
this I want to point out on this side
the design as you can see this sparkle
come across it's actually tiny little
a's that are the logo for that still and
curry company across the back so it's a
very cool touch if you look on this you
can see expansion slot the wheel here is
kind of molded onto the back it rolls up
and down but you can really tell from
this angle how thin they really kind of
went out other way there's a wake button
here on the top headphone jack there
beside maintains their similar pause
play and track adjustment functions and
the back side working at a microUSB in
terms of the interface there's something
good in focus there we go in terms of
the interface there's this new graphic
that's pretty cool in terms of volume
right there up and down with the knob
John Rose songs are this is kind of the
main menu when you land on their land on
their albums
and touch interface similar to the other
devices so all in all if you're looking
to get into a high res player this one
does play single DSD as part of the
feature set which is also a nice touch
you can see compared to here to the 102
model it's a little bit thinner but it
kind of keeps the same aesthetics going
features of Wolfson 8740 deck retails
for $4.99 really slick really fun really
cool here at Expo no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
