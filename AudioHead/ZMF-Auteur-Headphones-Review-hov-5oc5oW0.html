zmf auteur a review say $1600 headphone
so it definitely lands on the higher
side of things and use a bio cellulose
driver which is also kind of unique for
that space that's not a planar magnetic
technology it's dynamic like other type
of paper cone drivers but uses a bio
cellulose material to make its music it
also connects with a X mini XLR jack
similar to the Odysseys LCD series of
headphones so you can view a from our
aftermarket cables in the same manner
the headband is made out of nice
lambskin leather and it's two separate
bands so does it rest directly on this
the top one that provides the caliper
pressure but rather has two separate
pieces of leather both embossed pretty
interestingly for and with a little a on
one side and a zmf on the underside and
on the right side the ear cup is
actually us Oh mostly open back it is
slotted it does leak it's not the
leakiest headphone I've ever heard but
at the same time it's not the quietest
either it's definitely not a closed back
headphone so you probably wouldn't want
to use this in a public space has a cool
design across the grille that's kind of
unique and it provides you know some
really good sound overall so we're
looking at a very even frequency range I
would say with a little more emphasis on
the bass side for a bass guitar range
than perhaps the low low thump of a
planar magnetic so for mr. speakers and
the auto Z's line you'll see more of
like bass drum emphasis when compared
directly to this headphone it feels a
little more lively in the basic
thar section now that's not to say that
it's good or bad or either it's just
different from those two headphones in
that particular manner I think that
chant that emphasis is very slight and
most people probably wouldn't even
notice it but overall the entire range
of frequency is really good the autor
does come with an extra pair of ear pads
which are easily swappable which is a
nice feature to have
you can put new pads on if the old ones
wear out and also the two pads are
slightly different one has a narrower
opening than the other in this case so
there's a chance to swap it out and see
if you hear difference which is kind of
a nice feature as well overall the sound
signature is really even I feel like an
on par with other headphones in this
range which is to say that they've
geared it towards an audiophile
signature that is meant for clarity
resolution and fidelity overall but also
kind of has a nice stretch a nice range
from low to high and tonal texture
packed in the middle between all that so
a really fun signature I would say the
thing that stands out most to me about
this headphone as opposed to those
others is the extremely wide soundstage
and that's kind of an abstract thing to
think about but if you just think about
it as the instruments feel farther out
from your head left and right there are
other headphones that I've reviewed that
have more of a image that goes in front
of your head which is very very rare in
my opinion but these like some other
headphones out there go very wide which
is a really fun effect and like I said
unique to this headphone and just a
really important kind of differentiating
factor to the other other guys in this
zone so the build quality is good the
tonal quality is great has a nice even
kind of delivery that should appeal
many audio files and it's fun to listen
to the way is a little bit heavier it's
not the lightest of the batch was
definitely not the heaviest either it's
about average for this genre of over ear
high-end headphone in my opinion the
wood cups are kind of adding to that so
you know it has a little bit of extra
weight given that material use but it's
not too heavy to listen to for long
periods of time overall I really enjoy
the headphone and I think it'd make a
great addition to any buddy's collection

want and tune in next time for more
