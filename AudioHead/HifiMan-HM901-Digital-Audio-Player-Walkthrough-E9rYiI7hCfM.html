high five man and I just want to
introduce you all to the HM 901 portable
digital music player this unit will be
replacing the 801 right now we're
looking at approximately in April to May
launch time for it it will be retailing
for $9.99 and will be available globally
throughout high finance distribution
network some of the cool things we just
want to show show you on this is it's
kind of very simple to use Tai Chi UI
where you just simply scroll the wheel
and you can go through your settings
your songs John Rose album but if we
just sit here and we're going to click
down to our SD card and we'll have a
list of the music that we've got on here
it it's simple you click where you want
to go and then start to play it's that
simple it'll accept just about any music
file you toss at it
it loves lossless of flack a lack Apple
Lossless AI F ACC just about anything
you throw at it of course you can also
put mp3s on there the higher the
resolution the better what drives this
nice little machine is it has dual
32-bit decks so it'll it'll really clean
up something that doesn't sound great
but if you've got some really high-end
uncompressed music what it's able to
produce is just amazing some of the
features also on the side here we have
our HD and the vintage setting and this
is just basically helps us with you know
what kind of headphones or earphones
were listening to HD is great if you're
listening to a nice planar magnetic
headphone it just gives it a little bit
more information that a dynamic driver
may not get HD is also really good if
you're using a multi be a custom
earphone or even some of the universals
it does have a high and a low gain again
great for when you're switching between
headphones and earphones of what you
need you can even lock the device if
needed if you're using it on the go
which is really nice if you just kind of
throw it in your backpack of your bag or
whatnot if you're on the go and
have your earphones in your pocket or
what not it uses a very simple analog
volume control so you just kind of just
quickly click right through it and if
you're running up around 7 or 8 chances
are you're really listening to a loud
it's got a lot of output on this side as
you'll notice we have a memory card slot
the HTM 901 comes standard with 8
gigabytes of memory but it'll take an SD
card up to 128 gigs so you have a lot of
room to put some music on there and you
can switch back and forth as you're
listening we do recommend you turn the
device off if you're going to switch the
memory card just so we can refresh its
memory database of what you have it also
has a balanced and a normal setting for
the headphone out so that you can run it
obviously normal or balanced depending
on what you want to listen to and the
cables your youing there's a lot of
cables that are coming out now that are
a 3.5 millimeter yet you can run balance
through them so kind of getting ready
for the future blast we want to show you
guys is we're going to pop this open
here real quick is inside behind the
battery pack there's actually a user
replaceable amp card so we're going to
go ahead and open that up real quick ok
so what we did is we pop the cover off
our battery here and now underneath the
battery we have this little amplifier
card and the amplifier card we can pop
out and as you can see it's just a
series of op amps but one of the really
cool things is multiple versions of this
card will be coming out in the future
you'll be able to run it if you use a
again a multi be a setup for custom
earphones there will be a card built
specifically for those because they're
so efficient they'll really pick out a
lot of the nuances in the music so we
won't have a car that'll aim just at
that we'll have ones that are aimed
directly more for you know dynamic
driver earphones or plainer magnetic
earphones and just other earphone
technologies are out there so the really
nice thing is you'll have ultimate
flexibility of how you want to listen to
your music
I'd be able to change your DAC out or
I'm sorry your your amp out from here
you know and just kind of play around a
testing so that'll be really nice
that'll be coming out later this year I
believe summer follows what's been
mentioned there's no exact timeframe at
this point right now so one of the other
things
I'll show real quick is on the bottom
here we have a digital out and through
this digital out what we can do is you
can out to unbalanced RCA you can go to
USB you can go to a 3.5 so there's
there's lots of functionality of what
you can what you can do since this is a
player and a DAC in one with the
amplifier you can also do a 3.5 to
digital in and this cable is provided so
that if you have all your music on an
iPod you can actually use this device as
your deck and your amplifier and just
run it straight out into your headphones
or earphones so it's another just one of
the things that makes this 9:01 so
versatile of what it'll be able to do
for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
