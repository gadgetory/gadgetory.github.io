have the Odysseys closed-back planar
magnetic head phone called the X C C
standing for closed in this case there's
also an X version incorporating the same
driver but without the back the price on
this one is pretty up there it's a
flagship headphone so we're looking at
roughly $1,800 it'll set you back to get
your hands on one of these it it's right
up there with the LCD three the
company's still the highest price point
the company offers around $2,000 for
that one so it sits up there but it's
one of those things where we're really
looking at the top end of the heap here
unless you move over to electrostatic
technologies and things like stacks and
so forth but anyways I would say what
are the the obviously one of the the big
talking points is this sound for these
they do I'll just let you know right off
the bat they do sound amazing one of the
very few drawbacks from this design and
this type of headphone is the fact that
they're a little bit on the heavy side
they weigh a little bit more than your
usual headphone they're not as mobile as
perhaps some of the other ones are but
truth be told that is one of the few
drawbacks of this headphone I think it
in a sitting position you're usually
good they're just not something that you
might want to go for a morning jog in so
all things considered amazing sound and
it's just truly one of those more
audiophile style headphones where you're
gonna sit there and listen to some
really high-quality good stuff as far as
the sound news concern I found these to
be pretty close on par detail wise with
the LCD 3 which is a major statement I
think that the LCD 3s are very
articulate very acute in their delivery
of detail
these headphones follow suit directly I
mean I
perhaps if I really had to be put on the
spot I might say the LCD 3s are still a
little bit more defined but it's so
close that I don't think you would ever
notice that a vacuum that's for sure so
as far as detail is concerned hit the
nail on the head once again now these do
kind of carry just a very mild
closed-back feel to them so if you're
really looking at this or the LCD three
and you really want the most natural and
the most open sound and the LCD three
you would still be your choice but
that's not always the case you can't
have the bleed that comes out of the
back of those headphones and it lets
ambient noise in so in closed back
situations where you really need to
either keep sound out or in this is a
very very good second choice you know
and I think on top of that the the bass
the overall frequency presentation is
pretty darn good it's pretty flat it has
a nice good kick at the low end the
vocals stand and kind of sit right in
the mix where they should they're not
too far forward they're not too far back
the treble is not harsh treble is pretty
smooth pretty good it has a nice sparkle
to it without being overbearing or
having any crispies or having any any
type of artifacts in the high end so all
those things add up to a pretty swell
headphone all things considered so if
you're in the in the market for some of
the best in a closed back configuration
for headphone what you're staring at
right now is pretty pretty much it
you know there's a lot of other cut this
this area is heating up I mean there are
are there headphones but the LCD if it's
something you've been looking at the the
three the two or the two and you're
familiar with the sound this kind of
carries those carry a characteristics
very very nicely into the closed-back
arena I think that this particular
headphone is is
kind of one of the ones to beat
it's just they do amazing things with it
I even saw this prototype amplifier that
Odysseys had produced where majest for
phase and frequency on a specific
headphone they had it connected you know
directly to a headphone specifically
made for that amp with a DSP and so
forth and it was like really really
special in terms of soundstaging and
instrument placement instrument
separation they're working on things
that are just kind of really really
cutting edge stuff when you want to push
the high end even further so the
company's really hot they do good things
this headphone is an example of that
it's closed back but yet it just
performs phenomenally well for any
headphone so that is the disease X C
closed back headphone let me know if you
guys have any questions in the comment
section hopefully I'll be able to get to
them as soon as possible thanks for
watching and subscribe if you can buy
