Samuel audios the shadow it's a smaller
portable headphone amp that works well
with in-ear monitors I just want to give
you a quick unboxing to show you what
it's like it comes with a really nice
small box so you can see here some nice
graphics there as well and we open it up
you can see it comes with multiple power
adapters rubber or whatever country you
may be in this box it will make MIMO and
the power supply here fits that
universal adapter piece goes to a mini
USB Jack this is the amp√®re in this nice
robideaux bag and then just a little bit
of literature on the on the device
itself as far as the amp is concerned I
wanted things I just wanted to really
show you guys was size of this thing
there's the front and this is the front
as well there's a tiny little switch
here that you can see lights up red
when it's on and this has a stick volume
knob the volume knob it's a little bit
gradual but does a good job race is that
there's no capacitors in the path
through this machine and that leads to
better sound quality and from what I've
heard from this AMPA I do think it
delivers on on high resolution high-five
quality special appearing in ear
monitors really considering the size but
how big it is obviously the output there
on the back the input so there's no deck
inside this is just a headphone
amplifier there is a battery obviously
that charges and it can play straight
through your witness plugged in there's
a red LED that lights up when it's on
charging and it goes off when it's not
charging and it does can it can be
charged directly through a USB port on a
computer so I just want to give you guys
a shot of that look at it here's a piece
of perspective for you as a health small
this thing really this is the Sennheiser
650 look at the size of that difference
I mean this thing can truly fit in your
pocket really great little lamp that as
far as the sound is concerned I did
notice especially within ear monitors
the customs they have a great bet
they've much more expensive soundscape
which seems a lot wider and a lot deeper
than then allow the other amplifiers I
have one of the hard things with in ear
monitors is you know finding something
that doesn't because they're so
sensitive that doesn't play a lot of
distortion or background noise has a
really black background at low levels
that's what those things need and this
thing definitely delivers on that it can
power mid sized headphones it didn't
have any trouble pushing the Sennheiser
650 s you see here at all but I mean it
really shines within ear monitors a lot
of the
Dax unless even with the ones with low
middle or high gain settings sometimes
have a little bit of issues with a sense
really sensitive headphones like in-ear
monitors and this I really didn't
experience any with which is really the
amazing thing I mean considering the
size of this and the size of in-ear
monitors and portability you know this
is a really good match for those kind of
things it can sit right on your desk
obviously or even fit it in your pocket
so it's a pretty fun piece I really if
you're engineering ear monitors or just
looking for one of the smallest high
fidelity headphone amplifiers out there
I really strongly suggest you check this
thing on I'm really quite impressed with
it the full review is available at our
do - head comm so check it out guys
thanks a lot until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
