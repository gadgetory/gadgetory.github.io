Samuel audios the shadow it's a smaller
portable headphone amp that works well
with the in-ear monitors I just wanted
to give you a quick unboxing to show you
what it's like it comes with a really
nice small box so you can see here some
nice graphics there as well and we open
it up at my own you can see it comes
with multiple power adapters rubber or
whatever country you may be in this box
is brilliant make me know and the power
supply here it's that universal adapter
piece goes to a mini USB jack this is
the ampere in this nice rubber belt bag
and then just a little bit of literature
on the on the device itself as far as
the amp is concerned I one of the things
I just wanted to really show you guys
was the size of this thing there's the
front and this is the front as well
there's a tiny little switch here that
you can see lights up red
when it's on and this has a stick volume
knob the volume knob it's a little bit
gradual but does a good job races that
there's no capacitors in the path
through this machine and that leads to
better sound quality and from what I've
heard from the Santa I do think it
delivers on on high resolution high five
quality special appearing in ear
monitors really considering the size of
how big it is obviously the output there
on the back the input so there's no deck
inside this is just a headphone
amplifier there is a battery obviously
that charges and it can play straight
through your witness plugged in there's
a red LED that lights up when it's on
charging and it goes off when it's not
charging and it does can it can be
charged directly through a USB port on a
computer so I just wanted to give you
guys a shot of that look at it here's a
piece of perspective for you as a health
small this thing really this is the
Sennheiser 650 look at the size of that
difference I mean this thing can truly
fit in your pocket really great little
lamp that as far as the sound is
concerned I did notice especially with
in ear monitors the customs they have a
great but they've much more expensive
soundscape which seems a lot wider and a
lot deeper than then allow the other
amplifiers I have one of the hard things
with in ear monitors is you know finding
something that doesn't because they're
so sensitive that it doesn't play a lot
of distortion or background noise has a
really black background at low levels
that's what those things need and this
thing definitely delivers on that it can
power midsize headphones it didn't have
any trouble pushing the Sennheiser 650s
you see here at all but I mean it really
shines within ear monitors a lot of the
Dax unless even with the ones with low
middle or high gain settings sometimes
have a little bit of issues with a sense
really sensitive headphones like in-ear
monitors and this I really didn't
experience any width which is really an
amazing thing I mean considering the
size of this and the size of in-ear
monitors and portability you know this
is a really good match for those kind of
things it can sit right on your desk
obviously or even fit it in your pocket
so it's a pretty fun piece I really if
your engineering ear monitors or just
looking for one of the smallest high
fidelity headphone amplifiers out there
I really strongly suggest you check this
thing on I'm really quite impressed with
it the full review is available at audio
dash head calm so check it out guys
thanks a lot until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
