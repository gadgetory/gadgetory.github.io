this unit runs for around three thousand
five hundred dollars so it's a little
bit on the pricier side full size full
capability digital deck and preamplifier
as well only a single knob is on the
front of this unit it controls all the
separate sub menus that are available
it's it's actually quite a great knob
it's weighted perfectly and spins great
you push it in to turn it on
you push the button again and hold it to
turn it off into sleep mode the unit
actually contains a femto clock which is
accurate down to a very very small
increment of a single second and that
helps with jitter reduce jitter and also
you know it helps with the up sampling
in this case this one actually up
samples all PCM streams to the megahertz
so this was a pretty complex little
machine actually has USB and does DSD
natively as well which is kind of a fun
feature that a lot of other decks don't
have until you get into this price range
it does DSD 64 as well as DSD 128 and
also of course does all the regular high
res style of music including 24 bit 192
and others it has a digital only inputs
as a preamplifier so you can't actually
stick another analog source into this
and use it as a full preamp
however if digital is the
to go for you this thing's got a pretty
good substantial amount of inputs to
either act as a deck or a preamp alone
you can this can drive directly into a
powered amp and then be controlled by
the volume knob you can see here we have
the USB input on the far right tosh link
underneath that - coaxial aes next to
that and then on the left side we have
our balanced and unbalanced output so
pretty pretty diverse for digital input
and pretty simple going out nothing too
overly complicated on the back here as
you can see there's no input selector
directly located on the front of this
I'm just going to take you through some
of the menus here real quick on this
device as it kind of gives you a more a
better idea of the feature set you can
see the input is still selected here
from usb this will change depend on what
input you select and then also it has
your readout here which is very handy
that allows you to see what the incoming
bitrate is for the file you're playing
it also switches to DSD 64 or DSD 128
depending on if that's coming in or not
this also acts as a volume control for
the output in the back there a handy one
through a hundred if you click in like
so it brings you the first menu you can
see this pretty clearly you can see that
the input is actually the number one
option on this first entry here when you
click in you can then see the ability to
switch between each of these Toslink
coax and the AES and the USB is right
there if I were to select a yes you can
see that the signal the I'm sorry the
sign changes there to allow you to see
kind of what your you're dealing with
it's fun that it's an actual icon not
just lit up words you can see here
there's also balance control phase
control
you can invert that if you so desire
this year number four is kind of a
unique and cool feature for the device
the filter as you click in this one
actually allows you to have four
separate ones that you can cater to your
own tastes the default is for my
preference was also four but during some
trouble hot music I did find some nice
accompaniment with the mode three so my
preference was for for the most part and
three if you are looking to do more
trouble hot listening but for the most
part I stuck with the default four when
you're in this mode and DS DS beings
sent to this this menu will actually
change and have just mode five and six
six being the default that I also stuck
with for most of my listening for DSD so
that menu automatically changes when
you're running DSD so there's a two
additional modes for that type of
listening if you dive down into the
system here you can actually see a few
more options you can change the display
if you want put it into sleep the most
interesting feature on this menu however
is the clock now this corresponds to the
femto clock that is located inside here
which is actually uses a type of crystal
that needs to be temperature regulated
to perform its best so as this machine
warms up in standby mode you have the
capability to lock it in two different
clocking capabilities the first one that
you get and that's what the stage it is
in right now is only to auto and course
because this is still warming up the
crystal in that warm up phase you you
will have these two select options
okay so we've had a little bit of time
to let this thing warm up I'm going to
show you what it looks like when we go
into this clock setting here and this is
like I said before directly related to
the femto clock inside you
see here now the settings have changed
after it's been you know regulated to
the correct temperature we have course
fine and exact exact being the best and
you can click to lock that in and now
there's an extra dot illuminated here to
show you that it's been calibrated to
exact use the highest use of it of the
DAC system you can alleviate the warmup
time by just putting the unit into
standby mode which is located by
pressing this button in and going to
sleep
so in this standby mode that you see now
you will it actually continues to warm
the crystal so if you don't turn it off
all the way like you did what I had to
move it in here you should be fine and
this is just a quick shot of the final
menu here so overall this deck was
extremely extremely transparent in there
my full review on the website I
mentioned it crosses over T and dots
every eye it's really meticulous in the
way it reproduces things the DSD proved
kind of had the smoothest edge of all
the file types that I listened to you
can it's so transparent in a way that
allows you to kind of see here the grain
in lower recordings and lower fidelity
so it's very revealing it lets you know
what things really sound like really
kind of get you close to that edge it
puts things closer to you than other Dax
do when I was doing some critical
listening I noticed the compared to some
of the other budget decks that the
singer would appear four to five feet
away with the other decks
whereas this DAC it was literally
whispering in your ear so there's some
really exceptional performance when it
comes to that type of closeness intimacy
articulation and natural smooth
presentation that's kind of where this
meets both fields you got really great
detail on one side and really organic
natural sound on the other and this is
right in the middle of the road there
it's a very nice combination of natural
sound presentation with really great
fine detail that allows you to hear
everything that's we had on the
recording you're listening to so those
are very nice very nice features very
nice culmination of those two kind of
other ends so all in all I really like
this and like the stack the price is you
know cup there with the rest of the high
fidelity equipment in the DAC market you
know that it's constantly changing the
DSD is a relatively new file type that's
kind of cropped up as of late so things
are constantly changing
which makes purchasing a deck all the
more tough but if you're in the market
for something like this and you have the
money to burn this is definitely one to
check out in this price range it's
wonderful little device it really plays
well and acts pretty good as a preamp as
well this is the Alaric Vega DAC
wonderful piece of machinery I also
enjoy it very much let me know if you
guys have any questions comments you can
leave them in the youtube section there
and also subscribe to the YouTube
channel if you like this kind of thing
thank you so much guys have a great one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
