of our amps here we got the liquid
carbon 2.0 has an upgraded power stage
but it's the same liquid carbon as as
the first one
that's this and then we have should I
talk a little bit more about this or
okay yeah so it's a it's a transportable
fully balanced fully discrete class a
amplifier that's out 1.5 to 2.5 watts
per channel expect at 1.5 but it
actually does a lot more it has single
ended and balanced outputs has single
ended and balanced inputs and as a 3.5
input and RCA input for single ended and
it includes a phase splitter so that you
actually got a balanced signal inside
the amp and then this is old but this is
our new
new shiny object that we've introduced
this is the liquid spark this is also a
fully discrete a portable rechargeable
Class A amplifier puts out about 350
milliwatts per channel at at 50 ohms by
the way these are all 50 ohm steps and
yeah that's what a 15 hour battery life
it's gonna be charged through USB
we're gonna include a big USB cable with
a little work for charging purposes has
two inputs so that in case your phone
has a headphone jack on the bottom you
can kind of plug it in like that and you
can turn the pin the volume this here is
a gain switch this is 1x gain this is 3x
game is volume and the way you turn it
off is just turn it all the way to the
bottom so that we wanted to protect
people's hearing so you know you you
can't accidentally make yourself deaf oh
and this is gonna go for 4.99 our carbon
is 799 so these are sort of our lower
end products but this this actually
descends from the liquid gold which is
the which is the fully balanced
amplifier our flagship it's way down and
there and so yeah it it has the has a
legacy of the liquid gold but in a
little portable form factor and yeah
it's it's pretty light doesn't get too
warm we're gonna this coating is not the
final card II going to put a little
different coating so that it's more
fingerprint resistant and if you want
you can actually use car wax and wax it
up and then you'll be completely
fingerprint resistant
yeah it's going it's not $4.99 all right
and then this is our flat ship still in
prototype form obviously as you can tell
it's the liquid tungsten this is an
output transformer output capacitor list
all to them these tubes are the output
tubes these are VL 509 and this should
be ready by early next year it's single
ended the outputs are XLR because we
just prefer they operate but it still
sing lended circuit and yeah this this
is something we're very proud of it
sounds pretty good pretty damn good and
this is gonna go for about six thousand
dollars and no one sweat it thanks so
much sounds good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
