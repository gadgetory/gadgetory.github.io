first the battery pack uses a
lithium-ion to cell design using some 18
650 type cells and then inside here
you'll see the transducers we have the
total of seven there's three active
there's a left center and right and then
there's two passive base radiators on
the front and two on the rear go seal
the bracing inside we try to make this
structure as rigid and acoustically
inert as we can and what we'll do is
we'll take the two-channel stereo music
signal and we'll up mix the two channels
through a patented process we have named
Trillium to the three channels so the
three channels will come to the left
center on the right and when you listen
to it you'll hear a much wider in a
deeper sound field we're actually kind
of creating a virtual left-right speaker
outside the box so that's how we're able
to get the very large sound field from
the speaker here at the very bottom you
can see all the amplifier electronics we
use Texas insurance Class D amplifier
chips AKM DSPs everything we do is about
trying to reproduce the music is
honestly an authentically as we can
forward size a lot of the other speakers
in this category they do so much
processing to the music where they're
doing a lot of bass boosts treble boost
but they also do a lot of dynamic range
compression and make all your recordings
sound loud we're not doing that so if
you've got a white passage it's going to
be quiet but then when you get to loud
passage you're going to hear that
natural contrast and as a result you're
not going to hear the distortion it is
just going to be very effortless and
natural and in a very engaging wire see
the passive radiators inside the Reba s
we have two on the front and two on the
rear they are a passive device they work
together with the active drivers and the
acoustic chamber to help augment the low
bass you can also do ports a lot of
speakers especially like big high five
speaker supported but the problem with
ports is they take up a lot of closure
space especially if you're trying to
tune it to a little frequency and to
make air noise with passive radiators
you don't have any of those drawbacks to
take a very little acoustic space and
don't make air noise and so there are a
great choice for compact speakers like
this they also prevent any you know dust
water contamination from getting inside
the speaker we go an extra step with how
we develop our passive
whereas some other speakers tildes
simply a glue the the the diaphragm onto
the enclosure we go an extra step we
have dedicated steel frames and we have
separate surrounds and spiders just like
you would have on the active drivers so
the surrounding spiders are two dual
point suspension elements to help make
sure the passive radiator moves as
pastan tepee is a can it's not Rocking
and so again everything is balanced for
us so that it's going to working in
unison and and the speaker is just very
naturally stable just wants the release
all that energy is music into the room</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
