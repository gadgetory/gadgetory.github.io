headphone IAM is last year at the show
newport there were headphone companies
here but they were all spread out so you
really didn't know where they were and a
lot of people got missed and when
Richard beers who owns the show
approached me and said he wanted to do a
dedicated headphone show we had a little
bit of real estate to deal with but the
idea was to get the best of the best and
not only that the best of the best but
the people that I know are just
wonderful people the community of
personal audio had five org my friends
at odyssey my friends at alo you know
these guys really represent the bleeding
edge because they truly love what they
do they're doing the kinds of outreach
that I've been writing about editorially
these guys just got written up in men's
home journal Playboy magazine called The
Odyssey lcd3 the best headphone they
have ever auditioned I think they called
it the Ferrari of headphones is that
right yeah and so to get all the best of
the best and the people that would show
attendees that this is a community ha be
driven thing and what the high-end audio
has lost is that aspect of it you know
hobby became the small niche which
became elitist and it's separated itself
completely from pop culture and the
amazing thing about headphones is every
company in this room can relate to just
about everybody on the street because
all they have to do is say you got an
iphone you got nandroid you got an ipod
whatever you've got they can enhance
that experience because we have millions
of users out in the world currently
using earbuds beats by dre or whatever
it is they're using and they have no
idea that you can get better and that
you don't have to spend an arm and a leg
and honestly the part that excites me
most about this and writing reviews of
high flight components for yours as you
can imagine you know I've heard my fair
share stuff right now I only want to
review personal audio stuff because it's
exciting and because I know that for the
first time we can reach we can
infiltrate pop culture and we can show
the populace that they don't have to
settle for convenience anymore and so
the idea here
is just to give a good smattering to
people of what the other levels are you
know they don't have to set up for the
earbud they don't have to settle just
for an iphone you know they could put an
iDevice DAC on at a headphone amp sleep
devices so it's communal driven this is
a high-end audio show it always has been
so you know you can but you can hear you
can find a hundred-thousand-dollar
turntable or you can find a
two-thousand-dollar or 200 but that's
been the focus of this show is strictly
high-end to channel this year they have
a theater but it's really about the
high-end audio world these vendors get
to have those people come in and hear
what they've been hearing in room but
they get to hear it here like you put on
a pair of odyssey LCD threes and in my
opinion you have to spend at least 20
grand in stereo equipment to get the
type of realism you know the sense of
air and space around you I mean when I
put on my LCD 3s and I have a stellar
stereo it used to be I'd be listening in
my reference system and go oh this is
great now when I hear something in my
reference system I go I got to hear
these on my Odysseys and that's so that
reaction that I now get from it that's
what these vendors get to show to people
they get to excite people that way you
know we've got alo has their new
statements to do six again you know I've
mentioned the Odyssey LCD 3 sentence
right over here is introducing a
outstanding I device DAC and headphone
amp it's got fully balanced outputs it's
really cutting edge so what the
attendees get to see is brand-new stuff
and it's all big boy toys so we get to
play with toys and the thing that's
different too I want to state about a
personal audio event is if you walk into
a high-end audio room odds are you're
not going to be playing what you want
they're going to have a set you know
playlist and they've been playing the
same music for years an impersonal audio
I can't tell you as a music journalist
and an audio journalist I've learned
about more new music from member
head Phi I've also learned more about
personality off remembers on head Phi
this community is community driven so
they also newcomers get to get a piece
of that they get to feel what what
that's about and that's what the high
end is lost in my opinion is that
communal vibe so that's really what they
get out of it that's what that's what I
hope they'll get out of it that's really
what I hope they get out of it my
favorite part of the show is right here
and because right here is where the
innovation is happening right here is
where the youth are and right here is
actually whether people believe it or
not the people coming here and getting
excited about enhancing the experience
of whether it's an ipod or an iPhone or
a laptop those people may or may not
grow into you know high-end stereo now
they may stay with headphones and that's
awesome but the truth is high-end audio
doesn't recognize that the people here
this community they're educated because
they educate themselves they support
each other and it's very unlike some of
the politicking that's been going on in
high-end audio for years so that's also
something i want to expose what i like
to call the old guard to to see that the
community purse the personal audio
community has built what high-end audio
had in the 80s except for its modern now
and it's today and my biggest wish for
the show is just that people walk away
having heard something new and that
they're just excited that they go home
and tell a friend that they go home and
tell a cousin if they go home and tell a
friend of a friend as long as the
message keeps spreading that's our goal
and that's really what I want to have
happen here I want to you know more
seeds more seeds anybody watching this
an audio head if this is your first time
visiting the site stick with it because
Brian does an outstanding job I mean
everything down from his sonic
commentary to his commentary on the
products if the way he explained it to a
layman and the pictures everything about
the blog is pro so trust me again if
you're seeing this for the first time
and it's your first time on audio head
stay there so I'll say peace happy
and music can save lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
