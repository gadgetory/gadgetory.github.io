here if something kind of different
different a couple ways first it's a
loudspeaker setup from audio engine
secondly the brights on this one's not
too ridiculous so this is one of those
entry-level products that all those guys
in the comments section who are kind of
looking for a little less expensive than
the real high-end this might be
something that you want to look at these
retail for two hundred and forty nine
dollars and for that two hundred and
forty nine dollars you get a pair of
speakers a built in DAC and an amplifier
all in one so all of that is contained
in the left speaker here and a single
wire goes over to the right channel you
know ideally they're designed for
computer use so the great thing about
these are that they fit on a desktop
they have a separate pair of stands that
you can buy to angle them up towards
your ears a little bit more that
sometimes helps with the treble but they
definitely fit on a desk which is great
from a design perspective even some of
the larger the bookshelf stuff anything
that kind of sounds good generally
doesn't fit on a desk it's somewhat
unfortunate these are you know actually
actually perfect for just kind of
cradling either side of your laptop
screen we're just adding a little bit
more on the side of your monitor so from
a desktop perspective this is the cat's
meow
very very nice design on the size in
addition to that the sound is
unmistakeably great for two hundred and
fifty dollars by that I mean it is clear
it is articulate it is quick and it
sounds exceptional for two hundred and
fifty dollars there are a lot of other
products on the market jam box by
jawbone those kind of Bluetooth
connectivity little speakers they do not
really even come up to snuff with this
so it's there's a size difference these
are big or
but they're not large right these are
only these are the woofers are only
three point seven five inches big so
it's not even like much bigger than the
palm of your hand and it does include a
separate tweeter so there are two way
which helps a lot there is a slight
opening down here in the bottom for to
help with the base so there is a design
element to these that is much more
robust I think than just your average
bluetooth connectivity kind of thing
however you know they are not portable
for the most part you can definitely
move them around no problem but they're
not going to fit in the backpack very
easily that being said the which you get
for the money are way way bigger I
really enjoyed these you know I think
that the treble is very articulate the
treble is is kind of like the leading
edge for this thing and it does a really
good job of bringing out the detail
there is a great mid-range - vocal
presentation is really good for the
price I mean you have to take a massive
step up to get better exceptionally a
better sound out of something else
speaker rising then you won't even get
the combination of everything ready to
go you plug into your laptop in here and
you're all set in addition to that the
base it is bassy
i'm een you can have significant bass
come out of these for near-field
listening it's pretty darn good now it's
not like a giant subwoofer it just not
like in your chest rattling bass but
that's a little bit more I think than
you would expect from just speakers this
size for most music it's going to be
pretty well covered except for just
those lowest of the lows so for a range
for this size they are pretty good I
mean it gives you a nice breath for the
size like I said clarity is is is one of
the main reasons why you might want to
upgrade to these it is just leaps and
bounds beyond a lot of the Bluetooth
technology speakers that are out there
and you know a lot of other just
speakers in general I mean I think they
do an excellent job
I mean they these guys are really what I
would consider to be the entry-level
audiophile speaker I mean for 250
complete package ready to go that's it I
mean this is where it begins for a lot
of guys $250 DAC included amplifier and
speaker all ready to go and you're going
to see a vast improvement over the
speakers in your computer I mean there's
no comparison to what was going on with
my macbook air there's those are thin
and tinny compared to these which sound
like a regular full speaker the deck on
this does top out at CD quality so if
you want to go high res you can you have
to get a separate deck the audio engine
does sell a d3 that does high res that
you would do your line out to this I
also compared I went a little overboard
and connected this to a really really
high-end deck the Alaric Vega that I had
on hand that's over three thousand
dollars just to see you know what would
what is it compared to internally and I
did find a little bit more resolution
through that tact so I do think that
that speaks to actually the quality of
the speaker and the design as far as all
the great clarity I was talking about
earlier you actually you know this
speaker isn't limited it is even more
resolving than the deck allows it to be
if that's on the back end however it's
totally unrealistic for $3,500 DAC to be
compared to the dad can here I think for
all intents and purposes these speakers
do a great job with the DAC that's
inside and I think CD quality sound is
something that a lot of the guys who are
looking at this thing is probably is
most likely going to top out anyways but
like I said if you want to upgrade that
you can go ahead and grab a deck the d3
from them and run the line out that'll
do high res for you that's kind of nice
or you can just you use your deck of
choice because there is USB input your
mini jack input your regular RCA input
and also RCA outputs in case you want to
connect it to a separate subwoofer so if
you want some more rattling bass
it's your setup to go with these things
so they're actually
quite versatile little speakers I mean
they're pretty great so on now we're
going to do a little comparison and
audio comparison to the a2 plus to
another Bluetooth technology that I have
on hand
the jam box by jawbone just to kind of
give you a little sample of what these
could sound like I'll also include the
original track at the end so you can
kind of compare due to the technical
restrictions of the recording equipment
I have obviously it's not going to be
crystal clear so perhaps not the best to
judge the clarity on this recording
however it does give you a sense of the
fullness and how the speaker's
themselves sound less tinny but like I
said you know I'm using a very
rudimentary recording system here so the
quality itself isn't going to be as
resolute as acute as you know what
you'll hear with your ear but it does
kind of show a basic reflection of the
overall tone signature where the jam box
by my feeling doesn't feel quite as full
a little more like AM radio let's just
say then the overall kind of fullness
and obviously there's more base and just
a little better realism to the whole
presentation from the a2 plus but like I
said it's not as clear as I'd hoped but
it definitely gives you an overall sense
of kind of what we're talking about here
okay first up is a sample this is from
the jam box
and now the same track from the audio
engine a 2 plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
