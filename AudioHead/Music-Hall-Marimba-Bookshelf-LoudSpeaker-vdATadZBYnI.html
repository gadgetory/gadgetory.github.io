today we have a bookshelf speaker by
music hall it's the new marimba this
speaker retails for around three hundred
and fifty dollars which is a little bit
on the lower scale for audiophile kind
of things it is a true bookshelf size
speaker in that it's not overly large it
will fit on a bookshelf hence the name
surprisingly enough a lot of these style
speakers when you get into the more
audiophile sounds the cabinets get very
deep and even very wide in order to
accommodate larger drivers and you know
kind of add in a lot more base so they
aren't they and they cease to kind of
really fit on a bookshelf at all both
these and other speakers of that style
benefit from having a little bit of
space around the back and the sides of
the speaker's you can see here on the
right there's a porthole of a port for
bass that that that kind of really
speaks to the fact that these a little
air around it don't push these up right
up so while they won't sound their best
my experience has been that if you push
them up with the rear port design if you
push them up against the wall the bass
gets a little bit weird maybe a little
too much it's not balanced these overall
are a very balanced speaker and while
they may not have the same resolution as
thousand two thousand dollar speakers
which is to be expected they do you have
a very pleasant sound as far as bass
goes they do go down to a fairly large
depth for this size now I'm not saying
these are gonna come back with a sub or
anything of that nature but it's it does
give you a kind of an overall balanced
feel that is very you know fun to listen
to the sound staging resolution is
pretty good for the price point
vocals really shine on these speakers I
felt like they kind of just were very
vibrant very realistic they're really
believably hung in the middle of the
soundstage so really I think that where
these speakers shine the most are the
vocals a kind of a very nice
presentation especially with female
voices very nice I find for the price
he's got a pretty good buy I like them a
lot I think that if you got a spare
bedroom or a den or something where you
just gonna throw these up with a little
amplifier you'd be in a good space there
there was quite resolving for the price
and you know the fit and finish of these
is pretty good too
I talked with Roy and exponent this year
and he said that they did a lot of
internal bracing for these two up reduce
unwanted vibrations he also said that
they added in they went a little bit
higher on cost in the tweeter to try to
get a little bit better dispersion so I
think that the end result the sum of all
the parts is is very good the build the
fit and the finish I'll kind of come
together for a nice little tidy package
in this price range the overall like
lacquer finish on these is very nice I
like it a lot I think they look classy
they look audiophile nice which is you
know it's all about the sound but I
don't think aesthetics or whatsoever you
can see on the right there that we have
the gold plated posts that are pretty
pretty top rate for this category so
these are the magnificent Music Hall
marimbas bookshelf speakers if you have
any questions comments leave them in
down in the youtube comments section and
I'll try to answer them as best I can
