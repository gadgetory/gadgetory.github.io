we're back in the saddle again this time
with the mr. speakers Mad Dog
custom mod headphone this headphone
originally started as a fostex t 50 RP
headphone and then was modded by mr.
speakers this is quite a popular
headphone on the market right now and
especially in the head fight community
it does offer planar magnetic technology
that is similar to the one you might
find in the auto Z's LCD line which is
also very popular right now
the original headphone that the fostex t
50 RP starts its life as a hundred to
$150 headphone that is known mostly for
a lot of studio stuff people recording
engineers that kind of a thing you know
utilize it quite a bit not not exactly
an audiophile classic in that sense
however he's gotten gained a lot of
steam mister speakers his name is Dan
Clarke in real life with this headphone
and the mod to the audiophile and had
five crowd the modifications include
leather head strap he calls it the
comfort strap that goes around the top
that kind of shields you from the rubber
original head strap and he also modifies
the interior sound the Sonics of the
headphone and the ear pads so the ear
pads are like probably the business
biggest physical change they're much
deeper they're much more comfortable
than the originals and you know they do
a great job they're very deep to keep
the drivers off of directly touching my
ears at least which is a huge thing
because when the drivers push on your
ears internally it
causes fatigue over time so not the most
awesome things so he does fix that so
that's great so there's a lot of big
pluses about this headphone the pricey
charges is roughly $300 for one of the
unbalanced models
he has updated this headphone to include
balance connection so the universal fit
allows you to get the jack that you see
here but change out whatever cable you
want and mr. spiegle actually makes a
pretty good cable you can see the cable
here and it clicks right in and out
through this slide on connection and you
can get different the universal
headphone you can get different cables
through his website too that he makes so
use actually designed it so you can do
the four pin XLR which is what I did to
review with and also the RS a small
connection so he's really you know going
after the head fire out here and
offering all kinds of great connections
that you can go do right through his
site the cable I receive the 4-pin XLR
was good robust it was good long it's a
regular kind of thick wires that's c3
were special or any of those kind of
aftermarket things but it does the job
it's very dense it's very big and I
would say does a great job in his
function as far as the headphones
themselves are concerned I found them to
be very articulate and very defined for
the $300 price range so if this ever was
$100 it far exceeds that and I think it
really competes well with other
headphones in terms of clarity in the
three hundred dollar range now the one
thing to remember about this headphone
is that it is a closed back style so you
do have some of the tonality 's and the
airiness that our company a closed back
headphone and sometimes it's not quite
as airy or light or extended as an open
back I think that's one of the major
benefits of going that route but for our
clothes back it excels at almost all
things very well-balanced not overly
bassy
but it does have that low-end thump that
is kind of synonymous with closed back
headphones so it's got it can get a lot
of punch and a lot of push on the very
low end but it's not overly bloated I
think it's very well balanced if not
slightly leaning towards more of a
treble forward signature now not heavy
not really like sparkly or anything too
much in fact I enjoyed the signature
quite a bit it just leans that way a
hair more than let's say the Sennheiser
Momentum's which I think kind of strike
a very nice balanced signature so as far
as clarity top-notch for 300 bucks if
you like a little more you know accent
in the vocal vocals and treble and
that's really your bag with a nice
low-end thump that's kind of the
signature here so overall I really
enjoyed these headphones as well for 300
bucks close back I don't think there's
much out there that competes in that in
terms of transparency which is a really
great thing when you're going for that
audiophile crowd maybe not the best fit
for those who love the beats closed bag
signature or really really bass heavy
stuff I feel like this is a great kind
of fit for the audiophile crowd the head
Phi crowd really has the attributes that
they go after and obviously you know the
way this this headphone is marketed is
right at those guys so a fun little
piece definitely something if you should
check out if you get the chance for
yourself Dan mr. speakers frequents many
many of the head 5 meets as well as a
lot of the top end audio shows I've seen
him at so if you want to get a chance to
listen to him he's all over the country
I mean this guy I've seen him so many
times so he really gets out there and
lets people listen to so just check out
his website or even you know see if he's
gonna be at one of your local shows
which I highly highly encourage that you
tend to try to get a feel get a taste
for it see what's going on and if you
have a bunch of amplifiers this is a
great opportunity to kind of swap them
out
with a lot of different connections so
if you're for the audiophile crowd
this thing's capabilities the way it's
presented is very much fitted very well
for the audiophile crowd so that's this
one thanks you guys for checking it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
