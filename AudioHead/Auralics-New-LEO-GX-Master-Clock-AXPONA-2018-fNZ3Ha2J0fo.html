complete system to cover direct
different price range so for our main
system we're using our brand-new G
Series streaming device with the new
layer GX clock which is a prototype
driving the MARAC monoblock parent
leavers
with the yg Sony 2.2 last speaker for
the second system we are using our out
hair streaming DAC driving MARAC mono
block with rain speaker our 620 the
sector system is our polaris streaming
amplifiers this is the only one machine
directly driving rain speaker our 6/10
bookshelf speakers let's take a look for
the whole system this is the Ares 3 2
stringing transporter which we launched
during the Munich Show last year it's a
38 $99 it do everything what we can and
it's packed with a lot of technologies
so we got a wire light streaming
functions it can be played through our
like India's with a ruin with Spotify
connect airplay and or anything you want
so the Ares 3 2 is connecting to the
vega g tool this is our flagship
stringing that so beta g2 is upgrade of
our existing big attack not just for the
regular like a tag or analog design but
we we just change the whole structure it
also has a single string functions but
it works best when it connect to the
area g2 and the Vega g2 has a very cool
function what we call it is the analog
volume control which is using relay
based the r2r ladder network so you can
use the Vega g2 as a pure analog preamp
and also when you use it as a DAC you
don't lost dynamic when you change the
volume which means when it turns a woman
really down like a going to like 30 or
40 you see you guys the best a song like
a hundred so in this city we don't use
any of the analog preamp we just drive
the monoblock
three parts directly from the very tool
in the middle is our layout GX reference
master clock this is your portal tab
during the show but it's already working
we are going to launch it officially in
the music show I don't have the price
right now but as you can see it shares
the same looking for the other g2 series
it uses a unity chassis it also have our
suspension food to absorb the variation
the display in front of the leo GX shows
the current sampling rate and as you can
see we are playing something or DSD
right now
so the leo GX actually have two of the
atomic temperature stable clock inside
one is working for the frequency of the
44.1 and is the motive material and the
other one is for the 48 so not like the
other master clock device we are not
generation what is called the word clock
which is like a sampling frequency or we
are not generated like a 10 megahertz
reference clock we're using this your
clock to generate the working clock
frequency directly feed into the Vega
DAC which means it concludes the sound
quality a lot so on the bottom level
this are MARAC mono block partly fires
is 200 into 8 and 400 into 4 so this
model Bach has been on the market for a
long time but it still stands for the
highest quality of what we can do for
the Class D it sounds just amazing
because this is a huge room as 1,100
square feet and it's got a huge very
high ceiling so we're using three pairs
of this speaker to drive so yg acoustic
is a Sony to point whose speaker this is
a 3-way speaker we are using three pairs
to tree and the speaker one for the
woofer one for the mid-range and one for
the Twitter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
