audio head here another review for you
this time we have the Riga Brio are it's
an integrated amp with multiple inputs
we just want to do a quick unboxing for
you here and let you know what we got
going on so this particular AM as I said
before is integrated it has you can put
line level inputs into it and it goes
out to your speakers it's very simple it
has five input with an input selector
here power button here and then just a
simple volume remote there's no tone
controls for this one so that's kind of
a different it's very simple setup it
comes included with a very simple remote
so I can show you here there's no power
on this one just volume mute and then
input selector here infrared go straight
to there it also comes included with
instruction manual registration and your
basic power cord here I'm going to turn
this thing around for you so you'll get
it you can see on the back here the
inputs are very simple simply five
separate inputs the first one being in a
phono input which I have not experienced
with personally but I hear is pretty
good for the price this was previously
unmarked but I noticed that rekka did
update this now and it is clearly
labeled a phono whereas in the previous
models actually did not have a labeling
so you could mistakenly plug a regular
and put into your phone oh there's also
a record output so you said a very
simple setup with this guy but as far as
you know price to performance is
concerned it's pretty good I feel it the
clarity on this amp is really what
stands out for the price you get quite
the resolution quite the the impact that
you want
with a simple to channel setup so the
clarity is really good I found the basic
impact to be pretty Hardy as well nice
well-balanced kind of solid state sound
from this not too shabby if you're
looking for more of a really thick lush
mid-range may want to go the tube route
if that's your thing but for solid-state
sound this is pretty good crystal clear
highs are very articulated and nice and
joined it very much
and it is rated at I think 50 to 60
watts of channel I can tell you with my
pair of zoo omens I had it barely the
knob barely at ten percent and those
puppies were pretty loud the speaker's I
tested this out with dill have very high
efficiency so you know that is by no
means going to be the standard rule of
thumb that ten percents can be good
enough for you but it's just as
something up it's very powerful for its
size it is a half-size am so as you can
see it's not full-length as you can pull
with rather as you see with some
components it's just have roughly half
the size of a larger component well and
then these is this this line also has a
DAC external that matches the same type
of styling and a CD player so you could
in essence if you wanted to put two of
these side by side in the same space
that would fit a normal component and
styling I happen to like very nice to
each his own this one does come in black
and white but as you can see background
rear to front this thing is
extraordinarily heavy to lift up I was
surprised
um really simple design but boy oh boy I
mean it has some weight to it the feet
are good so this I have not taken the
plastic up here but this is actually a
high-gloss shine here and the matching
CD player and act both share the same
type of high-gloss front which is nice
if you like that so just to sum up you
know it is a great little lamp it fits
in a very nice small space in
white is quite quite powerful for what
you get granted the price point around
$1,000 you know you do expect these kind
of things being high quality build and
you got to have power I mean you could
get a lot of stuff for a thousand dollar
range to kind of really push the volume
if that's what you want it but is in
addition to the volume I really saw a
lot of great clarity at the top end and
some tightness with a low end really
good
clear clear bass articulation which is
nice
I'm few have any other questions you
know let me know in the comments section
subscribe to the YouTube channel if you
can thanks a lot guys
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
