gh 13 is a six driver three way actually
is the world's first six driver
three-way dulo dual mid and dual high
it's in the 16 is the first eight driver
three-way your piece which is four lows
two mids two highs the main difference
between those two earpieces is the audio
signature in the Headroom the the 13 has
more of a neutral audio signature very
wide accurate frequency response out to
18 K but it has a sixth and the bottom
end response has the 6 DB bump at 50
Hertz rows back down to accurate by 125
to 160 heard so it's very neutral
neutral earpiece with a nice musical
bottom the 16 was originally designed to
be a performance piece because as 13 had
about 3 DB less input sensitivity than
the and that's it then then the 16 so
that extra 3 DB of input sensitivity
when you're in a live situation makes a
huge difference especially when you're
you know starting to overdrive the board
a little bit through hitting a
transmitter hard and you know the artist
is driving a bell pack so sometimes you
really need the the input sensitivity to
get unity gain kind of all situated so
you're not going above zero on your vu
meters the the 16 is actually still a
killer audiophile
portable music earpiece because it's the
many differences that's got 12 DB of
boost at 50 Hertz and back to accurate
by 125 to 160 it has the same mids and
high extension of the same audio
signature between the mids and highs as
a 13 so it's basically a 13 with more
punch so it's depending on your musical
your audio taste you know how you like
your bass set feel like a nice punchy
bottom end with you know when the 808
sample said are the kick drum the bottom
end or the kick drum you want punch on
that you'll want the 16 if you're more
of a jazz person you want something
that's like perfectly accurate like an
ear field set of studio monitors you'd
like the 13 now both of those earpieces
I've created a new thing called the
Freak phase waveguide so basically the
Freak phase waveguide what I've done is
I've made the drivers all
at the same time at the end of the ear
canal within a hundredth of a
millisecond which basically corrects the
phase curve of the earpiece when you
look at the the the phase curve of the
13 and the 16 they're no more than plus
ten or minus ten degrees of face way off
a zero or you look at most of the
competitors six driver three ways the
lows are sometimes almost 180 degrees
out well and they do a nice level ski
slope around one to two K where it's
major cancellation and there are 90
degrees out on the highs so we've got a
chart here that you can take a look at
and kind of demonstrates that the the
orange line is the is the 16 and the
blue line is a competitor's six driver 3
way you can zoom in on that or you can
do whatever you want
what happens when the earphone has a
very coherent phase curve is that the
center image becomes very clean and
clear and articulate anything between 10
and 2 is where the phase cancellation
starts to really occur when you have an
incorrect phase response and an earpiece
or a speaker or anything else so when
you have something panned hard right or
hard left it sticks out it sounds like a
really wide soundstage because there's
not interacting with the other speaker
and there's no cancellation but as you
get towards mono the center image that's
when all the cancellation occurs so
between 10:00 and 2:00
you if with this phase this waveguide
with a correct you know coherent phase
curve what you end up with is very
detailed articulate center image you
have the ghost image of the vocal right
in the center of your head and you hear
in just you know five six three degrees
of any kind of panning off center and
you hear that and you you hear all this
separation in the detail and you know
very articulate layering of instruments
and so the thirteen and sixteen are the
only two earphones on the planet they're
actually phased correct took me 16 years
to figure that out so well I actually
invented the hybrid technology back when
I was the founder of Ultimate Ears and
it was it was really kind of a good
compromise back then because the dynamic
had nice warmth bottom end and the and
the the balanced armature at a point in
time didn't have a whole lot of bottom
end so it was a nice natural combination
if you use the diaphragm on bottom and
use a balanced armature on top but you
know you have problems with diaphragms
there they're one of the worst
candidates for phase if they're phases
all over the place and then there's no
real Headroom or dynamic range they just
stored really quickly so that's why I
went back to balanced armatures and I
started you know making double dual
armatures and then quad armature so now
I've got stuff that's going down to 10
Hertz the thing to do 130 DB and the
low-end before it starts to distort it's
got lots of dynamic range lots of lots
of you know hot input sensitivity for
live or listening to playback and it's a
much more controlled body menu it's a
very repeatable bottom and where a
diaphragm if you change one thing about
the volume are one canal is larger than
the other then you end up at with a
totally different frequency response
from right here to left ear so even
though
Meniere's owns a patent and they're
really the only only company they should
be building a hybrid anybody else's
infringing on that patent I choose not
to even go down that path because I
prefer you know I moved away from that
you know ten years ago and decided that
if I keep putting my you know pushing
the technology forward on the balanced
armatures I'm gonna have a very
repeatable earpiece that has wide
frequency response in put hot input
sensitivity and you know dynamic range
behind me you see the video of the
company called land toast technology
they've invented a 3d ear scanner
currently if you'd like to purchase an
in-ear monitor you have to get a
silicone cast of your ear and impression
so you have to go to an audiologist or
come to our shoppers go somewhere where
someone can actually do that process for
you we have pretty good repeatability as
far as fit wise you know about 90% but
this is going to make it a hundred
percent and the reason is that we do an
open-mouth impression so 80 percent of
the population when you open your mouth
that canal expands but 20 percent of the
population when you open your canal that
can open your mouth that canal restricts
so most of the problems we ever have
with the fit issue is the 20 percent
factor that the canal is actually in
verse when they open their mouth what's
nice about this scanner is that it's
very very accurate and you can actually
see the dynamic range if you notice
there's a point in this video where the
you see the patient opening and closing
or her mouth and you see how the actual
ear canal changes shape and it's amazing
how much an ear canal changes shape it's
a huge breakthrough and it's going to be
a you know much easier to get
impressions start in first quarter of
next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
