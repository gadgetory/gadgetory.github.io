partnership with the part-time audio
file today we have the Burson conductor
it's a fine fine piece of machinery I'm
very excited to get my hands on one of
these for a while it actually has three
separate functions that it does it can
serve as a preamp it can serve as a
external back and it also has a
headphone amplifier a very exquisite
headphone amplifier in the mix so on the
back you'll see that it has dedicated
digital outs from the DAC as well as
your line outs for the preamp
capabilities and it has all a mishmash
of your typical digital inputs that you
loved one of the really great things
about this amp the way it's set up is it
really has everything you'd kind of need
for for a headphone amplifier on your
desktop kind of situation it's rather
large compared to some of the other
desktop solutions on the market the
price for this one comes in around 1800
dollars so it's a little bit up there
when it in terms of all the compact desk
units that are out there but it really
is a fine piece of machinery when it
comes to sound quality the DAC inside is
a ESS saber DAC which is known to be in
some really great audio equipment
already out there some stuff that I
personally like as well in addition to
the 32 bit 9 0 180 SS saber DAC there is
also a unique feature to this amp
included in the step to volume control
here you can see that it is more
incremental as it goes along I'm going
to give you guys a quick listen the
overall design is meant to give you
better sound quality as each incremental
step has more of a defined stopping
placing connection at that point
whereas I did want to point out the
overall game for the switch is somewhat
unique in if you can see here it starts
there but actually ends up all the way
around almost at a 360 degree point so
you can see that you act you can
actually get a little bit more gain off
of this than you might expect for the
distance that it travels around I has a
total output of 4 watts the one of the
companion ones the SL the Bernstein
soloist SL that one only has 2 watts of
output this is twice that it can really
drive any headphone you throw at it
including the really hard to drive a g6
by a hi-fi man so that's a pretty cool
feature not a lot of amplifiers have
that kind of output in on the other side
of that I did notice it will drive in
ear monitors and really sensitive
headphones it's possible didn't really
have a problem with channel imbalance
which is pretty huge because that
sometimes plagues the lower regions of
headphone amplifiers when they have that
much gain on the lowest setting here I'm
talking about the low gain saying
however the increments were fairly large
so four to five clicks and I'm already
really really loud levels of listening
so it's not ideal for an in-ear monitor
I think that it's more suited for
full-size some of the sound qualities of
this amp that I'm very impressed with is
first of all resolution was phenomenal
that also will kind of led to great
sound staging and an overall
three-dimensional feel all the way
around across all the frequencies
balanced reproduction top-notch totally
flat but with a really really tight
bottom and a lot of energy and a lot of
excitement down there and that coupled
with our diseased LCD 3 we've made for a
real treat
it does pair well with other headphones
clean solid-state sound that will pair
pretty well with I think you know just
about anything out there but I did
really like that particular pairing the
mids are very good very liquid very
detailed as well I think the mids in the
bass are something very
exceptional on this amp but like I said
before the treble is balanced so across
the board a very even keel you know very
smooth impact is very good the amp
itself feels quite fast very very
accurate and and just a pleasure to kind
of enjoy and listen to this thing
probably one of my the best amps I've
heard so far in synergy with the LCD 3
and I'll pull out the raw inputs and
wide stages of gain for a headphone
versatility so a lot of really great
points on this one like I said it's a
little bit up there almost too grand but
for 2 grand you really start to see some
more return on your audio investment
here it's quite good in that regard so
feel free to let me know if you guys
have any questions you can leave
