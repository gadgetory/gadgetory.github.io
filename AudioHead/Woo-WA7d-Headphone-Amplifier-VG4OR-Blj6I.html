today we have a headphone amplifier from
Wu and it is a doozy this is actually
the W a 7d with the separate power
supply that's new the wa7 T P this one
the labeling is actually so new that
they didn't have the D added yet so
adjust as wa7 but this is the W a seven
D model the d stands for duo in this
case for dual digital inputs will get a
little bit into that later however I
just want to show you guys a shot of the
front here you can see that it's very
similar in design in that they both have
the same kind of round button however if
you look at it this button here is
actually for power you push in the
rotation doesn't have any particular
form function for this unit but you push
it in and push it out and that turns the
power on for both of these
simultaneously and this is your triple
good turn on this knob by the way I know
it's a small thing but there's a nice
resistance to it that makes it feel kind
of top-end
so I really do enjoy that these are two
solid blocks of glass that just rest on
here they are heavy this is a solid
block of glass it actually kind of gives
the unit a lot of weight but it is just
a free piece of glass that sits on the
tubes can come in and out for those who
want to like to roll but it's like a
nice way T solid piece of machinery like
everything else that will make so he did
a really good job I think from a design
element here just kind of looking at it
all together I think they look very
beautiful very elegant piece you know it
could be a talker talking point for your
someone comes over to your house and
sees it it's excellent the other thing
that I'd like to point out is he has two
jacks here but this one here is actually
intended for in-ear monitors favorite of
the audiophile crowd and I have to say
he did us all a really good service by
adding it on that way it's not just for
your run-of-the-mill headphones although
it will work when you plug in a pair of
in-ear monitors the noise floor is the
lowest I've ever heard with a tube
full-size amplifier because that usually
is usually buzz or you know crackly you
hear the tubes through in-ear monitors
because they're so sensitive not the
case of this if you're looking for a
little more versatility that little Jack
adds it in a very big way very good job
by kind of adding that diversity but
still pointed directly at the audiophile
crowd nicely done so overall this is
generally going to be used as a full
sized headphone amplifier sonically this
amplifier falls in line with a lot of
other woo products it's it's - it's a
tube amplifier but isn't necessarily
overly to be has a nice almost solid
like ish tone to it that I find really
nice clarity a little bit of warmth but
not not too much now the stock tubes
that are installed on this one that it
could that will come with I found have
it they have a nice frequency curve not
so much billing but they have a little
bit of kick around the bass drum so you
might feel a little bit of a boost right
there but if he varies from I'm sure of
tube to tube sometimes but swapping out
tubes does make a difference in the
frequency response but the stock ones
that I have that I listen to this one
critically are very nice nice punch in
the bass so the frequency givers pretty
much as flat as the rest of my
solid-state stuff just a little extra
punch in that bass so I actually think
that some people might find that quite
enjoyable overall tonal structure tonal
density the texture the detail the
extension is very good on both sides so
if you're into a tube type sound but
don't want to you know go too far
because the problem you run into is some
tube amps is that they get there just
really to be a little loose in the pace
and they lose a little bit of focus
because there's so much tube action
going on that is not the case with this
app very nice so you can see from the
back of this unit that there is a high
and low gain to it which is nice for the
harder term phones I prefer to listen on
the low gay and I think it's a little
bit more suitable for most headphones
and then just turn the volume up louder
if possible I really only resort to the
high gain if it's a very very hard to
drive headphone this is the power supply
section where this connects right to
here so these two are joined that's the
power supply from the separate PSU unit
here on an off switch
USB input this is an input so if you
want to use this isn't it use your own
deck or another source be it a vinyl or
whatever turntable from your phone
onstage you can use this as an external
amp without the DAC section which is
nice
here's the addition of the optical input
so you have to do that's what makes it
the duo the USB and the optical here and
here's the switch to switch between
those three inputs now this does differ
from the regular wa7 in that on the wa7
there's no optical and this position
here is actually reverse as this so you
could use the USB DAC session as an out
external DAC so DAC into here comes out
to another amplifier if you want I don't
think it's a big sacrifice with this one
I don't know why you would spend this
much money on the head amp and not use
it so I think that this setup is just
fine more inputs into the DAC you know
the design here is just an elegant kind
of desktop piece so it's not it's not
too bad I think that the the three
inputs in this is a very suitable use
for the way it's intended to kind of
beating
so the price on the original wa7 was
just a couple bucks shy of a thousand
and with this update the price is now
just a couple bucks shy of 12 if you
want the the separate psu the W a 70 P
here on the right that'll run you an
extra four hundred so that's kind of how
the price breakout is but it is you know
it's a it's a very very nice unit
overall good sound good texture great
design nice weight nice half nice build
just kind of a nice elegant piece would
make a great addition to just about any
place desktop you know a nice a nice
kind of talking piece the tubes light up
pretty it looks beautiful it sounds good
so a very nice execution by Jack you
over there who audio much thanks to
those guys for sending out for review
appreciate all their support and until
next time guys have a great one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
