n for it's a relatively new product from
a company that has traditionally made
tube amplifiers the previous product
they had was called the n3 it was a
budget tube amplifier perhaps one of the
very very few budget tube amplifiers for
loudspeakers they decided to go a
different direction with their next
product into the more digital realm
we're looking here at the headphone and
DAC amplifier as USB inputs digital
control over the volume it's in the
digital domain you can see from the
front here it just has a plus and minus
those buttons do control the output of
the headphone within the computer so if
you have itunes on it will move that
slider for you right there you don't
have to reach out to a computer it's the
same kind of functionality I found for
some of the other more high-end software
as well it moves the the dial on the
inside of the software functionality
wise pretty seamlessly so that was
really good it's about the size of a
deck of cards it's bound in leather with
some white stitching on the side that's
pretty nice 32 bit 192 DAC inside so it
does do the high resolution stuff
although it does not do DSD currently it
is for more upgradable but one of the
really kind of fun features of this
particular DAC because there are quite a
few other I'm just going to turn around
and show you here located right here on
the back now you can see USB input but
you have full size RCA outputs so you
can use it as an external deck if you
want to a separate headphone amplifier
but also a speed if coaxial digital
output if you want to just use it as a
USB converter to another deck so those
are some pretty versatile kind of
outputs especially considering this is a
portable unit
very cool I like that stuff i like i
like full-size RCA as I like the
versatility the only thing this one
doesn't really have is an input for the
headphone amplifier to use it as just a
headphone amplifier exclusively but all
things said the whole package works out
quite nicely the retail is three hundred
and forty-eight dollars on this
particular one I found the sound to be
pretty good for the price the DAC has
just a teensy-weensy bit of basic
situation over some of the other similar
products in the field I kind of didn't
mind it so much I thought that
throughout the head deck and the
headphone amplifier that bass kind of
carried through and it was nice textured
not overly so it's not grossly overly
basie it's just a little bit of a little
bit of bump there but not in the mid
bass so just like kind of a low
accentuation but extension to the
trouble was really good for the DAC and
through the headphone amplifier so all
things being said I really did kind of
enjoy this amp there are other a lot of
alternatives out there you can check out
some of my other videos to see that so
there are quite a few products in this
range right now but not many of them
carry the same kind of inputs and
outputs as this one does so a very
decent product for what it is for what
you get three hundred and roughly fifty
dollars does get you quite a bit I
thought it was a great little product so
I if you something you can audition
every ever get a chance to a highly
recommend it check it out it's one of
those decks that might be just right for
you if you if meets all that checks all
the boxes off that you're looking for so
it's not quite as expensive as some of
the big boys and you know it's not quite
as cheap as some of the bare-bones one
so you have a good arrangement it kind
of lens right in the middle there what
kind of all the stuff that's out there
right now if you have any questions
about the deck feel free to drop
