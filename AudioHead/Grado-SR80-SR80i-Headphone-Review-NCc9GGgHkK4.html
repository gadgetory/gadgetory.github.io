SR ATS you can also apply this to the
newer version of this these uh
headphones actually a couple years old
SR Adi is the newest version of this
headphone the main difference being the
covering here it goes over completely
with another the foam pad does you can
check out more information on the audio
head
that's audio - head website I've liked
these headphones there are a lot of the
entry-level people's gateway drug if you
will into audiophile
um territory when it comes to headphones
they have a really great reputation for
you know producing a good headphone and
this one is there's also one below this
one called the SR 60 um but I think
these are great this is usually retail
for $99 and they have a cool look to
them um a couple of key features you
know starting out they are definitely
open-back headphones as you can see here
you can actually see the driver through
the back of these um and they will leak
sound out so if you're in a place that
you know disturb someone like a library
or something it's probably not the best
headphone for that but what that does do
is it really adds to the soundstage
I think it is great there's a lightness
of airiness it doesn't have that
closed-in feeling of a closed back
headphone an additional additionally it
really makes these a little bit um
cooler on your ears there these are one
of the coolest fitting headphones that I
think I own and and they're good they're
good for long periods of time the ear
cup um I've heard you know running a
line that some of these they have
deterioration problems or they
um hard I actually haven't experienced
that myself at all that they've
maintained their form quite well I find
these to be quite comfortable the rest
on here not really around it so um
there's a slight bit of discomfort
occasionally for a really long period of
time with this top part well I should
push on the top of my ear it'll get a
little sore but I mean besides that
these are really comfortable pair
headphones and the clamping force the
force is pulling in this way is actually
quite light so I like that a lot
very comfortable as far as the styling
goes a lot of people you know they're a
little bit polarizing I personally think
I love the retro look of these I think
they work quite well they look they look
good they're not too ridiculous to wear
out in public you might get a couple of
looks here and there you can see here
that the the end is this come with a
larger jack but it also has a small one
nice adapter that comes with it almost
as far as the sound is concerned on
these I'd have to say that being the
entry-level kind of audiophile pill had
what have you they are they've clarity
above all else for 99 bucks that's what
these retail for they really do have a
good sense of clarity and it'll get you
into that doorway um for for audiophiles
I think that the base on these is about
the only thing that could stand for a
little bit of improvement it's not that
it lacks bass per se um it does
definitely have that grotto sound
signature which some people you know
what argue is a little bit extra on the
trouble I definitely has a little extra
bonus no not piercing though nothing
nothing too extreme but the bass it
doesn't extend quite as well as like it
when you start to get up into the higher
price points of these headphones I think
that the first thing is to use a little
bit of base improvement but these are
really fun headphone I actually listen
to these you know still I even though I
have more
expensive cans I just really enjoy them
I think they have a great sound um a lot
of times people say they're good for
rock things a lot of energy I think I
think they're excellent headphones for
the ear cups on this headphone the tube
they do come off and these headphones
specifically there's quite a bit of mods
you can find for them online so if you
want to Google the Google mods for these
particular headphones I'm sure you can
find just a plethora of interesting
things to do with them and for 99 bucks
I have to say this is probably one that
you're more likely a mod than a pair of
HD 800 s which run quite a bit more but
the you know there's mod for those as
well so if you have money to throw at
anyone take a risk but these you know
these are a good place to start you know
I think a lot of the main mods
come with the ear pad out in different
colors and and things of that nature
get in there maybe mod the drivers a bit
too but that's nothing oh that's pretty
personal what on the other thing to note
about these that they are a low
impedance headphone so they can be
driven pretty easily from an iPod or
another
device without the use of an external
amplifier which is kind of nice you can
just pop these in and go on the line
there
they're quite light so I wouldn't say I
mean I have taking these on walks I
wouldn't go for a run in these per se
because you know Google don't want to
get the pads too dirty but keep them
clean you know they're quite handy for
walking around and so just as a wrap up
this is the grotto SR 80 or this aiready
i know headphone low impedance if you
guys have any questions you can leave a
comment section of the video and I'll
try and do my best to answer them and
also check out the in depth review at
audio head comm audio - edcom thanks
