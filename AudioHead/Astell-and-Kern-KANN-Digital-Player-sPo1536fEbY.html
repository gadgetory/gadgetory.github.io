here at SoCal can jam 2017 here to tell
you about our latest new player the con
it's uh we're slotting this between Rik
300 and 320 between our entry-level
model and our mid-year models kind of
rolled into one package it still uses
the same AKM 4490 DAC that's found on
nak 300 series now it also has a
dedicated line out port for single ended
and balanced as well also you have a
full size SD card slot which supports up
to the 512 gigabyte cards USB type-c
support and of course fill the micro SD
card slot that supports up to 256
gigabytes of internal storage also at 64
gigabytes built-in internal flash
storage as well so theoretically you can
have over 800 gigabytes of storage in
this device so also it is a single deck
model but it does play native DSP which
was exclusive to our flagship models in
the past now it's available in the con
still does native DSP along with 32 384
PCM playback as well and it supports the
wide variety of audio formats that of
other models has always supported so
it's the same highly customized version
of Android that's also found on RAK 300
series players of 240 and the 100 gen 2
and a 120 gen 2 and dak 70 we moved the
hardware buttons that used to be located
on the side of the device now their
physical push buttons for your home
button your rewind fast-forward and your
play pause button as well so uses the
same high quality LCD screen that's
found in arcade 300 series it's a 800 by
480 resolution screen and also another
big part of the of the con is it's got a
much larger amp section compared to our
other players like the 300 series where
you need at the additional amp pack to
drive and playback much more inefficient
phones but with the con on the high-gain
setting you can have up to four volt in
the single ended output and seven volt
in balance without put impedance of only
0.6 for impedance it's the lowest output
impedance digital audio players that
we've released so far so it should be
able to drive and be compatible with a
lot of different types of headphone so
this is our latest model the new product
that we're showing off here I can't Jim
2017 come by our booth and we'll see you
when you get here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
