today we have the new he5 60 from hi-fi
man it is a planar magnetic head foam
that retails for around $8.99 so it's up
there near the kind of flagship Christ
point flagship of sorts no doubt for
high five man high five in replacing the
he5 hundred in this case while the he6
still sits atop the food chain so to
speak of the product line for high five
mm it's quite hard to drive and it's
just not as ubiquitous as these easier
to drive have smaller more manageable
headphones and when the hgz 500 came out
a lot of people were you know just
started to ask themselves you know is
the he6 worth it well I have heard the
86 in partically it is quite amazing it
is worthy of its flagship status however
I should know it's soon to be replaced
by the Aichi 1000 that's I saw at CES
this year so high five man's got a lot
of stuff going on but getting back to
what I was saying before the it is a
little bit of a hassle you can't drive
it so easily it needs a lot of juice
from the amp and these are just a great
middle ground I kind of like the price
point being just under a grand I also
like the fact that you can drive them
from a regular lamp now these are not
the easiest to drive headphones on the
plant they still require an amp to sound
their best there's a lot of things to do
but they're and they're not like as low
as some of the new other planers that
have come out and have gone in terms of
how sensitive they are they're still up
there a little bit you'll see you a
slight power decrease over like your
normal run-of-the-mill mainstream
headphone but these the good news is and
these puppies sound pretty juicy sound
pretty good I was actually very very
when I first put them on in terms of
soundstaging and focus and
three-dimensional holographic kind of
staging from left to right in front to
back I feel like the dimension
dimensionality with these was probably
one of the biggest takeaways and that is
you know it also kind of stems from a
very acute sense of detail so highly
detailed really great base like the
planners are know for good texture in
the mids but I would say the top-end
extension and the highs is pretty
exceptional from these headphones as
well now that being said my reference my
favorite pair of the this very moment is
still the Odysseys LCD 3 but that is
because I prefer the laid back sound
signature in the trouble so there's a
little less trouble on the auto cds LCD
3 compared to these the high five man hg
560 so that sound sure is a little bit
more trouble but the staging and the
surrounding kind of focused instrument
placement is pretty darn good on these
so even though I still perform my
reference for long-term hearing these
are like nestled up pretty dang close to
that and I think it's pretty noteworthy
to point out that they are $900 as
opposed to or closer to 2 grand or the
LCDs so those looking kind of for a
value proposition even though these are
on the more expensive side of things
I'd have to argue there is somewhat of a
value proposition there at $900 even
when you look at other things in the
field and kind of how it compares so
very very tight resolution another
really interesting thing is that they've
lightened these up so high fivin has
said these are about 30% lighter than a
lot of the other headphones out there
and that is true on the head
they aren't nothing however they are
much much less than a lot of planners
out there now that's changing more and
more models are coming out that are
finding ways to be lighter but when you
kind of talk about hi-fi men and its
roots its head
planar tech it's been doing this for a
while they're making strides in the
right direction so they're really kind
of improving upon the way they do things
and the way they kind of manufacture
more they're listening to the consumers
you know basically is what it comes down
to it's a lighter easier to wear
headphone kind of hat still has like a
cage-like design or on the top that it's
not my favorite but it definitely works
it's definitely wearable you could you
could do a liquid a long listening
session without too much fatigue another
good point they've always kind of had is
the detachable cable
I've always quite enjoyed this part if
you want to go balanced change to more
expensive exotic custom cables you can
get the hi-fi man connection on the end
screws right into the headphone and
where you go it's pretty secure does it
fall off and also it allows for
replacement cables which i think is
something you kind of look for at the
very we start getting into the high end
of things it's almost like a requirement
of sorts to make sure that it's as
versatile as it can be and if you got
this headphone for the long haul you're
gonna be able to kind of take care of
the wear and tear or you'll go really
long if you have to go all the way to a
dedicated headphone amplifier in your
house those kind of things are nice to
see you can see in the background here
I've actually left in the box so kind of
keeping close to a nine hundred dollar
flagship it has a pretty fancy box some
nice packaging the overall feel of the
headphone isn't maybe as refined as some
of the other flagships but I said it
costs you know about half as much as
some of those other flagships so I feel
like the trade-off is is pretty
well-balanced here I mean you get a
lower price point but at the same time
you still get kind of a flagship sound
others might disagree and I don't
disagree that $900 is not a lot of money
I do think the $900 is a lot of money
for a pair of headphones and so I can
definitely understand how some people's
expectation would be oh I get this
headphone and I want like a really
high-end feel but it's not bad I think
it's kind of I think it's kind of nice
it doesn't bother me all too much but it
is isn't quite it's not like solid gold
or anything the new HG 1000 that's
coming out it's got a little more bling
to the look a little more kind of a
flashiness but these are like a nice
simple understated pair of headphones
that don't I mean they're fairly large
in nature so I don't know if you're
gonna wear them outside you still might
turn some heads but it's not over
overtly ridiculous I kind of like the
look it's a little classic feel to me
there's some wood edging around and the
earcup is just you know plain not too
much over going over the top I think
it's nice simple plain good sounding I
actually really really like this F a lot
above quite a few of the other
headphones that I have heard if you get
a chance to listen to it I highly
recommend it to see like I said before
the sound signal signature is a little
bit more trouble for it than some of the
other stuff it's really kind of just two
camps but I do feel like it still feels
balanced on the head from top to bottom
base is not overinflated but it's still
nice deep thumpy mids are equally
balanced it's a nice balanced headphone
but a little bit more trouble than some
of the other planar magnetics on the
market currently so this is the AG HiFi
man he5 $6,900 headphone really really
really nice I'm very excited about this
one to kind of get it in the lab here
and listen to it so check it out if you
get the chance thanks for watching later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
