digital experience at CBS this year it
was quite an interesting experience for
me it was my first time there there was
a lot of fun stuff to be had a lot of
fun stuff to see and experience was very
very interesting a lot of food was
available to eat ran across this trash
can from Hugh simplehuman opens
automatically was so close can
close kin
to their listening experience so as I
was demonstrating we have this app we
can set the appt into omni mode so this
will let you hear any sound that's going
on around you such as in this conference
center you can focus on a specific
direction so if you're in a noisy so the
stages product that I saw at Pep calm
was kind of interesting proposal
basically it allows you to have a wake
word to your headphones through a micro
ray located on top or inside this device
that plugs your headphones into the jack
and that will allow you to have
directional listening for the outside
ambient noise it also allows you to have
a wake word so your music will tear down
when your boss comes up and says hey man
or something like that and then I one
more also had their quad drivers in full
effect it's there Leon headphone should
be priced around two hundred dollars and
that includes three ba drivers and one
dynamic driver they did a really cool
job with their three to be a one dynamic
driver this year and we are very excited
for the new one the quad coming out how
we expect big things should be really
fun all year so yeah yeah
I am Val Colton with v-moda and today
we're introducing the Forza metallo
wireless and with it's a the best form
factor for in-ear wireless headphones
you know you don't want to lose your the
earbuds you don't want to lose them you
want to wear it all day long but you
don't want to look like its paste ring
around the collar this is the ultimate
design so it has it features a trap lock
mechanism which makes sure that you can
wear it all day and you can really it
never falls off we even tested lifting
weights doing situps it really is
amazing we tried over 20 different
ergonomic designs it's titanium inside
of it so you can really it's plexus with
you and as you see here it's a very
minimal design so so the control pods
the control pods are barely visible when
you were in a collar this is great so
you can wear it all day long and once
you get used to it it's just something
you don't even know it's there so you
can wear it for community and working
and it has a bucket it'll actually
vibrate when you have a call coming in
so you can just put in one here and then
take a phone call or if you just want to
use your voice assistant like okay
Google or Siri you just hold up the
button for three seconds and ask what
the weather is it has two microphones
that noise cancelling microphones so
that these are really functional so it
actually gets a really great sound for
your poor microphone conversations and
for voice assistance and one of the
coolest things is that they're actually
customizable so this is actually I'm
right now actually were quite a few
drinking stations that passed vodka
through ice chambers down into a martini
glass at the bottom that was really cool
I thought also the glyph is a pair of
headphones that has a built-in screen
that projects in front of you right into
the headband you warm like regular
headphones but yet they have a screen
very cool stuff
there's actually a pretty cool pair of
headphones by warehouse that I have a
cool LED display on the outside but they
also by swiping on the outside cup can
share a song with another pair of
headphones wirelessly so just pairs and
swipes pretty cool the Sadie and the l
a-- came out from blue the l a--
actually has a planar magnetic
technology in it which is pretty
unexpected from them and also a noise
canceling headphone that uses two
separate drivers to deliver noise
canceling through want and sound through
the other which could equal to a really
cool kind of experience that's a little
bit better quality</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
