hi I'm screams expire dynamic because we
are here at the namm booth 2017 and
we're looking at the Palazzo in here
this is our first in here with Kepler
driver technology the test right here
you have drivers that are very efficient
we're getting good precision low
distortion at high volume and the
salento comes with a 3-button remote
control it's apple android friendly and
we're also giving you an additional
audio file cable without the 3-button
remote control you know if you don't
want the option to use with your phone
but we're also given a lot of goodies
with the stilettos we're giving seven
pairs of ear tips applied tips as well
and the polenta is going to be out on
the market next month for 999 it's made
by biodynamic comes with a 2-year
warranty made in Germany
in addition to our new product releases
this is a new gaming headset called the
custom game and basically the custom
game is very similar to our custom one
Pro Plus headphone same concept that has
a sound slider on the bottom of the year
comes where you can adjust your base
level so if you want a nice punchy bass
response folios open up the fan slider
if you want let's face you can take it
back a few notches this 47 the review
space and the custom game comes with a
boom mic and get some salsa de tasco if
you connect to ps4 xbox pc gaming to use
for multimedia applications as well as
Skype it has a mic mute on me cable
along with a volume control and the mms
i'm sorry the custom game is coming out
next month and street prices would be
209
