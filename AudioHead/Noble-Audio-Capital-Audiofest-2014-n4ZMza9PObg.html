make universal fit and custom fit in
your monitors we do everything from a
three driver for sign to attend driver
per side and one thing that makes us a
little different for most custom
manufacturers out there is that we focus
on audio files and consumers a little
bit more as opposed to focusing on
musicians or artists for our customs we
offer both acrylic and a silicon option
which is a little interesting silicon is
generally preferred by musicians due to
increased isolation and silicon slightly
malleable so if you have a interesting
ear you might actually end up being a
little bit more comfortable for you as
well the way I see it is we have two
families of products we have the three
the five in the eighth which are more
v-shape based emphasis sounding products
and then we have the for the six and the
10 which are meant to be more balanced a
little bit more linear we also have a
couple of new products called the FR in
the PR which are basically to ims and
one no drivers are shared between each
configuration the idea is that you'll be
able to switch seamlessly between two
different sound signatures with the f
farm we have a single balanced armature
reference configuration which is
extremely linear and then you have a
dual balanced armature configuration of
similar impedance that's more fun
sounding it and it's meant to be
complementary those two configurations
then with the PR you have the same
single balanced armature reference
configuration as you do in the fr but
then you have a high impedance do a
balanced armature configuration which is
also linear and it's rated at 350 ohms
impedance so that's great for people who
have home audio equipment headphone
amplifiers finally you have a IM that
isn't overly sensitive and you can
actually use that year without any sort
of adapter
we're really known for our craftsmanship
and our build quality when it comes to
cust our custom products as well as our
sound quality and my partner John I made
a name for himself a few years ago by
really using woods and carbon fibers and
things like that in the design of his
products we've since moved on and we're
working on some different things we can
do with the shell a lot of people know
us for putting a gold nugget in the
shell is very popular option and yeah
that's about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
