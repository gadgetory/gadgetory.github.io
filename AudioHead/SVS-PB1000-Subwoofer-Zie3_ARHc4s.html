today we have the PB 1000 from SVS it
comes in a black ash finish it's
actually a 10-inch front firing
subwoofer with a port design there in
the front as well it's rated at 300
watts RMS with a 720 watt peak it's also
ready to go down to 19 Hertz and it
extends all the way up to you know 270
it's quite a beast of a of a subwoofer
and it's also one of the entry-level
ones the SVS offers for around $500 this
particular sub woofer is actually one of
the lower models they have a wide range
of subwoofers offered on their
direct-to-consumer website but from
everything I've heard on this one I
really like it it's a great performer
for five hundred dollars let me just
take off the front drill here and show
you what it looks like as you can see
now we have the 10 inch speaker revealed
and then the port which is fairly large
located there on the lower left there's
also an indicator light just to the
upper left of the 10 inch speaker that
kind of indicates power and whatnot from
the front which is a nice design change
if it's just on the back I don't I
didn't find the light too intrusive and
so nice nice little touch nice little
touch so this speaker like I said it
costs a little bit more than some of the
other 10 inches out there however when I
compared it to my bargain-basement Polk
PSW 10 I noticed a couple of really
great improvements the first and
foremost being had lower reach a lower
thump
kind of a better grip on the low-end
that was really apparent in every song I
ran through the unit in addition it had
a little bit it was a little bit tighter
a little bit more firm it didn't seem as
bloated or wooly as the PSW ten not that
that sub is overly so it's just this one
is is definitely a step up from that
obviously it's twice the price of that
but I'm really happy to say that there
are improvements of this design over the
other sub before I had on hand even
though they share the same speaker size
which is really cool it really speaks
well to the design and the overall
appeal of this unit from the back here
you can see the adjustment knobs not
only for the frequency cutoff but also
for the overall volume of the amplifier
as I said before this is the black ash
finish and I really appreciated the
rounded corners of the design as well as
the finish it just seems like a nice
quality piece of audiophile equipment
the cab itself is extremely robust quite
hefty quite heavy actually much heavier
than the the pulk that I had on hand so
a solid cabinet design which i think is
very important when it comes to
subwoofer cabinets because they just
need a lot of firmness a lot of
tightness you know anything to rattle
around obviously no buzzes or things of
that nature at all so like I said fit
finish definitely a cut above of a lot
of other units the cheaper
bargain-basement kind of style and
overall I really enjoyed the the unit
it's it's a great little unit powerful
and with the extra money if you want to
take the dive into like the $500 range
for a subwoofer you do get that lower
grip like I said before in a little more
firmness and a little more clarity down
there on the low end so that's really
the big benefits to this this this unit
over the other ones a great little
low-end driver if you want to check out
the website it is SVS sound dot-com
only one ass at the end there I have a
great weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
