top-of-the-line so far
speaker the pearl three and one of the
reasons why we bring the pearl three to
shows is to show people what's possible
in a really high performance loudspeaker
that has not only tremendous reach and
power but presence and clarity as well
to me the most compelling reason to own
a high-end audio system is the large
library of musical recordings that exist
from artists who are no longer with us
we can only experience their art through
a real high performance system such as
this and to me it acts as sort of a
magic wand to bring these artists back
to life and of course we lost so many
last year who were very important
artists with a system like this it's
really possible to kind of wave a magic
wand and bring them back to life and
that's really the objective here with
the the Pearl 3 the Pearl 3 has several
unique technologies in order to do this
I think the one we're most known for is
that the crossover the crossovers job is
divided the sound between the individual
elements of the system the woofer
mid-range and tweeter our crossover
works differently than most it allows
each of the drivers to deliver that it's
best part of the range without
interfering with the other drivers so we
don't get those comb filtering or
globing effects that to me detract from
the natural illness and the realism of
the sound this pair is finished in
Rosewood
and piano black
now the rest of the components we're
using in the system are the air
acoustics mxr twenty amplifiers
those are twenty nine thousand five
hundred for a pair and they're just
beautiful works of art on their own
they're resting on a pair of hrs
amplifier stance which are precisely
engineered to isolate the amplifiers
from vibration through the transmitted
through the floor the cables were using
are the Cardus clear beyond both the
interconnects and the speaker cables
feeding the amplifier we have a long run
of Cardus audio clear running imbalanced
and this is the air kxr 20 pre amplifier
it's volume control you can hear it
click when we turn it it's actually
triggering high-precision resistor
networks Oh military spec and that
allows us to attenuate the attenuate the
volume very precisely without having the
artifacts that can happen in digital
volume controls feeding that below there
is the qx5 it's once finished in black
and this digital hub has the ability to
accept digital inputs from USB or
Ethernet or even Wireless and then at
the bottom shelf we have the l5 XC which
is a line filter that provides clean
electricity to the other components and
this again is supported by an hrs high
performance audio stand
so that's the system we're presenting
here at CES 2017 thanks for coming by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
