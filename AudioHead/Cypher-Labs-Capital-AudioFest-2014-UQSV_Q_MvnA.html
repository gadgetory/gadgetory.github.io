here at the capital audio fest and I'd
like to introduce my headphone vacuum
tube amplifier to you it's that called
the prowl cheese it comes in black and
silver and this amp is made specifically
for headphones with some headphone only
features it has a pittance matching for
variety of headphones and the whole idea
behind this amp is to get the most out
of your high-end headphone so that you
get everything you're paying for this is
an analogue only amp it's made in
Portland Oregon it's a collaboration
between Kauffman labs and cipher labs
and it's a handmade we use new old stock
tubes 50 l6 and they use seven tubes the
power cord that is attached chair is
included with this product and the
retail price is three thousand nine
hundred it has four inputs it has a line
output so it can also operate as a
preamp and it will drive a small set of
speakers 96 DB or higher with 2 watts
and we just introduced a new analog only
mini amp is called the piccolo it comes
in this hard case and it comes in three
colors black silver and gold this is the
gold model this is a very unique design
it's a discreet amplifier design in that
there are no op amps it uses a match set
of triodes
it's a very simple product it has a
single input and single output and three
gain levels from minus 12 DB all the way
up to plus 11.5 dB and it will drive all
your large headphones and IEM is very
sensitive IEMs with a black background
it's very portable and light discharges
from a five volt USB either your
computer or wall charger and this
retails for $399</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
