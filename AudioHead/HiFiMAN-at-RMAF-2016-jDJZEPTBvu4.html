first electrostatic for hifi man stead
phone amplifier unit new this is this is
the final version so if you've had a
chance to check it out please please do
so probably a couple months though
before you see it as of right now direct
sales from us only to be determined in
the future if we go forward from that
okay and this is the new headphone as
well right this headphone is actually it
will come with the unit it is the
shangri-la headphone the first
electrostatic for us so now the company
covers one of each there's dynamic known
for planar magnetic but of course now
the first electrostatic and its own
dedicated amplification unit you see
with a approximate Placement English um
I don't know if the approximate price
will be dropped they think it's
somewhere to ballpark of 50 I know if
that's official but I think that's
probably a pretty good number cool
walking down the line you have the
flagship model before that it is the
81,000 version to a couple differences
from the improvement from last year the
cable has been improved the the width
here used to be 14 millimeter it's now
down to 11 there's a change on the angle
of the of the foam and also it went from
a velour and it is now a polyester there
is more of a custom fit here so you're
going to get a better fit for more sizes
so you'll feel you know it will feel
more comfortable it would give you a
better fit and it should be a sonic
improvement over the past version
the EF 1000 amplifier customer price is
going to be 15,000 this is a headphone
amplifier and will also give you about
50 watts if i'm not mistaken of speaker
amplification this is also a new unit
stepping down we have the addition X
version too similar improvements that we
found on a 1000 cable improvement pads
improvement also went from a velour down
to a polyester more adjustments on the
head so it's kind of fit more
comfortable there should be also
subsonic improvement a couple new
players we have the super mini price
point of 399 I believe 22 hour run time
will take up to 256 card will play all
the high res files this unit small sleek
stylish easy to use willpower most
full-size headphones will not power from
our line or 560 will not power the
81,000 version to the mega mini is the
similar version it's a price point of
249 i believe the battery time is also
15 so it's still really good really nice
small sleek and again will power many of
our full sizes but we're not power the
1000 that I believe is a pretty good
some of what we have going on for the
show so I'd ask you to try things on my
name is angel thank you for popping over
yeah thanks alot man appreciate all
right brother</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
