by audio head dot-com this time we have
the v-moda m80 crossfade in white as you
can see here these are a very nice pair
of headphones I did want to show you
guys an unboxing on top of the review as
Val the head guy over there at v-moda
you know I think he put a lot of time
into the packaging of this and it's very
Apple inspired and I've always kind of
liked what Apple's done with their
packaging
clean nice so I wanted to show you the
boxing unboxing as well you can see here
in the top I think if you can make that
out he actually wrote inspired by Italy
styled in Hollywood so you can see you
know very Apple esque matte in the back
very cool on the top though you can you
see here there was a red ribbon here
that I cut when I opened it the first
time he just sliced right across her
areola so each box he's I think he's
been quoted saying is like a ribbon
cutting so this is actually a leather
piece here and this is leather as well
with this the same styling and it opens
up like so inside you see from top as
that comes out the packaging and again
everybody's favorite literature in the
in the base there but here we have the
headphones case itself very nice
different kind of rubbery feel to it not
a bad size initially when I had seen
these I thought they were much larger
than the actual are they're quite
convenient size this will fit in a bag
fairly easily or purse as soon as these
are white but you know I kind of like it
it protects it well there's a lot of
good accessories that are included with
this that phone itself is good but the
accessories are a big plus so you open
up you can see it's styled even more we
have two cords here one and this is very
convenient for like the modern try
we have one that's for Android and one
that's for Apple then one for Android of
course includes the mic for speaking
however it does include both this on and
off switch but that's it as you can see
they're just the on and off switch for
picking up calls stopping music things
of that nature and this one you have
more of the Apple style connector let me
get a picture of that for you
where actually has start stop and then
volume access as well which is pretty
darn convenient in the fact that it
works with both I think it's just a huge
win a lot of other manufacturers could
take a note from Val in that regard I
guess I also comes to this miniature
carabiner these panels actually remove
so you can you know change your mount to
everyone or just remove them altogether
from not using one type if you only do
Apple the headphone itself I supposed to
be really durable from my experience it
is quite build we don't like a tank it's
got a great headband this these things
feel solid that so take bit heavier than
you would expect to be honest to be when
you pick first pick them up they're not
heavy at all but considering like some
of the grotto designs and some of the
other ones they just feel more solid I'm
not saying they're heavy but they're
definitely more solid and they have
these customizable grilles here and
there is a tiny vent here that you see
in in it'll does I believe that does lay
let out some air for the design so these
are not completely closed back it's
pretty cool
unlike this design right angles okay
sometimes you know a lot of headphone
designers will do that this 45-degree oh
that works for me too
keeps it out of the way a little bit
more definitely helps prevent wear and
tear on that joint which is never good
over long alright so I like the design
of these like I said they're a bit
smaller than I expected they do fit
around
I'm sorry not around they fit on the
ears not around so they are a non head
headphone type as far as the sound is
concerned these do have a little bit
more of a bass signature to them
there's a good good way describes the
more of a roundness there's more of a
bass drum or bass guitar feel to them it
kind of comes out more pronounced in the
music if you like R&amp;amp;B to your Jeff we're
gonna feel that bass lump it's not bad
it's like pretty good I like the balance
I do think that you know if you look for
looking for more of a completely
audiophile neutral sound these may not
be the headphones for you but I find
them to be quite energetic and I
actually listened to these quite a bit
if I have a choice I really like to feel
the sound is very energetic and fun and
I really brings out a sense of energy in
the music which I you know really prefer
on a lot of occasions when I'm not doing
stuff that's supposed to be completely
flat excuse me so I really do think that
you know these are a great pair of
phones for people on the go you know
that our listening to mobile devices
that are you know finding themselves in
situations where where they don't want
too much sound leakage to come out it's
a very versatile kind of fun energetic
headphone so if you guys have any

review can be found on audio - head comm
