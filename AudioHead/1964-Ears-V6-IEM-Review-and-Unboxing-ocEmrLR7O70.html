in review of the 1964 ears in-ear
monitors their newest model called the
v6 the v6 has six drivers per ear
balanced armature drivers two for the
low end two for the mids and two for the
highs I'm going to give you show you
guys quickly here what comes in the box
because it is kind of a nice collection
of stuff some companies they don't
always include all the bells and
whistles 1964 years is not one of those
companies there's some really nice stuff
here the case as you can see it is a
little bit nicer than a lot of the other
ones I've seen it's a heavier plastic
you can see here at the top this is
actually a durable foam while here
underneath is a very nice rubber that
kind of coats the side here is very cool
I like it a lot of those like a pressure
release valve right here which is also
kind of nice because I have noticed with
some of my other in monitors traveling
on a plane and whatnot it's really hard
to get the containers open sometimes
when the pressure builds up in there so
not it not to be overlooked the
container for this is quite nice these
are the v6 in ear monitors themselves
very cool I'll go through those in just
a bit but to run through here quickly a
Velvet II type of bag that comes with it
pretty cool inside here we have your
traditional large two small headphone
jack adapter the clip your
standard-issue wax ear cleaner if you
look closely if I if you guys can see
this there's a little loop at the top of
this it's very handy for getting out
your wax that collects in the bores of
the the in-ear monitor so you reach in
there and grab it with the loop and pull
it out that's pretty handy because you
know the last thing you want is for one
of your your ear canals in your in your
monitor to get completely full earwax
that would be bad so and then there's a
little brush on the end this is a very
handy device if you have
you're in ear monitors for any length of
time you're probably going to keep this
handy don't lose it and my personal
favorite in almost an essential often
overlooked the headphone cable clip this
clip is very imperative at times when
you want it when you're moving around
and you're being portable and you don't
want the cable noise to distract you
also if you are walking around there's a
small chance that they'll get yanked out
of your ears that's this is really
helpful because it kind of protects as a
protective barrier from them ripping
right out of yours which can be painful
it happens me
unfortunately multiple times on occasion
so it's really twofold but the cable
rubbing isn't to be overlooked either
because it really kind of makes a large
scratchy bass on when you have a full
seal going with the likes of these type
of headphones so it's something that it
may seem small but in the end is really
helpful and I'm really glad to see that
they included this with the package as
far as the in-ear monitors themselves
these have the v6 logo on the back the
mid and the low drivers are visible
through this clear shell you can also
get this in a bunch of different colors
I also put custom artwork on the outside
if you so desire this particular model
is clear so this is what you'd get if
you ordered something like that you can
see it is a two of a dual bore design
that means the highs go through one
channel and the mids in the low go
through the other bore both channels
meet together in your ear but they are
separated out in that in the earpiece
specifically you can see the drivers
through the window here that's the mids
and the lows the treble if we can find
it it's located on this side they're
smaller and they go right into their own
individual bore near the top so like I
said these are pretty simple they just
have the simple v6 logo but you can get
them customized out a lot of different
ways the molds can be different they
also do soft ear canals the basic
construction of these is acrylic so the
material itself is quite hard but if the
custom fit is right the discomfort is
not really that bad in fact you know a
really good pair
of in-ear monitors will provide a good
seal for great that's essential for a
great bass accurate bass but they also
shouldn't have any type of discomfort
they should kind of melt away if you're
really active and moving around you can
barely tell that they're even in your
ear sometimes if the fit is right so
it's important to get a good fit not
always the easiest thing to do but once
you got it
it's quite worth it so you know a real
benefit to these over the universals is
the is that custom mold it's you know
quite more it's a bit more comfortable
and the seal is always perfect which
helps with bass and everything else so
that's that's a pretty cool feature of
these in-ear monitors overall you can
see the cable is pretty standard this
one's actually interchangeable it comes
out so if you want to upgrade the cable
later you're more than welcome to do
that with these and this is a pretty
standard - connection so you can also
get a balanced cable for these if you so
desire so there's like a little bit of
interchangeability available there from
my experience this cable when it is
clear like this if you work out
extensively with it it will start to
oxidize and turn a slightly green color
so just something to think about if
you're thinking about cable colors the
v6 is run around 650 dollars now
compared to a lot of the other players
in the field I actually found this to be
quite a good price for a custom in-ear
monitor some of the top of the lines go
up to 2 grand there's some that are
around the $1,200 mark that off before
perform exceptionally well however this
one is like roughly half the price of
the flagship Jerry Harvey 16 which has
two more drivers and an 8 per side but I
found this to be more than half of the
quality if that makes any sense the
quality of this is easily worth the
price the sound signature on this to be
pretty if it's not inflated in the base
to the degree of the JH 16s it is more
of a slight bump in the base it's not
flat
I would say there's a little bit of an
sin-shoo ated bass to it however it's
very nice and detailed and less than
that of the j j-- 16 so you really obey
said you may want to look at the sixteen
but if you want just a bit a bit of a
bump this one actually has a really nice
basic sure for in-house listening not
portable listing i would say i almost
prefer this amount of base over the j
j-- 16 the j 16s really have a great
outdoor portable balance that where bass
like i said with a cable running outdoor
your feet hitting the pavement or the or
the shaking of a subway car if you're
riding in transit those kind of noises
they generally give you a lot of bass
sound which interferes the bass will
look more accentuated bass works out
however for home listening or quiet
backdrops this one is actually a bit
less and i per for it prefer it for that
particular scenario when it comes to the
mids I found the mids to be pretty
exceptional as well especially for $650
great mids nice liquid not too forward
not too far back they felt right where
they should belong the treble on these I
found to be a little bit more
accentuated than the j j-- 16 so the
trouble was there it was good was
energetic i liked all those qualities
however I did find and this is maybe the
main differential aside from the base
with the JH 16s the high end was not
quite as smooth so fortunately there is
a little bit of a drawback in that the
smoothness of the high end wasn't quite
where a lot of the other guys are um
however in a vacuum I don't know if you
would necessarily notice that as much
it's a pretty subtle thing um so these
are not the best I've ever heard in the
world world however for 650 they are
probably one of the best ones I've heard
for 650 in that range I really enjoyed
the sound settings you're good energy
nice smooth bass mids like I said great
energy in the trouble however not the
smoothest it's basically curved for you
in this quick summary there but the
quality in the build is right on par
with all the other in ear monitors
I've really looked at they have there's
not really too much of a build issue
with a lot of these guys they're pretty
similar in build field they use a lot of
the same materials in the construction
so not too much to really talk about
there but overall a really great thing
if you aren't in ear monitors for
portable use I really find them to be a
great alternative to around the ear
headphones so check out their site 1964
ears dot-com they also offer a couple of
other really cool sleeves for universals
where you can have like this type of
custom fit but then you just plug in
your universal driver right into the
back of this they have them re-- molding
for universal driver so they do have a
couple of really cool alternatives for
all universals as well on their site so
let me know if you guys have any
questions feel free to subscribe to the
youtube channel that helps me out and I
will talk to you guys later thank you
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
