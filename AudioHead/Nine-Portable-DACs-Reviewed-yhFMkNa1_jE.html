compiled together a total of nine
different portable ish Dax that I have
at my disposal here all in one place at
one time very cool opportunity I thought
I would give you guys my thoughts the
good thing about these Dax is for the
most part they follow their price point
in terms of quality so a lot of the
cheaper Dax very good for the price and
as you go up features kind of differ but
for the most part the quality increases
proportional to the cost incurred now
it's not a straight curve obviously
something that costs two times more is
not usually two times better but it is
better than something that costs less
than it so that's a pretty nice feature
about these particular Dax that I have
together here for you I'm going to take
you guys through these Dax they're
actually set up the cheapest ones on the
left to the most expensive on the right
and I'm going to give you a quick
rundown of each one the first tech I
want to tell you guys about is down here
on the left it's called the Cadillacs
coffee this deck runs around two hundred
and fifty dollars it features a lot of
different controls on the top part it
has a headphone output as well as your
standard RCA analogs this other side is
just supplied via the power of this USB
acts as a computer deck for the most
part the sound I found pretty good I
really enjoyed it I think that you're
going to get the best out of this
through the analog the headphone out is
OK for the sides but it's not quite
enough to power really big headphones as
you can imagine it's a pretty standard
volume DAC that works well for E in ear
monitors this deck is cigar shaped it's
the deck port LX by Centron it's also
supplied for portable device through
computers to this USB the power is
supplied there and it goes up to 24 96
very good DAC also 250 dollars just the
single output on this one
you cannot plug headphones into this so
there's no headphone amplifier I found
the sound of this one to be very good
very smooth in the mids and indecent for
the price 250 this is the R cam RPAC so
basically the same kind of setup as the
calyx coffee except that it has just a
volume supply on the top there is a
headphone output the back contains the
same type of power supply through the
USB and an analog output this does not I
have a battery in as well none of these
ones I've shown so far are supplied by a
battery so all the power needs to come
to the usb I found this DAC to be quite
good all three of these previous ones
kind of are in the same league as far as
sound quality is concerned I found
however I did find the headphone jack on
this to be less than ideal
it will definitely suffice for in ears
but once again not something that you
can really kick but with big headphones
and look for a really big headphones
sound unfortunately so in this one is
250 as well this one here has quite a
bit of hype around it is the audioquest
dragonfly so the smallest one of the
group it lands in around 250 you can see
you can see here that it is simply the
size of a USB stick I've done a full
review on this in the past I really
enjoy this one I do think that the
output line quality that you plug into
here is just a hair above the rest of
these groupings the other Dax in this
category don't quite have the lifelike
recreation that this one does it's very
unique in that this little dragonfly
lights up in different colors based upon
what kind of signal you're feeding it so
you kind of get an idea of what you're
actually listening to as far as bit
rates and resolution quality is
concerned the headphone jack also is a
line out for the device and I found that
to be pretty good too on equal par with
the quality so
not something you can drive I mean this
will drive full side full-size
headphones but still I think for best
results an external headphone amplifier
but it will act pretty good for 250 to
even your line out stereo as we move up
the scale now we're going to go to a
bigger price jump but I'm glad to say
with this next one we also see the same
kind of bump up in quality which is
great this one is called the apex
glacier it's a relatively new one from
Todd the vinyl junkie TT VJ is his name
and he has done something quite
different as you can see with this it
runs around $500 it is quite a bit
sleeker and smaller this does actually
contain an internal battery for you to
use so it will go ahead and tap right
into anything portable you can take this
with you whenever you want you can see
it there is a bit of a deviation from
the other controls but this one has a
very cool lights that lets you know
what's going on with the volume like
that I don't know if you can see that
but it is pretty cool a little bit
different than a lot of the other ones
push on push off the back features a
mini USB jack one for charging and one
for the DAC so you know exactly what
you're getting out of each one there's
also gain switch it back there and then
an input for analog line ins this has a
96 20 24 96 DAC built in that I thought
was really good it the quality is
outstanding for this in here monitor
listening right up there with a lot of
the other big guys I really enjoyed this
one it does have enough juice to power a
pair of LCD 3s
through the internal DAC it was pretty
good juice on this one compared to the
other guys in this category I mean the
gain is just kind of up there from the
rest great sound quality
definitely a bump up in DAC and
amplifier quality than this group here
this is 250 this is where 500 starts the
next one
I have here is the pan M by alo audio
now as you can see this one is not
really extremely portable it started out
at 600 but I believe it's at 500 right
now at the website but this I would like
to say this is an external power supply
which does add to the sound quality in
my opinion but it also costs another two
hundred dollars more so bare-bones 500
but realistically more like seven or 800
by the time you're done with it if you
really want to get the best out of it
you can see that it actually
incorporates tube in the input stage but
the output stage is still op amp but
that in fact gives this thing a pretty
good sonic signature with with amazing
power there's a high low gain here and
on high it will definitely push a pair
of LCD threes to whatever level you
desire so it's pretty good as a
headphone amplifier this thing is
outstanding now the DAC is fairly good -
very good I would say for the price
point the amplifier really can't be beat
in my opinion with the tube stage in it
added in there this thing sounds very
very sweet well thinking about I have
noticed over time however is that vocal
presentations tend to be a little
forward so if that is your bag then this
is definitely the amp for you if it's
not your bag then maybe another one will
be just as good but the end I father
foes to be just a touch forward but all
of the other rendering especially the
base texture very very nice very very
warm as you move up the chain this thing
has a couple more inputs and outputs
obviously we have both type of
headphones jacks here but on the back
you can see we start to have you know
more of like a regular headphone amp
kind of setup this is for the DAC it is
powered through this and powered through
this this is the battery supply the USB
DAC here then the small input and then
regular RCA is all selected by this
rotating switch here so it's starting to
get a little bit more features you might
find you know just for like as far as
straight headphone amp
features but it is portable I mean this
is all you need to go connected to a
computer and you're ready so for a home
office setup this one is actually really
nice because it's got a lot of features
I kind of just work in a little compact
pet pack however unlike this you can't
really strap it to a foam per se this
one will accept you know output from
through a line out jack
into the back of this from your Apple
device and you can just strap it right
to it maybe strap it to your phone this
one obviously can't do that as well so
this is just a little bit more portable
obviously in this one but it sounds a
little bit sweeter on this so it's kind
of a trade off this one we have next is
the Emmaline intruder from Ray Samuels
Audio raised on a really good job with
this one it's very unique in the fact
that it has balanced inputs and outputs
balanced inputs and outputs here by a
4-pin jack as you can see the actual
channels are completely separate you
have separate selectors for the input
USB to the line in here single ended or
balanced there's the USB connection and
then you can do the four pin out to a
balanced headphone that's pretty unique
not any of these other guys really do
balanced connections and this is where
to say the least you can actually
partner this up with the algorithms so
low DB here and you're starting to get
you know kind of more like a high-end
stereo setup with balanced and
unbalanced connections I found the juice
from this very powerful now especially
through balanced mode there's like more
juice than I think almost you know not
more juice than any headphone could
handle but it it's it's big it's loud
one of the loudest amps probably on here
when it's in the balanced mode with a
single ed mode still great great power
there's three there's a three switch
selector here so this thing for
versatility if you like in ear monitors
it the lowest one is right perfect in
the area for any air monitors that being
this is sound soft and as you turn up
this is about half way and it goes all
the way here so what I'm saying is
instead of having just a tiny little
swing with a lot of the other amps for
in-ear monitors where it goes from very
quiet to very loud in just a small turn
this one actually gives you a perfect
kind of sweep from low to high across
the knob when you listen to unit in here
in your monitors that just happens you
know it's just so nice to kind of have
that versatility it's just a very smooth
transition and volume as you go up so
this one pretty unique this DAC however
just tops out at 16 48 so it does not do
the high res file transfer from the deck
but that being said balanced input you
can line it with another DAC and you're
going to get some pretty sweet sound
especially through the balanced
connections that let's bring it to this
here the cipher labs algorithms solo dB
this is an exclusive DAC also
battery-powered this is battery-powered
as well it runs for around $700 as well
but this is just for the DAC section
obviously but then again one of the best
sounds from a DAC as well it really
shines in that department this one as I
said before includes the balanced output
so that is very rare too for a portable
device they used to have one called the
algorithm solo and didn't have the DB
and it did not have this output as well
this one also now plugs into your
computer and I found the sound from the
computer to be exceptionally great very
very good stuff as I said before
balanced output coaxial output as well
in case you want to run this from your
computer into here via USB then you can
run this out to your favorite deck
somewhere else the USB input here solid
switches very cool
the next deck I have here it's a little
bit of a departure I would not consider
the centrist deck mini that I have here
to be by any means considered portable
it's in the shape of a Mac Mini so you
could rest one essentially right on top
of here I did want to bring it up as it
isn't the seat in the sentence
family as you know this one has a lot
more features with this right here it
rotates between inputs if I turn this
around you can see that has quite a bit
more inputs it's more of like a stereo
oriented device as well as a headphone
device optical in coaxial in analog in
if you want to just run headphones in
from some other source so you can access
just the headphone amplifier and USB
connectivity it does do the high-res up
to 96 not the full but 90 96 via this
port and it is very nice as well it's
very smooth and does a great job just as
a DAC the headphone is powerful you can
actually soup up this model on the
website if you want to make it even more
powerful with more gain on they're not
the best for in-ear monitors the gains a
little high like I said but for full
headphones you can definitely rock and
roll with that unit as well as far as
connectivity to Apple devices and
Android I did find that this device the
apex glacier and the intruder by RSA
audio did connect to my galaxy 3 phone
which is pretty cool because then you
can just slap this on in like a sandwich
and go this one is one of the few ones
that actually does it with an Apple
device is you get connects directly to
an Apple device and then decodes it
internally the rest of these for the
most part you can access it through a
lineout cable and but the internal jack
of the iPod or I device needs to do the
decoding this one does it in-house
inside this thing which is a really nice
feature and it is a slight upgrade in a
lot of cases to the sound but Android
devices I mean we don't let those guys
feel left out but these two do you have
that capability this one however does
not do the galaxy 3 Android devices
this one does Apple devices like the
iPad through the iPad camera connection
kit so I don't want to leave that out
that
works so a lot of these other ones they
can't go through the phone because they
require power from the device and that
unfortunately negates them as being
compatible with an i device so that's
the rundown I hope you guys enjoyed it
it's a pretty good swath of what's
available right now and I got to tell
you this is a really good time to be in
the portable audio and just Dax in
general because this is evolving
constantly what we see here and new
products are coming out and new
technologies are coming out and
everything is changing really quickly so
it's a good time to be into this kind of
hobby if you enjoy it let me know if you
guys have any questions in the comments
section of the YouTube video and please
feel free to subscribe to the channel if
you like this kind of stuff have a good
one guys
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
