call minor new products it was fun it
was great but this to me is like where's
the beef beef is here at this event and
the really big news is our 16 Ultra
subwoofers which we have been working on
in secrecy for more than two years I'm
so thrilled that we're finally launching
them here at Rocky Mountain there is so
much new on these subwoofers that I
really want to kind of take you through
it in three parts first of all and this
is something that everybody is thrilled
about this is SBS's first ever 16-inch
driver and we have been working on this
for a really really long time trying
different approaches I mean I can
actually I say two years in the
development but we actually started more
than eight years ago trying to figure
out how to do this why is it so
difficult well here's the thing the
existing 15 and 18 inch drivers in
subwoofers today if you have a massive
motor and a powerful amplifier you
certainly can move some air by saying
move some air I mean you can create
extreme low frequencies you can play
really loud but 15 and 18 inch drivers
are subject to inaccuracies particularly
in frequency response and transient
response SBS is all about great bass
deep low-frequency extension great SPL s
but we never want to sacrifice accurate
frequency response and and speedy
transient response so that's why we've
shied away from that this design is is
the product of two years of exhaustive
research we threw all our other designs
out the window and came up with this
innovation which is our that I think the
world's first ever eight-inch edged
wound voice coil the typical subwoofer
driver has a three-inch voice coil
trying to control this massive 15 or 18
inch driver it's not going to work this
8 inch voice coil exerts tremendous
precise control over the driver we marry
that up with a massive ferrite motor the
driver weighs in the neighborhood of 75
pounds of weighs more than most entire
subwoofers this driver can create
extremely low frequencies it can create
massive amounts of SPL but never
sacrificing frequent accurate frequency
response and speed in the transients the
driver is phenomenal but a driver is
only a potential it's not reality at the
same time as we began development of
this driver we imperil l began
development of an all-new amplifier
platform because without the right
amplifier the driver is just a concept
so we're also proud to launch our sledge
15 under an amplifier 1,500 watts of
continuous power more than 5,000 watts
of peak power I'm going to say arguably
the most powerful amplifier ever put in
a subwoofer and what's really cool about
it is the output is fully discrete
MOSFET output benefit there is gobs and
gobs of current to be able to really
drive that driver and control it we
marry that with analog devices one of
their best DSPs nobody puts
sophisticated DSPs and subwoofers we did
and the result is a phenomenal tour de
force of subwoofer performance as I said
phenomenal low-frequency extension great
output and always accurate and speeding
the transients and then we marry that up
with something that nobody's ever done
one thing you're going to see is the
first-ever SBS from panel display so I'm
really proud of that but obviously other
folks have done that but I don't think
anyone has done this this is the
first-ever subwoofer app for smartphones
it will work with your iPhone or your
Android phone it's fully bi-directional
meaning the app can talk to the
subwoofer and tell the sub control every
aspect of the subwoofers DSP but if you
go up to the front panel and control it
there it will the app will know you did
it if you don't want to use the app you
can also use the supplied credit card
remote to control the subwoofer oh and
by the way the app connects to the
subwoofer via bluetooth so you don't
even have to have line-of-sight to do it
you have a full readout of what you're
doing and the subwoofer can be hidden
behind something and not visually see it
and still be controlled by the app you
can look on our site to get the specific
specs but one
expect that everybody want to know is
our 3 DB roll-off rated for the SP 16
Ultra is 16 Hertz so well below
audibility on the pv 16 ultra it's
literally 14 Hertz so just an
astonishing amount of low frequency
output that's even below our ability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
