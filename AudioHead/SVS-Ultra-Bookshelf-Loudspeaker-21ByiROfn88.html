bookshelf
it's a new series by SVS SVS is
traditionally known as a sub woofer
company they make a wide array of so
subwoofers they sell to it a pair even
on their website but this is their first
kind of extension out into the other
frequencies the Ultra Series has a
center channel surrounds bookshelves and
then of course towers this review
pertains directly to the bookshelf
speakers they retail for around 500
rupees a thousand for a pair the speaker
itself contains a one-inch dome tweeter
and a 6.5 inch woofer there's also a
bass porthole located in the back to
help extend the bass even farther this
one that we're looking at right now has
that what they call a piano black
high-gloss finish I personally like it
quite a bit I think it looks very sharp
very classy you look great on your
bookshelf it's quite large to fit on a
desk but you could definitely fit it on
a bookshelf the depth is a little bit
more than your traditional kind of
computer sized speakers so it is like
more of like a full-size audiophile
bookshelf speaker in that regard I
really enjoy the sound of these speakers
I think they excel at detail that can
play with a lot of the other big boys in
the one in the 1000 dollar price point
range in terms of details very
articulate nice top-end
good top-end extension and they actually
grab really low on the low end for
bookshelf speaker they don't go as so
far as to have the kind of low end in
your chest thump as a subwoofer or even
some full-size tower speakers but for a
bookshelf they do a pretty good job as
far as the overall tone is concerned it
has a slightly forward slant in the
treble region compared to some of the
other speakers I had on hand in the back
you can see the rear base porthole and
the connectors
or by wiring if you so desire with the
base porthole being in the back it's
best to have a couple of inches of space
between the back of the speaker and any
wall you're going to place it with to
kind of help alleviate too much of a
boomy bass thing so that kind of wraps
up just a quick snapshot of the new SVS
ultra bookshelf thanks for watching guys
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
