can jam I hear you have a couple new
products on display here and just
looking for if you'd give us some
lowdown sure
okay thanks Brian thanks for coming to
the booth so this is one of the new
products we are showing
it's a open version of sine headphone
the sign itself has been phenomenally
successful for us it's a small on-air
closed back headphone the regular sign
so this version we are calling it the
signed LX it's a similar headphone but
completely open back so we also have the
driver slightly you know damped
differently and stuff like that but it
actually has an enormous soundstage so
everything that you love about the sign
headphones plus a much much bigger sound
stage is what you get with the sign
Tillich's what was your inspiration for
making the headphone different from the
sign is are you guys looking to kind of
move that direction
overall it's yeah so there's not that
many open back I mean we you know in our
near segment we only have the second
headphones there is no open back then
but usually when we design headphones we
designed them as open back first right
and then because open backs you can you
know since the sound is not once you
close it you get the reflection and the
reflection goes through the diaphragm so
you will have some unevenness in the
frequency response so every headphone
that we designed we design it with open
back first so but but for this
particular market segment when we
released it initially at the Apple
stores and everywhere close back was
more appropriate so we released the
clothes back but we had shown the open
back to some people even way back into
those and
14 or 15 early 15 I think
tile pile Mike myself a couple of people
have even tried it it's a really good
headphone because it's very linear very
nice headphone so now that the sign
product has stabilized a little bit we
are shipping in quantities we thought
okay let's make this headphone also
available this is more of an audiophile
play this will not be in the Apple
stores for example the regular signs
will be in the applesauce this will be
more an audiophile play it's just a
really nice sounding open back headphone
so that's basically what we are showing
you the pricing on it is $5.99 but for
the you know initially we are trying to
you know as I said this is also a test
in the market that we are doing so we
will have a limited quantity of these
for the first be first people at $4.99
and when they try it of the buy it from
our website and then based on feedback
we will figure it out as we go on this
particular headphone the driver is same
but the damping the damping and the
they because of the open drill it's
slightly differently and and you will
see it once you've added the frequency
response is also linear because there's
no ear cup and then it's your gonna take
pre-orders yes yeah probably in a week
we will start getting pre-orders and we
will probably start shipping you almost
immediately in a week or two weeks thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
