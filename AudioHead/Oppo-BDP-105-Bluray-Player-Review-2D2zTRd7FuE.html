this unit is relatively new it's
replacing the 95 the bdp 95 that was
quite well received from last year
it is a blu-ray player with a couple of
new features in addition to that it also
has a little bit of a price bump over
the 95 the 95 was roughly a thousand
this one is 1200 both great players I'm
going to go through the additional
features and just let you know kind of
how it performed this has a networking
capabilities in addition to playing
blu-rays sa CDs CDs it actually plays a
quite a great wide variety of format
types pretty much anything you can throw
at it you can play music through a
connected hard drive through the USB
ports there are a lot of connections on
this unit so anything you really want to
connect to it it'll probably do which is
a really fun kind of thing I found that
the versatility from just everything you
can put into it to everything you get
out is great you can see that they have
both a USB and MLH HDMI IN as well as a
headphone jack you can also plug in an
MHL cord and connect this to your phone
to play media directly through your
phone without needing to connect to an
external charger the charge actually
goes through that port as well which is
kind of a nice feature the headphone
jack in the front located right here is
fairly nice I didn't find that it pushed
the really really high-end headphones to
very loud levels however for in-ear
listening around 50 I felt was a
comfortable listening level
with my pair of LCD 3s I found a hundred
to be a comfortable listening level but
not
so those of you who really like loud
amplifiers you might want to look at an
external headphone amplifier and run it
through the outputs in the back which
are I got a little bit better sound out
of so as you can see there are quite a
bit of different connections any
direction you like to go right here you
can see we have 7.1 analog outputs for
your surround sound system it is a
surround sound player as well obviously
being blu-ray the outputs from this I
found our exceptionally great if you do
unless you have a very very high end
processor I would suggest connecting
your analog outputs directly from the
unit into your amplifier and instead of
going through the HDMI output here you
will get it usually get a much better
sound doing it so you look here this is
what this is kind of what makes this
unit very special for a stereo listener
it has dedicated stereo analog outputs
located here and as you can see it has
both the unbalanced and the balanced
connections there's also a separate DAC
chip just for these outputs separated
from these so there's a 1 - chip as ESS
saber DAC for this and for these outputs
the other feature that this player has
that a lot of other ones don't which is
very nice is the digital audio inputs
here these are not outputs these are
actually inputs where you can plug in a
computer coaxial or optical connection
into this to take advantage of that same
saber DAC that and I did test these
against this in the sound quality was
excellent very very good for connection
to a computer even when compared to some
of the other DAX that I used I was very
impressed
you may notice here that the HDMI
there's also two outputs so you can
connect it to two different TVs if you'd
like one of the things that's really
nice about this unit is that you can
plug in in outside video
source directly into this to take
advantage of the video processing that
this thing does in addition to be able
to take advantage of the audio so with
this one you can plug your TV feed or
what other feed you like into there and
you through an input selector it can
actually select whatever you want it's
almost like a processor at that point
because it has so many inputs and you
can try a lot of different things with
it to see what works best for you
obviously it connects wirelessly through
an adapter and wired to allow streaming
for Netflix and Vudu and a lot of other
kind of streaming it also does Pandora
for audio right now more firmware
updates should give it more options as
they become available
you can see here that the remote for the
Apple 105 is pretty much your standard
issue it's rather large not the smallest
thing no unique keyboard but it does
have as you can see near the top the
dedicated Netflix and Vudu button which
is kind of new that's fun probably one
of the most important buttons on this
thing is the input button here which is
fairly unique for a DVD player blu-ray
player because it allows you to run
through all the different inputs that
has be it HDMI for video these USB DAC
audio inputs coaxial even the ports in
the front so that is kind of an
important feature there mass accessible
through the remote the Android
application is mimics the actual remote
control pretty closely it works great
it's very quick and responsive I didn't
have any real issues here it would be
nice if there were a little bit more
file management for all the streaming
and playing services that the Oppo
offers but for right now I mean it
definitely works as a remote control
overall I found the Sun to be quite
comparable to the 95 and that may be
because the DAC chip is the same as last
year
I think that Oppo did a great job with
this
9 to 2 really keep the noise floor down
and keep it clarity up the player still
remains to be one of my favorites in
this price range and one of my favorites
overall to be honest with you I really
enjoyed the sound that comes out of this
one it's very organic and live it's one
of those players where you can just sit
back and listen to the music and enjoy
it's one of the few blu-ray players out
there available at this price point with
really the feature set that it has a lot
of the higher-end stuff gets expects
potentially more pricey however at $1200
while that may seem like a lot of money
the sound that you get from it is is
right up there in that range I really
enjoy it's very clear the DAX performed
exceptionally well playing a CD and by
themselves when you run them through the
USB deck I mean that's quite unique
functionality wise everything is in
working order it just the quality in the
build of this thing showcases a lot of
attention to detail from the build in
the front to the suspension of the unit
itself there's you can tell when you set
it down there's vibration reduction and
a suspension system through the feet
it's a very well-built piece of machine
it is quite hefty and large it's rather
big compared to most of your standard
blu-ray players but it is a solid piece
of machinery and and I and I think
there's a good amount of craftsmanship
that went into building it so that is
very nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
