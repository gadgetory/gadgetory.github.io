audio head here we have the new Auto Z's
LCD three flagship headphone these guys
have really burst onto the scene
recently with a LCD - and now the LCD 3
I'm going to give you an unboxing and a
quick review at the end here so I can
show you guys you know really what we
got going on with this package it comes
with this excellent um Travel this is
the travel case version there's also a
wooden box that is very svelte it has a
nice wooden outside exterior with a silk
interior more for presentations but this
one if you're traveling is really the
way to go the build quality is
outstanding on this box it's got a
little bit of weight to it you feel safe
with your treasure inside so to speak so
I turn this around open it up for you
guys you can see here you can also lock
it with a lock if you're so inclined
open it up you can see there's a nice
soft foam padding there some of the
accessories is really where these
headphones shines you can always get
aftermarket cables you can see here from
the removable cable which is a very nice
touch solid connectors but it does come
with both an unbalanced connection and
also a balanced connection here
that is a four pin stereo if you can see
that clearly which is pretty darn nice
if you don't want to throw it out an
extra change you have your balance
connection all ready to go considering
some of the prices of the aftermarket
cables you know that's a it's a pretty
good thing to have included as you can
see from the headphones here more
padding in the case they come with a
divider here so these ear pads don't get
squished and transportation so it comes
with a some oil for the pads and this
cloth as well they are completely
interchangeable very easily they just
click in and out right here I can show
you the most solid
you can see here the lambskin cushions
very nice in the full review on the
website I go into more detail but I'll
tell you these things are super duper
nice on the ears very comfortable as far
as just feel and overall I guess you
could say firmness is great and this is
wood here excellent build quality all
around you can kind of see from here my
hands that this is a driver itself is
quite a bit bigger than some of the
other ones but this is the planer
magnetic technology that makes the
headphone sound so sweet
um clamping pressure inward this way is
moderate but due to these and I think
the overall shape it does feel like much
less than that that I wouldn't say that
the pressure coming in this way is all
too unbearable by any means the other
the other thing with these headphones is
that the due to the size of these
drivers and the technology of all the
weight downward is a bit more than
you're usually used to on a headphone so
the overall weight is high but the
clamping force is not so bad they have
your typical
well I guess not so typical in this case
but adjustments this way all the clicks
are good
everything is very solid to the touch
which is nice the other thing that these
headphones come with is some literature
here warranty documents literature this
is kind of neat and unique to audas
Auto Z the LCD III s they come with a
unique graph to each headphone so they
measure this specific headphone here and
this is the frequency response curve for
this headphone and you as you can see
here
This Is It this is excellent I mean
normally you see this kind of drop-off
for a lot of headphones and this is this
base is just phenomenal so this is a
this is really good measurement and you
can see from some of the other resources
online too that these headphones tend to
be one of the best measuring out there
and it is reflected in their son they're
just amazingly clear coherent you can
really tell
um bit rates we really start to make
them so they're not that they're not
super forgiving in that regard like if
you want to have pull the best from
these you're really going to need to
have a good source good amplifiers they
will run right out of an iPod not
extremely loud but they can they're not
to the point where they're really really
hard to drive I would say there's like
moderate powers needed to drive them but
as far as clarity in the top-end amazing
very liquid mids which is really nice
but where they really Sparkle is is the
base the base on these is unlike
anything I've ever heard clear extended
very very low and just very pleasant and
not a lot of all the reviews to this but
I feel like it's a very natural sounding
bass a lot of times bass can get really
bloated big you just can some very
unnatural DS it sounds like you're it's
like a step closer to listening to
speakers they're not it's not like
exactly like listening Spears I don't
think that's physically possible giving
just the very nature of headphones but
when it comes to like speaker to like
presentation these keys are starting to
get a little bit closer to that and and
that is just an astounding leap I really
gives you a great sensation of natural
even sound across the field
nothing is overextended
nothing is over emphasized but base
extension bass trouble through both ends
of the spectrum going out are just
amazing clarity is amazing um and by my
measure and I've heard some of the top
top systems out there these are one of
the best if not the best headphones out
there available right now which is
pretty amazing say one of the downfalls
is they do carry a similar price tag to
being the best they run around
I think 1949 I'm not $19 1945 $45 for
this pair of headphones but oh my
goodness if you got the money to spare
it's definitely one of those things you
need to check out because they're quite
a unique thing so I've been saying for
these guys have come out with some
really great stuff in a really short
time period so I can't see where they
come out with next but as for right now
this is one of the best because of any
questions feel free to leave a comment
in the comment sections visit the
website WWE and we're on Facebook so
talk to you guys later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
