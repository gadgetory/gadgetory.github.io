powerful flagship smartphones the HTC 10
and the Galaxy s7 edge we're going to
start off by filming in 4k drop down to
1080p and then finish off with the
front-facing cameras and slow motion I
haven't both set up in this little rig
to keep them both equally stabilized
while I am filming let's get started so
right now I'm filming in 4k resolution
at 30 frames a second on each camera
things to look out for are the image
stabilization as well as the color
quality both cameras have the OIS image
stabilizing active right now at 4k so
the image should be relatively stable as
I'm walking
cellphones usually have a pretty hard
time finding definitions in clouds we're
going to go up to the sky here and drop
it back down to the ground
back up to the sky again still recording
in 4k I'll have a poll question at the
end of this video so you can answer and
tell me which one you think looks better
remember every screen is a little bit
different so watching this video on an
iPhone will be different than watching
this video on a Samsung one has an LCD
display the other one has an AMOLED
display which displays the colors a
little bit differently so now I'm
filming in 1080p walking down this trail
both cameras still have the OIS image
stabilizing but the Samsung Galaxy s7
also has something called a is which is
electronic image stabilization on top of
the OIS which is the optical image
stabilization so it should be a lot more
stable than the HTC 10
but it also might have more of a warp
stabiliser effect which distorts the
image a little bit from that electronic
image stabilizing so now we're filming
with the front-facing cameras there are
some differences between the two the
Samsung Galaxy s7 can film in quad HD so
the image is going to be a little bit
bigger than the HTC 10 but the HTC 10
has something called
OAS image stabilizing on the
front-facing camera which is a
world-first for a smart phone the first
smartphone in the world that has the
optical image stabilization on the front
facing camera so the image is going to
be more stable than it is on the galaxy
s7 theoretically if the specs work out
like they're supposed to so as I'm
walking pay attention to the color
quality and the image stabilizing on
each camera and since I have you here
let me rant for just one quick second
the HTC 10 has something called high res
audio but when you turn on this high res
audio it actually changed what format
the video is being recorded in it'll
drop the file as a dot MKV file which is
fine it'll play great on your phone and
on your computer but if you ever plan on
editing it in Adobe Premiere or any
other software that edits video is going
to struggle considerably Adobe Premiere
won't even accept that file format so if
you're a vlogger and you're planning on
using this awesome
OAS image stabilizing front-facing
camera make sure that your high res
audio is turned off
that'll make it so that the phone will
output in an mp4 instead of the dot MKV
and you'll be able to use your footage
I'll do a little walking with the
front-facing camera
so I switch back to ultra-high
definition this is 4k footage you can
also make the video fullscreen so you
can see a little better do some close-up
shots of these rocks still in 4k
check out the image color in the image
detail so for the slow-motion both
phones are actually going to be in 720p
the HTC ten will be filming in 120
frames per second the galaxy s7 edge
will be filming in 240 frames per second
so there's twice as many frames on the
galaxy to work with so the slow motion
will be twice as slow and twice as cool
the galaxy s7 definitely wins in the
slow-motion department so I'm going to
include a poll question right here in
the corner which phone do you think did
better in this test there's so many
variables when it comes to smartphone
cameras but you have to pick and then
leave down in the comments below why you
think that phone did better I did
durability tests on both the HTC 10 and
the galaxy s7 edge I will link both
those videos here so you can watch those
if you're interested thanks ton for
watching hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
