feature-rich flagships of 2017 with so
many smartphone manufacturers dropping
useful components it's nice to finally
get my hands on something with all the
bells and whistles this is the retail
version of the foam that I purchased
myself here locally and it's time to see
if the LGB 30 is durable
now you might have forgotten about this
phone since it was announced seven weeks
ago and only now becoming available to
purchase
let's hope it's worth the wait the
scratch test is first Frederic Mohs
designed this scratch test back in 1812
to differentiate between different
minerals the six inch display is covered
in Gorilla Glass five plastic wood
scratched at a level three pure sapphire
would scratch at level eight or nine so
in the screen of the LGV 30 scratches at
a six or seven it's to be expected the
iPhone 8 and the Samsung Note 8 both
scored the same down at the bottom of
the phone there is no home button it's
located around the back of the phone due
to most of the front surface area being
dedicated to the screen which I am a fan
of the closer we get to screens filling
up the entire front of the phone the
better up at the top of the phone we
have the front facing five megapixel
camera under that same Gorilla Glass 5
so no damage to the lens will be
happening here the earpiece which
actually doubles as a microphone when
recording video and loud environments is
recessed pretty far into the phone body
the grill is metal which is good but
that recess is the perfect spot for dust
and dirt to collect speakers are
magnetic as well so if you work around
metal shavings like an auto mechanic
welder or bank robber metal shavings are
attracted to that speaker magnet and
could get inside shredding that speaker
cone blowing the speaker so having a
metal grille with small vent holes is a
good thing for people with physical jobs
but it would be easier to keep clean if
that grille was more flush with the
surface of the glass like on the iPhones
or the Samsung's instead of a gaping
hole on the back of the phone we have
the glass covering that wireless
charging the LG logo at the bottom is
recessed under the glass so no
scratching it off down here same with
the v30 logo in the center of the phone
it's also under the glass and will never
rub off or get damaged ever one thing
that can be damaged though is the
fingerprint scanner some fingerprint
scanners are unscratched like on the
iPhone or the oneplus 5 but this one can
be damaged it's pretty safe to say that
with normal use the fingerprint scanner
will never get this scuffed up but it's
also unfortunate that after the abuse
the scanner is unable to read my
fingerprint anymore constantly
displaying the sensor needs to be
cleaned and also for the record most
other phones survive this say
level of abuse and still function just
something to keep in mind
don't let the scanner get scratched
it'll still work as a button of course
just not a fingerprint scanner
I went incredibly in-depth on this dual
camera setup during my LGV 30 tear down
video popping open the camera unit
itself to look at the pretty incredible
ten bit image sensor I'll link that
video in the description if you want to
see this phone reviewed from the inside
it is good to know though that the
exterior of the camera is protected from
scratching no plastic to be found even
the frame around the lens is metal
continuing our search for premium
materials brings us to the sides of the
phone and judging by the sound of my
razor blade we're looking at pure metal
the nice thing is that it's not painted
metal either so any scratches or drops
will just expose more silver the same
color
keeping this visible damage to a minimum
the volume buttons are also made for
metal and up here at the top of the
phone next to the headphone jack this
solid nut the antenna bands are plastic
but that's normal along the sides of the
phone we have our SIM and expandable
memory tray I do like how LG kept things
simple and didn't force any extra
unwanted buttons on us like Samsung did
with Bixby
I wouldn't be opposed if there was an
extra programmable button along the side
as long as we get to choose what it does
like activate the camera or mute button
or maybe a more useful voice assistant
the bottom of the phone is metal we have
the loudspeaker holes and the USB C port
all of which are water-resistant jumping
back to the 6-inch 1440p OLED display we
find that 10 seconds from my orange
lighter were enough to permanently
damage the pixels which turned white and
never recovered personally I do prefer
LED displays over LCD displays the
absolute blacks make videos look super
good so I'll forgive the non reviving
pixels it's also pretty safe to say that
I'm probably the only one on the planet
dealing with flame damage the LG v 30 is
ip68 water-resistant the same level at
the Samsung Note 8 and one step above
the iPhone 8 all of which were released
this year during the structural Ben test
we checked the frame of the phone for
weak spots as well as checking to see if
the Flex compromises the waterproofing
adhesive around the edge of the glass
panel there is a very minor flex to the
phone when Ben
from either side but there is no
separation of either slap of glass the
adhesive holds it tight and the phone
remains structurally sound surviving the
bin test no matter what side the phone
is flexed from this is a solid premium
feeling phone on every single surface
I'll give LG a thumbs up for this one
while Apple Google essential and
sometimes Motorola are pulling useful
features from their flagships
LG is still here alongside Samsung
cramming every useful thing they
possibly can into the phone while
keeping a solid durable build this is
daily driver material for sure check out
my teardown of the LG v xxx you haven't
already
the aerial shots I got of New York City
while using the rear camera are pretty
impressive come hang out with me on
Twitter and Instagram and thanks a ton
for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
