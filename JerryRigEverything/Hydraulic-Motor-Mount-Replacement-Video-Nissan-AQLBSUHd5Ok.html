that the Indian mountain makes so as
we're accelerating it doesn't make any
noise I'm but as soon as we let off the
gas
kind of makes that rattling noise up in
the front there that's because when
we're accelerating the engines putting
out enough torque to kind of keep it in
the same spot but as soon as we let off
the gas
it loses all the torque it has and so it
starts to rattle around inside that
mountain so you can kind of hear that
alright so today we're going to place an
engine amount on a 2000 Nissan Altima
the engine mount itself is right here
this yeah you can kind of see that it is
torn up on the inside it's a hydraulic
mount so it's not all solid rubber in
there it's a rubber with a pressurized
hydraulic fluid inside and it's been
rattling around so what I've done so far
is I took a jack and I just supported
the engine just a little bit just enough
to raise it up so when I take that mount
off there's not a whole lot of pressure
on it and then I can raise and lower the
motor just a tiny bit to line it up when
I get the new mount back on there so we
had three bolts we had two right here
and then one right underneath there and
I was able to get that one right here by
the alternator I just had to get one of
these long wrenches and just kind of
sneak it in there and wrench it out
little by little I figure that's a lot
easier than taking the alternator off
then there's so those three right there
and then there's one long bolt this guy
right here that goes through the mount
itself now there's a nut on one end
other bolt 14 millimeters as well anyway
that's the only thing holding the mount
in there see how easy it is to take out
now that I have the engine lift it up
just a little bit you can see the inside
of the mounts completely just shredded
bits
so all the hydraulic fluid used to the
inside of that and I forgot the new
mount right here so I'm going to put
this little black box on top of the new
mount right here and then just slip it
in and kind of bolt everything back into
place again and drop the engine so
there's one more look at what the good
mount looks like got the box mounted to
the top this one was 100 bucks at my
local auto place I'll Riley I'm pretty
sure you can get them cheaper off Amazon
though so I'll post a link at the bottom
of the video for that and there you have
it everything is all torqued down I
believe these bolts should be around
4045 same thing with this bottom one
just make sure it's super tight it's not
high yeah just make sure it's super
tight anyway that's about it make sure
