the tread on this one's a whole lot
they're in the other one
now we're going to put on the final
drive I'm just kind of just pop it back
in place I did grease up these these
gears just a little bit I'm just kind of
wiped off the old degrees threw on some
new ones
it's belt we're at right now make sure
you toss some grease on the axle as well
so as far as getting the wheel back up
into place it's kind of a little dance
you have to do to make sure everything
lines up right I'm the first thing I do
is I make sure this the shaft right here
is lined up with this old and it cut
you know Ang's that angles that way once
that's in place here on this side you
have to make sure that this is lined up
correctly so it slips up over this notch
then the caliper goes on and connects to
this and once those are in place then
you can start to angle the splines of
that shaft on the other side into the
engine itself and how you get it it's
like exactly you saw on the other end of
the splines there's kind of like little
teeth to have to mesh in with the the
other part of it so you kind of spin the
engine out sorry you spin the wheel
which turns that shaft right there which
makes it so the splines line up so you
kinda have to lift up twist it and push
it in all the same time anyway so that's
a that's the dance you have to do and
now I'm just kind of putting out the
bowls by hand making sure up everything
lines up right and then once all the
bolts are in and the tires in the right
position I'll tighten them all down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
