released moto G fives the G Series is
Motorola's less expensive smart phone
line but as we found over the years
price is not an indicator of durability
pulling it out of the box the phone felt
extremely light and I feared greatly for
the safety of this phone
shortly afterwards though I realized
that the g5 has a removable battery that
needed to be put inside the phone forced
this doesn't happen as often anymore
with most manufacturers sealing
everything shut these days this was a
welcome change with the battery actually
inside the phone and the weight of the
device restored let's get started
as always scratch test first the
hardness level gives a general idea of
how scratch-resistant the screen is
going to be the majority of smartphones
have tempered glass which means it
scratches at level 6 some phones like
the honor 6x have some kind of weird
weaker hybrid glass and there are phones
with plastic screens and Sapphire
screens but this moto g5 scratches at a
level 6 which is where the majority of
all flagship phones are at so we're off
to a good start
the fingerprint scanner has a thin
rubber coating over the top of the pad
it's not a button just a touch pad with
normal wear and tear I think the rubber
coating will keep away most cosmetic
scratches but even with the deeper more
harmful gouges the fingerprint scanner
continues to read and function like
normal another success for Motorola
not every phone survives this one the 5
megapixel front facing camera is
protected by that same tempered glass
that covers the screen so no worries
about that scratching my razor blade
does no damage if we move over to the
earpiece lot it has a thin piece of
vinyl covering the speaker but it won't
pull out with my tweezers so I doubt
it'll ever fall out on its own like some
of the older iPhone 4 is used to do but
if it ever gets dirty you have to be
super careful while cleaning it out now
motorola has advertised this g5 as their
first G Series phone with metal built in
pitchers can be deceiving and an
advertisement is welds an advertisement
but my razor blade only tells the truth
the razor blade of truth is currently
telling us that the bottom section of
the removable back panel is made of
plastic the whole area surrounding the
microUSB slot is plastic up at the top
next to the headphone jack which always
gets bonus points for me is also made of
plastic the only part that appears to be
metal is the centre back segment of the
phone now one of the reasons I started
this YouTube channel five years ago was
because the best and most
environmentally friendly way to recycle
a cell phone is to just keep it alive
and useful as long as possible
and to make a long-lasting phone
manufacturers need to make them durable
the note 7 was an incredible
environmental Fiasco one of the many
ways to help the environment it's not
throwaway useful things especially
broken cell phones they are usually
worth money and someone somewhere can
fix them and keep them circulating never
throw away a cell phone always recycle
it hopefully my channel is helped with
that long story short the center back
panel is metal the camera lens is
scratch resistant glass just like it
should be it doesn't look like Motorola
has cut any corners so far so let's keep
going
the sides of the phone are made from
plastic even the power and volume
buttons are made of plastic so I
wouldn't get too excited about this
being an all metal device the majority
of the surface area is plastic speaking
of heat my lighter tells us that the
screen is AMOLED or LCD and by the heat
killing the pixels temporarily turning
on black we know it's an LCD it did last
about 15 seconds before reacting though
and that's pretty good an AMOLED screen
like most Samsung phones have would turn
white and not recover like this LCD
screen just did now the ultimate test of
structural integrity and durability is
the bin test pressing from the back of
the phone the screen does protrude quite
prominently out of the removable rear
panel but it does not shatter or break
this phone is still functional at this
point when pushing from the screen side
there is less flex to the phone and this
inexpensive device for Motorola does not
kick the bucket the screen did stop
functioning for a brief second but it's
simple turning it off and back on again
fix that issue since the majority of the
phone is plastic no permanent damage was
done during the bin test it is not stuck
bent out of shape like the HTC u ultra
that costs four times as much the Moto G
5 passes my durability test it might not
have the premium feel of a more
expensive phone but it is a device that
can physically stand the test of time
and having a removable battery will help
extend the life of this phone far into
the future
since batteries are you - the first
thing in cell phones to die of natural
causes I'll be reviewing this phone from
the inside with a repair video in the
very near future so if you love or pair
ability
sustainability or just seeing technology
from the inside you're in the right spot
thanks for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
