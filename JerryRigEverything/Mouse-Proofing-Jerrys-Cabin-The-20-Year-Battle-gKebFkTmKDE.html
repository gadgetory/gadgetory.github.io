jerry-rigged everything most people
assume that my name is Jerry but it's
not it's Zach Jerry my grandpa built
this cabin right here and this cabin
right here has a 20 year old mouse
problem not that the mouse is 20 years
old but the mice have been there for 20
years
Jerry was really good at Jerry rigging
things and he didn't always use the most
kosher construction practices so this
cabin has a lot of reclaimed wood in it
and the mouse problem could be
relatively small but it's probably going
to be pretty big that mice have been in
there for a very long time and they're
very comfortable but this week we set it
aside and we are going to vanquish this
mouse problem so if you're squeamish
about dead animals or dirty places this
probably won't be the video that you
want to watch I hope we're successful
because this cabin is pretty awesome I
say we are glad we work
a Sammy a cabana we look back right now
we just removed the toilet we have some
holes here in the corner where the mice
have been getting in and then right here
you can see like a bunch of dirt and
grass and stuff where they've been
coming through the drywall check out the
toilet stuck in the shower then on this
side we have some more holes in the wall
where the mice have been getting in so
we have to rip out this wall and see
what the damage is inside of there as
well once you started wearing our proper
safety gear we're going to lift out the
carpet around this bottom area so as I'm
lifting out the carpet we got the dead
remains of the mouse right here just
died between the cement and the foam
padding probably get out of the hole or
something we get Mouse fur and mouse
gets all up inside of this cabinet and
then you got Mouse poop everywhere else
all right we're taking out the wall
behind the toilet and this is what we
found
right here this cute little guy with its
last moments if you follow right here to
this pipe we have a whole nest
coming up where the price comes into the
house because it doesn't look like
there's anything every time that just
ready here now we know cut this piece
out by the shower here so there's impede
installation all the way through here
they're just tearing it out there's no
insulation just let's be insulation
right yeah they hate it yeah and you can
tell they're coming in back there is
this the outside wall yeah we've got
plants growing up in here so what we're
thinking right now so this is the shower
we're thinking they're coming up through
the drain right here and then going into
this part of the wall and eating away
the insulation we also went up here to
the top side of the shower and right
here you can see there's mouse crap
everywhere and we can see they're going
up into the ceiling a little bit
probably through that little hole right
there because the drywall little bit
pretty tight up against those those
boards if that holds the perfect size
for a mouse I think we'll find out after
we get the shower out of here
top part kid so we got the shower out
and we found out where all the mice are
getting in there right down here that
foundation is just pretty much gone so
the reason up from the drain or most
likely they're coming in from the
outside over there and they're making
their little homes in here
looks like they've eaten out all of the
insulation over here on this side all
the way up they've eaten the insulation
here and are going up into the ceiling
see all those little black dots those
are not supposed to be there so yeah you
bet we look a semi-active bad we look
tell me how to do it and I do feeling my
ambition like a filling up a pool
ain't my choice but it's up to me to
choose him around my goals like a
working mama tools on the same pace like
yes as a mouse Hotel Mouse go in because
there's bait inside so they go in
through this hole and then get stuck
inside of the hotel
we've had a little mouse problem over
the last couple years we can see the
problem
is that there's an actual literal gap in
the framing where you can see outside
that's where all the my Sega dad will
probably need steel wool for that Oh for
mouth wire no floor
we got the leak up in the ceiling I got
it worries not couldn't take me on my
ropes best foot for liquidation with a
broom we gonna stay grind until we all
make a move
are you gonna find a baby my way are we
gonna ground
Oh
we gonna give it time for never going to
either black or black but not brick are
you gonna find a babe in my way I'll be
gonna kinda I'll be go
go give it topic always we've made quite
a bit of progress we have the wall
ripped out on this far side to see where
the mice are coming in and it's
basically just one whole way out there
in the corner and I'll show you the
outside of the house in just a second
but up here we can see where the water
is coming in so we have for the chimney
there's like four inches above that
metal box where the water is coming in
and then it's running down that left
joist all the way down and that's where
you saw the big water mark over the
drywall right here so pulling off the
drywall was difficult we didn't know
what direction they were going to run
but patching it should be relatively
easy once we get a joist or a stud in a
straight line and then we can just put
the drywall into place so now we'll
assess the damages and see what we want
to do with it I say we have bad we lack
a semi-active and we work
we were he look I say we and God we were
so the reason we're wearing these masks
is because of one the mouse poop but to
this fiberglass insulation right there
this paint stuff isn't good to breathe
in and there's also a bunch of mold and
stuff from the water damage in the other
room so we're making sure we're not
breathing in any harmful chemicals you
want to wear it gloves as well because
the pink stuff the fiberglass you get
into your skin and it's really
irritating
so we've cleaned out the drywall and
insulation from behind the shower and it
looks like the biggest mouse problem was
right here in the concrete so when my
grandpa built this from day one they
decided to add another drain to it and
so this drain this hole in the floor
it's been here since day number one and
you can see it out in that far corner
there is even daylight coming through
that hole so the mice have had an open
passageway this whole time so we're
going to do it now we're going to clean
out all the dirt from right here level
it out and then stick new concrete and
fill this hole up only we never loose
cuz the only thing we ever shared be the
truth be the fire till it's burning down
the roof focused on your heart cuz the
fields be the proof pigs my soul
lighting not like a fuse always down to
share never that's our food sugar to the
wheel like a despot cruel ahead in the
world baby that's our school
my way are we gonna grind Holly
we go give it up and never go away so
they need a black lab this part
basically I'm just smoothing it out and
shaking a little bit to get it all up
inside the cracks and to get the bigger
rocks down to the bottom now give us a
smooth surface on top when we finally
get this other layer on top click at the
second bag on here's where we just did a
submit part of it so over here in the
corner we can see a little hole where
the mice have been coming in so lucky
for us we're going to put some steel
wool around the outside some wire great
but mice don't like to eat steel wool
for obvious reasons it's a made of metal
so we're going to put some silicone
caulk all around the inside and then
stuff it with steel wool and then put
some steel wool around the outside wood
as well so the steel wool from the
outside is going to do most of the
protecting but the steel wool on the
inside is going to ensure that nothing
else comes through this hole and we'll
staple it down as well to make sure that
no Hercules mites can slip through all
right so we have a steel wool in there
and a bunch of silicon caulk that's kind
of holding it in place so here on the
edge of the house I can see a little bit
of a hole right here and on the inside
that goes into the cabin so we need to
put a bunch of steel wool and stuff in
here and caulk that up so this is the
inside of the hole we just previously
looked at from the outside so I'm going
to fill that up with steel wool and
silicon caulk and hope for the best all
right now I got the whole crack full
with steel wool silicon caulk down in
there and I can spread it around and put
it all over the steel wool the nice
thing about silicon is that it helps it
once it's all dried it'll help it stay
in place and it's not very tasty so the
mice won't eat it but these are the same
my sweet fiberglass insulation so they
might like it I don't even know so
here's our precarious ladder situation
going up to the roof once I get up there
we'll take a look and analyze and see
where the water is coming in through the
chimney okay so I'm up here now we can
see that people have tried to fix this
already but it looks like they used some
inferior called
so when this gets really hot in the
summer it shrivels up so you can see
right around here this nail on the
caulking from below I got this section
so while the right here is
shriveled up and it's just not working
at all anymore so I'm hoping that's the
issue I'm gonna pull off all of this
dead stuff and then we'll put some new
high-temperature rated caulk on top of
it but I'm hoping that this sealer the
ultimate sealer is going to hold a
little bit better it's rated at 300
degrees and that should be enough
temperature-wise
I don't think this roof will get much
hotter than that so now I'm just going
to smooth it out and make sure that
these joints right here is when the
water runs down these channels is going
to go right there underneath and then
down the chimney so as long as I have
done this excessively I shouldn't have
any issues and I'll make sure to keep
these channels pretty deep
let us some thick stuff all right so we
have a ridiculous amount of caulk on
there right now hopefully that will keep
it watertight it's not a professional
job but we're just here to jerry-rig the
thing that should keep all the snow and
water out of there so I just move this
wood box away from this wall over here
and there's a whole dead bird right up
against the wall it was kind of like
just disintegrating itself pretty
feathers though we should probably use
this cabin more often I remember when I
was little kid working with my grandpa
to make this ladder we would cut out the
holes right here and I had no idea what
he was making at the time because it
just didn't make sense to me when it was
laying on the ground but then when we
came and installed it here for the loft
turned out pretty well a salient
we were azalea when we were ready we
weren't we
here's a new creative mousetrap this one
might crawl up the little wooden plank
and then on this soda can there are two
little X's that you put peanut butter on
and so the mice will jump onto the
peanut butter and the candle spin and
they will fall in and die you can put
water in the bottom so that they'll
drown or you can just leave them in
there and they'll be cut so we're on to
the drywall right now this is one of the
test walls we cut to make sure there's
no mice living in this wall and this
side of the house is pretty fine so I
went through and I measured this I cut
out to this other stud too so there's
two points of attachment on either side
and then here is the piece of drywall so
drywall has like a little bit of a taper
on one end so it's like a slightly
thicker here and then a little bit less
thick here and you want to use this
taper whenever possible because it makes
the mudding easier which you'll see in
just a second cutting drywall is
actually extremely easy so I have this
knife right here that I'm going to do it
the short side and that just cuts
through very easily all the way through
it's very serrated and on this long side
I'm going to use my razor blade to score
the paper all along this bottom edge and
then just snap it off and it'll cut
cleanly you want to score the side
that's going to be facing the room
because the backside this brown paper is
going to tear a little bit so let's give
it a shot and then we'll just pop the
puzzle piece into the hole that we cut
and we'll go from there
one thing my grandpa taught me is to use
the whole length of the saw blade so
when you're cutting through it let the
saw do the work instead of you do the
work tools so what they make for so
since this hole was cut kind of Squam
pits in the first place and we're doing
a patch job I just scored it one more
time to cut it to length and you can
just sense it scored the paper will just
break off without actually damaging the
part that's going to be visible because
if you have a bunch of frayed paper it's
going to be a lot harder to put the mud
on and paint later so now we have the
unfinished unpainted drywall in place
little gaps like this aren't a big deal
and I'll show you why in just a second
as we mud it because that's going to be
all covered up when you're doing this
try to hit as many studs as possible
there's a stud here and a stud here and
so this is going to be pretty solid so
if this was a new house we'd be using
the normal drywall tape that just sits
over the top of this and is a lot
smoother but since this is a patch job
we're using this kind of drywall tape
basically it sits over the crack and
lets the drywall mud seep through into
the crack filling the hole and then
making it smoother overall this holds
the mud in place a little bit better
all right so the first coat of mud is on
right now it's mostly just filling in
all the gaps on the uneven ledge between
the one piece and the other piece and so
you can still see the tape a little bit
but when I go back through and sand
these ridges and then put one more coat
of mud over the top of it it'll hide the
tape completely and then we'll be able
to blend it more and we paint the whole
wall so we'll let this dry you can see
this part right here is drying and when
it all turns white we're ready to sand
it and put on that second coat I say
here's a furry little mouth friend that
we have making a little bit up here in
the insulation get rid of his body so
one of the entry points for the mice is
right in between the foundation layer
and then the wood right on top of it is
a little bit of a gap there
so we've taken is we have some wire
grate that has 1/4 inch holes in it that
mice can't fit through and we've taken
some adhesive and there's two of these
cement and then we've just angled it
into the wood so now that gap is
off-limits to the mice
so we're three days into it and we think
that we have everything figured out and
solidified and we come around to the
back of the house as we're wrapping that
metal grate around it and this is what
we find so we have the side of the house
over there and we have the highway of my
schooling inside of the house that looks
like
they have a nest right there and it
looks like it goes farther over there as
well so we realize is that this whole
cabin has been made out of reclaimed
wood so when my grandpa put this plywood
in it already had a hole nibbled out by
mice and then the mice here at this
cabin made it bigger so he knew that
hole was there so we stuck this piece of
wood to block it but the mice just went
around it same thing with this board
down here so that's where we're at
instead of ripping out all the interior
walls to pull to find the nest and pull
out the insulation we're just going to
cut a foot out from the bottom of these
pieces of plywood because these are the
pre mouse nibbled pieces of plywood that
my grandpa put down and then we'll take
a new piece of plywood put it in its
place put the mesh over the top of it
and that should be good after we've
cleaned it all out from the outside
so right now I'm going to cut a piece of
insulation for this hold right here
it's about a foot 9 inches the trick
with insulation is that it has to be
fully expanded to do the insulating so
you have to get the right dimensions for
us this is a 6-inch stud right here and
when you install you have to make sure
that it's all fluffed out and when you
cut it if you step on it and make it
flat you can cut it pretty easily all
the way through the insulation at one
time and the r21
gives it its insulation value how well
it is at retaining heat so I'm going to
cut it and we will install it I say we
have a ground we work
I see me acting better we look better we
work I said we better be like tell me
how to do it and I do feeling my
ambition like a filling up a pool
eat my choice but it's up to me to
choose him around my girls like I'm
working with my toes on the same page
like the headline knows even Jimmy
Fallon couldn't shake me on my ropes
best foot forward like we dancing with a
groove we don't stay grinding till we
all make a move I'm gonna find a baby
from my way are we gonna grind our don't
play we
time for never go away sitting either
black clapping I'd bring a baby my way
I'll be gonna burn out of a gold ring
you don't give it time and ever go away
sitting in the back of i-49 I say we I
find we work
I say we have an a we work
we work semi-active and we work kudamon
is one of the carpets that we have up in
the loft has just like a bunch little
games on it so you have like Chinese
checkers you have regular checkers you
have hopscotch you have all kinds of
games tic-tac-toe this is just up there
as for all the kids to play with all the
grandkids right now it's out here in the
Sun hopefully the Sun will kill all of
the bacteria and stuff on it and we can
keep using it so I'm doing all the
taping behind the stove all the tape is
up now I'm going to start the mudding
process and over here
my uncle has this all taped off and
drywalled this is from the hole on the
other side that we discovered underneath
the plywood on the exterior and down
this room this is where I have that
first wall muttered off so it's just one
layer right now we still got to sand it
down and refinish it make it a little
bit more seamless then here is the
bathroom where we did the cement plugged
up that hole and this hole this has a
bunch of calc and steel wool in it and
that should keep anything from coming up
and that is our view this is an old 36
caliber Stavanger he was likely used in
the silver war and it was found in a
privy behind a bar so is day number
three a pretty good day we finished a
lot of the drywall and the plugging of
the house we sealed the bottom of it
with that steel mesh the worst part of
the day is when we found the big holes
in the back but it turned out not to be
a big of his deal as we thought it was
yeah we still had to seal him but the
holes were already there from the wood
that my grandpa brought back from his
car wash so he reclaimed the wood and
reused it so the holes were already
there the nice just made them a little
bit bigger but they didn't like explore
into the house they just used that area
in between in between the walls so it
wasn't too bad we took out the plywood
put the new plywood in and then put a
lot of the wire mesh over the top of
that so we're pretty confident that
they're not going to get in
hopefully we only have one more day of
this all we have to do is finish the
second coat of mud kind of expand it out
so the seams aren't as noticeable and
then we'll paint it probably in the
spring once we verify and make sure that
there's no mouse problems anymore so
cross all your fingers we could only we
never Lowe's cuz the only thing we ever
say it be the truth you don't see the
fire till it's burning down the roof
focus on your heart because the fields
be the proof so stay for I finally have
all the carpet out of all the rooms and
we are doing the finishing touches on
the drywall so this is some drywall that
I just finished you see how the second
coat is a lot wider than the first coat
so the first coats mostly just to fill
it up and then you sand it all down and
then you do a wider coat so there's
still like a little Ridge right here if
you can see it but we'll sand that down
before we do the final painting drywall
mud is really easy to sand before we put
everything back together we're going to
make sure that the mice are completely
sealed out so we're going to leave
everything for the fall in the winter
because that's usually when the mice
come in and then next spring if there's
only like one or two mice we'll paint
everything and make it all like a nice
little cabin again but if there's 100 -
or 200 - then we will assess other
options
my cousin's mowing the lawn he's gonna
be out there a while
so we're pretty much done with the cabin
this is the middle of day four so we
pretty much worked four days on it day
three we had some time members come out
and help out with the construction
process and that helped out a ton
couldn't done it without them but I
think Jerry would be proud of what we've
done you know a couple things are
jerry-rigged but that's how he would
like it so we'll wait around till next
spring and see how bad the mouse problem
is then hopefully only one or two get
inside I mean we're in the middle of
nowhere so we can't expect the
impossible thanks so much for joining us
with this project it's a little bit
different than what we normally do on
this channel but I had a lot of fun and
I think Jared be proud of what we've
accomplished Topsy around I say we have
and we work a Sammy AK man we work say
we I bet we like a semi I bad we work
tell me how to do it and I do feeling my
ambition like a filling up a pool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
