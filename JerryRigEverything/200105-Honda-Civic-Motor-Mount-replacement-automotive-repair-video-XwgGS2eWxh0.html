engine press right up against the oil
pan there's not a lot of weight on that
jack because there's other motor mounts
that are holding up the majority of the
engine I just have the mount that we're
working with is the one right down in
there and so we want to support the
engine just enough so we when we take
that jack off the engine doesn't move up
or down and also the jack underneath the
engine will help us adjust it ever so
slightly to line the hole through the
center of the motor mount back up into
place again when we're trying to put
that big bolt through it right there you
can see that my wrench my ratchet is on
one side of that and I have this huge
ole of stinger bar that has given me all
the leverage I need as it sits on the
end of that ratchet so I can just click
this back and forth without having to
have my hand down there in that cramped
little space works out pretty well cool
thing is that this sits on that side of
the motor mount right down in there and
it's got this little tab that slides
down into a metal bracket so you
actually don't even need to hold a
wrench on this end the only thing you
need to be rationing is just this side
over here on the on the open side on the
right side there you go now you can see
where this one's broken
now what the motor mount does is its
rubber inside of there on the mount so
it kind of holds the engine in place
like it's the engine mount but it also
keeps the vibrations from shaking the
car and so if your mounts broken
obviously it's going to put more stress
on the other mounts which shakes your
car more damaging more things so I have
the new motor mount here I'm just going
to show you have the as I took the bolts
off the old one is put into the new one
um so these two bolts right here are
seventeen millimeter both of these are
17 millimeters remember you need a
ratchet from the right side as it's
mounted up inside of the onto the engine
just like that and then this top one in
the corner is actually a fourteen
millimeter that's the longest bolt so
now I'm going to set it back into place
you can see down in there that there's
actually nothing supporting the engine
onto the frame right now adjust that
Jack that I put underneath the engine
the jacks not holding very much weight
but it keeps the engine from sinking and
getting out of alignment with those two
little brackets the holes down there at
the bottom so now I'm going to toss the
new engine mount back into place got all
the bolts back into place they were
really hard to line up I don't know if
it was just the temperature difference
between the three different metals but
what I ended up doing is putting the
bolt in and then threading it in a
little bit just like probably you know
four or five full turns on each of the
bolts so they were the mount was still
loose against the engine and then after
those three bolts were in right on the
edge I tighten them in all the way and
then I put the center bolt through the
eye of the engine mount and that's what
worked out best for me but lining
everything up was the hardest part of
the whole operation I'll link the part
in the video description below I got
mine off the Amazon Amazon is usually
pretty cheap so check the video
description below for that anyway if you
