lg gram and it went pretty well but
there were a few suggestions a few
people wanted to know what the camera
lens was made out of it looks like it's
made out of plastic but since this isn't
like a portable in your pocket device I
don't think that's too big of an issue
another person wanted to know if the
charging port still worked which it does
you can see it charging here in the
corner surprising to me though with that
some of you said the drop test wasn't
violent enough so let's try it one more
time on some concrete stairs looks like
we got a little damage on the edges here
on the corner see if it still works and
it is still functioning
looks like we're still in one piece got
a small bend right there on the corner
but everything else still works that's
pretty impressive drop it down about
eight stairs there so now that I know
the laptop can survive a 200-pound guy
standing on it being dropped normally on
a carpeted floor and being dropped down
a flight of concrete steps let's take it
apart and see what's inside I'm curious
to see how big the battery actually is
inside of this thing
this laptop was given to me by LG two
durability tests and teardown which is
rather brave of them opening up the
laptop is actually pretty easy it needs
to be turned off first and then all the
Phillips head screws are hidden under
these little circular tabs and rubber
boots there are eight screws total even
without the screws in place the back is
still very solidly snapped into the
frame so it takes some pretty heavy
prime to remove it and look at the size
of that battery I'll talk more about
this in a second but it's a 60 watt hour
battery with an advertised lifespan of
17 hours pretty darn impressive for a
laptop it's got a copper heat pipe
system over the processor similar to
what we saw inside the LG G 6 except for
this one also has a fan attached to it
speaking of cool the ports are detached
from the motherboard and on a separate
PCB I'm as missing to help keep the
laptop super thin but it's also good for
repair ability if one of your ports
break you don't need a new motherboard
you can just swap out the less expensive
smaller boards we have two USB ports a
headphone jack and an micro SD card slot
on this side and on the far side we have
a charging port another USB port and
HDMI and a USB C port this laptop needs
0 dongles in order to be useful it's
ready to rock right out of the box
speaking of useful LG has upgradability
longevity and repair ability in mind
when designing this laptop the RAM is
modular if you were to buy an Apple
laptop this would be soldered on to the
large motherboard which is not
replaceable and not upgradable but with
this LG Graham in a few years when the
specs are outdated you can just plop in
a higher capacity Ram stick and continue
being productive same thing with the
hard drive this laptop comes with 512
gigabytes but a few years down the road
as games and video files keep increasing
in size
you might want to upgrade this em--to
slot allows for upgrading hard drives if
you were to buy a new macbook from apple
a few years from now you'll be left high
and dry with no upgradable hardware so
I'm super glad that LG is still looking
out for consumers thumbs up for that
onto the battery there are six screws
around the edge of this gigantic thing I
can unclip it from the motherboard and
the 60 watt hour battery comes loose it
looks like it has four separate
quadrants inside of it which is
interesting
looks like the touchpad is replaceable
and another cool thing I noticed when I
toss it down those concrete stairs
is that there are super strong magnets
in the base and the lid holding it
together since this laptop is so
lightweight
the magnets make sure that the lid
doesn't fall open on accident and lastly
if your screen does break somehow the
hinge connectors are here along with the
attachment to the motherboard the what's
inside YouTube channel drop one of these
laptops from 25 feet on the concrete and
it still lived so a broken screen is
going to be pretty rare I'll clip that
battery back in with its six screws and
then that back panel made from the
special nano carbon magnesium alloy
snaps into place with eight screws for
extra security
overall this laptop is a solid and
durable build with ports and replaceable
components so it gets a thumbs-up for me
as with all electronics the price is
always changing so I'll add a link in
the video description for the most
current up-to-date pricing on this
laptop huge thanks to LG for sending me
this one to review and let me know in
the comments which laptop you want to
see me review next
thanks ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
