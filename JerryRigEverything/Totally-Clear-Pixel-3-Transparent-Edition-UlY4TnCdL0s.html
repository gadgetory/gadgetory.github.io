get bored of making transparent phone
videos
no no I do not
in front of me today we have a brand new
no not CH regular-sized pixel 3 and it's
time to make things transparent Google's
unique two-tone glass design feels
smooth and velvety to the touch but acts
like a chalkboard when it comes to
scratching I want to see what this pixel
3 looks like when we remove all the
color from underneath the back frosted
glass panel
no glass phone is safe he does a good
job of softening the ip68 watertight
adhesive under the glass and then a
suction cup razor blade combination
lifts up and penetrates simultaneously
slicing through the adhesive to release
the glass from the frame glued shut
phones are a bit harder to work on but
not impossible
after the initial slice all warm things
back up and tell it's just barely too
hot to touch and continue slicing around
the edges with my razor blade taking
special care around that left side
because that's where the fingerprint
scanner cable resides there's about 4
billion things that can get damaged or
punctured in here so I should probably
tell you to not attempt this project on
your own as the back lifts up we get our
first peek inside and I can already tell
this is going to be a good one take a
look at the copper coiling the larger
portion dead center on the phone is for
the wireless charging and the top
portion is for the near-field
communication or NFC with a few extra
orange accents around the 2900 milliamp
power battery Google is looking good
from the inside and that's without even
trying there are two silver screws
holding one little plastic bracket
covering the fingerprint scanner ribbon
cable I'll unscrew those and set the
black plastic bracket off to the side
then I'll unclip the ribbon cable like a
little Lego with a plastic pry tool the
fingerprint scanner is adhered to the
glass with the same waterproof adhesive
we found around the edges of the glass
panel the camera lens is a super simple
square also adhered with the same black
adhesive the dual LED flash diffuser is
a tiny clear piece of plastic with the
smidgen of clear adhesive holding it to
the glass now every clear glass phone is
a bit different when it comes to
coloring some laminates pull off easy in
a few seconds leaving the glass clean
and pristine other colors are made up
from super gunky hard to remove adhesive
that requires industrial-strength paint
remover to dissolve but the Google pixel
three is more of a
record scratch off type of coloring yeah
we might be here awhile but at least we
don't need to bust out the heavy
chemicals
we'll just keep scratching and
scratching and scratching kinda
monotonous really but slow and steady
wins the race we are working with glass
so being gentle is important
it's projects like these that allow for
deep introspection being alone with your
own ideas deeply lost in the caverns of
your own mind nothing is more beautiful
than the sound of your thoughts and then
your brain brings up that one
embarrassing thing you did years ago
that nobody else cares about and the
subtle anxiety takes over thinking is
dangerous the hardest part of the color
removal is around the edges of the glass
there's a gentle curve around all four
sides making it hard for my flat razor
blade to reach but after about 45
minutes worth of perseverance and gentle
scraping we finally get a solid look at
what the difference is between the clear
and the frosted portions of the glass
pretty cool I got a feeling that this
pixel three might be one of the coolest
transparent phones I've ever made after
the last bit of tedious color removal
around the fragile glass corners of the
back panel the phone is clear and I
still have all my fingers thumbs up for
that a little bit of glue gone and glass
cleaner clears up any residue and
fingerprints and I'll dust up the white
pixels snowstorm I created and remove
any leftover black adhesive on the phone
body to make sure it looks clean from
the inside it's starting to look pretty
awesome it's almost like Google knew I
was gonna do this cuz literally nothing
had to be modified removed or cut inside
the phone for this to look absolutely
amazing it would be nice to see the
vibrator though I'll give the glass one
last cleaning and flop the fingerprint
scanner back into its hole along with
the singular circle camera lens the
flash diffuser is a bit harder to place
now that the coloring is gone so I'll
just rest it sticky side up over top of
the LEDs so it'll stick to the glass in
the correct spot when I set the glass
down for the final
time I'll lay down some clear
double-sided tape around the edges of
the phone the pixel three won't be
water-resistant anymore of course but
for aesthetic says eye-catching is this
it might be a worthwhile trade-off what
do you think Google could totally
manufacture a clear watertight version
of this phone with basically no changes
to the internals just a clear piece of
glass and clear adhesive and they're
good to go if only there was some way to
contact them to ask for it one little
snap of the finger print scanner ribbon
back onto the motherboard just like a
little Lego two screws over that black
bracket and were finished seriously
amazing everything still works and no
internal hardware was modified a fully
transparent pixel three clearly one of
the best-looking transparent phones in
existence
get on it Google hit that subscribe

don't want to be alone with your
thoughts go check out the pixel three XL
durability test or the off-road
wheelchair contraption I built from two
electric bikes thanks ton for watching
and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
