this will show you the screen
replacement the charging port
replacement battery replacement and just
how much of a royal nightmare this phone
is to work on buckle up
turn off the phone and remove both the
SIM card tray and the SD card tray I
will link the tools and replacement
parts down in the video description
right below this video next to the
subscribe button few things to watch out
for the playing cards or business cards
that you're going to use to remove the
screen are going to slide over the
earpiece watch out for the screen
ribbons on the left side and the
capacitive buttons on the bottom of the
device
you'll understand what I'm talking about
as you watch heat up the phone around
the edges that is where the adhesive is
the phone is totally glued shut
so by heating the edges you soften the
glue I put a little gap between the
screen and the metal frame with my
little metal pry tool then I slid my
business card between the two and into
the glue the thinness of the card will
cut the glue and not put any unneeded
pressure on the glass if your screen is
already destroyed you don't need to be
as careful as I am but I want to keep
using my phone since it's in good
condition if you put your playing card
in too deep it will damage the super
fragile LCD basically if you're going to
open your phone for something other than
a screen replacement just plan on
replacing the screen as well
it's that fragile I heat up the screen
again about every twenty to thirty
seconds as the glue cools off it gets
hard again the hotter the glue is the
easier it is to remove it pay special
attention to the bottom as well so you
don't damage those capacitive buttons I
leave the playing cards all around the
edge so that it doesn't reappear back to
the frame again as it cools once the
glue is totally separated the phone will
open like a little book the screen
ribbon feeds through the metal mid frame
into the rear of the phone all that work
and it is still not accessible yet there
are 12 screws around the mid frame this
thick mid frame is probably what helps
give the phone its durability if you
have not yet watched my durability test
you should check it out this phone is a
beast the mid frame is not glued into
place but it is very very precisely set
into the rear of the phone so using a
thin pry tool pry between the two frames
and lift the screen and the motherboard
out this exposes the three different
circuit boards stacked on top of each
other like some freaky tetris game
before we can disconnect the screen
let's unscrew the battery connector and
then pop that off so there's no power
running through the board it snaps off
like a little Lego now listen real quick
if you only need to replace your screen
ignore everything I do until I get to
this ribbon cable here I try to keep as
much of the tape intact so that I can
reuse it later but you're much better
off just removing it from the phone
entirely first and setting it somewhere
safe it'll make this whole project less
cluttered so far I've removed the power
and volume ribbon there is a little
latch that you flip up and the ribbon
cable can slide out of its connector
same thing with the SIM card ribbon the
top board left side connector is the
same way slide that out after lifting up
the different tape layers the tape is
mostly just here to make sure the
latches stay latched if you ever drop
your phone next I'll remove the charging
port ribbon connector and lift off the
tape that holds the screen driven
connector in place
I'll also expose the right side
mainboard ribbon and the SD ribbon and
the to signal wire connections once
those are all out I can remove the
copious amounts of tape this looks like
the Medusa of cellphones there's only
one connector for the screen so if the
screen is all you need to replace don't
bother with anything else it is a
nightmare in here so get out while you
can the screen ribbon slides out through
the mid frame so here's the screen I
will link to replacement screens in the
video description your replacement will
look the same as this one but will
probably come with its own adhesive
you'll need to transfer over the home
button as well if you need to do a
battery replacement continue watching
the rest of these screws are going to be
a t5 screw from the toolkit that I link
in the video description let's start
with the charging port next since that
is the most likely component to need
replacing after the screen or the
battery you can unsnap the charging port
ribbon connector as well as the two wire
connectors on either side of it then
flip the phone over and unstick the
capacitive buttons from the mid frame
they do have the little LED light
attached to it so make sure not to rip
that off if the light breaks the button
will still function it just won't light
up any more those ribbons will pull
through the frame and then release your
charging port into the wild it's got a
USB type-c connector and
microphone on that board as well now
let's work on the middle board above the
battery it's got one wire connection and
then two t5 screws at the top grab the
little rubber niblet up by the LED flash
and the whole middle board can slide out
from under the top board lift it up
gently and watch for the bottom vibrator
for some reason HTC soldered it onto the
main board
it matches the unorganised collection of
everything else in here though so let's
just roll with it the 12 megapixel rear
camera is attached to this middle board
it'll unsnap like the little charging
port did here you can see the OIS image
stabilizing on the camera it will
physically move the lens while the
camera is on to help stabilize the image
like a little gyro thumbs up for how
awesome technology is now that the
middle board is off we can remove the
battery there are no pull tabs on this
one so we just have to pry it out
luckily the screen is not attached
anymore so we don't have to be super
careful about flexing that mid frame
just make sure not to flex the battery
and don't puncture it also stay away
from that top edge of the battery
because there are random ribbon cables
underneath it here is the 3000 milliamp
battery if you have not yet subscribed
to my youtube channel I'd love it if you
did it is free I review technology from
the inside lift up those two ribbon
cables under the battery and then remove
the three t5 screws on the top word the
board will lift off here you can see the
front 5 megapixel camera with the same
oh is image stabilizing feature that the
rear camera has it is a world first to
have it on the front facing the
proximity sensor also snaps off like a
literal Lego I think this is a world
first as well normally they're built
into the motherboard the headphone jack
is soldered into place and the front
camera is removable as well the bottom
two ribbons are not one really cool
thing about this phone is that both the
SIM card tray and the SD card tray are
replaceable not many phones have that
capability lately just remove the tape
from the mid frame and each of the slots
will lift out allowing it to be swapped
the guts this phone are messy but at
least they are modular let's put this
bad boy back together the straighter the
ribbons are from the top board the
easier they will be to plug in later so
line those up with the lines underneath
the battery get those three screws back
into place
always keep your screws organized even
if they look the same make sure to lift
up the power and volume buttons before
you put the battery down don't worry I
went back and fix this later the camera
from the middle board will
tuck underneath that top word then get
the two screws into place feed the
capacitive buttons through the mid frame
from that charging port make sure they
stick then set the charging port in
place plug it in along with the two wire
connections on either side and the three
screws now that most of it is in place
we can work on the power button
connector and the top ribbon connector
the sim connector the wire connector the
SD connector and the other top ribbon
connector then I'll tuck the screen
through the frame gently if you can Gore
bend that ribbon too much your screen
will not work I'll connect that into
place and then lastly I can connect the
charging port ribbon right on top of it
the last two wires get clipped in and if
your tape still exists put it back on
top this will just help the latches stay
shut when you drop the phone the next
time get the battery plugged in and
screwed down then set the whole
contraption into the rear frame and clip
it into place it'll snap down and you'll
hear it I'll test the screen at this
point get all 12 screws back into place
if everything is functioning the
capacitive buttons are working as well
as the screen so I can hear it down into
place bonus points to anyone who
actually counts how many connections are
inside this phone well I'm glad this
repair is over hopefully with the HTC 11
next year they'll manage to consolidate
a few more components and make the
repair more manageable for the average
person
check out the HTC 10 camera test and the
durability video this phone is amazing
as long as you don't ever need to open
it up my Instagram and Twitter are where
I am most active hope see over there
