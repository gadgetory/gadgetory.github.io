names getting longer and more
complicated nowadays it's getting tough
to keep track of them all
this most recent flagship from Sony just
got a hefty all-glass redesign and well
it's time to see if it can survive the
stress of everyday life this is the Asch
pink color which describes itself pretty
well kind of has a Jigglypuff walk
through a forest fire vibe let's get
started sony historically has never been
a super high performer when it comes to
solid build quality or rigidity the z5
premium and Xperia x z from last year
both flexed like soggy bananas and while
they didn't fail or break it was a
little unnerving out of the box this
heavy all glass rectangle feels like it
might be telling a more durable story
this time around we'll start with the
glass scratch test sony has advertised
Gorilla Glass 5 on both the front and
back so it's pretty safe to assume that
we'll get scratches at a level 6
this means coins keys and razor blades
won't do any damage to the surface
because they are all softer materials
than a level 6 we get deeper grooves at
a level 7 but since this is Gorilla
Glass it should still hold together to
avoid shattering even with those
abrasions introduced into the glass the
Sony branding at the bottom of the phone
is under the surface and won't scratch
off things start to get interesting up
here at the top of the phone the
front-facing camera is 5 megapixels but
it's advertised as having gyro
electronic image stabilization it'll be
interesting to see if that gyro is
Hardware related during the teardown the
earpiece is color matched to the phone
kind of looks like double bubble after
it's been on the bottom of your shoe all
day the earpiece won't come out
it's very solidly attached to the inside
of the phone which is good for the
aesthetics of your phone in the long
term ideally we want smartphones to last
longer than 2 years moving to the
Gorilla Glass 5 back glass panel on the
phone it's got a subtle curve throughout
the whole surface it's definitely not as
flat as the previous Sony phones it is
packed with features though like
wireless charging and NFC the single
colored LED flash is also tucked up
underneath the glass the rear 19
megapixel camera is protected with glass
to won't scratch easy and it has that
same gyro he is at the
camera has the fingerprint scanner is
very flush with the back glass surface
which leads it pretty unprotected in
your pocket or purse I'll scratch it up
a little bit with my razor blade to
mimic a few years worth of abuse luckily
though it can still sense my fingerprint
and unlock the phone the sides are made
from anodized aluminum which matched the
same watered-down grape kool-aid
aesthetic as the rest of the phone the
color can be scraped off revealing the
silver metal underneath same with the
volume power and dedicated camera but
the top of the phone has the sim and SD
card memory expansion slot up to 400
gigabytes so thumbs up for that I'll tap
that back in here and there's plenty of
metal up here to the other side of the
phone is gloriously free from bixby but
the bottom with the USBC is annoyingly
void of a headphone jack just something
to keep in mind if you plan on buying
the Xperia XE to the burn test is next
which I guarantee has probably happened
to someone somewhere at some point so
for that one person is good to know that
the 5.7 IPS LCD of the xe2
can last 13 seconds under direct flame
from a lighter the screen went black and
the pixels turned off completely but did
end up recovering try to avoid doing
this though to test the structural
integrity of the redesign we commenced
the bin test and very much unlike its
flexible predecessors this new xe2 is as
rigid as smartphones get zero flex and
zero kinks done to the frame of the
phone also no cracks in the glass huge
thumbs up to Sony for the build quality
on this one the Xperia XE 2 passes my
durability test and is more than capable
of handling everyday abuse hit that
subscribe button is free and coming out
with me on Twitter and Instagram that's
where all the cool kids are thanks ton
for watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
