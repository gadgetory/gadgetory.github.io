the Motorola Droid turbo first of all
make sure that the phone is off before
you start working on it
secondly you have to take off the back
of the phone and it is kind of adhere to
the frame of the phone the easiest way I
found to take off the back is to take
your fingernail and slide it between the
power button and the screen and then
slide it up a little bit and that leaves
you just enough room that you can take
your pry tool stick it between there and
pop off the rest of class all the way
around the back side a little bit easier
using that red pry tool that has a
little lip on it and that got all the
clasps undone once the clasps are undone
you can just pry away the back a little
bit be super careful though because
there is the Qi charger it and that is
adhered to to the back of the frame it
doesn't matter if you leave that
adhesive on the frame or on the Qi
charger itself it's not super important
either way I left mine on the back cover
as you can see here you can also see
that the contact points for the LED
lights are on the back cover and that's
what turns on the flash for the camera
here is the plastic bracket it's kind of
like a spacer for the battery to make
sure it doesn't jiggle around inside of
the phone a lot of times you can just
unclip the battery and that's like
taking the battery out of your phone
that'll fix a lot of software issues you
have so if your phone is ever freezing
or anything like that just unplug the
battery plug it back in and you should
be fine now here's the Qi charger I'm
going to pry it away from the battery
really quick and I'll go a little more
in-depth on that a little bit later in
the video here's a screwdriver I will
link all the tools and parts you'll need
down in the video description below
most of these screws the four along the
top are t5 screws so I'm going to take
all those out and that removes the
plastic bit you can see here that the
gold contact points for the vibrator
motor and the headphone jack are up here
and you can see these little gold points
where they just rest up against the
board and I think this is super
interesting I'll talk a little bit more
about that later in the video it's kind
of redundant how many connections they
have that control these parts there's
four screws along the bottom and then
also make sure to take out that SIM card
slot just so you don't damage it when
you're trying to lift up the motherboard
from the frame of the screen once the
motherboard is up you can see the LCD
connection is under one of these little
wire cables you lift up the little white
flap and then the ribbon cable will just
unplug there is a piece of tape along
the top so make sure you remove that as
well and the ribbon cable will just
slide right out
pretty straightforward that removes the
motherboard and battery from the screen
so here's the screen if you do break
your screen like the glass or the LCD
you will need to remove it from the
frame of the screen unless you can find
a frame LCD and glass sold in one piece
that would be the ideal situation but if
you can't find them all together you're
going to have to remove the frame from
the glass and the LCD and then once you
have your new piece you're just going to
adhere it back into the old frame and
then you can put your phone back
together again pretty straightforward
but the ideal thing is to just buy them
all glued together in one piece I will
link parts down in the description below
so if I find them all in one unit well
let you know here's the Qi charger is
connected to the back of the motherboard
kind of one of those little Lego
connections just pop that off and then
since I've already released the Qi
charger you know taking off all that
adhesive with my pry tool it just pops
off from the edge of the battery the
battery itself is glued into the frame
so I'm just going to take my pry tool
and pry that out of there and then the
battery lifts out away there is some
really fragile black tape underneath not
a super big deal
just kind of lay it flat if you end up
scraping it off the motherboard and then
here is that really weird connection
that I was talking about before it's
almost like Motorola is like oh hey we
designed this phone and oh we forgot the
vibrator motor and the headphone jack so
we're going to take this ribbon cable
with connection points and plug it into
the motherboard and then the connections
will just rest on top of it usually when
you see a phone it'll have the
connection points right on the
motherboard so you have not so much
redundancy and loss of signal I would
imagine that the signal clarity through
the headphone jack is an ideal because
it has to go through two connections
instead of one here is the front-facing
and rear-facing camera believe they're a
2 megapixel and a 21 megapixel kind of
nice and then you can see the water
indicator as well right there now we're
going to take the battery set it back
down and put the Qi charger back on top
of that as well plug it in first then
you can just line it back up on top of
where it was before remember I will try
to find replacement parts and put those
down in the video description now
getting the motherboard plugged back
into the screen make sure that there's
no tape on it and plug it all the way
back into that socket latch it down
again and then put the tape over the top
of that so if you ever drop your phone
the latch
come undone and your screen will stop
working so make sure that connection is
good and tight now connect the battery
back down just make sure the little pins
line up with the battery connection and
the motherboard and just clip it down
just like a little Lego piece get that
black pad over the top of the earpiece
and get those four screws back into
place there the t5 remember that also
get those four screws down at the bottom
back into place
get that spacer placed over the battery
to make sure it doesn't jiggle around
and then the back make sure you slide
that the bottom part with the charging
port first and then clip it all the way
around the outside the SIM card back
into place
