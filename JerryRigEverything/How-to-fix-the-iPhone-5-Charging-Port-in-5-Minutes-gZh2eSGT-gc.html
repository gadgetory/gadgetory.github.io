how to replace the charging port on the
iPhone 5 and it's actually pretty simple
you know if you used a screwdriver or
your and opened anything before you can
probably accomplish this and basically
take off the bottom two screws this is
the same pentalobe screwdriver that you
would have used for the iPhone 4 now
they're pretty inexpensive online I'll
list the the tools that I use in the
video description below as well as where
to find them on Amazon I'm the tool kit
itself is only like 15 bucks it's not
too bad anyway grab a little suction cup
once you got those screws out and pry up
a little bit
in hindsight definitely use a plastic
tool for this if you don't want to
scratch up your phone but by this point
you know the phones are mostly scratched
anyway it would be able to tell then be
very careful when you're pulling the
screen away from the body you can see
that there is a metal bracket right here
if you're going to take the screen off
redo these three screws take them out
and then you can pop the screen off but
what I just did is I kind of just leaned
the screen back up against something so
I wouldn't put any stress on the cables
I'm but it would still be out of my way
right here I'm taking apart three screws
off the metal bracket and the metal
bracket comes apart in two places and
you can kind of see that I'm placing the
screws on the piece of paper in such a
way that I'll remember where they go
later so all three screws and the tube
bracket pieces are organized right there
pop the ribbon cable off with just your
plastic pry tool lift it away it's kind
of like a little Lego piece snaps on and
off just like that then there are seven
screws down at the bottom this corner
one and once again I'm placing the
screws very carefully in a certain order
and then there's four screws holding the
actual charging port in place there's
the two upper ones and the two lower
ones are smaller and then here's the
other bottom left corner and there's one
more screw right here that kind of holds
this other little metal part in place
anyways you can kind of see the place
where the screws just correspond
directly with where they are on the
phone and then I can put them back a lot
easier now that I know where
anyway there's a little wire cable right
here that you have to snap off
just kind of pry it up a little bit and
then this part you have you're really
careful with this little ribbon cable
right here is glued on to the plastic
piece below it so if you just kind of
pry up around you to the corners
eventually the glue will just unstick
itself and you're good to go
if you rip that cable you'll have some
problems in the future anyway here's the
speaker itself pull that out you can see
this little plastic bit up top that's
what kept it under the main motherboard
put that if you need to replace that
that part is only like five bucks on
Amazon I'll put a link in the video
description for that as well anyway then
you take the ribbon cable and just kind
of pull it away gently and just kind of
unstick it from the glue that is below
it it comes off pretty easily and then
pull it off and you can see it's all of
this right here is the part that you're
replacing you have the headphone jack on
the left side and then the microphone
between the headphone jack right here
and then you have the charger itself to
put it back in I start by just putting
the charging port in the correct spot
and just kind of popping it into place
it fits slides right back in that groove
where it came from and then positioning
the the headphone jack and the
microphone in place as well and then
just kind of pressing down you know
sliding this little corner underneath
the motherboard and then pressing down
the rest of the ribbon cable into place
and then you snap the ribbon cable in
just like a little Lego just where I
came from
anyway put the speaker back in by
sliding that little notch underneath the
motherboard and then all you have to do
to make sure the little cables all line
up there's a little groove a little pin
that sticks up that aligns that ribbon
cable and you might get all the screws
back into place
doesn't really matter what order you do
them in and then snap the wire cable
back in it's just like a little pan that
snaps onto the head of the little pin in
the motherboard it's pretty
straightforward and you win as far these
little metal brackets go I position them
and then I put the center screw in first
and that keeps the brackets in one place
where I can adjust them just a little
bit so I can put the top and the bottom
screw in then I took the top room cables
in and snap them the screen down on top
of the iPhone itself and you'll hear it
snap all the way around the outside and
then you're good to go make sure you do
put the bottom two screws in the
pentalobe ones too to hold the screen
down VM everything works you have any
questions make sure to leave them in the
comment section below make sure to LIKE

forget to subscribe and once again I'll
put everything you need in the video
description below so make sure you go
down there if you need any parts just
click them right from Amazon anyway
