replace the rear camera on the iPhone 6s
it's a pretty simple repair the hardest
part of this whole thing is just going
to be getting the screen off and back on
safely so I will show you how to do that
first things first turn off the phone I
will link all of the tools you'll need
and the parts like the replacement
camera and camera lenses down in the
video description below there are two
pentalobe screws at the bottom of the
phone remove those and then lift up on
the screen with a suction cup and you
can pry between the frame of the screen
and the frame of the phone with a pry
tool it can be metal or plastic just
make sure that when you're prying
between both of the frames that you're
not actually bending the LCD because you
can crack your LCD that way and it will
turn into a much more expensive repair
so be careful when you lift up the
screen make sure not to go past 90
degrees or else you'll tear those ribbon
cables there's four screws attached this
metal plate make sure to keep those
organized and put them back where they
belong
then you can lift up each of these
ribbon cables they're like Legos just
unsnap them from their connections and
that removes the screen there are two
screws here next to the camera there's
also that same little ribbon cable
connector that the screen had remove the
metal plate for the camera and then the
camera will just pop out of its little
slot pretty straightforward here's the
camera itself it is 12 megapixels and
can record in 4k finally here's the rear
lens for the camera you can see that is
a little bit protected with that lip
right there you can replace this lens
you can pop it out from the back of the
phone just push it out through this
little hole or you can take a razor
blade and you can heat up the phone a
little bit and pull out the lens with
the razor blade as you can see in slow
motion here this is the iPhone 6 that I
was pulling that lens out on the iPhone
6s is a little bit different with the
lenses but I will link those in the
video description when you're putting
the camera back in make sure where my
tweezers are to pull that little ribbon
it's little grounding ribbon and that's
the screw is going to go through that
ribbon so make sure it's in the right
spot before you put those screws back
into place and then you can just take
the ribbon cables and push them down on
top of their connections as well you'll
feel them kind of snap down into place
just like Legos as I was explaining
earlier so before I put that metal plate
down I'm just going to make sure the
screen is working if you
lines running through your screen or if
your screen is white or doesn't respond
to touch you're going to just take it
off and then reseat the ribbon cables
again there's been a lot of people who
have been having problems with that in
the past so if everything works fine
like mine you can just put that metal
plate back into place line up the top of
the screen with the edge of the phone
and then snap the sides down into place
after that make sure to get your bottom
two pentalobe screws in and you are good
to go
