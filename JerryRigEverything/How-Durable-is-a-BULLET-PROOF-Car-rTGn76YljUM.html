proof cars have been around for a while
and today we're going to see how durable
a bulletproof car really is
we have governments we have the
president united states we have famous
people a lot of them use bulletproof
cars for protection and today we're
gonna see how durable the glass is how
durable the paneling is inside those
doors and we're gonna do it in real life
with real guns now if you don't like
guns that's fine we're also gonna focus
on the construction of the bulletproof
paneling let's get started
before we destroy anything let me show
you what working with a company called
armor max here in Utah was nice enough
to donate some glass panels for us to
shoot and we have two glass panels here
today one is for a smaller caliber gun
like a little pistol like a 9-millimeter
and the other piece of glass is for a
larger caliber rifle like the one I use
my bump stock video the ar-15 so it
really just depends on how much
protection you want for your vehicle
this is the nine-millimeter that we'll
be shooting at the glass and this is the
thinner pane and then over here we have
the ar-15 with the bump stock attached
we're just going to be shooting single
rounds today though you can see the
larger caliber here and how thick the
pane of glass is compared to the lower
caliber but really all of this stuff is
completely customizable like the
president's motorcade here in the United
States uses about double this thickness
of glass inside it really just depends
on how much protection you want and how
much you're willing to spend as far as
weight goes when there bulletproofing a
car with a smaller caliber you know
bulletproofing it for a handgun it
usually adds anywhere from you know 400
to 500 pounds give or take the
protection you want but if you're gonna
fully rifle proof your car you can add
anywhere from five hundred all the way
up to maybe 12 or 13 hundred your gas
mileage might go down slightly but
sometimes that's a good trade-off for
the protection it offers so gun ranges
are actually pretty cool so right here
we have different slots gun safety is a
pretty big thing when you're at a gun
range each of these little cubicles keep
the you know the bullets that are jacked
out of the gun keep it from hitting your
neighbor and then as we walk down range
right now it's safe because there's no
one else shoot in here this is one of
the pieces of glass that we're going to
be shooting at so we have it propped up
we have some of these little green
targets right here just so we have
something to aim at while we're shooting
and then we also have
one little melon right behind it so if
the bullet goes through the bulletproof
glass which it shouldn't we'll know for
sure now down here at the end of the
range is something that not a lot of
people see this is what directs the
bullets into this channel down here at
the end so that they can recycle all of
those bullet tips because there's a lot
of metal in a bullet and it's always
good to recycle so you can see here all
these little markings are little bullets
that have hit this metal panel right
here and then ricocheted up there into
that little slot so they can collect
them and recycling all right so we're
gonna start with the 9-millimeter
handgun first we're going to shoot that
pane of glass right down there let's do
it that looks sweet let's go take a
closer look oh man that's so cool you
can see the impact point right here you
can see like a little bit of remnants of
like the metal on the tip of the bullet
and then it just like absorb the impact
and fractured all the way around this
outside so here on the back side it's
still 100% completely smooth my fingers
aren't catching on any of like the glass
layers on the back of this if you were
sitting inside of this car window you
would still be totally fine now these
layers of bulletproof glass there are
actually layers of glass and plastic
stuck together so if you interested to
see what kind of penetration we can get
when we start shooting the rifle on the
ar-15 but a half an inch stopping a
bullet that's pretty impressive so we
have the camera set up and our safety
gear on we're gonna shoot that same
piece of glass a couple more times with
the 9-millimeter and see how well it
hands up to multiple shots alright so
safety gear is on I mentioned if you're
being shot at inside of a car it's not
just gonna be one bullet there's going
to be multiple so I'm gonna empty this
full magazine into the glass and see
what happens
sweet
okay so check this out it looks like I
hit this part multiple times I think
there was an impact point here here here
here and here
as the outside structure of the glass is
compromised it removes the outer layer
but the inner layers are still fine so
you can see like this divot right here
if the glass is an inch thick
this probably removed about half an inch
of that but it's still survived I mean
how many shots was that like six and so
if we go back here to the back of the
glass you know feeling the back of it I
can there's not there's nothing catching
on my hand but as I move my hand over
this I can feel like a slight indention
and I imagine that's like the plastic
layer bulging out just a tiny bit
terrified after that glass my finger all
right so we're not gonna touch the glass
anymore but when the bullet hits there's
so much energy in that bullet it impacts
the glass obviously in the glass
distributes the impact over the whole
thing so not everything you see in
Hollywood is truthful because if a
bullet hits a car it's going to shatter
the exterior layer of the ballistic
glass at least all right so we have a
new glass in place and this one is an
inch and a half thick so it's going to
do the ar15 the higher caliber bullet
and we'll see if that melon survives all
right so safety is now off and full
disclosure I have not cited this gun so
if I miss this first shot
you
okay so that was pretty sweet so the
impact of the bullet had right here in
the center and we can already see like
this is an inch and a half thick you can
also see the divot from the glass you
know separating from the point of impact
the energy said of going forward it
immediately stops the forward energy and
disperses it into the outward glass and
these cracks look freakin incredible and
this is the size of the bullet that hit
that Center impact part right there and
I think this is one of those classic
layers inside let's see if we have any
damage on the back that is sweet there
is no damage on the back of this thing
so if you were sitting inside of this
car you would be completely safe from
someone shooting an ar-15 at your window
so you know everything this manufacturer
has like a rating to it and so this
piece of glass is certified for five
bullets but armor max has shot this
thing 20 times and it still survived
which is pretty darn impressive so we
just finished shooting the ballistic
glass we're still going to shoot some of
the ballistic armor panels here in a
second but let's check out the
Laboratory of armor max first and see
how all this stuff is put together and
there's actually quite a lot that goes
into this so this stuff right here this
is like a little bomb proof blanket that
can actually sit down underneath the
carpet inside of the car so I get for
grenade or something has rolled
underneath the vehicle you know it's
full of Kevlar and stuff it stops the
explosion from coming up inside of the
cab now normally when you're sitting
inside of a car you're hidden and
protected by the door and the windows
that's like one of the most important
parts of bulletproofing a car is the
glass and the door panels so this is a
Land Cruiser right here and this is the
bulletproof glass the same stuff that we
were shooting at earlier you can kind of
tell how thick this panel is but because
of the weight of the bulletproof glass
they actually have to stick new motors
inside of the door so these are
specialized motors that can lift the 60
pound slab of glass so the slab of glass
will protect the top half of the person
and the rest of the door is fitted with
these bulletproof panels here inside we
haven't shot any of these bulletproof
panels yet but I'll make sure we get a
chance before we leave so we've talked
about how to protect the driver inside
now here in the front protecting the
engine is another important concept so
here we have bulletproof panels that are
set at an angle and go all the way down
in front of the radiator because the
radiator is what keeps the engine cool
and if your radiators bleeding out then
your car's not going to go very far so
these bulletproof panels right here
pretty important there's
also the same bulletproof panels that we
have inside of the metal panels here
inside of this as well as protecting the
firewall between the engine and the
passenger compartment and then here we
have a few more bulletproof panels
protecting the battery because also
without the battery you're not going to
be going very far
another bulletproof panel here
protecting the air intake and inside of
the tires they have something called a
run flat which is basically a metal band
on the rim of the tire that sticks up
past the rim so even if there's no air
in your tire and the tire is technically
flat you'll still be able to drive on
that metal rim inside of the actual tire
so like I mentioned before there's a
couple different packages that armor
Maxx offers and so this is one of them
here it's like you know an optional
piece this says like that bulletproofing
rounds because this is one of the
weakest points when the door is closed
that if a bullet Pierce's right here
your head is still going to be right on
the other side which just adds another
layer of protection you have bulletproof
glass on the windshield for that twenty
twenty five thousand dollars all the
main things be protected you know you
inside of the cab but can go anywhere
from 70,000 all the way up to the top
with armor-piercing rounds and stuff
like that
it has remember that 2-inch thick piece
of glass if you have that installed in
your door panel obviously the windows
aren't going to work anymore but that's
the most protection that you can have
while you're driving so one of the
things when you're adding so much more
weight to the vehicle like those panes
of glass weighed a lot and it's anywhere
from 500 to a thousand pounds maybe a
little bit over that sometimes they have
to upgrade the suspension as well so
this suspension is calibrated for the
extra weight and it'll still ride the
same you know just as smooth as a stock
vehicle even though this one's
completely bulletproof so this isn't a
sponsored video I just thought it was
pretty cool technology and this company
armor max has been in business for over
25 years they've had over 250 known
attacks on their vehicles but no one has
died from being shot through the armor
on their vehicles so it's pretty good
stuff but it's also interesting to know
that like this stuff does happen like
there are dangerous places in the world
so seeing how the technology is able to
protect people it's pretty interesting
if everyone could just be nice to each
other companies like this wouldn't need
to exist but since there's niceness
problems in the world here we are this
car right behind me actually
electrified door handles Dan doesn't
know yet from a YouTube channel what's
inside so I'm gonna tell him to open up
the door to see what's inside of the car
and see what happens see what he says
about the steering Hall oh is this the
shock door this is the shock door wow
you almost got me do it anyway do it
anyway I don't want to get shocked you
gotta do it going in is he gonna hurt
[Laughter]
okay okay shocked me I felt it so there
was a button back here that he just
friend the hallway J goes out so this is
like you can drop this behind you like
if someone's chasing your car that's
hilarious
so like literally if someone's chasing
them you can drop this little
compartment in the back and these things
fall out - like puncture the tires of
all the cars that are behind you that's
awesome so it's pretty sweet like one of
these buttons right here he just had
them labeled so one of these is dropping
the tacks or the you know the things in
the road and the other one this is the
one that electrifies the door handles
all over the lanes and then this box
right here just folds up and click shut
no he's got a figure out of stick all
these back up in there and get it locked
and loaded for the next guy okay so
since Dan wouldn't really grab the
doorknob I'm gonna give it a shot I've
been tased before with that little case
but I think this one's a little bit
higher voltage and I am super nervous
right now this is not something I
planned on doing today are we good
did you get it okay so I felt the tingle
from my tip of my finger all the way up
to about here so I'm gonna try it again
yeah mmm hey you can fill it all the way
up your arm it's stronger than that cell
phone case that I reviewed a while back
you know the Taser cell phone case it's
not something I want to do for a long
period of time when the car's actually
turned on and the engine is running
there's way more current going through
that so what I was able to do right
there it would be completely different
if the car was on so here's a close-up
shot of those electrified door handles
you can see the copper strips on the
inside so anytime someone just reaches
in and grabs these grabbing the copper
it'll jolt their whole arm like you saw
earlier all right so we've seen the cars
and we've seen the glass and now we're
gonna shoot at some of the armored Mac's
paneling that goes inside of the car
doors now this stuff it's lighter than
steel which makes it ideal for you know
putting in cars because the more weight
you have in a car through more the gas
mileage goes down and the slower it gets
so lightweight cars are good but this
stuff is actually so light that they've
stuck it in helicopters the ones you
know in South Africa the anti-poaching
helicopters which is pretty sweet
so this piece right here is for like the
larger caliber rifles but we also have
this smaller piece of armor max material
that stops 9-millimeter handguns so
let's shoot both of these right now and
see what happens so this square panel
this is the armored Max 3.3 is the same
stuff they stuck on the anti-poaching
helicopters we're gonna shoot it with
the nine-millimeter to see what happens
let's try it out
so the bullet travelled punctured into
here and then traveled up inside of it
because apparently there's one hundred
and fifty six different laminate layers
inside of this thing keeping the bullets
from penetrating to the important stuff
on the other side of the material so
we're gonna empty the rest of the
magazine inside of my nine-millimeter
and see what happens with the rest of
the bullets and then we'll switch to the
bigger caliber guns alright so there's
about five more shots in this we're
gonna put all of them straight into the
material and see what it looks like
after we're done
that's crazy
it looks like there is absolutely no
damage done to this but you can see tiny
little pinpricks where each of the
bullets hit and all of the bullets have
been captured inside of the material
that's a 9-millimeter bullet you know
the smaller ones now we're gonna try the
ar-15 and that should make a mark okay
so this is the ar-15 the safety is now
off let's see what happens so looking at
it outside it's seriously like there's
seriously no mark on the material which
is like incredible but here on the back
side you can see a small little divot
where the bullet hit so it's just like
this little tiny bolt personally I would
feel super safe inside of a helicopter
or a car you know with this lightweight
material inside of it protecting against
the bullets even with an ar-15 like
stopping that much power is incredible
so this piece of material is rated you
know within a 5 inch radius it can be
shot three to five times and still
maintain a structural integrity but you
know when you're in a moving vehicle and
someone shooting at you which does
happen armor max has had cars with like
a hundred shots in them the bullets are
all spread out like no one's gonna
consistently shoot in one spot over and
over and over again so overall today was
a pretty fun day you know shooting guns
is always a fun hobby for me and whether
you like guns or you don't like guns
it's still fun to see you know the
science and the technology behind
armored cars and armored helicopters I
did not know that they armored those
anti-poaching helicopters in Africa
there any questions been down in the
comments I'm sure I could be back here
later to answer those questions or to
blow up something else coming out with
me on Instagram and Twitter and thanks a
ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
