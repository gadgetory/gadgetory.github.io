how to fix this cracked screen on a
Galaxy s3 the same process that you
would use on any of the newer Galaxy
phones and even new Samsung phones first
of all we are going to take out the
battery you don't need to take apart the
phone for this because the glass is
actually not connected to anything on
the phone it's just glued on there so
we're going to take a heat gun and heat
up the glue that is separating or that
is holding together the glass screen to
the phone it's sitting right above the
digitizer so we're heating that glue up
enough so that will let the glass
separate away from the rest of the phone
the temperature you want to get it at is
the point where it's almost too hot to
touch if you heat it up too much you'll
damage the LCD underneath and I made
another video that you can check out
here that'll teach us some of the of
what not to do when you're separating
the glass from the rest of the phone so
I've taken my little razor blade and
I've inserted it between the screen and
the frame and you can see the glue start
to separate and move downward into the
phone the male let that sit for just a
second and pop one of my other tools in
here to hold its place and while I'm
doing this the phone is cooling down and
the glue is is going to start to harden
again so periodically during this whole
process I have to bust out the heat gun
and heat up the phone again
keep it warm so that the glue stays
liquid enough for me to work around the
outsides what's nice about this is that
normally when you crack your screen you
have to replace the whole thing as a
unit and this can cost anywhere from 100
to 250 bucks depending on what kind of
phone you have and how new it is the
glass pieces for these phones only cost
about 10 bucks and so I will list those
in the video description below but ten
dollars a whole lot better than 250 so
here I am separating the glue again
coming out from the other side after I
was done reheating the phone and you can
use plastic tools you prefer metal tools
myself you just have to be really
careful not to damage the frame everyone
has their own personal preferences I
just find that metal tools are a little
more there's more have more structural
Integrity's they don't bend around or
fluctuate as much and they have more
control over what I'm doing so I'm
heating up the phone again making sure
the glue stays nice and hot touching it
periodically making sure not to heat it
up too much now I'm going to take both
of my tools and kind of slide it down
the sides separating them I need to be
really careful not to touch the
digitizer underneath the glass screen
the digitizer is the next layer because
it is incredibly fragile pretty much if
you put any pressure whatsoever on it it
will crack and you can check out the
Tips &amp;amp; Tricks video that I made that
I'll show you a little bit more about
that and you heat up the phone again
making sure the glue stays nice and
one now the tips and tricks video that I
made actually shows me breaking the
phone in three different ways so it's a
pretty useful video showing what not to
do when replacing the glass on your
phone definitely check that out before
you actually attempt to do this
operation
now if I was smart I would have done
this step a little bit sooner because
the top of the screen is started to
reattach itself so I should have propped
something in there like a little guitar
pick or another razor blade to kind of
keep the top of the screen separate from
the rest of the phone so I wouldn't have
to pry it back up again but now that I
have my red tool in there it will hold
the screen far enough up that the glue
will start to separate on its own going
down towards the bottom you can see the
glue as the screen separates from the
rest of the phone
keeping that heat gun moving I keep on
sliding my tools all the way down just
frying the screen up ever so gently
if you end up cracking your digitizer
you will think to yourself man that was
so easy to crack I cannot believe how
easy that was your best bet is to just
not touch it at all I'm being really
careful down around the bottom of the
phone because that's where the the touch
sensitive buttons are and there is a
little cable connecting those that
you'll have to detach from the back of
the glass and I'll show you how to do
that in just a second there's one little
bit that's still holding the phone
together so I'm going to heat it up and
you'll see it move and detach itself
just like that it's all about having the
right amount of heat that's what makes
this job that's what makes fixing the
phone easy or hard just finding that
perfect balance so right here this the
double-sided sticky tape that's holding
the screen down you want to reuse as
much of this as possible unfortunately
for this phone most of that that I just
got off is not going to be able to be
reused so I'll show you how to fix that
in a second now these are the buttons I
was talking about before I'm going to
switch to my plastic tool and pry those
gently away from the glass screen
because I do have to reuse these they
have to connect to the new piece of
glass otherwise you'll lose your menu
and your back buttons now if you end up
ripping this cable that's it you only
have one shot at this
if you end up damaging the digitizer or
ripping the cable you just have to buy a
new screen there's no fix in it so there
is a little bit of risk involved but at
the same time you end up saving a lot of
money if it works all right getting rid
of the old glass now I'm going to go
around the edge and make sure there's no
little shards of glass anywhere it is
very important that you get every single
little shard take as much time as you
need and pick out every little bit
because
any bit that stuck down still inside of
the phone will keep the new screen away
from the phone body and won't let it sit
flush against the the phone itself so I
just cut away some of the old sticky
tape the stuff that was bunched up
because I want my screen to sit flush
against the phone and if there's any
little bubbles or ripples or anything
like that it won't sit flush now usually
this adhesive comes off with the glass
screen but in this case the adhesive was
stuck down on the digitizer so I'm very
gently just kind of rubbing that back
and peeling it away which is stranded
strangely satisfying you see adhesive
isn't super important to the phone it
just helped the old screen stay on and
stay in place we have a new way of
attaching the glass and I'll show you
that in just a second put some new tape
down so this will tape this whole thing
cost about three or four bucks on Amazon
I'll link that in the description below
as well it's enough tape to last a
lifetime
basically what I'm taking is I'm just
unpeeling it from the roll and building
kind of a framework around the actual
screen itself and this does two things
one it holds the new piece of glass in
place as well as it creates a barrier
from dust so you want the square of the
screen to be a hundred percent sealed
make a solid square or rectangle around
the LCD so that when the glass sits on
top of it there's no way for dust to get
between the glass and the digitizer
making sure there's no gaps anywhere you
can see right here I meet just meeting
up with the piece of sticky tape that I
was able to save on that top left side
and I'm also making sure that I'm not
covering up any of the cameras or the
speakers just putting the tape around
those so that I can still use them now
right here I'm being super super careful
I'm taking a coolant free cloth and just
rubbing around the outside to get any
dust that fell onto the digitizer while
we were working being very gentle
remember if you crack the digitizer here
there is no solution just got to replace
the whole screen gently picking up all
the dust making sure there's no glass
fragments anywhere and now it is time to
remove the upper side of the sticky tape
just take my little razor blade and
separating the two layers so the sticky
tape is now stuck to the phone as well
as the other side is ready for the
screen to be placed down on top of it
kantrelle the dust is guy you only have
one shot at this so make sure the dust
is gone now I'm taking the screen and
lining it up with the buttons down below
the back button and the menu button
pressing them into place lining the
screen up and then making sure that the
buttons are stuck to the screen before I
actually set the screen down into place
once again that you can get these glass
pieces for super cheap on Amazon
anywhere from five to ten bucks I'll
link those in the video description
below
then I'm lining the home button up first
because that does have a little bit of
play in it you can wiggle it around and
make sure it sits tight and then you
make sure that the earpiece is also
lined up with the hole in the upper side
of the clasp once you have those two
pieces lined up you can just press it
into place now this right now it's good
to go you can use the phone it's working
a hundred percent I like to take the
heat gun in just one more time just heat
up the phone just enough so that it's
hot to the touch
and that kind of seals the double-sided
sticky tape to the glass it makes a
stronger bond than it would be without
the heat holding it about six or seven
inches away from the phone it also just
depends on you know how powerful your
heat gun is
it's almost too hot to touch and we're
good to go once again I'll put all the
parts you need for this project in the
video description below it's kind of fun
kind of satisfying the whole thing only
took me about thirty minutes I do have a
little bit of practice you know but most
important thing is just take your time
go slow and try not to break anything
anyway pop the battery back in ten want
that overheating then I'm just run
through the test make sure that
everything is working still you know if
you have any questions make sure to
leave them in the comments below don't
forget to like if this video helped you
and don't forget to subscribe I do you
put up videos fairly often I get new
technology pretty quick just made a
galaxy gear video you can check that out
it also hit me up on Twitter at Zacks
jerry-rigged or a Facebook jerry-rigged
everything and everything on the screen
is working perfect another success thank
you for watching hope to see you around
