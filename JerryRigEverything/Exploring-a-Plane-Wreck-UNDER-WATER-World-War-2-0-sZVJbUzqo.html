run out of fuel in an airplane there's a
guy who found out the hard way in world
war two when he crashed his airplane
into the ocean off the coast of Oahu
there's two ways to explore this wreck
one is with scuba gear the other is with
an underwater drone today we have this
guy the Gladius we're going to take it
down underwater and see what happened to
the airplane the guy had to abandon
let's get started
so with this underwater drone there's a
couple different features of it a camera
here in the center that shoots in 4k
there's no gimbal which should be
interesting I've done a couple test
flights with this drone underwater but
nothing as big as this so it'll be
interesting to see how well the camera
is controllable and how well I can point
the camera at what I want to see there's
a couple different propellers we got the
right and left propellers here at the
back that'll guide the drone you know
left and right and then we have these
propellers here in the middle which
bring the drone up and down and a cool
thing that I haven't seen on other
drones is these front led these
headlights that should allow us to see a
little bit better underwater one thing
that is different about underwater
drones is that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
signals don't travel more than a few
feet underwater so the whole thing does
need to be tethered and we have this guy
right here a hundred meter tether which
allows us to take the underwater drone
which is waterproof about a hundred
meters down in the water in this wreck
the Corsair is 35 meters which should
allow us plenty of leeway with this
tether we have a bunch of these little
rings right here so I'm gonna pop this
tether into the top of the drone and
screw it on tight to charge the drone
there's this little tail pipe right here
on the back and it just charges up with
little circular connector and then all
of the internal memory is inside of the
drone there's no SD card slot or
anything else you transfer the files via
Wi-Fi if there was a removable SD card
slot it's just one more hold of
waterproof so I kind of liked that it's
a whole self-contained design and no
extra holes for water to get inside of
but turning on the drum we have the one
power switch right here and we have a
bunch of LED indicators inside of the
Wi-Fi spool alright so we have the drone
pointed straight at us
you can turn on the LED lights right
there then we can see us in the screen
alright let's see how it operates
underwater let's go explore this Corsair
tossing in the water okay let's go
so this propeller-powered World War 2
airplane called the Corsair lies just a
few miles off the coast of Hawaii and
1945 due to a mechanical issue with the
fuel gauge the pilot had to crash land
the plane in the ocean but luckily still
managed to survive the plane is also
still in one piece resting with one wing
submerged in the sand on the ocean floor
but the rest of the plane is pretty
exposed
while crashing an airplane is usually
bad news it's good news for the fish in
the coral during the last 70 years while
the plane has been on the ocean floor
it's turned into an underwater oasis for
all kinds of ocean life which makes it
even more fun to explore and to film one
thing that I really like about this is
that there's a little diagram here in
the corner that tells me what direction
the drone is facing left right forward
or backward as I'm actually flying the
drone so it makes it easy to tell what
direction I'm looking at
one thing people don't think about when
underwater is that there's a ton of
currents kind of like how there's a
breeze out in the open air underwater
has the currents that flow back and
forth and they're pulling the drone one
direction or the other constantly so
that's why you'll see with some of the
footage that the drone is tilted
sideways or floating back and forth with
the flow of the ocean luckily this drone
does have like a little stabilizing
feature that I can flip on and then it
keeps the drone kind of hovering in the
same position which is pretty cool most
of the flights we had today though that
feature was off and I was controlling it
all manually making sure that I avoided
the pole of the cable on the top which
wasn't really much of an issue because
of all the slack we had the 100 meter
cable was way longer than the 35 meter
dive down to the Corsair airplane as
well and all we've been flying this
thing underwater for about two hours now
and I'm down to about 28 percent battery
life which is pretty phenomenal
considering how long we were underwater
looking at that wreck and the turtles
and the divers one thing I want to point
out is that the drone can go in
saltwater and freshwater but there is a
weight here in the bottom that you need
to switch out so I had the weight for
seawater because this is the ocean I've
tested a couple underwater drones and
I'm pretty impressed with this one my
favorite thing about it obviously is the
headlights which is pretty nice
underwater when you're super deep in the
water there's not enough light and light
is required to see color so when there
is light produced by the drone there is
more color underneath the water we were
pretty deep so I'm not sure how the
footage is gonna turn out but uh you be
the judge let me know down in the
comments what you think so I took this
underwater for a bit hold it back up
took a break and took my air drone out
for a while
and the controllers are very very
different like let's say you're looking
at an object the cameras pointed the
object you can go left or right and kind
of like pan around the object the drone
you can't do that it's only a head-on
motion so what I would like to see the
one improvement I would like to make on
this keep the headlights keep the
waterproofness everything but make it so
that the drone can like pan left and
right and circle around an object
instead of just going forward and
backward up and down it would make for a
more cinematic feel to the footage
the GLaDOS drone does come with its own
storage container
it's got slots for the controller and
all of the drones and stuff which is
great no complaints there huge thanks to
Gladys for sending this drone out for me
to test overall it's a pretty fun drone
I'm not around water very much so I
don't know how often I'll use it an
aerial drone for me is a little more
economical but if I had to choose this
one with the headlights in the 4k I'm a
pretty big fan huge thanks to Steve here
for being our scuba diver and we got
Braxton right here our on boat cameraman
and we're here with the reef pirates
they took us out on their boat and a
huge thumbs up to Gladius from chasing
innovations they've made a fantastic
underwater drone hit that subscribe
button if you haven't already and thanks
a ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
