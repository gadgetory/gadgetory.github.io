I want to show you my most recent project.
My wall-mounted, water-cooled, super powerful
rendering computer.
I had a ton of fun making this video so I
hope you enjoy it.
Go ahead and click the link in the bottom
left-hand corner if you want to see the list
of parts that I used to build this computer.
So what I've done up to this point is I've
kind of figured out how much space all the
components take up on the board, and then
measured my board accordingly, and now I'm
kind of just drawing all of the outlines.
The power supply goes here, the SSD goes here,
hard drives go here, sound card, video card.
And when I sketch out kind of the basic placement
of it, I also sketch out where the wires are
going to bend down into the holes as they
go underneath to kind of keep it more clean.
Because with each of the wires, I'll take
kind of the biggest example, when this plugs
into the motherboard, it takes a second before
it can bend again, and so I have to compensate
for that bend so that it'll go down in this
hole.
So I kind of spread it out just a little bit
so it'll allow for a fold in the wire.
Same thing with all of the different power
cords here.
You have to space the hole out far enough
so that you don't kink the cable too drastically
as you can see like that.
Anyway, relatively simple.
Just kind of lining everything out right now.
Fabricating and figuring out how the acrylic
is going to work.
I took this board and cut the sides at 45
degree angles so that the light from the LEDs
would shine through better on the sides.
So that's kind of like my rough cut.
And then the SSD will sit just right on top
of that.
And so when the LEDs turn on with the acrylic
underneath, it's going to shine through the
edges.
And so now that I've kind of made that I can
start with the acrylic and make the real mounts.
And so the base is going to be here, the LEDs
are going to sit there, acrylic's going to
sit on top of that, and that's kind of how
it works.
All right, so I started with the biggest piece
of acrylic first, the one that goes for the
motherboard, and you can see the rough cut
on the edge there that the table saw left
as I was cutting it.
And then as I set the motherboard on top of
it, you can see that it just comes out a little
bit on every side so that the LED lights can
shine through it.
Pretty sweet.
Now to make the rest of them.
Here I have the LEDs.
And I started off, I cut a bunch of them up,
and I was planning on soldering them all together
but that is actually an extraordinary amount
of work, especially because each of these
little strips has five solder points on it.
So I'm going to avoid soldering that much
by taking that roll and rolling it here underneath
the wood, just kind of doing one big long
continuous strip all the way through the whole
box and that'll save me a whole lot of time
I think.
Drilled myself some pilot holes with the drill.
And now I'm going to cut them all out with
the jigsaw.
Then I'm going to build a frame around the
backside of it.
So I've already put on the two sides as you
can see here.
Basically I just put a thin strip of glue
along the top, and then drilled holes for
the sides.
And I'm being super careful with this hard
board right here, to not split it, so what
I'm doing is I'm taking a large bit, pre-drilling
just a small little hole on the top, and then
taking smaller bit for the shaft and drilling
that down inside where the top hole has already
been sunk.
Just so you can see how the frame is put together
this is the back of it, and I have wood glue
in the seam there, as well as screws along
the top.
So this is all the acrylics in place, they've
all been mounted, I'm just going to kind of
go through a little bit and tell you how I
did things.
This is for the graphics card.
So I have these two screws going down into
the plexiglass and then this one and this
one kind of coming out to hold it in place.
Then this line in the center is actually a
groove, it's a v-shaped groove so that LEDs
come up into the groove and then shine out
onto the edges which allow the light to shine
around all the sides like you've seen before.
This is for the audio card.
Same thing.
These go into the card.
This holds it down.
This is for the hard drives.
These four screws come up into the hard drives
into the pre-mounted holes that come with
the hard drives.
And then for the SSD, there was no really
good way to hold that on so I just used some
industrial velcro, which is good for 20 pounds,
and the SSD weighs like a third of a pound,
I don't know.
Super small.
Power supply.
I have some pretty hefty brackets on the back
that come in and screw onto the power supply
and then this piece of velcro just kind of
help hold it so it doesn't twist downward
at all which is kind of nice.
And this is for the fan.
Comes up and then these keep it elevated so
there's enough circulation underneath for
it to allow--and I can always change the elevation
depending on how big a screw I put in there.
This is for the motherboard.
I have one-inch standoffs.
Lifting the motherboard up and away from the
plexiglass.
And then these screws hold the plexiglass
down into the board.
And then I'm also going to have three screws
coming from the motherboard underneath the
wood as well so that's how that's going to
be mounted.
Anyway, pretty straightforward.
I'm just going to go through and kind of clean
up these holes right now before I put the
sticker over the top, the carbon fiber sticker.
And we'll go from there.
So now that the sticker's all on, I can go
ahead and mount the acrylic pieces and all
of the components back where they belong.
So the six terabytes of hard drive are actually
pretty uniquely mounted.
I put the screws in first, and then I screwed
the acrylic onto the bottom of the hard drives
afterward.
That way my screws are all ready to be slid
down inside of those holes.
I put a piece of electrical tape over the
top of the screws to that the PCD boards don't
ground out having a piece of metal so close
to them.
So hopefully that electrical tape will keep
enough insulation between the hard drives
and the screws themselves.
It still has that same little line right there
to help guide the light into the outside edges.
Mounting the power supply is a little bit
trickier.
What I ended up taking is some of these framing
brackets and just put some screws through
the frame of my case here and then screwed
it into three of the four power supply slots.
And I think honestly it's pretty sturdy.
I'm not worried at all about it coming off.
This is the motherboard now.
You can see I have the one-inch standoffs
kind of sticking up.
Three of them are replaced by just normal
screws, they're going to go and hold the motherboard
to the mount itself.
So all the standoffs are going to have their
own little screws as you can see like in that
corner and stuff.
And then the other two screws will just come
all the way through and there will be a little
bit of a gap right there where you can kind
of see that light shining through.
The CPU fan is a little bit different.
It's kind of mounted the same way that the
hard drives were.
I have these screws coming up from the bottom
of the plastic piece.
And then I have three more screws coming through
the back of it as you can see right there.
And then we have the same little v-shaped
slit in the plastic to help disperse the light.
I did it a little bit different on this one
though, I cut a hole out in the center, and
I also put the same carbon fiber stuff over
the top of this, and I put a hole in the center
so that when it's lit up, you won't be able
to see the LEDs from straight down, but the
light will kind of emanate from around the
edge of the fan.
Hopefully.
So that should be pretty cool.
So here's my workstation where I've been the
last couple weeks.
I've been waiting on a shielded PCI cable
which is this guy right here going down to
my graphics card.
The daisy chain one that I had before wasn't
really working out.
Sometimes the error code on the motherboard
would pop up that the display wasn't reading.
So I figured I was getting some kind of interference.
Probably where the PCI cord comes down close
to the motherboard.
Getting some kind of signal interference there.
Anyway, it's mostly all put together right
now.
Here's a view of the back of it, I still need
to do some wire maintenance back there and
then make sure that the LEDs are in the right
spots.
Basically I'm just going to tape those in,
probably with duct tape and electrical tape.
I'll do another shot as soon as I'm finished
with that.
I was going to mount it right between my 4K
TV and the shelf that I built last year, just
sitting right there on the wall, next to my
monitors.
Should turn out pretty well I think.
So here's the back of the computer.
I have a lot of duct tape covering up the
LEDs as they loop around underneath the acrylic
so that the light doesn't bleed out and then
come out through the cable slots.
I want those to kind of be darker than everything
else to not take away from the LED effect.
All right, we're making progress.
I moved the shelf over a stud, that way I
had room for the cables, obviously we need
a little more cable management going on.
Need a new power cable for the power supply,
that one's not quite long enough.
So those are ordered, they'll be here in a
couple days and then I can finish up my videos.
So one thing about this setup that I'm not
super fond of is that the heat from the motherboard
is rising up underneath the fan, and so it's
heating it up and it's running about ten degrees
Celsius hotter than than it was before.
Well, more like seven degrees Celsius hotter.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull
it back off the wall and extend this out about
another inch and that should give me a little
more airflow.
And then hopefully it'll just run quiet the
whole time.
