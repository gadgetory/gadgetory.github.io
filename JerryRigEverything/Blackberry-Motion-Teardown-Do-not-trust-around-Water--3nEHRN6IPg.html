durability test and now it's time to
tear it down see what makes it water
resistant and learn how to replace the
individual components let's get started
BlackBerry decided to forego the iconic
keyboard with this full screen flagship
which is totally fine with me
keyboards are cool but screen real
estate is much better
wrong mr. Mobile the physical keyboard
is the best reason to buy a blackberry
but please keep going don't let me stop
you yeah totally so there's no visible
screws than the exterior of this phone
but it is ip67 water-resistant I know
there is adhesive inside and heat
usually helps with that I'll use my heat
gun and then slip my thin metal pry tool
between the metal frame and the slick
rubber backing the whole back panel
comes off the phone surprisingly easy I
doubt I'll ever come off on its own but
normally the adhesive on water resistant
phones is much stronger than this
I actually fully agree with you there
I'm still sad about drowning my LGV 30
yeah but look at this adhesive it's
barely there getting inside an IP 60 a
phone like Samsung or LG is much more
difficult I would not trust this
blackberry motion around water okay
looks like there are six Phillips head
screws surrounding that top plate so
I'll just pull that black piece up and
away from the phone set that off to the
side
revealing quite a few isolinear optical
component things that use okay Zack I'm
sorry I should not have taken the mic
why don't you take over again I mean it
is my channel I've unplugged the battery
lego style connector and over here on
the left we have a very unique connector
in the middle of a cable bridging the
three of the volume power and better
Bigsby buttons it's interesting to see
the connector in the middle of the
ribbon instead of on the end I'll unclip
the extension ribbon at the bottom and
then the screen ribbon cable both
unsnapping like little Legos it's still
impossible to remove the battery at this
point so I'll mosey my way down to the
bottom of the phone and remove the seven
Phillips head screws which allow for the
loudspeaker and plastic shield to come
away from the phone this loudspeaker
does have a little rubber
around the opening which rests up
against the water-resistant mesh at the
bottom of the phone it is the largest
opening into the device so it's good to
have multiple layers of liquid
protection getting the battery out of
this phone was actually much harder than
I anticipated there are no visible pull
tabs that I noticed so I assumed prying
it out was my only option turns out I
was wrong
and the pull tabs there were three of
them are just tucked up underneath the
motherboard making a motherboard removal
pretty much mandatory if you want to
replace the battery just remember to
take out that SIM card tray first yeah
of course I usually always remember that
part it's got a little rubber ring to
help keep water from ingressing through
that little slot the motherboard has two
wire connections along the bottom right
side and then one more Lego connection
up at the top for the front sensors then
the whole motherboard can lift up and
out of the metal frame we've revealed
the front eight megapixel camera and the
rear 12 megapixel camera neither of
which have optical stabilization by the
way BlackBerry hasn't made a phone with
OIS since the Prive in 2015 which is
rather unfortunate a YS is really
helpful on a cell phone
luckily though now we have access to the
pull tabs hidden underneath the
motherboard like I said there were three
but now I'm down to one nice and it
broke the prize a mission at this point
with too fragile communication ribbons
underneath the battery though I highly
recommend against using very much force
fun fact the battery on the BlackBerry
motion is 4,000 milliamp hours making it
about 14% larger than the battery on the
previous key one saw an improvement see
what you can do when you remove the
keyboard as I get ready to remove the
charging port take a look at this golden
extension ribbon
it says Krypton on it you know the home
planet of Superman
I'll unclip that capacitive ribbon
button as well as the ever so useful
headphone jack and then pull the
charging port from the frame of the
phone which also includes the circular
vibration motor soldered into place
permanently normally we would see a
large rubber ring around the charging
port like there's been on Samsung's
iPhones and LG phones but this little
guy does not have much rubber at all the
waterproofing of this BlackBerry motion
seems abnormally week for an ip67 rating
pulling out the headphone jack and
bottom microphone we get
another rubber ring larger than the
charging ports for sure so at least some
holes are protected I'll tuck everything
back into place screen replacements are
definitely going to be difficult
LCDs that are glued into metal frames
are hard to remove successfully without
cracking and since I kind of want this
phone to work when I put it back
together I'm not going to attempt a
screen replacement until the screens
actually broken up with the battery in
next and I see here by the camera we
have another Krypton reference
yeah actually Krypton was the codename
for the BlackBerry motion before it was
released interesting one more thing to
point out before putting the phone back
together is this water damage indicator
when water does seep inside this phone
the circular white sticker will turn
pink and you can see if it's pink or not
simply by taking out the SIM card tray
and peeking inside
I'll get the motherboard back into place
with its two wire cables on the bottom
right side along with that golden
extension ribbon the screen ribbon and
the battery ribbon and the side buttons
get plugged in as well with that unique
connector okay I've got this part the
black plastic goes over the top of the
motherboard with its six Phillips head
screws and the salmon SD card tray can
slide right back into the slot it came
from nice work mr. mobile bottom
plastics are in place with yet another
codename krypton reference and then the
candy cane shaped back panel can latch
on over the top of the phone and click
down into place along the sides not too
bad not a super huge fan of how hard the
battery is to replace or that the water
resistance seems less than optimal yeah
not to mention the subpar camera sensor
that mushy haptic motor and that
fingerprint loveand display definitely
not given up Mikey 1/4 the motion though
I do admire the aesthetics to a point
one last little trivia bit it took
blackberry five rounds of laser etching
on the back panel to get the design and
texture had wanted it's always fun to
learn about the production process for
this stuff I think is a pretty good
looking foam I definitely like that
extra screen real estate huge thanks to
the BlackBerry living Michael Fisher for
jumping into the video with me and check
out his channel for some pretty in-depth
and cinematic tech reviews hey sorry for
all the interruptions and a huge thanks
for having me on Zack
also my dad says hey I think he likes
your videos even more than he likes mine
well he must have excellent taste in
YouTube videos
I think the tongue for watching
and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
