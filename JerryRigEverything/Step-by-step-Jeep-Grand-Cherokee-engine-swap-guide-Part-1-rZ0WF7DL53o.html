that's a 95 the Jeep threw a rod about
two years ago and it's been sitting
around ever since you can kind of tell
that from the went through the rot the
oil came up through the this end down in
here into the air filter this up you can
see there's a bunch of oil down inside
of there that's what's kind of a
giveaway that it threw a rod needs a new
engine we're going to do a engine swap
on it started the front grill has three
screws here here you're in there you son
screw those three things go comes up and
off okay so to take out the radiator it
comes up in parts there's a bolt here
here here here times there's four along
the top and then there's two more
underneath the bottom so on the front
grille right above the license plate
here and here and the whole thing should
just lift out but I finally got the
radiator out there's a few more hoses
and connectors that needed to come off
as well um there's this one right here
and there's two more at the very bottom
of the radiator I'm a big tube and a
little tube I will show you with those
ones or so that top one was here and
then the big tube little too I took them
off at the other end where it connects
to the motor that way guys have to take
apart less things as I'm taking out the
engine so to get the whole thing apart I
did have to take apart the fan that made
it the easiest give me a lot more room
to work with once I had the fan out and
the plastic shroud out the whole thing
giving more room to get the radiator out
to move the cables around the big hoses
then you always have to do is make sure
to put all those back where you got them
just to make sure that there's no chance
of you losing them later on because
there's going to be a lot of leftover
bolts and stuff like that if you do that
so better to stay organized so we
started taking apart the power steering
the pump for this the reservoir it's the
same way to get the belt off of the
engine you undo
there's a few different slider bolts on
the track down inside here there's
another one on the back there you want
to do those slider bolts and loosen this
one up as well and this one sorry the
Sun is kind of in the way there the
whole the whole system just kind of
shifts down a little bit you can see
that it kind of it tracks up and down on
those little runners and then once it
tracks down the belt just kind of slides
off of the whole thing remember where it
goes so when you're putting it back all
the components are turning in the right
direction that's an easy way to damage
some stuff right here above the radiator
when all the pieces are intact there's a
little map all these here on the on the
Jeep Cherokee that tells how the belt is
routed I have another engine for this
vehicle right here and you can tell the
tracks that are right here safely the
tracks are right here in right here and
that's where the the reservoir can track
in and out and release the belt so that
is how you take off the serpentine belt
now Jeep Cherokee so as you can see
we've off the power steering fluid
reservoir started taking apart this
thing for the AC pretty simple this part
up at the top these are 13 millimeter
bolts there's four one I believe this
was a 10 millimeter these two tubes are
connected to it it is pressurized so
remember that when you take them off
there is also one little wire right here
you have to disconnect from the back
freeze simple you just have to lift up
the little plug that goes in there and
it snaps right out is pretty simple then
the whole thing just lifts up and away
from the motor so to take off your
alternator there's a few bolts on the
top you have to take off this one's a 15
millimeter that one is also a 15
millimeter on the back of this bigger
the longer one there's a nut that you
have to put the 15 millimeter socket on
then you can just ratchet it out
on the back of the alternator there's a
few different plugs there's this guy
right here which has four connectors on
it if you can see it it's got I'm show
you on the back of the alternator then
right here let's get and wow this sounds
really in the way there all right so
right here I believe these three are 10
millimeters on this one is a seven
millimeter is disconnect all those are
pretty simple there nothing is really
stuck on there to that and that is the
whole deal I believe there is this red
wires the one that's connected to the in
this black section right here that's how
to take out the alternator
all right so now we're taking the all
the wiring and electrical stuff off the
engine kind of there's a lot going on so
I was kind of explain what I remember
just this one comes out these two come
out these two just slide off so I saw on
the wiring everything inside this
harness right here needs to come off
basically it's all these little clips on
this connector there's one this guy was
all the way down the bottom and
basically it's just anything that looks
like it's going to come off take it off
so it doesn't rip off the engine when
you're pulling it out trying to think of
anything else I don't know what
basically I've been doing I've just been
taking a look at this engine and taking
a look at this one and just seeing you
know what this one has and what the
other one doesn't I'm just going off of
there so this one's wired a little bit
different than my other engine so I'm
just taking this out replacing with the
one I have these cables look shot so I'm
replacing them with the ones that I have
those are already in there just kind of
like that
so pretty straightforward just start
taking things apart alright so I'm on
the underside of a Cherokee I'm at the
starter motor I'm pretty simple to take
off there's a bolt here that's a 14
millimeter I believe bolt behind right
here I already took off is a 15
millimeter then we have this bull right
here which is an 8 in this bolt right
here which is a 12 millimeter you take
off these ones to get the electrical
side of it off and then these bolts of
the mounting bolts and the whole thing
as you can see just kind of already got
the bolts off just Wiggles off and comes
right out pretty simple
alright so here I am underneath the
engine this is the exhaust where it
connects to the engine just make sure to
take this off as well I believe is 2 14
millimeter bolts the whole thing just
kind of slide apart like that then it's
disconnected and ready to remove from
the engine
it makes it a whole lot easier is when
way back there on the top of the bell
housing right above where the
transmission connects to the engine
there's a two bolts that are 14
millimeter sitting at the top of that
but the way that the firewall is sitting
over the transmission it's super hard to
get the the bolts to turn so what I
found as these little wrenches right
here with the with the ratcheting socket
on them where they can bend at that
angle that's the easiest way to get that
bolt out I've heard a lot of people
complaining that there's Starr bolts on
the back of this this engine that you
need like an e 12 socket for but on this
engine this is a 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee
there weren't those star bolts there
were just the 14 millimeter just the
regular ones that are all around the
bell housing so just be ready for that
but yeah without this tool I could not
have gotten those off so that very for
that I made some progress
it's basically what happened is down
there on my flywheel the engine had
ceased I wasn't able to turn the
flywheel at all to unscrew the torque
converter you slide under here and show
you what's going on right up in here
this big round thing is a torque
converter this is the flywheel I'm on
the flywheel there's little bolts
those are the bullets they go out of the
flywheel they were sense that it sees it
wouldn't spin so I only get three of the
four out so I had to just pull the whole
torque converter out with the with the
flywheel most people on the internet
said not to do it that way but we'll see
if it works also to pull it straight out
the motor mount was getting in our way
so we just went ahead just deke detached
the motor mount to make it a easier I
believe those was a 15 millimeter bolt
this came right out and then just as we
went we just make sure to disconnect all
the extra wires and stuff there's
another one down here by the oil filter
the fuel line was also given us some
issues what I did is I came in up to the
fuel line and I undid this little screw
I'll show you on this other engine on
the fuel line it's a little bit
different
you'd undo this and release all the
pressure inside and I disconnected these
and then I disconnected the hose I'd
left it connected as well because it's
pressurized and I didn't want to deal
with attaching a whole new hose to it
anyway as far as connecting the engine
to the hoist goes now I might just use
these big bolts right here a little
chain and then O'Reilly Auto Parts was
pretty cool I just do it to deposit with
them and then they give me a lift
350 bucks and then when I return the
lift they give me back my deposit so
kind of like renting for free anyway
other than that we're just about to
clear the whole thing so that's about it
I've got the engine most of the way up I
just want to show you some of the
carnage right here this is from when it
threw the rod
punctured a hole right in the engine
there you can see our this isn't
supposed to be coming out if your engine
if this spins if your flywheel spins
make sure you just take off the flywheel
bolts make things a lot easier for you
let's see if there's anything on this
side little pins good holy crap
this is not supposed to be there look at
that
 up over right through the head
whoo all right let's get this thing out
of here all right so now that it's in
the back of my dock we can work on
taking apart the torque converter as you
can see down inside that crack is the
bolts tor converter still hasn't
spinning just because the EES engine is
seized up you can see this hole right
here and that would explain why it's not
turning same here hole on this side
anyway um I can get my wrench down in
there though and you can see that I'm
turning the bolts so hopefully I get
those turned enough to get the whole
torque converter off
