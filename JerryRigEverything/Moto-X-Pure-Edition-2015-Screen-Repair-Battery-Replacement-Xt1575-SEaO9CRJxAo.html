Moto X pure edition this is the phone
that came out in 2015
luckily everything inside is pretty
straightforward I'll be walking you
through the whole process on the back of
the phone here there is a SIM card tray
that also holds the SD card just put
your little SIM card tool in there and
then right here next that tray there's a
little hole and if you stick your SIM
card removal tool in that hole it'll
start removing the back of the phone
from the housing once I had that little
corner up I slipped a card in there I
found that the glue was very very strong
though and I ended up dropping the card
and just using my hands to pull it away
from the phone body I have heard of
people using heat to soften the glue and
that would make it a little bit easier
to pull away from the body but there's
not a whole lot that can go wrong here I
will show you a few ribbon cables you
have to avoid here in a second but
basically all you're doing is pulling
away the back panel from the phone
itself make sure you do watch out for
these orange cables underneath though if
you tear those you will lose your volume
and power buttons which are pretty darn
important you can see all the adhesive
that is holding back the plastic panel
on to the phone itself once the plastic
panel is pulled away from the phone you
can see all the excess glue you can
remove this if you want it'll probably
make a little bit easier to put the back
on when you're done I will be linking
all of the tools you'll need for this
project down in the video description
below there are 20 screws here they're
all sized t4 once you remove all those
screws there are a couple ribbon cables
you have to pop out as well as this
little plastic camera shield and then
down here there's these pull tabs these
pull tabs make it extraordinarily easy
to remove the battery from the inside of
the device so pull these tabs if you
pull them out horizontal with the phone
it will make it so that the battery is
not stuck to the back panel anymore when
you pull on this adhesive it becomes
unsticky and just slides out from the
back of the phone
here's how to unplug the battery
sometimes this will solve any software
issues so instead of unscrewing the back
panel and releasing the battery you can
just unplug the battery and see if it'll
solve any of your software problems
after the battery is unplugged you can
lift off the back panel before we jump
onto the motherboard let me show you a
little bit about the back panel flipping
it over and you can see how easily the
battery just pops away from the back
since we've already removed those pull
tabs you can see that the NFC connector
right there on top of the
batteries well I'm just going to pop
that off and there's the battery here
are the volume ribbon cable connections
as well as the led the dual LED flash
and they just plug down on the
motherboard with this little waffle
connector right there just like a little
Lego snaps on to the phone and snaps off
pretty straightforward here's the
headphone jack pretty common with
Motorola to have the little pins that
just rest on top of the motherboard and
that's how the headphone jack receives
its communication so if you ever have
anything you know get stuck in there or
dirt or grime or anything like that it's
pretty easy to clean out just pops away
from the back panel
so here's a little ribbon cable for the
rear-facing camera it is 21 megapixels
just has a little latch that you unlatch
and then you can slide the camera out
from its little connection here is a
little circuit board on top of the SIM
card and SD card tray just unlatch that
from the motherboard just like a little
Lego here is the front-facing camera
also has that same Lego connection it is
a 5 megapixel camera and then here's the
vibrator motor I thought this was
interesting it has the dual vibrations
on either side and there are different
sizes so it gives you a more full
vibration because it has a small and a
larger side similar to one of the Xbox
controllers here's one of the screen
ribbon cables I'm just going to remove
the tape flip up the latch and that'll
let the ribbon cable slide out of its
little slot then there's one more screw
down at the bottom of the phone that's
holding the motherboard into place so
we're going to remove that and then that
lists the bottom of the motherboard
slide up and the top of the motherboard
pop out of its little connection on the
frame for the screen so here is the
screen this is the part that you want to
buy if your LCD is black or if you have
a crack in your glass of the screen
motorola has been good in the past about
selling the screen that is already
attached to the frame of the screen so
it's pretty easy to install once you
have this particular part if you buy a
screen that does not have the frame
installed you'll have to remove the
plastic frame from your old screen and
installed on the new one usually using
heat and a bunch of pry tools there is
much easier if you buy the screen with
the frame intact here is the motherboard
again with the charging port down at the
bottom the charging port is not
replaceable which is unfortunate usually
charging ports are one of the first
things that go out on a cell phone
besides a cracked screen putting it all
back together the motherboard does have
that one screw at the bottom go ahead
and screw that into place and then get
the circuit board that rests on top of
the SIM card tray plug that in you'll
feel it snap into place here's a
close-up shot of the ribbing
cable connector for the screen who is
going to slide it into little plug and
then latch the black plastic part down
and that holds it into place has the
same exact connection as the rear facing
camera going to latch that down then
we're going to put the tape back onto it
as well the tape just make sure that the
latch does stay down and keeps any
debris away from those connections we
don't want anything shorting out while
you're using the phone getting the front
camera back into place latching it down
with a little Lego connector and then
sliding the battery back in as well you
can put a little piece of double-sided
tape in there to hold it down if you'd
like putting the NFC back on top of the
battery and then laying the back panel
back on top of the phone pretty
straightforward clamp it into place all
around the edges and then make sure the
battery is plugged back in as well as a
little rubber protective piece on the
top of that as well then here's the
little connector for the power button
and volume buttons so once that's
connected everything should be done and
I'm going to test the phone before I put
the 20 screws back into place everything
looks like it went smoothly the phone is
turning on and it vibrated I'm going to
go ahead and take all of those 20 t4
screws and put those back into place now
the back panel is pretty easy as well if
you're new back panel didn't come with
any adhesive you can just take
double-sided tape put it around the
outside the more the better just make
sure you don't put any adhesive that
will rest on top of the ribbon cables
for the volume and power buttons
otherwise next time you take off the
back your phone it'll rip those right
off and render your phone unusable
