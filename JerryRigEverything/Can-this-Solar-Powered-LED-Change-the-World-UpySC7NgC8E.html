people on the planet without access to
consistent electricity right now these
people with no electricity turn to
slightly more dangerous methods to
illuminate their homes at night like
putting kerosene in small jars with the
wick and starting it on fire Lantern
style kerosene is a dangerous poisonous
chemical that winburn provides a smoky
yellow light naturally this is dangerous
and doesn't even provide much light
millions of kids every year are severely
burned when the lamp gets accidentally
knocked over
not to mention families can end up
spending 20 to 30 percent of their
income on kerosene meaning that the
money isn't being spent on more useful
things like food or education luckily
with advances in technology there is a
solution watts of love is a nonprofit
organization that provides safe clean
sustainable solar powered LED lights to
families I think it's time to take one
apart and see what this safe alternative
is made of let's get started LEDs have
been around for quite a while now but
only through the combined advancements
of battery technology and solar cells
with a product like this currently
possible right now with multiple LEDs
spread out on the front and a large
solar panel on the back this light is
capable of turning into a headlamp
necklace Lantern or wrist strap after a
full day's charge in the Sun it provides
a hundred and twenty hours of light on
the lowest illumination setting super
impressive the solar light produces 275
lumens at the highest setting and also
has a strobe light for emergency
situations it harvest the sun's free
power during the day to get free light
at night the outer housing is made from
thick black plastic and has a microUSB
port for quick charging or power is
available we'll see what size the
internal battery isn't just a second if
we can get it open this is a product
that's designed to be extra durable and
last a while the front lens for the LEDs
is made from clear plastic and the back
polycrystalline solar panel is also
covered and protected with clear
protective plastic it has little feet on
the housing to keep the panel elevated
from whatever surface it might be set on
thumbs up for that little design perk
getting inside the light is rather
difficult with no external screws it
looks like everything is permanently
molded shut which is fine this is a
product that needs to
never fall apart or break open in harsh
conditions my razor is no match for this
light my hacksaw on the other hand seems
to be a bit more successful after all
four sides are cut through with my saw
the two halves of the solar lighting pop
open revealing a pretty large 2,000
milliamp hour battery a larger capacity
than the iPhone eight it's easy to see
why the LEDs can last for so long there
is a rubber sealant all around the
inside edges of the rear solar panel and
we can also see the black and red
positive and negative connections from
the solar panel soldered into the
circuitry on the motherboard which in
turn charges the battery surprisingly
enough the whole light is still working
it's always a good sign of build quality
when something can be ferociously
dismantled and still function let's see
if we can pop the motherboard out of the
top housing to get a closer look this
thing really isn't meant to come apart
finally we get the clear slightly
diffused - lens housing popped away from
the motherboard and everything is
surprisingly still working the center
push button in the middle of the board
is what switches the light on and off
and changes through the different
lighting modes we have 11 LEDs circling
the center and a microUSB port over on
the side super simple and super durable
exactly how it should be try walking
around your own house tonight in the
dark sometimes we take things for
granted I think everyone should have
easy access to light when they need it
I've donated five thousand dollars to
kick off a campaign with watts of love
to bring these LED lights to Guatemala
and the Philippines I'll put the link in
the description the watts of love is a
nonprofit that has a solid product and
is accomplishing good things obviously
you don't have to donate anything just
liking and sharing this video would
count as contributing as well this is
the first time I've ever done a donation
like this on my channel before so I'm
curious to see what happens and how much
good we can accomplish as a jerry-rigged
everything community I know that light
is important everyone should have safe
access to it and these solar powered
LEDs are infinitely better than
flammable kerosene together we can light
the world safely the link is in the
description if you feel like donating
either way hit that subscribe button if
you haven't already share this video and
come hang out with me on Twitter and
Instagram thanks ton for watching and
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
