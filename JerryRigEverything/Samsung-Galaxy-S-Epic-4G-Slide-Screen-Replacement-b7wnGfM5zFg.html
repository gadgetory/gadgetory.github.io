Galaxy S 4G epic slide phone it's called
the d700 there's a seven screws around
the base there on the outside of it I'm
gonna fast forward this just we don't
waste any time
for myself is pretty easy to take apart
it's not a whole lot of screws inside
anyway make sure you keep them all the
screws in the same place oh I did all
the screws around the outside kept them
in that little file to pull apart the
foam disc a little pry tool and kind of
pry between the back housing and the
frame of the phone it'll be a little bit
tough to get out there's little clips
that surround the outsides I have to do
is pop them out one by one kind of see
me lifting up the edge of the case here
and just reaching the pry tool under and
kind of twisting a little bit to get it
to to pop out you'll see it click out
here in a second in the whole case
slips off there's a few ribbon cables
there's this one on the side for the
main screen and there's one more along
the top right here you just pick those
up they snap back into place really easy
so down here is the the bottom speaker
housing there's one screw on it you just
take off that screw and then the whole
thing just kind of clips out of place
it's pretty simple it has a 1
cable that goes up to the top and it has
one little tiny clip in the bottom of it
so you can just lift that off with your
pry tool and then just kind of feed it
out through those little brackets to
hold the wire in place
motherboard itself just lifts out
there's no screws holding it in place
the audio jack if you want to take this
out like if you're out of checks come
bad you just lift up the little tiny
black lever at the bottom of it and if
you pull gently the audio jack will come
right out it's a little ribbon cable
that attaches it slide it back in latch
the black part back down and that's how
you would replace one of those if you
need to
okay to separate the board itself from
the screen to get to the sliding
mechanism you lift up the sticker down
at the bottom make sure you keep this
because if you ever need to you know
warranty out your phone or anything they
need that sticker with the DC and all
the X numbers on and everything so you
can see the four screws they're silver
this one
those screws are done the whole panel
just kind of lifts up by itself you can
see the ribbon cable for the top so the
keypad itself is just a little thin
piece of plastic I can just lift that
out there's nothing really all the in
place just little brackets that kinda
you know keep it in place but don't hold
it permanently there to remove this last
bracket from the front screen there's
four more screws there black ones you
can kind of see oh I'm keeping all the
screws separated on the side there
putting the black one in there a little
pile just so you don't get them confused
later on
then it separates super easily from the
phone you got to pry it all just feed
the ribbon cable through that bracket
then you can see the sliding mechanism
on the screen right here so to put it
back into place make sure that you line
up well we make sure you have the border
oriented in the right direction so it
sits down correctly and then make sure
you hold the ribbon cable out of the way
you don't want to damage that
but the four black screws back in place
slide the keypad back into the swap
where it was before just kind of sits in
there by itself
now here
important to make sure you sit that
little bracket right back down inside
the slot there that way it sits
underneath the motherboard in the exact
position where it needs to be to clip
back down onto the motherboard again
it's not in the right spot you'll have
to take off this board oh all over again
and reposition it right put the four
smaller silver screws back into place
you
like I mentioned before using
sure to keep that sticker
with all the information at the phone on
it
motherboard pops back in
so right now I'm popping on the little
wire for the bottom speaker it clips on
the bottom most a little round thing on
the motherboard and it clips in right
there you just kind of position the
cable back into the slots where it was
before snap the black part into place
and screw down that one screw that was
holding it in
and there's that screw you know right
now I'm just popping those ribbon cables
back into place there's only two of them
on this phone so it's pretty simple
taking the back housing flipping it into
place and making sure that I get the
buttons back into place as well so the
volume button and the power button
I'm just there's nothing really holding
them in place we just lift up the back
in a little bit slide them in and then
before they fall out again just clip the
the case closed
and that one in place once both the
buttons are where they're supposed to be
pop all those screws back into where
they're supposed to be at
just go around the edges and kind of
hold the phone in one piece and make
sure everything looks like it should and
that's how you fix a Galaxy S epic slide
phone from Sprint you might be have any
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
