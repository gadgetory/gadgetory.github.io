5 and then an iPhone 5c and I was going
to see if we could switch out the
screens on them if the iPhone 5 screen
and the iPhone 5c screen rain or
changeable
as you can see they look pretty much the
same between the two of them but the
connectors on the two are completely
different so you have right here these
two don't line up this one and this one
don't line up and then this far one
looks like they switched it to to a
horizontal but anyway so you have to get
a different screen if you're going to
work on the 5c you can't switch the
screens between the two all right also
had a question to see if the battery
from the iPhone 5c would fit into the
iPhone 5 because there are the iPhone 5c
batteries just a little bit bigger
it's got 5.7 3 watt hours and this one
has 5.45 if you're looking at the
milliamps and you got 15 10 and this one
has 1440 so this one you know it's not
substantial there it is a little bit
bigger than the iPhone 5 anyway but
looking at the connectors this one has
three pins inside of it where the
battery connects to the phone and this
one has four pins inside of it where the
battery connects to the phone so Apple
did change the connectors on the battery
force so there is no swapping out the
batteries anyway figured that would be
interesting to somebody if you have any
other questions make sure to ask me in
