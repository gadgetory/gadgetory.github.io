little help getting a clip for a video
he's making about alternative energy I
think if something has to do with
windmills and luckily my navikev has
arrived so this is my first time playing
with the magic air and the reason I like
this one so much is because it's a kind
of a combination between regular Mavic
throw and the spark that was released
last year it's basically a Mavic pro
that can fold up and collapse into the
size of a spark so I got the fly more
package which should come with a couple
extra batteries and some prop guards
which is good because we're taking more
than one drone and I don't think they're
both gonna make it back when you're
flowing around windmills things can get
dangerous here's those prop guards I was
talking about drone should be in one of
these bags got the batteries in here
these look a lot different than both the
spark and the Phantom and the Mavic so I
don't think they're interchangeable
anymore remember with the magic platinum
and maverick Pro those batteries were
interchangeable these ones are not this
should be a eunuch hair wow that is
sweet they're actually calling this the
flame red and it is a completely
different design than what I was
expecting I was expecting something a
little bit more like the spark I'll make
a video where I show all these
side-by-side and stuff a little bit
later but right now we got to get going
let's just keep our fingers crossed that
this one comes back and if one wrecks it
stands so initial impressions this is
about as small as I anticipated it being
one thing I was expecting was that the
propellers would Bend you know and fold
in half like they do with the previous
medics the propellers have no flex to
them the front arms pull out just like
normal and then the back arms fold out
like they do with the previous Mavic and
that's pretty sweet and it's got these
little tiny legs right here as well for
like the landing gear on the front but
not the back I imagine that's to keep
the camera a little bit elevated from
the ground I feel like everything's
redesigned just a little bit different
so with this front gimbal protection
thing you unclip down here at the bottom
and then it pops off the top that's
completely different than all of the
other gimbals on all the previous DJI
drones the 4k sensor inside is
stabilized on a gimbal
and it looks like the batteries eject in
a similar fashion it's got these little
pull tabs down here you can tuck it back
inside and it's locked and loaded
doesn't come with a charge that is a
problem so not only is this a smaller
form factor than the previous Mavic but
it also has more safety features that
has centers on the back and the front so
if you're flying backwards you can't
crash in anything which is a plus
because I fly backwards a lot getting
that shot as you're backing up and
panning around is perfect someone put
these prop guards on just for kicks and
giggles in case it bumps into anything
it slips right down here through the
bottom and then this top latches and
closes and that way when this is
spinning around nothing can come from
the bottom and hit it and nothing can
come from the side and hit the props and
stop them because once one of these
stops the whole drilling just plummets
and we're trying to avoid that it looks
like these bumpers actually snap into
each other giving a little bit more
protection not too bad that is quite the
cage of protection right there okay
we're set my charge some batteries we'll
get out of here
one thing I don't get is why people are
kind of opposed to wind turbines I mean
I get that they kind of like block the
view but they're pretty sweet-looking
and if you think about it the reason
they're called renewable energy is
because they're sustainable we can keep
making more of it I mean I haven't seen
any dinosaurs walking around recently
and oil is a thing of the past it's not
coming back which includes gasoline and
coal and everything else that's taken
millions of years to develop
so getting the drones ready to fly
around those wind turbines we have the
irregular Mavic this is the Platinum and
this is what I was talking about with
the wings that fold open and shut one
thing that is interesting with the Mavic
I mean obviously there's the size
difference the Mavic air is considerably
smaller than the Maverick Pro but the
gimbal as well so the gimbal right here
is pretty free floating and the gimbal
inside of here is protected on both
sides when we're looking at the
controller's we can see that the
Maverick pro has a little bit of a
display right here which gives some
information while you're flying which is
incredibly nice the Mavic air is more
like the Mavericks Park controller where
it doesn't have the display and it's
more just everything is on your phone
okay so the goal of today is to not lose
either of the drones as we're flying
around these wind turbines
I think there's nine turbines and each
of them can produce 2.1
wads of electricity sounds like a lot
like something out it back to the future
so thanks ACK for helping me out I am
NOT the greatest drone pilot I tend to
crash my drones and so I just need a few
b-roll shots for a video that we're
making with Bill and Melinda Gates on
sustainable energy so I asked sach and
he's like let's go by this giant wind
farm and fly the drones around it so
we're going to be careful we're going to
be safe we are in a safe location we'll
try not to get too close or dangerous it
doesn't look like these things are
moving all that quickly but in reality
they are huge they are so big so we're
gonna try to keep our distance and not
get too close just to get some good
b-roll I just need like three seconds of
footage and the way we're gonna do this
is that if you look at all of the
turbines over there remember that these
each of these propellers are like the
size of a semi but there's one tucked
behind the mountain over there that's
not moving so the drone can probably get
a little closer to that one then it can
all the rest of these
so it's super windy right now so the
drone is compensating a lot for like the
air movement in this canyon I do think
it's interesting though your drone is
more shaky than the Mavic you can you
can
super annoying dude I can't get the
drone to go more than 193 feet from me
so all of the footage you just saw none
of that was from the DJI air it has a
limiter in it when you're first starting
out so you can't fly too high and you
can't fly too far I adjusted both of
those and even turned off the distance
limiter and it still would not let me do
what I wanted to do which is extremely
frustrating this one is working really
really well I was quiet the whole time
he's over here I don't remember what he
was saying but he was super frustrated
when I'm over there just silent just
like look at these shots they're amazing
so if you see any shots right here these
are my shot yeah I'm pretty proud of him
dan did better today with the drone than
I did so I know that you have skills it
definitely was a not user error on this
one it is really frustrating and like
this isn't my first drone like I've had
basically every DJI that's come out and
so like I know what I'm doing when I'm
flying around at these things but the
settings on this were just even though
the settings were correct the drone
still would not fly and farther than
like beginner mode so if you haven't
seen Dan's video yet head over there and
leave a comment saying I came here for
the windmill and we'll see how many
people go over from my channel so that
just goes to show not every project goes
as planned I had a completely different
idea of how this video is gonna go but
that happens tech doesn't always act the
way you want it to and that's my review
of the Mavic air alright so I'm gonna
try this again because I've never gotten
a bad product from DJI like everything
I've gotten from them just works and so
it's weird that this one is not working
and it won't fly farther than just a
very short distance from me so in a mess
remount the settings a little bit and
see if I can figure out what is going on
with this and reach a final verdict
right here once and for all so it has
been about two days since I last flew
this and there is yet another update so
it's updating the Maverick air right now
and maybe that'll fix the problem but to
be honest I feel like every time I turn
on one of these drones there's some kind
of update going on okay moment of truth
that made me calibrate the compass one
more time
but I think we're ready to fly all right
let's see if we get farther than 200
feet this time and it did it so we are
currently 600 feet away and there are no
warning messages at all so it must have
been that last firmware update that it
needed to perform but the funny thing is
is that I did all the updates before I
left and everything was fine and it said
it was ready to fly but then it just
never did anything so a couple days
later it finally pushed that last update
and now we're good to go so I take back
most everything bad I said about DG I
previously I'm happy that this is now
working and I will keep you updated on
whether or not it continues to function
as we go along so it really must have
been that last update cuz now you can
see it as entirely stable but when we
first started flying around it was
wobbling around in the air so even
though it said there were no updates
left when I first started flying
apparently there was one and now
everything's fixed
kind of makes sense I'm glad we were
able to update this and figure out what
was going on with the drone thanks ton
for watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
