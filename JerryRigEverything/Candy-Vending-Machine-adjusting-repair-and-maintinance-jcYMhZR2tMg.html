part three get candy vending machine
Wednesdays into ghetto you how to take
it apart set the candy settings put a
lock on the top kind of all the basics
that you need to know to operate one of
these guys first step stomp those out
alright so in order to adjust the candy
setting each one of these you got to
remove these two screws down at the
bottom and that one right there and the
whole head will come up off of the
plastic bar on the bottom taking that
out as well so I got those three screws
out this part itself comes up never
really need to mess around with this
part those two screws right there just
kind of keep these Springs in place you
never really need to mess those unless
you're going to clean them out so this
is what it just lets the candy flow down
through it so you can adjust this top
part right here put those little grooves
up here at the top so the wider that it
is the more candy will flow down to
small it is the last Daniel's bow down
so if you're going to skittles or
smaller on candies you want to do
something like that we're going to do
Eminem's like the peanut ones you want
to do something like this or like the
mixed nuts would be on the far position
like that this whole portion comes out
as well you know if you ever want to
take it out and clean it so now during
this whole plastic piece including all
of the these mechanisms you got to take
off this bolt that both this one and
that one so there's four that you got to
remove
okay so levels were a nine millimeter on
all those sides and it takes a second to
pop it out away from the
the holsters like the little place where
you screw on the nut but this itself is
the where the candy falls through so
here we have the coin mechanism so
that's where the the can you fall
through in those little dark places
right there and the coin mechanisms
themselves they all come apart as well
returning time to get the coin mechanism
down all you have to do is unscrew this
right here on the side and then rotate
this so that it's not connecting to that
metal part anymore so to spin it see if
we can do this with the camera
spinning like that and it's not holding
into the side anymore and this whole
place reaching around to the front will
just kind of pull out I can get a better
shot off in the front you can see that
that has a clip on the side right there
so when that clips in this side the
other end that we just unscrew it has
that little middle part that sticks on
the other side to hold the whole thing
in so that's how that parts held in the
rest of this just kind of slides up and
out of the little hole so there what's
holding that in is the coin mechanism
itself so I'm going to show you how the
coin Buddhism itself works so when
you're turning this it stops unless
there's a quarter down inside so when
there's a quarter inside and you turn
the quarter allows the mechanism to spin
all the way through
spits the quarter out the other side
stops again time gravity does help you
out as well okay so to install a lock
there's quite a few pieces here I'll
kind of explain which one does this is
the main part right here that needs to
come up to the bottom doesn't really
matter which way this one goes this
piece right here it goes on top of that
main lock piece to hold it down so once
you have that fee down let me take this
amount over here and you upper over the
top of that to hold the whole thing snug
so once that's honest as you can get it
take the lock mechanism yourself doesn't
really matter which way it goes in I
stick a through the bottom now you see
on that it's got a little square head so
this is the part where you choose how
far you have your key to turn yeah these
two little gizmos right here this is if
you want your key to turn 180 degrees
this is if you want your key to turn
just 90 degrees there's a little
stopping point right there which makes
it you know go one way or the other does
stopped on those little grooves but I
put the 90-degree one on it you can kind
of see as I turn it there that it's
catching there I turn the key 90 degrees
it catches there on that side and so
that's what decides what keys turn so
once that's in place all right I'm going
to take that piece right there and now
position it on the top
just like that when you take your screw
and you're screwing the top of that to
hold everything in place right so now at
the keys in place I can spin it
whichever way I want so this is the open
position this is the closed so as you
can see in the open position that climbs
onto that little piece right there close
it over the top lock it that won't open
up anymore so anyway that's how you want
to change the lock on a three headed
vending machine as well as take it apart
and adjust all the candy and stuff so I
usually put up videos you know a couple
times a week you know different projects
like this just fixing everything and
showing you how to do life
so anyway any questions go ahead and
leave in the comments and don't forget
