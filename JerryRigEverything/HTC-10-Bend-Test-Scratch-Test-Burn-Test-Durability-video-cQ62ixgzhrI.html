desk I do durability tests on phone so
you can get an idea of what your phone
will look like after two years of daily
use without having to wait two years to
see it this has been one of my most
requested phones recently probably
because the HTC m9 did not do so well
with my tests last year
sorry about that HTC let's jump in and
see what happens with this year's model
the HTC 10 I've tested over 20 phones
now and most of them survive these
extreme situations only three phones so
far have catastrophic ly failed let's
start with the scratch test I have a set
of picks that tell me where the screen
falls on Mohs scale of hardness if the
phone has a tempered glass screen like
the Gorilla Glass 4 on this HTC 10 it'll
start scratching at level 6 with a deep
scratch using a level 7 pick this
smartphone is on par with the rest of
the major flagships
one of the features I'm most excited
about for this phone is the 5 megapixel
front camera with oh is image
stabilisation
a world first and luckily this year they
decided to protect the front camera with
glass instead of using a plastic lens
like last year's m9 I'll do a front and
rear camera test with the HTC soon so
make sure you're subscribed so you don't
miss it
let's get back to scratching the HTC
logo is integrated into the back
aluminum so it will scratch equally with
the rest of the device it won't be
popping off like the lumia 950 or the
Nexus 6
this phone is pure metal and not covered
by plastic or primer fun fact the back
metal of this phone scratches at a level
5 the plastic e LG g5 scratched at a
level 3 when I scratch the back of the
phone with keys you can see the scratch
initially but they can easily be rubbed
off and almost entirely disappear it's
like magic I always recommend the case
no matter what but it's still nice to
see how durable this phone is without it
thumbs up if you're glad my phone is
being tested and not yours the 12
megapixel rear camera is protected by a
very thick glass layer way thicker than
last year's m9 which actually cracked
during my lens scratch test you won't
have to worry about this lens being
damaged easily even though it does stick
up a little bit from the back of the
device the side buttons on this phone
are made of metal as well which is
awesome there
much less likely to distort or warp with
long-term use like a plastic button
would check out the ridges on this power
button
beastly the ridges are sharp so it's
easy to find and press the power button
in the dark or as you're pulling it out
of your pocket onto the flame test the
LCD 5 screen of the HTC 10 lasted 9
seconds before the screen reacted to the
heat the pixels turned off and went
black but did completely recover after
the heat was removed for reference the
LG g5 lasted 3 seconds and the Nexus 6p
lasted 8 seconds the phone is cool to
the touch within seconds of the heat
being removed the fingerprint scanner
does scratch but it does not affect its
functionality at all I was able to set
my fingerprint and still use it with a
snappy response time no issues there now
onto the bin test
I've tried bending over 20 phones now
and only three have catastrophic Lee
failed one of them being the HTC m9 from
last year let's see if HTC made any
changes to their design
I'll start bending from the back you can
see the screen flex out of the frame
just a tiny bit you can also see the
amount of pressure my thumb's are
applying I'll flip it over and try again
there is ZERO flex with this device it
is incredibly strong I'll analyze it a
bit more during my teardown video but I
imagine that a lot of its strength comes
from the design of the metal back the
extra ridge along the back edge helps
add strength to the phone just like with
canned fruit these ridges along the side
of the can keep it from crumbling under
pressure the same way that the extra
crease on the side of the HTC 10 will
keep the phone straight overall I'm very
impressed with this phone HTC took the
physical hardware flaws of the m9 and
improved them in every single way let me
know in the comments below what phone
you would like to see me test next and
subscribe so you're never out of the
loop with phone hardware and durability
bonus points for following me on
Instagram and Twitter for the extra
tidbits of information thanks a ton for
watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
