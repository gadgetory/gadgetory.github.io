something I saw over on unbox therapy
channel while back it has to be one of
the strangest phones I've ever seen but
surprisingly only cost me 35 bucks on
eBay a self-proclaimed dustproof
shockproof waterproof and rugged dual
SIM card cell phone with get this a
built-in shaver yeah like the kind of
shaver you would shave your face with in
the box it even has one of those little
bristle cleaners for the foil head I'll
be testing all of these features if it
ever turns on side by side with a normal
razor blade from Dollar Shave Club who's
sponsoring this video all in the name of
science of course let's get started
turns out that the phone wasn't dead out
of the box the phone has a passive
old-school removable 3800 milliamp hour
battery that has some tape over the
battery contacts and once I got that
tape off everything started working we
do durability tests here on my channel
to make sure
to a make sure the manufacturers are
giving us quality durable products and
that includes this Frankenstein
monstrosity of a cellphone shaver let's
see what this thing is made from
starting with the screen I have a set of
most pics that visibly show us what the
screen is made from glass is level six a
diamond screen would be a level 10 but
since this unique machine is only $30 on
eBay the screen is plastic scratching at
level 3 with deeper grooves at level 4
it does have the brightest flashlight
I've ever seen on a phone though so if
you've ever wanted to call your grandma
while shaving in the dark this phone is
for you the front buttons are painted
plastic kind of what we would expect to
find on the lower end of the quality
scale a higher-end plastic button
example would be the embedded buttons on
the Nintendo switch we aren't here just
for the buttons though let's shave the
shaver the side buttons are made from
plastic it seems to be a reoccurring
theme throughout this phone the back
panel is also made from plastic the
center logo thing has more of a clear
rubber over the top the flashlight on
the top of the phone has a plastic lens
which is fine and normal the camera lens
though
is also plastic it's a bold move that
little piece of plastic is protecting
all point three megapixels of the camera
so it's pretty safe to say that quality
pictures were not the first priority on
this flashlight shaver that happens to
make phone calls the little flap
doohickey down at the bottom protects
the microUSB and regular sized USB slot
and hasn't stayed shut since I unbox
this thing so I think that waterproof
claim is completely bogus it will be
nice to use that full-sized USB slot to
charge up some other accessories though
it's interesting that the dedicated
shaver switch on the side doesn't have a
safety lock I imagine this shaver
randomly going off in your pocket is
going to be a real issue still more
useful than bixby though let's give this
thing a shot at shaving
you have a thing into yourself why is
this grown man shaving his arms with a
cellphone and you're right this is an
incredibly weird situation
I think maybe we should just clear your
search history and not talk about this
again but if I'm being completely honest
this is the best shave I've ever gotten
with the cellphone getting out of 10 I'm
legitimately surprised it even works
fair is fair though let's see what an
actual razor can do Dollar Shave Club
has this starter box and send out for 5
bucks with Free Shipping and has all
kinds of goodies they even have stuff
like toothpaste and hair styling
products for those of you grab hair that
you can add into the kit later not just
razors and the best part is there are
zero contracts so if being clean is not
your thing you can quit whenever you
want not a bad deal at all for just five
bucks replacement blades are sent for
just a few dollars a month after the
first batch and I'll leave a link in the
description the razor is just as if not
more efficient than the shaver foam and
it won't awkwardly go off in your pocket
grab your own five-dollar kit with a
link in the description or head to
dollarshaveclub.com slash jerry-rigged
it's pretty easy thanks to Dollar Shave
Club for sponsoring this video let's
finish off the durability test and see
how this shaver phone works from the
inside one of the biggest flaws in this
phone is the lack of games there is no
snake game which is kind of a
deal-breaker for me the 2 point 6 inch
screen is covered by that thick layer of
plastic so the heat from my lighter
doesn't penetrate down into the display
below but we can't see it melting the
outer plastic it did last about 18
seconds before turning into a molten
mess which is good to know if you happen
to be shaving outside by a campfire
structurally if it looks like a brick
and feels like a brick there's a good
chance it's actually a brick and that is
indeed the case with this random
conglomerate of gadgets the shaver phone
is surprisingly sturdy I still have
massive doubts about the waterproof
claims though since there is no actual
IP rating and the back panel and bottom
flap keep opening up on their own so
maybe don't get this thing wet while
shaving you might lose your $30
investment I've what we open it up and
see how the shaver operates from the
inside it's actually rather simple with
two screws holding the bottom together
for visible screws holding together each
of the golden metal side rails and two
more Phillips head screws up at the top
there's one last tiny little guy
guarding the battery how
and then the whole phone can start to
open the problem with opening up this
phone is that the screen is semi clipped
into the front housing and since there
are no Lego connections holding the
screen to the motherboard I shredded all
the soldered ribbon cables between the
two kind of like how we saw on the
world's smallest cell phone except for I
didn't break that one the motherboard
has the seller grounding tape all over
it but once that gets peeled back we get
our first look at the circular vibration
motor and the even bigger loudspeaker
sub-woofer thing remember that catchy
little jingle that played when I turned
the phone on this speaker is probably
the biggest speaker I've ever seen
inside of a cell phone the shaver motor
which is quite a bit bigger than the NEX
s front camera motor is soldered
directly onto the mainboard no Lego
connectors anywhere inside of this phone
but there is an aluminum heatsink on the
back of the LED flashlight diode the
thing is so powerful and bright that it
needs its own mini heat dissipation
system which is actually super cool
thumbs up for that let's see how the
shaver portion works the top metal
circular foils pop off allowing the
insides to be clean but under those
triangle pins is another trap door with
massive white circular gears the big
motor inside spins its singular gear
which in turn rotates the two larger
gears attached at the bottom of each of
those triangular silver posts which then
rotates the shaving mechanism underneath
the circular metal foils pretty
brilliant we can snag a closer look at
the underside of those foils you can see
that the gaps in the foil are just big
enough to let hair through but not big
enough at the little metal twisty bits
could snag on your skin the same basic
principle applies to all shavers it's
just super interesting to see it here on
a cell phone I would put the whole thing
back together again but somebody
accidentally ripped the screen off and
destroy the ribbons so it's kind of
incapacitated at the moment still a
super interesting phone though grab your
own five dollar shaving kit from Dollar
Shave Club using my code and link in the
description with free shipping it's
cheaper than even your local grocery
store would you ever use a phone like
this let me know down in the comments
and then come hang out with me on
Twitter and Instagram
thanks ton for watching I will see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
