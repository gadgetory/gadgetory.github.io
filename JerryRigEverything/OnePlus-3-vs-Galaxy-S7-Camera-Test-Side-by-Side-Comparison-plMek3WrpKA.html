and the galaxy s7 edge both of the
cameras are mounted to the same rig so
it'll be held equally as I'm walking
around I will also keep all the settings
on automatic and I'm using the stock
camera apps so the comparison will be
fair between the two of them I'm going
to need your help to decide which camera
is better the galaxy s7 edge or the one
plus three I'm gonna leave a pole up in
the corner of this video so you can vote
at the end of the video and you can also
leave your opinion down in the video
comments we'll start off in 4k then
we'll drop down to 1080p to see if the
image color or stabilizing is any
different at that resolution will do the
front-facing cameras and we'll also go
into slow motion so we'll test every
aspect of the video camera on both phone
make sure to pay attention to things
like the color quality the resolution
the image stabilizing the white balance
everything let's get started so right
now both cameras are shooting in 4k both
cameras also have oh is image
stabilizing so the camera itself is
compensating for the emotion as I'm
walking which is pretty cool it's not an
electronic stabilization it's an actual
physical image stabilizing so I'm
walking right now I'm gonna try running
still shooting in 4k both these cameras
are shooting in 30 frames a second right
now Bourdieu started with the walking
front-facing camera test s want to thank
everyone who subscribed to my youtube
channel 200,000 subscribers is
phenomenal when I first started making
Jeep and motorcycle repair videos four
years ago that number wasn't even on my
radar so thank you so much for watching
let's get going so this is the front
facing camera on both the galaxy s7 edge
and the one plus three the one plus
three is gonna be shooting in 1080p the
galaxy s7 edge resolution is a little
bit higher it's quad HD 1440 we can also
check the white balance and the depth of
field so you can look back on the path
behind me and see how far back the
quality goes with enough leaves like
this it's also nice to see what kind of
bitrate we're working with I'll have the
bitrate listed up in the top corner as
well bitrate is basically the quality of
the image inside of the resolution so
having a higher bitrate is a good thing
because there's more information there
and if there's lots of leaves and like
detail in the background it's using more
of that bitrate obviously YouTube is
going to compress it a little bit but
you know we can still see an equal
comparison between the two cameras even
though the galaxy s7 image is bigger
that doesn't always mean better the
image quality could be way better on the
1+3 so it's important that you guys let
me know what you think and how it looks
on the screen you're watching on whether
it's an IPS display that you see on an
iPhone a regular computer monitor a CRT
monitor from way back in the day or an
AMOLED screen like we see on the Samsung
phones it's going to look a little bit
different on every single one of those
so here's the 1080p walking test both of
these cameras have oh is image
stabilizing optical image stabilizing
the galaxy s7 also has an extra layer of
stabilizing that isn't turned on at the
moment it's a is electronic image
stabilization sometimes it warps the
image so let's take a look at that I'm
going to turn on the e is for the galaxy
s7 edge right now but now the e is on
the galaxy s7 edge is enabled so it's
got dual layers of stabilizing where the
1+3 only has one layer of stabilization
a little Sun flare in there one more
slope and in 4k
one thing that I really like about
filming in 4k is that there's a whole
lot more pixels to work with and you can
zoom in on things that you normally
wouldn't be able to see with 1080p gives
you a little more space to work with
we're going to come up here to the sky
and find some clouds to look at some
over here gives you a good indicator of
the white balance you can check out the
contrast between the white clouds in the
sky hopefully there's not too many focus
issues with the different phones
remember I need your help to decide
which cameras better make sure you
comment after watching the video so keep
in mind that there is a huge price
difference between these two phones the
one plus three is the cheaper flagship
killer and the galaxy s7 edge is pretty
much you know the top of the line the
most expensive phone on the market so
right now to pay attention to the color
reproduction on both phones so I've had
this bike for a while now and about
three years ago I took this rear tire
and sprayed never wet it's a hydrophobic
spray around this side of it so you can
see that this side is still white even
after three years of use and this side
is black because of all the brake dust
from the calipers and the brake pads
it's kind of interesting I mean this
will clean off pretty easily but the
hydrophobic spray is pretty interesting
I never finished the video because I
hurt my back and wasn't writing as much
as I thought I would but now it's done I
can give my my rear rim a wash
remember it's super important that you
leave your opinion down in the comments
below and you vote in the poll question
up here in the corner so we know which
camera does better I have tons of camera
tests we have the Nexus 6p HTC 10 iPhone
6s plus you can watch this all day long
please consider subscribing if you
enjoyed this video hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
