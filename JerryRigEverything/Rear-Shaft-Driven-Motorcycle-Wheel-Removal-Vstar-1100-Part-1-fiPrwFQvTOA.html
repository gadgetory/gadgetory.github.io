V star 1100 I have it propped ups using
a car jack and some blocks underneath
pretty straightforward use that to make
sure it's balanced the front two blocks
are just under the frame to the seat off
pretty simple my seat only had the one
pull back here I also just released the
back fender by taking off the two saddle
bag holders and then there was two
screws right here as well so now I can
get the back tire off by lifting up the
back fender otherwise you can see that
there is no way that that back tire is
going out of there hot zone so now I
just have to disconnect the back tire so
I just took off the brake
the caliper basically there's two bolts
right here that was holding it on they
were a 12 millimeter I believe anyway so
I just took those two bolts out and just
kind of slid this out if you look at it
you can see that my brake pads all seem
to be replaced
there is almost no pad at all on them so
I'll be doing that in the near future as
well but now that I have that out I just
need to take these two bolts out here
and then loosen up the back axle so the
reason you take off the back the caliper
is because when you take the tire when
you're sliding it out it won't slide out
all the way if the if the calipers still
attached to the rotor right here so you
pull it out and then make sure you tie
it up as well out of the way because
when you pull the back tire out it needs
to be supported so it doesn't
automatically like fallen any ink on the
on the brake lines because that's
delving into a whole nother situation
you don't want to work with all right so
I got a little bit ahead of myself let
me explain what happened
so take the back tire off there's a few
bolts you got a release so this is where
the the final drive went
the axle went through here there was
four bolts around this mounting plate
that I took off then two bolts here
obviously so those are those two bolts
and these are the four bolts around that
mounting plate the axle was pretty
simple
I believe it was a 22 millimeter she's
got the the nut in the washer that came
off with it pretty straightforward and
then on the other side it just had the
Cal probably so I got off it had this
bowl right here and then these two that
hold the axle in place on this side and
so you can kind of see it has this arm
that was connected to the bolt to the
top then the caliper goes on most - so
those are the parts that I've taken off
so far so the final drive just kind of
pops right off the top of that you don't
need to loosen up any bolts or anything
and that's the part you got to take to
the guy to get the tire changed off so I
just have it propped up on two blocks
right now so I'm not damaging the rotor
on the other side just take off all the
loose pieces take it into him
he'll switch the tire out put it all
back together and throw it back on the
bike when you do put it all back
together again
make sure those times are they're
greased up and then also at the end of
this other shaft I'll just put a little
bit of grease on before you stick it
back in
so to help me out tomorrow I made sure
to put all the parts in the same order
that they were on the bike so I got that
arm right there the end of the axle I
got the different bearings inside and I
got the final drive just all kind of
lined up exactly where they were on the
bike so to make things easier and then
with this I also put like all the nuts
and pulled some things that I took off
back in there same spots so I don't have
to worry about losing them figuring out
where they go tomorrow when I get the
wheel done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
