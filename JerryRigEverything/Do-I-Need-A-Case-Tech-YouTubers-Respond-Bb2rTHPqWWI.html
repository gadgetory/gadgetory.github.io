on Twitter asking who uses protection on
their smartphone I was surprised to see
that about 47% of you guys use a bulky
case and a screen protector on your
smartphone while about 20% of you guys
use absolutely nothing I decided to ask
a couple my youtuber friends to see what
they use on their daily smartphones and
this is what they said hey Zach and
everybody it's Michael Fisher aka mr.
mobile thanks for having me on
to tell you about my stupid moronic
stubborn dumb habit of carrying my
smartphone in the nude yep I go
completely unadorned no case screen
protector or skin and as a result I've
consigned more than a few phones to
early grave so why do I do it the most
pretentious phone nerd reason ever I
don't like to cover up the designers
intent i buy my devices based in part on
how they look and feel in the hand and
no matter how cool the case or sleek to
skin putting anything on top interferes
with that it's not a smart way to
protect your multi Benjamin investment
and there are some skins out there that
tempt me but what can I say it's the
only mobile life I've ever known
thanks for the time everyone come see me
at the mr. mobile on YouTube and above
all don't be like me when it comes to
cases Zach thank you for having unique
Channel mr. safron superstar TV and so
my devices a lot of you guys may already
know I tend to use ad brand skin the
advantage of having a skin is that my
device will have some more grip and
you'll be less likely to drop it it also
adds zero bulk and it gives a nice
custom look now the disadvantage of
skins is obviously that you're not going
to really get much protection if you do
drop your device and for that reason
when I am out and about I tend to use a
case when looking for cases I always go
for a soft rubber material which is not
too bulky but at the same time is going
to give some protection I quite like the
air cushion technology from speaking
cases and the other thing that I
definitely look out for is a lip around
display so if I was to drop my phone
face-first on a hard surface which I
have been in the past then it is going
to have some formal protection although
I
cannot use a screen protector I kind of
find they come in the way that's me past
me anyway that's it for me guys like
thanks for having me once again this is
saffron Superstock TV I'll see you next
time hey guys I'm crystal and yes I have
Brooklyn phones before I broken actually
to which considering how many phones I
get here that's pretty good I would say
but yeah I brought the Galaxy s7 and a
Nexus 6p and I actually didn't drop
these I was actually just running up
concrete steps and I fell with them like
I scraped my knee and everything like
they just they fell with me and they
kind of broke my fall
so yeah they actually have the same
crack pretty much like right in the edge
and I really don't think like a case
would have saved it because of the angle
that like it fell on the concrete now
sometimes I will use a case and other
times I'll use a skin it really all
depends on what phone I'm using where
I'm feeling that day it's not really
about the protection it's more about
like dressing up the phone and making it
look nice what's up guys Mike here de
Tori Borg and one of the most frequent
questions I get is what do I use to
protect my phone now for the most part I
think everybody should have a case on
their phone because as soon as you drop
it those good looks are basically ruined
they're hard to resell and if you like
me and like to keep them and use them in
future videos you want to make sure
they're in good condition for that
camera so of course a good case also
provides a good grip on your film so you
don't drop it it's frequently and if you
have a good case with a nice lip on it
you don't need to add a screen protector
because that means when you lay the
phone flat you don't scratch the glass
and glass is already pretty scratch
resistant so I never see a need to add a
screen shield especially since most
phones have curved glass at the edges
which means screen shields never fit
properly anymore anyway so generally
speaking I just use a really nice case
with a good land table design a good
grip so I don't drop it and it's not too
bulky so it doesn't add to the sickness
of the phone now one of my favorite
cases right now is the spec positio grip
and for the most part I'm just looking
for a case that has a hybrid design the
hard shell on the outside a rubber shell
on the inside to provide some shock
protection and also seals up the phone
so sanding grit don't get between the
case and the phone to scratch it so
that's generally what I'm looking for
inspect has been one of the pioneers and
that sort of design and that's what I
generally recommend to most people
what's going on guys to travelers
consumer
and for me I typically like to have a
case on my phone my current daily driver
is an iPhone 7 plus and I'm using the
Apple Levin case with it now I'm using
this case because I love the look and
the Apple leather cases has surprisingly
whispered some pretty nasty Falls for me
in the past so I'm feeling pretty
confident using it here but something
that I did this year that I don't
typically do is go without a screen
protector and I got to say guys that was
a huge mistake I'm the kind of person
that gets bothered with fine scratches
and just by having the iPhone 7 plus in
my pocket I've gotten a ton already and
it's driving me crazy but I typically
like to use regular screen protectors
regular plastic ones they're pretty
inexpensive easy to apply and if
anything goes wrong I can replace it
with no problem so I'm going to go back
with that once I get a new iPhone or
maybe actually shut my phones but
definitely using an Apple leather case
and a screen protector is the way to go
and there you have it even among some of
the top tech youtubers it just boils
down to personal preference some walk
around completely naked and others are
completely covered I've had a lot of
phones during my life and even since my
very first smartphone the Samsung
Vibrant way back in the day I have
always had a case and a screen protector
on my phone my case of choice is the
OtterBox kind of like have some of the
other youtubers we're talking about
having a hard shell on the outside and a
rubber case on the inside it has that
dual layer of protection plus that
little edge along the lip of the case is
pretty important even if your phone has
curved glass like on this galaxy s7 edge
that little lip will protect the screen
if it ever drops face down screen
protectors are also important to me I'm
not so worried about small micro
scratches in fact I'm still using this
Galaxy s7 edge that I used in my
durability test about a year ago it's
got some major scratches on it and this
little burn mark so the minor scratches
don't bother me as much but when I'm
using a phone that is brand new the
resale value is very important and
that's why I put a screen protector on
it because it'll look pristine if I ever
go to resell it but as we've seen today
it really just boils down to personal
preference I am curious as to what you
use on your smartphone do you have a
case and a screen protector or do you
walk around living life on the edge with
no protection I'll be linking the
YouTube channels of everyone who
participated in this video today down in
the video description so make sure you
check them out
I know before I buy any a piece of
expensive technology I'd like to check
out the reviews and these guys are some
of the best thanks done for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
