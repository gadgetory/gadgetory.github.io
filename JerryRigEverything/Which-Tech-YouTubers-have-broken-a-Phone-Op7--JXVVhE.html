cell phone repair and cell phone
durability believe it or not I have only
broken one cell phone in my life on
accident I'll tell you that story in a
minute but first I want to hear from a
few of my YouTube friends to see if
they've ever broken her phone normally
on their channels we see these beautiful
cell phones displayed perfectly but I
think there's some horror stories hidden
there somewhere let's find out hey guys
I'm Kelsey and this is pebbles and with
my phones I'm usually pretty careful I
typically put my phone in an otterbox
but the one time that I didn't was when
I cracked the screen pebbles is there
she could tell you right okay so I
thought it was gonna be a good idea to
try to walk two dogs and text at the
same time you know what could go wrong
with that and you know of course I was
distracted because I was texting and the
dogs got excited yanked the leash in my
hand and my phone in one direction and I
had to watch my phone slowly hit the
ground multiple times before just
landing flat on the pavement and you
know it was an old phone so I actually
lived with the crack for a really long
time and you eventually got a screen and
fix it myself but I guess the moral of
the story is don't try to text while
walking your dogs but if you do and you
break your phone you can always fix it
yourself what's up guys this is Zach
from super socks TV and phone breaking
stories well I actually have a few I've
been known to drop my phones in the past
not deliberately all the time anyway but
the first time actually completely broke
a smart phone was the Samsung Galaxy s4
I tend to use the case pretty much most
of the time and I had the s4 for about a
year and then the case kind of fell
apart so I decided to go naked which was
a bad idea because I think within a
couple of days of me doing that I
dropped the flower on its back on a hard
surface and the screen just went it
wasn't shuttered or anything but it just
wouldn't switch on now the cost of the
repair was around half the value of the
phone so I didn't really bother with it
and at the time I didn't know Zach
otherwise I would definitely hit him up
for some help in repairing it now
another interesting story about me
breaking one of my phones is the
seven plus I dropped it and although
there wasn't really any visible damage
to the front-facing camera stopped
working now I took it into the Apple
store they had a look at it and they saw
some structural damage so they did say
that I have to get a replacement phone
which costs around three hundred and
fifty pounds here in the UK but they
said that because I had bought it from
them and it hadn't been too long that I
had had it they actually gave me a
replacement for free now this is why I
always advise buying Apple products
directly from Apple themselves and also
why I praised Apple customer service so
much
not because I'm a fanboy thanks for
having me Zach this is sac from super
SAC TV and I'll see you next time hey
guys this is Austin and I have never
broken a phone that's a total lie I've
actually broken a couple so the very
first smartphone I ever broke was the
original Moto X so remember it was
actually one of those first review units
that I got so I got it straight from
owner Ola I was doing my video
the day after I went go-karting and I
hit my pocket and it was bent the frame
was like completely like jacked up and
the screen was totally shattered so I
felt kind of bad but Motorola was cool
with it so you know that was that was
great another story was I was actually
last year I actually killed an iPhone 7
plus twice so the first time was when I
was doing my video and I was doing a
quick little water test so I took it is
obviously the first iPhone that was
waterproof dropped it in a fishbowl
picked it up and it started freaking out
water was inside the screen was a little
fogged up or specifically the actual
camera was fogged up so that was kind of
bad well the good thing was it dried out
until I was running across the street
and without a case on it flew out of my
shorts and smashed right into a curb and
again totally shattered the screen so
you know in like the last 10 years I
broke into phones I think that's not so
bad right I'm Michael Fisher and I have
broken more phones than even those bad
luck schlubs on infomercials
my most recent casualty it wasn't a
victim of dropping or shattering for a
change but of drowning you've watched
enough jerry-rigged everything to know
that the LGV 30 is water resistant but
you probably also know that no phone is
waterproof well I knew that too but I
took it swimming anyway in the salty
Pacific and you know what I got some of
the most fun photos and videos of that
trip thanks to the V 30 and then I
pushed my luck seat when the phone
survived all that I thought it was
thanks to my careful freshwater baths I
thought it could also handle a whole
afternoon in a chlorinated swimming pool
taking more ridiculous underwater photos
and it totally did until it didn't a few
seconds after leaving the pool the
display went black and with the
exception of a few flickers the next day
never came back do I blame the phone no
you're not supposed to push it that far
and I had met that do I miss it though
heck and yeah hey Zack
two words repair collab think about it
and thanks for having me on to share my
shame so I think a lot of people are
gonna find this pretty hard to believe
but I have never actually broken my
daily driver phone not in any like
meaningful way like I have dropped my
daily driver phone a fair bit my iPhone
6 has a really nice dent on the corner
my Galaxy s8 has also a really nice dent
on the corner going all the way back my
iPhone 4 actually has some spectacular
scuff marks on the back piece of glass
because I was actually moving at the
time and I dropped it and it skidded
along the ground so the entire back of
it has like these deep scratches but I
have never actually had to do a glass
replacement for one of my devices now my
wife on the other hand she is such a
prolific phone breaker
she broke her s6 active oh prior to that
like she broke an active and then prior
to that when she was using a droid DNA
the excuse was well the baby dropped it
and I'm sitting here going why are you
letting an infant use a phone what did
you think that a six-month-old was gonna
do with a phone handle it carefully
they're gonna chew on it and then
they're gonna drop it
so she breaks her droid DNA and it takes
me a while to get the replacement parts
cuz it wasn't exactly a very common
model finally it comes in and I'm not
the most experienced phone repair
technician but I'm competent enough so I
did manage to do a screen replacement
but it took me a little while
three days later breaks it again that
was actually when we switched her to the
s6 active although from the earlier
point in this story we all know what a
great solution that ended up being so in
conclusion I actually don't break phones
but my wife my wife does she does I did
break my iPad too oh oh that was my
fault
okay so we're sitting on the couch and
we're about to watch a movie and I'm
like sitting on the iPad and I'm done
with it
and so I kind of toss it on to the
ground onto the carpet in front of me
and we get I don't know ten minutes into
the movie long enough to kind of forget
that I put it there and my wife like
lays down on my lap because it's a
boring movie and she's probably gonna
fall asleep she goes all your keys
they're bothering me and I go okay yeah
no problem that one was my bad but it
wasn't a phone hey guys it's Krystal and
here's a couple of my phone breaking
stories let's take a little trip down
memory lane
so my first most memorable phone
breaking story was of my Galaxy s7
right in front of my house right here
and I've definitely talked about this
one before this is no 8 but let's just
pretend it's a galaxy s7 for the story
cuz I don't have that phone anymore
I was running inside my house late at
night one night I don't know I was
running inside but I
and I tripped and fell on my brick
concrete steps and there's only three
steps there but I fell anyway I scraped
my knee and instead of hurting my hand I
hurt my phone because I was holding it
as I was running inside and yeah cracked
the edge of it I told myself I would put
a case on every phone that I have and I
would never be holding it while running
but I do that all the time anyways so I
never learned from that one this next
phone breaking story kind of
embarrassing happened with my Nexus 6p
I had my Google pixel here so it should
pretend that it is a 6p right now it
happened as I was walking out of my
neighborhood Walgreens and it was summer
2016 when Pokemon go was still a thing
now this Walgreens is always a good spot
to catch good Pokemon so I thought let
me pull my 6p and try to catch some I
opened up my Pokemon Go app and I saw a
Snorlax just waiting for me to catch it
so I started flicking away trying to
catch the Snorlax and as I was flipping
my little Pokemon balls trying to catch
it my phone slipped out of my hands and
fell to the ground and not only did I
not catch my Snorlax
I also cracked my six feet it was a
really sad day because I loved that
phone and it was actually one of the
last times that ever played Pokemon go
yeah it's pretty sad and the most recent
damage that I've done was to this iPhone
six-plus don't even know why I had it
out I just did for some reason I was
holding in my hand and I was leaning on
the second-floor balcony of my house and
it kind of just slipped out of my hand
and fell to the first floor onto the
hardwood floor and then this happened I
mean it's pretty bad but considering
that 20 foot or something dropped it
could be worse I think it doesn't really
turn on anymore but it did have problems
prior to the fall so I think that fall
was just as last like that's the last
thing that it could take it was coming
to its final days anyway but those are
my phone breaking stories and
considering all the phones that I've had
I think I've done pretty good hey what's
up guys I'm kitty HD here and yes I have
broken a phone in fact pretty recently
now I was actually previously pretty
proud of my never broken a phone in a
couple of years record may have even
mentioned that in my own videos but this
iPhone 10
I've actually tweeted pictures of this
now this is a phone that I've broken
very recently well actually I don't know
if
I didn't break this phone so I don't
feel like I broke it but it is my phone
and it's broken so the reason I say that
is this broke while I was in a different
room iPhone 10 is so slippery that if
you put it on a surface face down and
leave it like that long enough and it
vibrates and you get a few texts and
notifications it might vibrate enough to
get to the edge of that table and fall
this happened I put this on the top of a
dresser in a different room when in ten
minutes I was in a different room
maybe typing some emails doing something
else and then I just kind of hear this
crash and I'm not really sure what it is
so I leave and I walk back to the other
room and I find this iPhone on the
ground with glass around it there's
chunks missing from the corner it took a
pretty hard fall so I'm now again a
member of the broken iPhone club again I
don't think I can say that I broke it I
don't consider this a phone that I broke
but that's the latest to happen to me
the one time I broke a cell phone an
accident was with the iPhone 7 plus
there's about a period of three months
where I was trying to give Apple a fair
chance and use an iPhone as my daily
driver and about three months into it it
was okay but after about three months
into it I was going on a date went to go
pick up the girl gave her a hug on her
front porch and as I was giving her a
hug her purse or her hand or something
hit this phone out of my hand
straight onto the concrete flat down on
the surface I don't think I had a case
on it I can't quite remember but I'm
pretty sure there was no screen
protector in no case and the whole thing
was just obliterated and while I was
fine using iPhone for those three months
that was kind of the abrupt end to my
iPhone experience I switched back to my
galaxy s7 edge right after that I did
end up repairing this phone and I think
I even did a video about it on my
channel and ended up working perfectly
so there's no hard feelings and there
you have it most people who have owned
cell phones in their life have damaged
them one way or another whether it's
their personal fault or the extenuating
circumstances caused the damage damage
happens and putting protection on your
phone would be a good thing I want to
thank all my YouTube friends for joining
in this interesting collab I'll have all
of their channels linked down in the
video description if you want to check
out any of them individually they're all
solid people to check out if you've ever
broken a phone I want to hear your story
down in the comments make sure you're
careful with your cell phone and thank
you so much for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
