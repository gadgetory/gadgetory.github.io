hidden mechanical camera on top I think
we should unhide that thing and make it
transparent so we can see all the bells
and whistles inside from the outside
this is one of the most unique and
futuristic smartphones that have ever
taken apart so it should be a fun one
let's get started
the psychedelic coloring on the back
panel is pretty stunning all the
different colors reflecting at different
points on the black back I almost feel
guilty about my plans to dissect and
modify the internals almost like with
most glass backbones the glass removal
is pretty standard our heat gun warms
the little guy up and a strong suction
cup and metal pry tool commenced the
initial penetration while slicing
through that still warm adhesive the
back glass does have curves around the
edges so I use a more flexible piece of
card stock or a business card to do the
slicing since the card can wrap around
the curve without putting too much
pressure on the glass glass is glass and
glass does break furillo this coloring
is super impressive
it's like someone dropped a bag of
Skittles in a parking lot I can almost
taste the rainbow just by looking at it
I'll keep warming up the adhesive before
it cools down and gets hard got to keep
it right around that perfect temperature
where your fingers feel like they're
melting off lucky for us the adhesive is
just around the edge of the phone so
once all the cutting is done the whole
glass back panel lifts up and away from
the phone in one piece with nothing
attached to the underside that we have
to worry about the trick now though is
that the mechanical camera operation
that we want to show off is still hidden
under this metal plate the phone still
turns on in the camera functions so it's
all still good let's work on removing
the color first we encounter a few
different types of materials covering
the underside of glass phones it could
be a thin layer of paint like LG or
goofy laminate that doesn't want to come
off like HTC uses or the third option is
a thin layer of laminate that's easily
peeled off in one giant piece and lucky
for us that's what vivo is using on this
next s a little heat here and there
helps out and the adhesive comes off
leaving the glass clean and clear with
no residue the camera lens comes off as
its own little metal unit I'll install
that again later after I get the color
out from underneath it and is clear
looking closely the next logo in the
middle and the V
logo down at the bottom are still intact
which is fine with me
and now our bezel a smartphone has its
own clear back glass panel to show off
all the high-tech goodness inside the
only thing that would make it better
right now is if we could see the
mechanical components of the
front-facing camera while they are
operating I think it's possible
there are 12 screws holding down the
metal plate over the motherboard pulling
that off gives us our first look at the
camera raising mechanism
it looks like a lead screw stepper motor
is doing all the work the motor on the
right twist the screw which raises and
lowers the camera in and out of the
phone the camera of course receives
communication from the motherboard like
normal with one of those Lego connectors
but this time has a really long flexible
ribbon so it can keep moving in and out
the large spring is probably to make
sure nothing gets damaged if the camera
gets bumped it absorbs the bump instead
of hurting the lead screw with a motor
pretty smart a vivo to design something
like this thumbs up for that what's not
smart though is covering up all that
beautiful engineering inside the phone
it deserves to be shown off and that's
where I come in
I want to keep the back metal mostly
intact because it might contain little
antennas and I also like how it's
aesthetically silver to match the rest
of the phone the part over the camera
and motor isn't as important as the rest
of it though a little snippety-snip from
my scissors will take care of that I'll
leave as many screw holes as possible so
it's still secure and then I'll put all
12 screws back in including the ones
around the motherboard so it's still
tight and the motor won't flex out of
place on accident I'll do the full
teardown of this phone in another video
I'll clean up the remaining adhesive
residue from inside the phone and then
I'll add my own strong double-sided tape
around the edges this helps keep the
glass in place as well as dust out of
the phone
the vivo next s wasn't water-resistant
to start with and is definitely not
water-resistant now after this little
operation I'll get rid of fingerprints
on the underside of that glass since I
won't have access to it when the glass
is set in place the camera goes back in
making sure to keep things fingerprint
free and we're ready to drop the back
glass in place and secure it all around
the edges with a little bit of pressure
the phone does turn on and now
everything inside the phone is exposed
to the outside viewers while being fully
protected with glass yeah that
psychedelic layer was pretty cool but
the
your modern industrial mechanical look
of this phone is pretty awesome the
bright shiny metallic silver battery is
perfect for this build and we can
clearly see the camera flexing in and
out of the phone continuously this might
be my favorite clear phone yet feel free
to share this video with other
technology loving individuals with
enough voices we just might get
manufacturers making clear phones before
I get my hands on them hit that
subscribe button if you haven't already
and come hang out with me on Twitter and
Instagram
thanks ton for watching and I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
