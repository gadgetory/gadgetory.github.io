and see how much space inside is
actually wasted is this newest phone
from HTC a poor use of space only one
way to find out easy a step first
removing the sim and SD card tray one
thing I do like about the HTC phone is
the expandable memory now onto the back
glass panel I'm using a heat gun to
soften the adhesive under the back glass
so I can lift it off keep in mind the
only reason the back is cracked right
now is because I took my level 9 pic to
it I've dealt with plenty of cracked
glass phones on my channel but there's
something different about this device
I've never complained about getting
glass in my fingers because normally all
the glass shards are still glued into
place even if the glass is cracked but
with this phone the glass is not glued
into the phone and at the glass breaks
the glass chunks fall off of the device
easier than I've ever seen before
which is kind of dangerous normally the
goal of repair is to remove the glass in
one piece without cracking it so if you
want to see a successful glass removal
check out my LG g6 tear down video since
this one's already destroyed it is
interesting comparing the back glass to
the LG G 6 though after I removed that
back glass panel I did intentionally
break it and it still held together just
fine no glass in my fingers and no glass
chunks falling off I have to say the
lamination process on the LG G 6 is much
safer than a lamination on the u ultra
but as long as you never break your
phone you shouldn't have to deal with
any of those problems there are 16
screws along that back side these are
all t5 screws and if any of you are
actually attempting this repair yourself
I'll include a good tool kit in the
video description as well
after the screws remove the back plastic
panel can lift up this top plastic panel
is normally where we find the wireless
charging but HTC u doesn't have wireless
charging so this flap is just for
decoration
I guess this is our first example of a
poor use of space this plastic panel was
actually designed for wireless charging
but HTC just didn't include it in the
final version of the phone they
literally stuck in a placeholder
hopefully they're just practicing for
the HTC 11 the bottom plastic shield
also lifts off but before I unplug
anything electrical in this phone I'm
going to disconnect the battery this has
two screw holes directly in the plug
which is interesting normally there is a
thicker metal bracket over the top to
keep it attached so if you accidentally
drop your phone it won't unplug by
itself
but this method looks like it will work
just fine the loudspeakers of Ottoman
phone has its own ribbon connector I
call these Lego connectors because they
literally snap on and off like little
Legos you'll feel them click into place
there's one more Lego connector at the
top of the battery for the screen and
then one at the base of the motherboard
under the silver metallic tape this one
is actually incredibly simple to work on
when compared to the HTC 10 the HTC 10
was way overly complicated with tons of
ribbon so I'm glad HTC simplified this
version of the phone there are two more
screws holding down the motherboard
these are your normal Phillips head
screws I'll pop off some the little
signal wires and then the motherboard
can be lifted up be careful with the
other signal wires though I left them
connected because they're on the same
board but they can still rip at this
point so slow and gentle is a good thing
there's one more ribbon cable on the
underside of the mainboard we've seen
the same design on some of the Samsung
phones so no surprises here and here is
the motherboard grabbing useful things
into small spaces is essentially what
technology is all about the only reason
that company would exclude components
like wireless charging or headphone
jacks is because of cost not space if
you keep the price high but exclude the
wireless charging headphone jacks and
waterproofing the profit margins on your
new phones just skyrocketed any average
non tech enthusiast will walk into a
cell phone store see a shiny new phone
and buy a full flagship price not
knowing or caring about the lots of
extra features so if you are watching
this video and actually care about
technology you're probably not the
target market for this phone the U ultra
has two cameras the rear camera is 12
megapixels and the front-facing camera
is 16 megapixels I think that last
year's HTC 10 was better built for tech
enthusiasts it even had optical image
stabilization on both the front-facing
and rear-facing cameras we're now on the
few ultra the optical stabilization can
only be found on the rear camera the
front camera has no visible hardware
stabilizing just another feature they
got cut with this ultra phone I'm pretty
sure these two little ribbon cables at
the bottom are for the front to pass
ative buttons under the front glass all
unsnap these from the little board and
once those are disconnected the charging
port can pull out from inside the hole
in the frame and here it is the USBC
charging port I'll talk about potential
headphone jack placement in just a
second the little circular thing you see
dangling off to the side
is the vibration motor I'll also talk
about this in a second - so remember if
you are attempting a screen replacement
the metal frame is the next thing to go
there are 11 normal Phillips head screws
holding this onto the screen I kind of
like this design because if your frame
ever gets damaged or dinged up during
drops or wearing out with time it can be
pretty easily swapped out you can even
mod this thing pretty easy too if the
phone was worth buying the battery is
the next thing to go no magic pull tabs
on this thing
just straight leverage taking special
care not to puncture anything I can lift
it out of the frame with the flat end of
my metal pry tool this little guy has
3000 milliamp hours one thing I really
do like about HTC is that the
replacement parts are relatively cheap
the HTC 10 was released about a year ago
and the replacement screens can be found
right now for about 60 to 80 dollars HTC
even has oil protection which is very
respectable for a company because
accidents happen and it's nice for HTC
to take care of their customers this is
what your replacement screen would look
like though you might need to separate
the LCD from the frame and reuse the
frame it just kind of depends on how
they are sold I'll link them in the
video description when they become
available now let's jump into some
comparisons this is an HTC m9 from my
shelf of shame a few years ago both of
these phones had stereo speakers ones
down here at the bottom and the others
up here at the top the funny thing is is
when I set the speaker from the HTC U on
top of the speaker from the m9 we can
see that the speaker's are pretty much
the exact same size even though the
older HTC m9 was a much smaller phone
you would think that since the U ultra
has more space to work with they would
include much bigger speakers for better
audio but that doesn't seem to be the
case the ultra doesn't seem super ultra
at this point the m9 even had a
headphone jack down here at the bottom
pay attention to the area down here as
well with very little effort
HTC would have had room for the
headphone jack on the U ultra they used
that circular vibrator called a linear
resonant actuator it is more efficient
than the eccentric rotating mass motor
that we have in the m9 but that circular
form factor leaves wasted space
I'll cover vibrators in a separate video
long story short if you remove that
circular vibrator you'll have room for
both a headphone jack
and a rectangular rotating mass vibrator
and that's without even trying with even
a small amount of board level changes
HTC could have stuck the headphone jack
anywhere they wanted very
remember space is never the issue money
is the issue if you remove features yet
keep the price the same you make more
profit and there are plenty of people
who don't really care about tech but
still want a good looking phone and this
device was built for them let's look at
a few more things so I'll set the
battery back into place we're using the
same adhesive from before and then I'll
screw down that outer aluminum frame
with those 11 Phillips head screws the
charging port gets tucked back into the
frame and press down into place
connecting the capacitive ribbon begin
at the top of the charging port board
before putting the motherboard back down
let's see if HTC is hiding any extra
space under these metal brackets these
metal boxes are here to help protect the
important circuits inside of the phone
like the processor there is nothing
replaceable under here so I normally
don't remove these coverings it looks
like HTC did fill it up pretty well
there's no thermal paste or heat pipes
though like we saw in the LG G 6 so this
phone isn't made for any super heavy
lifting I'll press the shields back into
place and it's good as new
remember that ribbon cable at the base
of the motherboard I'll clip that in
like a little Lego and then set the
motherboard down then I'll get that
screen ribbon above the battery plugged
in and the charging port ribbon with its
silver tape and finally the loudspeaker
with its little tiny Lego connection
there are two signal wires leading up
from the charging port board that need
to be plugged in the little circular
head on these things is pretty fragile
so be careful you don't want to bend it
or snap it off
speaking of signal wires anyone who's
ever done car audio before will know
that if you run your power wire next to
your signal wire even if they are
shielded you'll get some major
interference so it's definitely an
interesting design choice when HTC put
the battery power connection laying
right over the top of the signal wires
it'll be interesting to see if that
contributes to signal loss over time
after getting the two screws on the
battery and the two screws on the far
side of the motherboard you can set the
protective plastics back into place once
the 16 screws are in and securing the
components I'll do a test turn on and
surprisingly enough the thing still
works in summary it's important to
remember who this phone was made for not
everyone researches phones before they
buy them I say the vast majority of
people don't even utilize all the gizmos
and their phone in the first place so to
those non tech oriented people who
purchase this phone as long as you don't
sit on it or care about wireless
charging or loudspeakers or headphone
jack or waterproofing it's probably a
decent phone the main problem I have is
that
HTC put Lamborghini pricing on this
Honda Civic of a device if the pricing
match the specs it would be much more
worth it
hey at least it looks cool hopefully the
ultra is just practice for an amazing
HTC eleven in the near future Twitter
and Instagram or where I'm active the
most come hang out with us over there if
you haven't already and thanks for
watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
