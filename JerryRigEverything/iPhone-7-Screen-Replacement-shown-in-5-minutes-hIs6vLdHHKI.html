on an iPhone 7
remember this is harder than it looks so
make sure to watch the video all the way
through before you decide to dive into
your own repair as always you attempt
this project at your own risk
turn off the phone and at the bottom of
the screen there are two pentalobe
screws the same ones Apple always uses
since there is copious amounts of
adhesive under the screen I found it
easier to use a thin metal pry tool
instead of a suction cup slipping it
between the metal frame of the phone and
the plastic frame of the screen then
gently twisting the tool to pry up on
the screen in a controlled way there are
a few ribbon cables along the right side
of the phone that are extremely fragile
so do not put any stress on them
whatsoever a little bit of heat will
help soften the screen adhesive so if
you're struggling bust out your mom's
hairdryer and warm the screen up the
trick is releasing that top edge of the
screen enough that you can untuck it
from the top edge of the metal frame
that's what's holding it in place the
adhesive you see stretching isn't
structural it is only for keeping water
out your phone will not be water
resistant anymore after replacing the
screen but a cracked screen isn't
water-resistant either after releasing
that top edge the phone unfolds like a
book and you can see those incredibly
fragile ripping cables I was talking
about earlier this metal plate protects
the connections to the main board that
is held down by four Y shaped screws
called a tri point or Y triple zero I'll
link all the tools that I use in the
video description I unplug the battery
ribbon first and then unclip the two
screen ribbons right next to it they
just unsnap like little Legos up here at
the top of the phone we have another
metal plate held down by two screws this
is protecting another ribbon cable so
pop that off and the screen comes loose
from the phone the screen is made up of
multiple components and these components
need to be transferred over to your new
unbroken replacement screen if you need
a replacement screen I will link them
down in the video description along with
everything else to start transferring
components we need to remove the huge
metal plate from the back of the screen
there are three tri tip screws on either
side make sure you keep all of your
screws organized throughout this project
it is incredibly important because
nearly all the screws are different
sizes and you do not want to mix them up
one more screws at the top holding down
that big metal backplate and two more
screws above that holding down the
earpiece bracket
once that earpiece bracket is set off to
the side the earpiece speaker can pop
out and you can see the little spring
contact points that rest on the
little golden circles this is how it
receives its signal the front camera
ribbon cable is just lightly glued into
the frame so be extremely careful pry
that out making sure not to kink or tear
it here is the ribbon itself it has the
front camera and all of the other front
sensors attached to it on to the home
button I'm going to explain a few more
things about this little guy at the end
of the video so stick around for that
there are a total of four screws holding
it in place
remember keep them organized the home
button bracket can then be removed and
then the metal backplate itself can lift
off it has a little bit of adhesive
holding it down to the ribbon cables and
even if your old screen is broken to
bits it is still a good idea to go slow
while removing this so you don't break
anything new and I'll just reiterate the
ribbon cables are extremely fragile they
can tear like paper now that the big
back metal plate is off the home button
or touch pad can be removed by
unclipping the little Lego light
connection and then dropping it out of
the hole in front of the screen now I
grabbed the new replacement screen and I
start installing the original components
on the screen that isn't broken line the
metal backplate up with little screw
holes on the sides and then tuck your
original home button from your old phone
up through the hole and plug it in get
the bracket screwed back onto the back
of the home button making sure to put it
over the little circular tabs on the
metal backplate and then those four
screws in the back going the holes they
came from originally then the middle
backplate has six screws to tighten it
down all of them those same little
tri-tips
then we have the front camera ribbon
fold that back into place like an
origami master the earpiece with the
springs will sit on top little golden
circles and it will be held down with
two screws then the top bracket will go
on top of the earpiece with its own two
screws now to reconnect the screen the
funky-looking ribbon cable at the top
clips in like a little Lego and then the
bottom two ribbons plug in next to the
battery connection remember these
ribbons are like paper so do not kink or
rip them get the battery plugged in and
then I'll test the screen out before I
screw all the metal plates back in if
your screen is dark or has lines running
through it or it doesn't respond to
touch it either has a bad connection
with the mainboard
or it is just a bad replacement screen
everything looks good on mine so I turn
the phone back off and screw the metal
plates back in with their original
screws that I kept organized from
earlier remember that the top edge of
the screen goes in first and the rest of
the screen gets gently placed down after
that so if your frame has been bent by a
drop you might need to undo
a little before your screen will fit
into place so watch out for that don't
press too hard and crack your new one
I've seen it happen now back to the home
button
since this phone is so new this video is
showing literally one of the first few
times the iPhone 7 has been taken apart
in the wild
after reading online several other
people are complaining that their home
button does no longer function when
attached to a replacement screen Apple
has played dirty in the past with error
53 not allowing people to fix their own
phones so it wouldn't be super
surprising to me to see Apple pull more
anti repair shenanigans against their
own customers but obviously we have to
wait until we get a larger sample size
of broken phones if you have repaired an
iPhone 7 leave any tips down in the
comments below remember if Apple really
is disabling the home buttons I've
repaired phones you can get around it by
using the on-screen home button located
in your settings and if you enjoy seeing
tech reviewed from the inside hit that
subscribe button I've got a lot more
videos coming bonus points are following
me on Instagram and Twitter and I even
post an occasional behind-the-scenes
snap story on snapchat thanks ton for
watching hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
