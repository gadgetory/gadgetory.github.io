for smart phones, and iPhones in particular,
that aren't always safe, including one that
claims to be an electric razor powered from
an iPhone's lightning port.
Things are about to get weird.
Huge thanks to Dollar Shave Club for sponsoring
this video.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
Let's start with this fan thing.
It's got a micro USB main port with an iPhone
lightning port adapter.
The fan has soft rubber propellers that are
friction fit to the shaft of an electric motor.
You might be thinking to yourself, 'wow, that's
pretty cool.
Iphones might actually be good for something.'
But here's the problem, iPhones are not designed
to throw this kind of power out of the phone.
Some Android phones can, but by powering third
party accessories with a lightning port, there's
a high risk of frying the internal charging
port circuit board.
It could burn out and stop charging altogether,
basically ruining your phone...which actually
sounds kind of fun to me.
So let's try another weird accessory.
This one is an electric razor that's powered
by the lightning port.
It can plug directly into your phone to steal
some power.
I use the word 'steal' because that's exactly
what it's doing.
The iPhone is definitely not designed for
this.
[Buzzing sounds] It sounds like it's working,
and nothings exploded yet.
But it's also doing pretty much nothing as
far as shaving goes.
In fact, it stopped working.
[Buzzing sounds] Apparently the top protective
metal screen was too tight.
And the iPhone also isn't strong enough to
push the motor...even though it's not currently
cutting anything.
Even while pulling power directly from the
iPhone, it's pretty gutless.
[Buzzing sounds] The protective metal screen
can be unscrewed while the electric shaver
is in operation.
This is extremely unsafe.
I like razor blades as much as anyone, but
spinning razor blades are where I draw the
line.
Let's take this apart and see what's inside.
The spinning triple razor blade propeller
can slide off the motor shaft easy enough.
And the bottom plastic cap can be pried off
of the razor housing.
I'm currently taking apart a razor with a
razor.
The lightning port is directly wired into
the motor, and the motor itself is just press
fit into the blue plastic housing.
It's a tad bigger than the other motors inside
the little electric fans, but everything is
still pretty generic.
Even after being taken apart, it still functions
when plugged into the iPhone.
The shaft of the electric shaver motor is
the same diameter as the electric fan motor,
which means that the blades are interchangeable.
Technology is getting pretty weird lately.
So now we know that unapproved third-party
accessories that plug into your iPhone can
potentially destroy your phone.
So what about this guy?
This, my friends, is a car charger with an
internal battery and built-in electric shaver
â€“ something you never knew you wanted and
still probably don't.
[Buzzing sounds] It already sounds like way
more of a beast than the other guy.
It's got a protective plastic cap and a USB
out port to charge up your phone while plugged
into the 12-volt auxiliary outlet in your
vehicle.
Interesting design, but does it work?
[Buzzing sounds] Absolutely not.
Not a single hair was cut today.
Now that we know the shaving car charger is
also completely worthless, let's see how it's
put together.
It has the same spinning razor blade propellers
that the first guy did, but this time there
are actual screws holding it together.
I'll unscrew the pointy metal tip, which can
also be used to crack glass windows in an
emergency.
Thumbs up for that.
And then I'll pinch the metal tabs while prying
the circuit board loose out of the plastic
housing.
It's a pretty crazy looking contraption.
The metal tip is what gets pressed into the
12-volt car outlet.
And the springy side tabs touch the negative
wall to complete the circuit.
This then charges the internal battery and
powers the spinning razor blades.
Pretty interesting...even if it's not very
functional.
One functional way to shave time and shave
money (the guy who came up with that deserves
a raise), is with Dollar Shave Club.
Razors at the store are usually pretty expensive.
Dollar Shave Club is a place online that cuts
out the middle man and sells razors for pretty
cheap.
For just $5 you get a starter kit sent to
your door.
This includes an executive razor handle, four
razors, shave butter, and face cleanser.
That's cheaper than what you can get at the
store, and it's delivered right to your door
on your own schedule...for $5.
Dollar Shave Club is not just about shaving
either.
You can toss in things like a toothbrush or
hair products, if you're the kind of person
who has hair.
After you get the $5 starter box, a restock
box will come with regular sized products
at the regular price.
But if being clean isn't your thing, you can
quit whenever you want.
I'll leave a link down in the description.
Or you can just go to DollarShaveClub.com/jerryrig
to get started.
Thanks to Dollar Shave Club for sponsoring

They seem to be infinitely more effective
than the other useless and electronically
dangerous accessories we tested today.

And thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
