apart the LG g2 this particular one is
from Sprint but all of the g2 should be
pretty much the same from all the
carriers take off the back panel stay on
the backside of the silver line and just
put your non-marking pry tool between
the back case and the edge of the phone
and it will start up lift up you can see
a series of clasps around the back edge
that you have to pry loose it is on
there pretty good so you don't be afraid
to use a little force but that does
release the back panel from the phone
then you have five screws along the base
of the phone and this holds the charging
port in place along with their large
ribbon cables that LG used to build the
rest of their phone this is the speaker
that's attached to the black plastic you
can see the two little leads right here
that power the loudspeaker then along
the top of the phone you can see the
rest of the screws once those are out go
ahead and release the top plastic it is
also clipped on there so you have to use
your little pry tool and pry it up and
off and this exposes the motherboard as
well as the super large ribbon cable
that all of the replaceable components
are connected to I'm going to go ahead
and pry that up and you can see it's
held down by a little bit of sticky
stuff as well and so just pull that up
and away from the battery and then
there's a little wire cable that you can
lift up and away from the bottom board
as well there's two of them the black
one and the silver one so make sure to
release both of them at the same time
there's a couple of the ribbon cables
that are released along the top three of
them and then that releases the other
half of the super large ribbon cable
component not sure what else to call
that LG really went above and beyond
with the size of this thing there's also
a little micro board along the side the
after release it's also attached to the
ribbon cable and then that releases the
rest of it pull it up along the battery
and then there is a little ribbon cable
connector at the bottom that's actually
attached to the screen and then this one
down by the microphone as well and then
that releases the whole ribbon cable
away from the screen itself just pry
underneath is a little bit of glue
holding that down as well you can see
the microphone popping out of
a little holster there and there you got
it
so most everything that could break on
your phone is most likely in this part
right here obviously besides the screen
and now you can see the headphone jack
the microphone the charging port if any
of that stuff goes out you have to
replace this whole ribbon we also have
the power button volume buttons I will
put a link in the video description
below for this part so if you need to
replace it go ahead and click below to
find that now I'm just releasing a few
more ribbon cable connectors up along
the top there were those two before and
then this one is the front camera and
then the front proximity sensors once
these are disconnected the motherboard
pulls up and away it has the LED and
then you can see the processor is the
big black box right there the little
wires along the side are also
replaceable I'll put links down in the
video description below for a place
where you can buy all of your components
pulling out the proximity sensors right
now so if your phone stops turning off
the screen when you're on a phone call
and it's pressed against your face most
likely this thing is the culprit little
guy just buy a new one pop it into place
clip it onto your motherboard and you'll
be safe then you have the front-facing
camera as well right here it's taped
onto the screen so I'm just going to
pull it up a little bit and just show
you what it looks like but that pops out
the same way the proximity sensors do
then you have the rear facing camera
right here pretty straightforward it's
also taped in there just pull it up and
away and if you need to replace that
pretty straightforward and now for the
battery the battery is glued on very
very tightly on the screen it's super
important that you do not pry on the
screen because if you put any pressure
on the screen at all the screen is so
thin the chances of you breaking it are
pretty high so when you pry out the
battery from the little holster try to
just go straight in like you see me
doing here instead of using leverage
just put your pry tool straight in
underneath the glue and it will separate
that way replacement batteries can be
found in the video description below as
soon as they become available and this
is the screen so if you crack your
screen this is the part you need to
replace it comes attached with the
digitizer and LCD together
now I'm just getting the battery put
back into place hitting the motherboard
sliding it in underneath and around all
of the other little ribbon cable
connectors making sure there's none
caught underneath it
getting the proximity sensors in the
front-facing camera connected as well as
the battery now this is kind of tricky
you just take the bottom ribbon cable
and make sure that the microphone is
slid into its little holster there's a
little rubber piece along the end of it
also that needs to be on the microphone
but if you're replacing it make sure
that rubber piece goes with it now I'm
sliding the other ribbon cable connector
and the other ribbon cable underneath
through the top of this little circuit
board you can see them pulling up on the
top there and I'm just going to fold
them down and clip them into place in
this last ribbon cable also connected to
the bottom circuit board now getting the
wire cable clip back into place you only
get one shot with this because you
really don't want to bend it once it's
bent there's no fixing so make sure it's
placed directly above the connector and
you place your force directly down onto
it so it doesn't Bend at any one angle
now just getting the wires placed back
into place will sort of orbital on the
side
now it's kind of cool once you get the
big ribbon cable connector equipped in
place the rest of it kind of snaps in
its own little grooves as well to hold
the power button into this correct
location
make sure to clip down all of the other
little connectors
same with this app the ribbon cable then
top
bracket also goes into place through
down those screws at the bottom bracket
and loudspeaker pin down into place as
well get the screws back in then you're
ready to get the back on you'll hear a
series of satisfying clicks as you clip
it back into place
then you're ready to turn the phone on
if you have any questions make sure to
leave them down in the comments remember
that all of the replacement parts when
they become available will also be
placed in the video description below
