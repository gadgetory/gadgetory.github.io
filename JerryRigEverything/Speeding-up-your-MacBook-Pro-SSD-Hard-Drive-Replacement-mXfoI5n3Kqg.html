replace the hard drive in your macbook
pro you have two options one is you can
keep the same type of hard drive that's
in there now and just increase the
capacity of it this is the cheaper
option or you can upgrade to an SSD or a
solid-state drive the SSDs are a little
bit more expensive but your computer
will boot in half the time the programs
will load faster there's no moving parts
so your battery will last longer inside
of your laptop they run cooler and they
also run quieter but I will link both
hard drives down in the video
description below as always it's your
choice I'm just here to show you how
it's done
after you pick which drive you want you
have to move all of your stuff over from
one drive to the other this is called
cloning the drive it'll keep all of your
files all of your programs all of your
homework all of your music everything
will still be there when you clone the
drive I personally use a program called
super duper but you can also use a
program called Carbon Copy cloner both
of them do about the same thing just
download the program plug your new hard
drive into your computer and then do the
clone it'll probably take you know about
45 minutes to a couple hours depending
on how much stuff you have on your hard
drive to transfer over I'll link the
transferring cable along with the hard
drives down in the video description
below as well so let's get started
remember that you open your macbook pro
at your own risk there are 10 Phillips
head screws located around the back edge
of the computer so unscrew all of those
and remove the back panel then you have
two screws that are holding in the hard
drive they're connected to this little
black bracket so set that off to the
side somewhere safe pull up on the
little tab and be super careful right
here you want to unplug the hard drive
so you don't damage that little ribbon
cable that's connecting the plug to the
hard drive you can also see there's some
silver niblets on the side of the hard
drive so unscrew those with a pentalobe
screwdriver if you don't have one of
those I will include it in the video
description transfer over the clear tab
to your new hard drive I'm going with
the solid-state drive on this computer
just because of all the benefits that it
has screwing in those little pentalobe
screws on the side and these just kind
of hold the hard drive in place after
you plug it back in it's the same
connector as the old hard drive used I'm
going to put the little and silver
niblets into the black bracket on that
end piece and then just set it down into
place getting that black bracket screwed
down again and then get those tins
screws back in place that's it thanks
