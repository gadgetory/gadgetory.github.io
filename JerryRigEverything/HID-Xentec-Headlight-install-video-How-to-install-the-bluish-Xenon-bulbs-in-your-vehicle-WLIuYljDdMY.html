how to install a Zen tech lighting
system it basically comes with five main
parts so you have your bulbs right here
make sure not to touch that glass part
on the bulb because the oil from your
fingers can actually make it overheat
and break so make sure not to touch that
then you have what's called the ballast
right here and it's got two connections
that go into the bulb and then a red
connection that actually plugs into this
other cable right here and so on this
end of the connection we have one that
plugs into the bulb one that plugs into
the ballast and then this is a ground so
you just gonna bolt that onto your frame
somewhere you usually use like an
existing bolt and I'll show you how to
do that in a second and then on the
other end we have a few more cables this
is what actually plugs into your
existing wiring harness you know that
comes out of the back of your bulbs and
then it's the same kind of thing over
here with these this goes into your
ballast this goes into the bulb and then
that part goes into the ground which is
just bolted onto your frame and then
with your built in fuse right here on
your last cable this just needs to be
connected to the red of your battery and
that just gives power to the whole
system and then this can be secured
somewhere on your frame where it's not
going to bounce around or get wet or
anything like that and then the other
side is just for the other headlight and
I'll show you how to install it all
right now all right so here's the
original bulbs you can see this is the
connector that goes into the harness and
there's two filaments in there there's
one in the back and there's one up front
and that's your high and low beams so
you can see that the HID bulbs also have
the two filaments inside and that they
are also reflecting straight up into the
housing
just like the old bulbs are so you're
not going to have the same problem with
reflection as they did with the old type
of lights with the old type of lights it
was just this part that was sitting
straight into the the housing the
reflector housing and so the light would
go out everywhere and blind everybody
and that's why they added this part
so the HID lights are much safer than
they used to be this is what we mount
them to the car first then you plug this
in and lock it all right so this is
aimed directly down into the back of the
bulb so I'm just going to reach in here
and unplug it
now it's unplugging I'm gonna get rid of
that dust cap just by pulling up on the
bottom and the whole dust cap comes
loose and then there's depends on what
kind of bulb you have some of them twist
out this one has a little wire spring
type thing that's in there so I'm just
gonna unlatch it and then the bolt comes
out this one just fell out try not to
touch the glass the bulb itself if you
ever plan on reusing it and you can see
that the bulb is right there then I'm
going to save these just because you
know the bolts still have a lot of life
left them and if I ever decide to switch
back to my old system it'd be nice to
have these around kind of expensive
little guys I'm going to take my old
housing unlock it and there's three
little prongs on this thing right there
and those are all going to fit into
their own little slots to keep it
straight up and down and then the little
wire clip just goes right back in and
holds it in place just like that so
that's being 100% securely held in I'm
going to take the desk boat dust boot
and I wiggle that back on the flave all
right got the dust boot on there and
I've kind of pressed it in in the center
there to make sure that it's come up
that it's sealed all the way around this
end right here as well so that no water
or dust gets inside of there all right
so I took out my air filter box would
have a little more room to work with it
I'm gonna go ahead and stick the bulb in
there now
all right now that is locked in place
all right so it doesn't look too pretty
right now just because I'm testing it
out but basically I have everything
plugged in right there I have the ground
that I showed you earlier just tapped in
right next to the battery ground and
then I just took the line with the fuse
in it I just tacked it directly into the
battery lead and then on this end I have
this is that main part coming in from
the other side where I have that guy
plugged in to just where the old
headlight harness used to plug into the
bulb I just plugged into that little guy
and then I came over here to this bulb
and I have the ground hooked in right
here to the frame and then I'm gonna
find a way to take the ballast and kind
of mount it up underneath there once I
have my air filter back in place I took
it out to give me more room to work with
anyway right now they're both on super
bright super pleased with it
go ahead and try the brights alright so
there's a few quick little things it
probably took me about a half hour to
get at this point right now I just need
to get in there and clean up all the
little wires and mount the ballasts and
everything like that so take about a
half hour and plan for that there are
quite a few different bulbs you can buy
there's it's kind of based off of a
color spectrum I would recommend that
most people stick around a five thousand
or a six thousand maybe seven thousand
the more mid-range you stay the more
natural light it'll look like which also
works better in like rainstorms and
stuff like that because when the roads
are wet it's gonna reflect more of the
light back at you and not light up the
road as much so I recommend staying
within there as well as like the blue
lights most people associate that with
the being blinded like I mentioned
before it doesn't have it reflects the
light very well so it's not you know
being displayed all over the road and
blinding drivers in the other lanes
that little reflective housing that
assistant is pretty beneficial I got
these lights off at Amazon I'm gonna
link them in the video description below
along with any tools or anything else
that you need if you have any questions
make sure Liam in the comments I do
respond regularly overall was a fun
project I'm pretty stoked with how it
turned out you can see my before and
after pictures even mind that these
bulbs are not legal in every state so
make sure you check your own state to
see if the bulbs are legal and see if
it's all right to have the HID bulbs
installed in a car like yours another
super important thing is that once these
bulbs are installed the light might
reflect slightly differently so it's
very important to adjust your headlights
so that the lights aren't reflecting
either too high or you like into into
another Lane or something like that and
you can check your local laws and stuff
like that to see exactly how high and
how far the lights can spread other than
that it's a pretty simple operation most
let's just plug and play all the little
plugs can only fit in one spot so it's
not too rough if you don't want to go
through all the trouble of actually
changing out your entire headlight
system you can get this cool stuff on
Amazon that actually cleans the lenses
of your headlights basically if you just
put it on your headlight rub it on let
it sit for a little bit rub it off and
it cleans up your headlights really well
so I'll put a link for that in the video
description below as well it's probably
end up being a little bit cheaper that
way for you especially if your local
laws don't let you put in the HID
headlights thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
