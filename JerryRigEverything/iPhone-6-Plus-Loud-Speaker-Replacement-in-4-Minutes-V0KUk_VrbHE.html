loud speaker on your iPhone 6 Plus.
If you want to see any of the other repair
videos go ahead and click the links in the
front of this one.
To get to the loud speaker on your iPhone
6 Plus, we’re going to go underneath the
screen.
Grab your pentalobe screwdriver and take out
the bottom two screws.
If you need any tools or parts for this project
go ahead and look in the video description
below.
I will have everything linked for you there.
Grab your suction cup and lift up on the screen
a little bit – just so you can slide your
pry tool underneath.
And then pry up on the edge of the screen
which is where the frame is and also the frame
of the phone.
You don’t want to put any pressure on the
screen or else you’re going to bend it or
break it and that’s a more expensive repair
if you end up breaking that.
Don’t bend the screen past 90 degrees or
else you’ll hurt the ribbon cables underneath
this metal plate.
Take off those 5 screws, remove the plate,
and then you’re going to unsnap each of
these little ribbon cables.
You don’t technically have to take off the
screen for this repair, but it does make it
easier because any twist of the screen will
damage these cables.
So you want to be gentle with it.
Set the screen off to the side.
And then you have the 3 screws on the little
metal part that’s next to the battery.
Then you can remove the top metal plate.
Unclip the battery from the rest of the phone
and lift up the little ribbon cable because
there’s another screw hiding underneath
there.
Once you remove that screw, it’s attached
to the vibrating motor, unclip the little
wire cable and then the vibrating motor clips
out.
You can pull the wire cable out from the vibrating
motor – it’s got a little slot right there.
You can see the vibrating motor here, it’s
got the two little connection points that
just clip down onto the wire cable that goes
down to the charging port.
Keep on lifting that wire cable out from the
loud speaker.
Two screws down there at the bottom of the
loud speaker.
Then once those are out it frees the loud
speaker to come away from the phone.
Pretty straightforward.
So this is how you take out the loud speaker.
You can clean it out if there are ever any
metal shavings or if it’s been water damaged.
There are two contact points that go onto
the charging port cable.
So if you replace the loud speaker and it
still doesn’t work, you might need to replace
the charging port cable as well.
Anyway, got that metal bracket back onto the
loud speaker.
And then I’m putting the wire cable in-between
the metal bracket and the loud speaker itself
so that it never gets damaged with the battery.
Screwing in the screw at the corner of the
battery, and then also at the corner of the
loud speaker down there in the other corner
of the phone.
Pinching the wire cable into the vibrating
motor.
Getting that one hidden screw put back in.
Clipping down the ribbon cable.
Clipping down the wire cable.
Then making sure it’s completely clipped
into place or else you’ll get interference
later on.
And then clipping on the battery.
Once the battery is clipped in you can put
on that top metal plate and the bottom screw
for the vibrating motor.
Then you have the screen.
Make sure you’re super careful with these
connections as you pinch them back into place.
If any of the connections on aren’t fully
seated onto the main board, you’re going
to have lines running through your screen.
If that happens, go ahead and turn off your
phone again, lift up the screen and then reseat
the cables.
That’s usually how you fix the lines.
So I’m just kind of putting them over the
top of the connection and then pressing down,
treating them like Legos, pushing them down
all the way making sure they’re secure.
I folded down the screen and then turned on
the phone just to make sure there were no
lines.
Now I’m going to turn off the phone again
because you definitely don’t want to work
on it while it’s not seated down into the
frame.
Now that I know there are no lines I can go
ahead and get these 5 screws back in.
And then there are some grooves along the
top of the screen.
Go ahead and press that into the frame.
Make sure it’s flush and secure and then
you can run your fingers down along the edge
of the phone, pressing that down into the
back of the frame as well.
Just be super careful because screens are
very fragile, especially with a phone this
big.
You do risk breaking it if you press too hard
or in the wrong place.
Make sure you stick around the frame of the
phone.
Get those bottom two pentalobe screws back
in and you are set.

It does mean a lot to me.
And don’t forget to check out my Instagram,
I think it’s pretty fun.
Thanks a ton for watching.
Hope to see you around!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
