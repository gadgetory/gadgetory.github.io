Nexus 5's this one's made by LG I'm
going to take it apart and see what's
inside first of all I need to take off
the back of the phone and generally
speaking the backs of not supposed to
come off so you have to be a little
persuasive about it I separated the back
with my fingernail and kind of used a
pry tool to unlatch the little clasps
that go around the the back of the phone
and just kind of trace the pry tool you
know up and around and all the way down
the other side
little by little working each clasp
individually and then as you move I
start at the top of the phone and move
my way down there's some glue that hold
the bottom of the phone to the back case
you can kind of see as I pry away there
and I'm just working it gently try not
to bend the back too much working my pry
tool up in there and it is finally off
you can see the back of the phone and
here are six screws around the top of
the phone we're going to take apart you
can see in my little diagram there and
now the black plastic is going to come
off the top of the phone and this
exposes the motherboard to us so you can
see the camera all the different wire
cables there's four screws down at the
bottom as well so I'm going to take
those out and then the bottom bracket
will pop up and off away from the phone
just use my little pry tool to get it
away the charging port on this phone is
removable and replaceable which is
really nice this is the speaker for the
phone by the way if it comes off with
deep black back on it and so the
charging ports connected up here on the
main board so I'm going to unlatch that
it's kind of nice to see a different
carrier besides Samsung make their
charging ports replaceable this is
little wire cable along the outside as
well
be super careful when you're lifting
this up I kind of lifted a rope up
around the base of the head of the wire
cable so it wouldn't bend or break the
head of it there's another ribbon cable
latch right there kind of like Legos
just unsnap t'v to replace the battery
you just lift up
at the bottom and then there's another
little ribbon cable that attaches to the
motherboard
super simple I'll replace any I'll place
any parts that I find either on Amazon
or each trade supply down in the video
description below replacement parts so
if you ever need to buy a new battery on
your charging port you can find them
down there there's another two wire
cubile on the other side attached to the
motherboard and this disconnects the
charging port from the mainboard itself
and so now I'm going to pry it away and
like I was saying usually Samsung is the
only one who makes their charging ports
replaceable so it's nice to see other
companies like LG branching out and to
into that because the first thing that
usually breaks out a phone is the
charging port and Samsung's charging
ports are all around you know 10 or 15
bucks so it makes it super repairable
especially for the end user now it is up
and away from the phone and if you're
just replacing your charging port that's
all you got to do grab your new one
place it in latch it down and you're
good to go right here there's another
ribbon cable up along the top of the
phone I'm going to unlatch that and then
there's another one right here by the
camera there's not very many ribbon
cables on this phone that completely
detaches the motherboard away from the
phone itself so I'm going to wiggle that
up and off around the camera the ribbon
cable got caught on the mainboard there
and we are free so that's the mainboard
and here is the earpiece also very
replaceable just pop it up and out so if
your speaker goes out it's super easy to
replace it and grab another one it's
kind of like a little Lego piece you can
play with Legos you can operate on a
phone pop it back into place
also the headphone jack is very
replaceable pops up and out away from
the phone you can see how little
connectors right there that touch the
jack of your earphones when you plug
them in and then they will all feed up
to the mainboard as well
camera also pops up and out so if you
replace your camera super simple
once again if you need replacement parts
that I haven't listed just send me an
email or just leave a comment in the
comments below and I will get that to
you this is the screen right here so if
you need to replace the screen it comes
apart as a whole unit this video I'm not
showing you how to take apart the glass
of the screen mostly because the success
rate of that is super low so I would
highly recommend just replacing the
whole screen as unit the glass and the
LED putting foam back together got the
motherboard slip down over the ribbon
cables making sure that the ribbon
cables are on the top side of the
motherboard and not pinched down
underneath latch them both on just like
the little Legos I was talking about
before grab in the charging port laying
down that into place and the same spot
it was before there's little guidelines
along the plastic of the phone as well
that guide and make sure all the ribbon
cables are in the same spot that they
came out of so it's pretty simple
you're not going to misplace something
especially like these little wire cables
have grooves that they sit down inside
so they said exactly like it was when it
was manufactured now you only have one
chance of this these little wire cables
they do Bend really easily the heads of
them so you want to make sure that it is
directly on top of the port that plugs
into before you apply too much pressure
because if you do break one then you're
just out of luck and you got to buy
another cable so be super careful line
it up press it down get the battery back
in there clip it into place as well
latch the charging port ribbon cable
into place and the bottom bracket which
also includes the loudspeaker
get the screws back into place all four
of those one here's a diagram again same
thing with the top you're going to want
to get all of the six screws back into
place as well once again if you have any
questions make sure to leave them in the
comments
I usually respond pretty quickly
overall I'm pretty satisfied with foam
very well built in my mind compared to
the Samsung I think is very similar to
how Samsung is done with their phones
with the Galaxy S series the three the
four and the notes there will be a
series of satisfying clicks as you pinch
shut the back around the outside of the
phone and once again if you need a
replacement parts let me know it will
link what I have down in the video
description below and that is it don't
forget to subscribe to my channel you
can also hit me up on Google+ Twitter at
Zach's jerry-rigged and also Facebook
jerry-rigged everything hope see you
