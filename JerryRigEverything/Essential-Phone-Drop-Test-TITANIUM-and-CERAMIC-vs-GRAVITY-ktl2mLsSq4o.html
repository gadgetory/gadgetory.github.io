for multiple reasons mostly because in
order to get an accurate idea of how
well a cellphone does during a drop you
would need multiple cell phones you know
five or ten and my wallet can't handle
that I'm just one guy plus every drop is
a little bit different some will drop
from you know when you're sitting down
on your leg and we'll just slide off
some phones will drop when you pulled
out your pocket and accidentally let it
go it's hard to come up with just one
test to cover all the different kinds of
drops but every now and then I'll make
an exception like with the show me me
mixed phone that came out about a year
ago that phone is made out of ceramic
and I wanted to see how that held up
against a drop this phone the essential
phone is in a similar situation the back
is made out of ceramic the front is
Gorilla Glass 5 and the sides are made
out of titanium so it'll be interesting
to see what's damaged first in a drop so
let's see what happens
all right so in order to do this drop
test I have two cameras set up I'll have
my essential phone sitting on my lap
right here and I'll just stand up and
let it fall down to the ground you know
just like a normal everyday drop
situation then here I have my Galaxy
Note 8 which is filming in slow motion
this is the one I took the color off the
back it's clear and this is my Galaxy s8
which is very scientifically situated on
top of this tripod also filming in slow
motion so here we have the phone it is
in 100% working condition right now it's
kind of bright outside we can still see
the screen moving it does have a couple
imperfections on it which is another
reason I don't do drop tests because
I've already compromised the integrity
of the ceramic panel as well as the
front glass the Gorilla Glass 5 and the
ceramic on the back you know the sides
have scratches too but you know a
scratch doesn't compromise metal as much
as it does ceramic and glass I said on
my knee like this it actually just
slides off well enough that we're just
gonna leave it like that
they're coming from my knee doesn't look
like there's any damage done on the back
yet oh wow I did not think that was
gonna happen I thought that the plastic
ring around the edge would help the
glass not crack
that's way interesting it still is
functioning underneath the glass so
that's good
another interesting thing is that my
scratch marks right here from my Mohs
pics are right here and right here and
the crack emanated from over here on the
side and down here on the bottom corner
let's do it again and see if the
anything happens to the back panel we'll
just let it slide off my leg naturally
back panel is still fine if I were to
stand up from about pocket height
still nothing on the back panel the
fronts just as correct as it was during
that first drop waist height with the
back facing down that was a pretty solid
drop and the back is still fine that's
impressive
screen is just the same as it was on
that first drop that might have just
been an extremely unlucky first drop
just give it one more shot waist height
straight down on the back so we're
looking at the ceramic we got the crack
in the corner there looks like the
screen over the screen took some major
damage on that last one the ceramic up
here in the top corner looks alright the
plastic is what you know that plastic
surrounding the lip is what's really
damaged you have my scratch marks but
other than my scratch marks the ceramic
looks pretty undamaged the back panel is
still 100% fine no scratches besides the
ones that I put on it and the screen is
just roasted it's like we're missing
entire chunks of glass out of the front
that's crazy
since the screen is already broken we're
going to try it one more time from head
height right about here and we'll see if
we can get the back ceramic panel to
damage
even from a head height drop the back
panel doesn't do anything on cement now
the screen still completely destroyed
though last time head height
and the back panel is still fine I guess
getting a screen protector for this
thing would be a good idea because the
screen protector does help the glass
hold together especially in drops so
even though a drop test is an incredibly
scientific I still think it's super
super interesting personally I thought
that the back was gonna be the first
thing that breaks since ceramic has a
much higher rating on Mohs scale of
hardness it's more brittle the glass the
Gorilla Glass 5 should have lasted a
little bit longer in my opinion but
drops are so hard to predict now the
good news is is that since the back
didn't break and ass and the side
titanium didn't really damage the screen
is the easiest thing to protect on the
whole cellphone obviously a case would
help an extraordinary amount but a
screen protector would do a lot as well
whether it's the plastic kind of screen
protectors or the glass screen
protectors if it were to drop fall hit a
rock the first thing that except that
absorbs that impact is the screen
protector itself and not the more
expensive screen of the phone so a
screen protector and a case are pretty
important no matter what cell phone you
own I am going to attempt to tear down
of this phone even though the
replacement parts probably aren't
available for it it'll be interesting to
see how the phone is built from the
inside and what components can be
replaced and what components can't so if
that subscribe button hit the thumbs up
if you liked this drop test and if you
want me to do more in the future on
different phones not every phone because
like I said drops are so unpredictable
and it's hard to make a scientific test
for every single phone without buying
like ten of them anyway
thanks for watching and I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
