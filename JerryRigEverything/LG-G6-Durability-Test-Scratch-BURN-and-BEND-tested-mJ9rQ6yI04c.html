version of the LG G six I've already
reviewed this thing from the inside with
the teardown video and now that I have
the retail version it's time to put it
through the rest of my tests it's time
we find out if that gigantic screen is
going to compromise the overall
structural integrity let's get started
my durability tests are a pretty good
indicator of how well cellphones are
going to hold up over their normal
lifespan as always we'll start with a
scratch test these most pics will tell
us what the screen is made of some
phones are plastic like the galaxy s7
active or the no phone both of those
scratch at level 3
luckily the LG G 6 is using tempered
Gorilla Glass 3 on the display which
means it won't scratch until level 6
just like most of the other smartphones
these days now even though it is using
tempered glass it's not invincible
and I'll talk more about that in just a
second down here at the bottom of the
phone the LG u logo is underneath the
glass so it won't ever rub or scratch
off there is no physical home button on
the front of the device so we'll mosey
on up here to the 5 megapixel front
facing camera this is also protected by
that same Gorilla Glass 3 and it should
be scratch resistant as well now one
thing I really like about this phone is
that everything is completely flush
nothing protrudes past the glass layer
including the metal earpiece grille from
a design perspective it looks absolutely
amazing but that also means if you set
the phone facedown on a granite
countertop or tile granite is a Mohs 6
or 7 the phone might get damaged by the
rock since there's no protective lip on
the device and granite is harder than
glass so a screen protector would
definitely be a good idea with this
phone now the back of the LG G 6 is a
little more interesting the fingerprint
scanner and home button are back here
ideally centered exactly a middle of
foam as I scratched this scanner does
not have the same rubbery texture that I
found on the Motorola g5 so
theoretically it might scratch a little
bit easier but even with a plethora of
superficial scratches on the scanner it
still functions perfectly fine and
recognizes my finger so scratching isn't
something to be super worried about
the LGG six has two cameras a 13
megapixel wide-angle camera and a 13
megapixel regular camera with the
optical image stabilizing that I talked
about in my teardown both of these are
protected with the same piece of scratch
resistant glass and once again I love
the completely flush design but because
it's flush anytime you set it on a table
or countertop that glass is going to be
rubbing right up against the surface of
whatever you set it on since there's no
lips protected so personally I would get
a case or even a skin to rate the
surface of the phone just enough to
protect that camera when you set it down
the skin I applied here on this g6 is
from D brand the first time I heard the
name D brand I thought it was just
someone's initials but it actually
stands for D branding a cell phone as in
covering the logos or the carrier
branding kind of clever thanks B brand
for sending me the skin I'll put a link
in the description if you want to check
out any of their other skin variations
and now my personal favorites checking
the material quality we learned that the
back panel is glass from my teardown
video it took quite a bit of force for
me to shatter now it's time to see what
the sides are made of the gleam of metal
shows through on both of the volume
buttons down the length of the side is
also real metal definitely no coating or
paint here just a good old premium
feeling cold hard metal even up here
next to the headphone jack is no and
over here the SIM card tray is metal as
well it's nice when companies pay
attention to the little details down
here by the USBC port at the bottom we
find more medals this phone is
water-resistant with USB C and a
headphone jack we are definitely in the
future now when it comes to the flame
test this phone did roast slightly
faster than average the pixels started
to turn off at 6 seconds instead of the
normal 8 or 15 seconds like we've seen
on some other devices basically this
just means that your phone will toast
five seconds sooner than everyone else's
during the apocalypse but I mean you're
probably going to be dealing with bigger
issues at that point anyway now one
thing I want to point out before the bin
test is that the rear glass on this
phone is tucked inside the metal frame
which means that during the bin
test it is going to be adding strength
to the device HTC missed out on that
little trick when it came to you ultra
that glass was just resting on top of
the frame so let's see if this design
trick helps the g6 I've never had an lg
phone fail my Ben test yet
me and the g5 had a couple disagreements
but it didn't fail to Ben test either
and with the solid metal frame of the g6
it's not surprising that there's almost
no flex to this phone even when bending
from the front or the back if you
remember from my iPhone 7 bin test that
flex enough to break the watertight seal
but even after bending this LG g6 none
of the seals are broken so this phone
passes the Ben test with flying colors
my only issue would be that while the
completely flush design is aesthetically
pleasing to look at it leaves the camera
lens and screen very exposed to
scratching but a simple case or screen
protector would solve that problem
easily lengthening the lifespan of your
device significantly and that's what
we're all about
plus it'll look sly like a g6 thanks ton
for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
