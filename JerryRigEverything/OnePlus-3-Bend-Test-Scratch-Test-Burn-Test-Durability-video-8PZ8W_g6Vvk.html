from the company oneplus this is the one
plus three I've previously tested the
oneplus 2 and the oneplus X both of
which survived my durability tests let's
see what happens with this new design
which is supposedly carved out of a
single slab of aluminum the oneplus
three was bigger than I anticipated it
is the same size as my galaxy s7 edge
after admiring the reflective logo on
the back let's jump into the scratch
test it does come with a pre-installed
plastic screen protector so I'll remove
that I have a set of pics that tell me
where the hardness of the screen falls
on Mohs scale of hardness each pick has
a different material on the tip the
oneplus 3 has Gorilla Glass 4 on the
screen so it's no surprise that the
glass does not scratch until a level 6
and much deeper groove is left with a
level 7 pick but this is normal and on
par with most every other smartphone
that doesn't have a plastic screen like
the galaxy s7 active the home button is
made of ceramic which is awesome if you
remember on my galaxy s7 and LG g5
scratch tests both of those have plastic
home buttons that can scratch easily the
galaxy s7 active even scratched to the
point of not working anymore that won't
be a problem with this one plus three
there are zero scratches which means
that the fingerprint scanner can last
longer
thumbs up for ceramic the 16 megapixel
rear camera lens is made of glass so
even though it protrudes out of the back
of the phone a little it is resistant to
normal scratches
unlike the plastic camera lenses of the
z5 premium and the blackberry prif clear
pictures are always important onto that
slab of premium aluminum the phone is
pure metal so there is no thick coating
of primer or plastic like you'll see on
the LG g5 and you can feel it the phone
is cold to the touch
I tried scratching the reflective logo
to see if it would pop out like the
lumia 950xl or the Nexus 6 but it is
very well embedded into the rear metal
so it won't be falling out on its own so
far this device is a champion the volume
button alert slider power button and
even the SIM card tray are all made of
metal so there won't be any warping of
plastic buttons like we saw with the old
Evo phones even the speaker grille is
made of metal
little things like that add up when
making a quality phone one-plus did not
skimp on materials on to the flame test
the 1+3 went with an AMOLED screen for
this device so let's see how it holds up
to the extreme heat the galaxy s7 edge
lasted 14 seconds before turning white
and not recovering as you saw at the
beginning of this video it has a
permanent white spot on the screen the
oneplus three also made it 14 seconds
before the pixels turned white
but after removing the heat the screen
slowly recovered and went back to normal
it was cool to the touch within seconds
onto the bin test while putting this
much pressure on a phone at one time
most likely won't happen in everyday
life it does tell us if the phone will
survive any extreme accidents and all of
the tests together will show us what the
phone will look like after 2 years of
abuse cell phones are realistically the
most abused pieces of technology on the
planet so if you haven't subscribed yet
I would recommend it it's free and
ensures they won't be buying a cheap
phone in the future the bin test scared
me at first because the screen popped
out of the frame but even after exerting
a lot of pressure the phone still
wouldn't snap remember that I've tested
over 25 phones now four of them snapped
catastrophic aliy but the rest survived
the one plus three is a survivor even
after bending both directions the front
and the back there is no permanent
damage and the best part is there's no
kinks in the metal frame either some of
the Huawei phones would have permanent
damage or kinks next to the power button
or volume buttons after a hard flex but
the oneplus three can be straightened
out to look just like new I'll open up
the phone during my tear down and repair
video to see what's inside and how to
repair everything it's fun to analyze
tech from the inside from a durability
and build quality perspective this is
one of my favourite phones so far this
year I did do a behind-the-scenes snap
story of the durability test on this
phone
I'll also be snapping the teardown
process so if you're into disappearing
videos head on over to my snapchat hope
to see you around
