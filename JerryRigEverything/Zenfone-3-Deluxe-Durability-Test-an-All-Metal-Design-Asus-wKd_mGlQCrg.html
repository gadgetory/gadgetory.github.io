popular phone from Asus this is the
zenfone 3 deluxe I put brand new phones
through a series of durability tests to
see what they're made of and how well
they stand up to the test of time the
box of this phone is pretty phenomenal
opening the lid exposes a very thin
layer of brushed aluminum whose
reflections to wreck your focus to the
phone in the center
it looks like Asus is in search of
something incredible have they found it
with this phone let's find out
my initial thoughts holding this phone
is that it is pretty lightweight
compared to my normal galaxy s7 or
iPhone or even the oneplus 3 and that
makes me nervous because when assessing
durability weight is usually associated
with quality let's start with the
scratch test I have a set of most pics
that tell me what the screen is made of
if the screen is plastic like the galaxy
s7 active or droid turbo - it will
scratch at a level-3 tempered glass like
Gorilla Glass we usually scratch at a
level 6 and harder materials like
sapphire will scratch at an eight or a
nine
this phone scratches at a level six
which means we're working with tempered
glass like most other smartphones these
days the same front glass covers the
eight megapixel camera and the sensors
so those are protected and inside the
ear slot the grille seems to be made of
plastic or vinyl covering so if you ever
need a clean dirt or makeup out of this
hole don't go too deep or it can tear
now here's the part I was super curious
about all over a Souza's website they're
claiming that this phone is an all-metal
miracle and that it has pure metal
technology which is fine except for they
have this TM thing right next to it
which means that is just a trademark
phrase instead of an actual material so
I was nervous but the sound shows us
that it is indeed metal I thought Asus
was going to pull an LG g5 and make a
plastic sandwich and call it premium but
they didn't thumbs up a Zeus the back
panel of the phone is definitely metal
if you squint your eyes real hard and
use all of your imagination you can
clearly see that this is a pony
fingerprint scanners are usually made up
of a different material than the rest of
the phone and that is the case with the
zenfone 3 - looks this scanner seems to
have a plastic coating on it which can't
get scratched pretty easily I think we
can all agree that this particular
fingerprint scanner is scratched more
heavily than could ever happen in real
life with normal use so let's see if it
can still function it still allows me to
set my fingerprint and unlock the phone
every single time I touch it which is
pretty impressive you definitely don't
need to worry about damaging the
fingerprint scanner on this phone so far
Asus has done a really good job with
build quality even the camera lens is
real glass so it won't be scratching on
its own like a plastic lens would now
when I come to the side of the phone
this is where I encounter my
first issue that satisfying
metal-on-metal scratching sound that we
all enjoy is nowhere to be heard only
when I get deep enough through the thick
layer of plastic do I see a glint of
silver metal call it plastic call it
primer whatever this layer is your hand
is not touching metal when you are
holding the phone which is absolutely
fine if this phone wasn't so heavily
marketed as all metal on their website
it does have more metal than the LG g5
though which also claim to be all metal
at least the back panel on the zenfone
threes Lux is legit as you can hear from
my razor it is just the size of the
phone that are having an identity crisis
so now we know any time someone tries to
pull a trademark metal shenanigan it's
not going to be real metal now there are
two different versions of the zenfone 3
deluxe a 5.7 inch version with an AMOLED
screen and a 5.5 inch version with an
IPS LCD that was released a few months
after the first version both are branded
with the same zenfone 3 deluxe name and
both have the same build quality and
exterior materials the IPS screen of the
5.5 inch lasted 8 seconds under my
lighter but fully recovers now I've had
several people tweet me about lighting
their own phone on fire this is a
terrible idea
even if the pixels do fully recover
there is still damage done to the
oleophobic coating that coating gets
evaporated by flame so definitely leave
the phone burning to a professional
phone burner like myself speaking of
tests you shouldn't do at home the bend
test of the zenfone 3 deluxe is anxiety
inducing it appears to disobey the laws
of physics the screen stopped working
for a second after the bend but after
turning it off and turning it back on
again we are back in business
bending from the front of the phone
yielded much sturdier results I imagine
because the glass inside of the frame
kept it pretty sturdy and rigid and
while the metal is pretty disfigured it
can be mostly bent back into its
original shape and continue on
functioning just like normal so as long
as you are okay with plastic sides on
this so-called all-metal phone design
this is a pretty solidly built phone
good as new do you think a suit should
get a pass on calling this phone all
metal or do you think phone
manufacturers should be more specific on
what their phone is made of let me know
in the comments I test every new phone
that comes out to make sure your
notifications from my channel are
enabled so you never miss out
on a durability test Instagram and
Twitter are where I'm active most and if
your mom catches you lighting your phone
on fire you don't know me thanks for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
