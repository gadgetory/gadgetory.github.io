lately over the construction of their
recent iPhones because they're so
expensive to replace with the iPhone X
it's 549 dollars to replace the back
glass with the iPhone 8 plus it's a
little bit cheaper but still incredibly
expensive so today I'm gonna put my
money where my mouth is and I have two
brand new phones the iPhone X and the
iPhone eight plus both of them have the
glass backs with the new construction
design and we're gonna drop them both
with realistic drops and see when they
may or may not break remember that drop
tests are never conclusive with a larger
sample size you can get a better idea of
what's gonna happen I have done two drop
tests in the past with regular-sized
iPhone eights but I have never dropped
these two phones so be interesting to
see what happens
plus I'll be attempting my own back
glass repairs on these broken phones so
I need broken phones in order to do that
so it's all for a good cause
Apple does claim to have the most
durable glass ever on a smartphone so
it'll be interesting to see what happens
with this iPhone X and the new iPhone 8
plus let's get started
so like always we'll have two
smartphones this is the Galaxy S 8 plus
and over here we have the Google pixel
two both of these will be recording in
slow motion as we do the drop test so
I'll start with the iPhone eight plus it
also has an aluminum frame which is
slightly softer than stainless steel and
can be pushed into the glass a little
more easily now both the iPhone 8 plus
and the iPhone X have a small plastic
layer between the glass in the metal but
since aluminum gets pressed in easier
I'm going to assume that this one breaks
sooner so I'm just gonna set this on my
leg right now it's about three feet up
or 1 meter give or take both cameras are
recording and I'll just stand up
so after the first drop it looks like
the back is fine you get right up here
on the corner next to the camera bump
but the back panel is fine and the front
is fine set that down and we'll start
playing with the iPhone X or the iPhone
10 whatever you want to call it this one
does have the stainless steel rails on
the side which is a little bit harder
than aluminum so my assumption is that
this is going to break after the 8 plus
but there's only one way to find out go
ahead and set this on my leg and we will
stand up looks like the back glass is
totally fine front glass is still good
let's try it again
will do sitting down one more time
because this is the most common type of
drop just for getting it's on your lap
and then standing up and the back glass
this is amazing the back glass is
completely shattered I'm impressed at
how shattered that is from such a short
drop Wow so this brand new iPhone 8 plus
took only 2 drops from about knee height
as it slides off my leg to completely
shatter the back and now we owe a palay
of money to replace this thing that is
mind-blowing this wouldn't be an issue
if we could just remove the back without
destroying the camera and replace it you
know with a third-party but what Apple
does is that they replace the whole
housing of the phone transferring over
all the internal components because the
back glass does not separate from the
back housing all right now that the
iPhone 8 plus is completely shattered
let's go back to the iPhone X once again
I think this one will last a little bit
longer because of that stainless steel
frame but let's find out it is on my leg
standing up
looks like the front is still fine the
back glass is still totally fine no
damage
so hopefully that stainless steel side
is absorbing the impact and not denting
in to hit the glass so the iPhone 8 plus
is completely shattered but we're gonna
do another drop test anyway and see how
long it takes the front to shatter now
I'll be pulling it out of my pocket and
dropping it from about waist height
that time around it did fall directly on
the screen as I flopped it out of my
pocket from waist high the front of the
phone is completely damaged whether it's
from the glass slightly protruding above
the edge of the aluminum right here or
just the aluminum getting pushed into
the top edge of the glass and breaking
it that way either way the front and the
back of this phone are completely
damaged now from I think dropped two and
three of this drop test so as far as
most durable glass on a smartphone ever
glass is still glass and gravity is
still gravity but we're not done with
the X yet let's keep going we'll pull it
out of my pocket and let it hit the
ground
all right still nothing wrong with the X
we have complete solid glass on the back
and no cracks on the front we'll do one
more waist-high drop with the X since
the 8 plus is bit the dust yet again
waist-high there is nothing wrong with
the front of the phone still zero cracks
on the whole front side of the device
but on the back side right next to the
camera hump there's the smallest of
Nick's so I'm gonna assume that with the
next drop or a drop soon after the whole
back is going to shatter from that point
because once there's a weak point
introduced into the glass that's where
all the damage happens we'll do one more
from about chest high
so it was wrong about where the glass
was gonna crack it did not start from up
by the camera hump it actually emanates
from the bottom corner all the way up to
the top but now the back glass is
shattered and we owe Apple five hundred
and forty nine dollars to replace it not
because the components are expensive
this back glass portion probably only
cost about twenty dollars it's the
construction of the phone that makes it
expensive it is not removable and that's
the bad part Samsung as you pay that 20
bucks get the replacement part and
you're good to go so now the iPhone X
the iPhone 10 has been damaged from
chest-high we're going to do one more if
it's like drops from your hand while
it's up by your ear I'm about six feet
tall about two meters give or take so
let's see what happens
so the front glass of the phone does
have damage in that bottom left corner
nothing too drastic but it is damaged
and the back is now just shattered
everywhere so overall I would say I'm
pretty disappointed in the construction
of the Apple phone I think they look
fantastic I love the glass I love the
metal the stainless steel is probably
one of my favorite phone materials of
all time
but the way the back glass is adhered to
the phone is incredibly stupid
it is not repairable and it is
incredibly expensive to replace for us
as the consumers which means there will
be a ton of these phones walking around
in the wild with cracked backs from
people who don't want to pay $500 to
replace them so now that we know how the
phones are constructed and how fragile
they are it's time to make a decision
and to me a case seems like a no-brainer
in my past videos I did have a case on
one of the phones that I was dropping
and it lasted significantly longer than
the naked phone and with the high price
point cost of repair on these phones the
risk is not worth the reward
yeah the phones look good naked but they
don't last long naked so yeah I would
say a case is mandatory on both of these
phones because you're basically buying a
new phone with the price it cost to
repair it definitely a poor decision on
Apple's part let me know what you think
though down in the comments I'm curious
would you buy a phone like this and if
you would buy an extremely fragile phone
that's expensive to repair would you
walk around with it naked
or would you put a case on it as always
thanks a ton for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
