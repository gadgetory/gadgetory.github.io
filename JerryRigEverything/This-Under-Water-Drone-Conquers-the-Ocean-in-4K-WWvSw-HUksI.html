right now I'm in a place called the isla
de las mujeres right next to Cancun
there's this place called the underwater
Museum where there's a bunch of statues
buried down to kind of help you know the
wildlife and stuff under the ocean
normally when I review drones they're
the kind of drones that fly around in
the air today we have an underwater
drone that films things underwater in 4k
should be pretty interesting so after we
check out the footage we'll take the
drone apart and see what the water
protection is actually like let's get
started one of the things that's really
hard with this actually because like
with the drone you can actually see
which way it's oriented in the sky you
know the lights on the propellers and
stuff like that with this you don't
really know what direction that's going
when you're in the water because there's
no way to like orient yourself except
for when it reaches the surface
going in
whatever lies inside of the box we have
the drone itself this thing is legit
here we have one of the vents for the
propellers so when it's sinking down
it's sucking the water up and shooting
at the top of the drone then we have the
connector here which goes to the tether
into the battery pack and the signal
where it stores all the information we
have the propellers in the back here
underneath the drone here's the
propeller that brings it up and down
this is a sonar fish finder tells us the
water temperature and finds fish down to
one hundred and thirty feet and then
this is a little magnet on the front so
if you will have like bait or something
you need to drop while fishing you can
just release this from the controller
and drop the bait in the front of the
drone we have two headlights led looks
like and then we have a 4k camera and
that cameras on a two axis gimbal the
tethers 225 feet and it goes into that
receiver there then the controller is
kind of like the DJI set up where you
have the mount for your phone and then
you have the controllers there on the
side pretty sweet so this thing right
here is called the base station it's
actually like the Wi-Fi emitter because
signals underwater don't travel so
bluetooth and Wi-Fi just don't work
underwater very far so with the
tethering cord that's why we have that
and then this transmits Wi-Fi into the
controller just like the DJI controller
does data storage for like the footage
and things that's all stored inside the
drone with internal storage so there's
no removable SD card slot what makes
sense though because the whole thing is
waterproof
instead of water-resistant so having the
SD card slot would've been really
inconvenient as far as waterproofing
that goes one of the hugest perks about
this whole setup though is that the
charging port which is also the same
thing for the tether the battery inside
of the sink can last for two hours
imagine a drone in the sky being able to
last that long probably one of the
reasons the battery lasts so long is
that the water is holding most of the
way to the drone and it doesn't need it
like support itself in the sky and the
propellers are pretty small I'm
confident
when you're flying the drone you can't
go left and right to circle around
something you can only go forward and
back and then like twist the front left
and right so it's little bit different
than flying in the air so it doesn't
make things a little bit harder to
control but it's not too bad this thing
lights up blue but like I was explaining
earlier like it doesn't really orient
yourself when you're in the water
because you literally can't see it so
basically you're just looking around you
in the water maybe you can find the
bottom of the boat you're in but it's
really hard to tell like distance and
stuff when you're flying the water
so now that we've seen what this can do
and we've explored the outside of it you
know it's time to explore the inside
let's take this thing apart and see what
makes it so waterproof one thing to
remember as we take apart this power Ray
is that it's waterproof to 30 meters or
98 feet depending on what part of the
world you're diving in water-resistant
cell phones like the iPhone or the
Galaxy phones are only water resistant
to one or one and a half meters that's a
huge difference it'll be a shame to see
what's inside
there are seven screws holding down the
exterior plastics these are mostly for
decoration and physical protection since
there's no waterproofing around the
exterior edges
it'll unsnap from the lower body
exposing the more important components
there are some weights attached to lower
shell this might be to keep it oriented
in the water bottom side down or it
might also be because this is a
pre-production unit that isn't quite
finished there is a final version for
sale in Amazon today already and I'll
link that in the description but this
one's just a functional prototype the
three different propellers are now
exposed all the motors are concealed
inside the watertight black plastic
housing the other side of the white
shell can also pull away from the
watertight internals and now it's
definitely looking more like a submarine
than a drone there are a total of 46
hexagonal 2.0 screws holding the two
plastic halves together after all those
screws are out the top half can lift
away there's still wires attached to
that top tethering point as far as
waterproofing goes a thick green rubber
ring surrounds the entire outer lip of
the Power Ray that rubber gets smashed
by the 46 screws around the edge keeping
all the water from ingressing there's
also a shiny grease covering that outer
lip as well water and oily substances
don't mix so there's multiple
waterproofing barriers at work here
there are four screws holding down the
main board to the plastic body and this
would be a good time to mention that any
time you take something waterproof or
water-resistant apart it'll never be
water-resistant again until it's
resealed so with this particular project
I don't plan on reassembling this drone
since it's already been compromised I'll
just keep it for parts I unplugged a few
of the signal cables interesting ly
enough there's an Ethernet port on the
motherboard that explains the long
tether and how that signal works I've
never seen that inside of a drone before
there are a few more plugs leading off
for the fish finders and front camera
and then the whole motherboard lifts off
exposing the battery now this is pretty
interesting the battery that's held in
place by the four smaller
hexagonal 1.5
is the same battery that fits inside the
power egg an aerial drone made by the
same company inside the underwater drone
the battery is not removable but inside
the power egg it is it's smart using the
same battery across multiple products
saves a lot of money all three of the
propellers have black wires connecting
to the small circuit board in the front
right next to that 4k camera and the
front LED headlights the drone is
already pretty sweet but if I could add
one more thing it would be the ability
to flow sideways instead of just forward
and backward
it would require adding additional
motors but it would be nice to have more
control while filming it was super fun
to take apart something that's actually
waterproof the waterproofing on this
power is pretty intense and I think it's
time to go wash my hands I'll toss a
link in the video description with
current pricing for this thing whether
it's just for fun or actual industrial
underwater inspections it's a pretty
useful little tool thanks stuff for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
