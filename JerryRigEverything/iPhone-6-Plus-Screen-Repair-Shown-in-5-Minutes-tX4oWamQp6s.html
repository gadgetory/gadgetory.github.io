to replace the screen on the iPhone
six-plus if you want to see any of the
other repairs go ahead and click the
links in the front and menu here's the
iPhone 6 plus and with the giant screen
it is prone to breakage so we're gonna
go ahead and do is take out the bottom
two screws they are the pentalobe screws
the same screws that are in all of the
other iphones if you need any tools or
parts check the video description i'll
have everything linked down there take
your suction cup and lift up on the
screen and that will allow you to slip
your pry tool in between the screen and
the frame of the phone pry up very
gently because you don't want to damage
the screen any more than it is and then
you'll be able to lift the screen up
don't lift it up past 90 degrees or
you'll put stress on the ribbon cables
that are underneath this metal plate
take out the five screws then you can
remove the metal plate and then each of
these little ribbon cables is kind of
like a Lego you just unsnap them from
its little connector and then lift it up
there's four little connectors
underneath here after the four
connectors are done the screen comes up
and your replacement screen probably
won't come with the hardware so I'm
going to show you how to transfer all
that to the new screen start with the
earpiece there's three screws on the
middle bracket lift that up then you can
grab your earpiece out
once again replacement parts are in the
video description and then you'll
probably need to move over the little
plastic bits as well they're glued down
so just unsnap those from the old screen
and then you can lift off the ribbon
cable contraption
this will also be linked down in the
description below so if you're a
proximity sensor or your front camera is
messed up go ahead and check that out
there's two screws holding down the home
button remove that bracket
ribbon cable connectors right here so
just unsnap that and then you can press
the home button out from the front of
the phone
lift up little circuit board as well
make sure not to put any stress on the
ribbon cable at all or else your
fingerprint scanner won't work when you
install it again there's the home button
and fingerprint scanner there's a bunch
of screws around the outside edge of the
metal plate so go ahead and undo those
and then the bottom ribbon cable is
still glued to the frame so make sure
you pry that up very gently and then the
metal backing will come away from the
screen there it is along with the
fingerprint scanner and then you can
transfer all those parts over to your
new screen and once again these are
linked down in the video description
below so if you need to buy a new one
check their place that metal bracket
back down on the phone again over the
little ribbon flap that's underneath the
earpiece make sure it's on top get all
the screws back in along the sides now
let's get the home button in place just
press it gently down the glue that was
on it before should still be sticky so
it should just stick right back in there
how it was clipped that ribbon cable
you'll kind of feel snap it in place
just like a Lego get the two screws on
the bracket back in pretty
straightforward now with the earpiece
section you want to get that little
bracket in place once you get the ribbon
cable on top of it it'll hold the
plastic better than it is right now fold
each part individually place it exactly
where it needs to go it's kind of like a
puzzle so if each part isn't exactly
where it needs to be it's not going to
fit very smoothly slide the earpiece in
between the cables because the top part
of the ribbon cable has the connections
that make the earpiece work get the
camera down in the little plastic hole
and then the metal bracket goes right
over the top and it should fit very
easily lining up very easily with the
holes if it's not fitting easily you
should probably lift it up and make sure
everything's positioned correctly now
that all our parts are on the new screen
we can go ahead and clip it back in once
again you got to be really careful with
these ones you don't want to bend any of
the connections so make sure you
position it directly over the connection
and then press down and you'll feel it
snap in with your fingers I keep on
referencing Legos because that's exactly
how it is now if your screen has lines
through it when you turn it back on
there's a chance that one of these
ribbon cables didn't get snapped on
correctly so turn your phone off and
then lift up the screen again and make
sure each of the connections are good
I mean there's a chance that your screen
is bad but check the connections first
the connections are good on this one so
now I can go ahead and put that metal
bracket on turning the phone off first
because you don't want to work on it at
all while the phone is on now the metal
bracket with the five screws get that
back into place then the top of the
phone has these little grooves that you
want to slide into the frame get that
first and then you can press down along
the edges snapping each of those little
things back into place as well remember
don't use a whole lot of force you're
gonna break your new screen and that is
not the direction you want to go once
your screen is snapped in you can turn
it on
make sure the bottom two pentalobe
screws are in and you are set thanks a
