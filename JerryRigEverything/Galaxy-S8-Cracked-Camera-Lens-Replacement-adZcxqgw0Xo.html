your Galaxy s8 don't worry it can be
replaced on its own for cheap without
opening up the phone and repair didn't
take very long it is pretty tricky
though so make sure to watch this video
all the way through let's get started
the exterior protective camera glass for
the Galaxy s8 and the Galaxy S a flood
is the exact same size on both phones
the clear glass has no focusing
abilities it's just a little square
clear protection the maintain holding
the glass onto the phone is some really
strong adhesive visit he said can be
softened with some high heat you can use
a hairdryer for this but since I don't
have a hairdryer a heat gun works as
well once the glass is warmed up until
it's just barely too hot to touch you
can pick your starting point mine is
going to be the center point where the
glass is broken and then try to lift off
the camera glass without dropping any
glass shards or dust into the camera
unit below the reason you don't want any
glass falling inside of the camera unit
is because in order for the camera to
focus and stabilize the camera has to
physically move and if glass dust is
caught down inside of the unit it will
block that movement making the camera
unable to function so keep the dust and
any new glass breakage during this
removal to a minimum feel free to warm
up the glass if the adhesive starts to
harden again after the big chunks are
gone make sure to clear that adhesive
completely out from inside of that metal
ring if there are any little niblets of
adhesive or bits of glass dust when you
press your new lens into place the new
lens will shatter because of that
pressure point I'll use the sticky side
of a piece of tape to try to pick up any
remaining shards of glass inside the
metal frame and here you can see what I
was talking about earlier with how the
camera needs to physically move around
in order to stabilize itself and focus a
good replacement camera glass took me a
long time to find there are a lot of
plastic imitation lenses on the market
and nothing works quite as well as glass
does and these bonafide hardware camera
lenses are real glass I'll link these
lenses down in the video description
it's not a bad idea to get one as a
backup or maybe get two if you're
actually attempting this repair on a
Galaxy s8 because one might break during
the installation it is glass after all
make sure there are no fingerprints or
dust on the underside of that glass
before you plop it down into the little
square on that metal frame I'm using a
clean cloth to just brush off any prints
and then I can remove the adhesive
protection then I'll drop the lens into
place gently situate the glass inside of
that metal square this is where most
people will probably break the
replacement lens by applying too much
pressure
as a sidenote even though there is
adhesive surrounding that lens I still
wouldn't trust the replacement to be
water-resistant and while that might be
slightly disappointing a cracked camera
lens isn't water-resistant either the
little yellow blip you see on the screen
is for my Galaxy s8 durability test
video a while back it's not from the
camera it looks like my focus is working
and the camera is taking clear pictures
a tip per if your camera stops focusing
its to open up the camera app turn the
phone camera side down and do a couple
sharp taps on the screen to jiggle any
dust out of the camera unit if that
doesn't work and the camera doesn't
correct itself after a few days the
camera unit might have gotten damaged
during the glass breakage replacing the
camera unit is also pretty inexpensive
but it does require opening up the phone
I'll link the repair video in the video
description if you want to see how that
had done if this video helped you or you

me on Twitter and Instagram I've linked

the video description right below this
video and thanks for watching I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
