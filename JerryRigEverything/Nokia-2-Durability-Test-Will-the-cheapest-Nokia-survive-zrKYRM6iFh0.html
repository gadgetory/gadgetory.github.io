$100 here in the United States it's the
cheapest phone in a Nokia lineup Nokia
has never failed a durability test but
with a device this inexpensive it'll be
interesting to see what happens this is
the last phone I'll be testing before my
2017 most durable smartphone awards are
posted so let's hope it survives out of
the box the phone feels very solid it's
got the white and black stormtrooper
vibe going on and even comes with a pair
of headphones which you guessed it plug
right into the headphone jack at the top
of the phone with many companies making
headphones uh additional paid accessory
it's nice of Nokia to toss a pair in the
back of the phone is removable which
gives us access to the sim and SD card
trays but no access to the huge 4,100
million power battery non removable
batteries have been the theme lately
across all smartphones and these Nokia's
are no different thus crash test is
first with a phone that's cheap I was
almost expecting a plastic screen but
it's actually advertised as Gorilla
Glass 3 it is registering at a level six
on Mohs scale of hardness along with the
rest of the tempered glass smartphone
flagships so far so good the front 5
megapixel camera is under the same front
glass there is no home button or
fingerprint scanner so you'll have to
unlock the phone manually but for the
amount of money you saved buying this
device it's really not a big deal the
earpiece is a super thin white piece of
vinyl that isn't going to be doing much
protection but gets dirt or metal
shavings the whole thing can be pulled
right out from inside the phone which
means a year or two down the road it
could very well be falling out on its
own glue doesn't last forever
the Nokia logo on the back of the phone
is inlaid into the white plastic surface
very similar to how the old Nexus logos
were set in place these are secured at
the moment but they do come out I
imagine that over time the thermal
expansion and contraction of the plastic
against the metal lettering will cause
the lettering to come loose and fall out
definitely not a deal-breaker but a
might bug a few people asthetically a
year from now surprisingly the 8
megapixel rear camera lens is
from glass the nokia 3 one step up from
the Nokia tune used inferior plastic
which can get damaged easily thumbs up
for the cheaper Nokia to having better
materials I've tested an insane amount
of phones on my channel this year after
this Nokia to test is over I'll go back
through all my phones and pick the most
durable smart phone the most repairable
smart phone and the least repairable and
I'll also throw some shade at companies
who made some stupid design choices this
year hopefully this information I
provide helps people when buying phones
I know this snowman carved into the
white plastic definitely approves of
buying durable phones that stand the
test of time the buttons along the side
are made from metal along with the sides
of the phone definitely all metal up
here at the top of the phone we have our
headphone jack and some more metal and
the bottom of the phone instead of a USB
see we have the older-style micro USB
connector for 100 bucks though you can't
be too picky and now for the burn test
this 5 inch IPS LCD lasted about 5
seconds under the heat for my flame I do
the burn test because well I wasn't
allowed to play with matches as a child
and I'm making up for lost time plus
it's fun to watch pixels come back to
life with the IPS displays and don't
pretend like you don't enjoy it as well
now for the ultimate test to see what
kind of built quality we get with $100
of materials starting from the back we
get a decent sized flex from the phone
but the frame and the glass are still
intact a permanent kink has developed in
the frame but with a little bend from
the front side it flexes again the other
direction but the whole thing remains in
one piece which is pretty impressive
even Nike is cheapest phones are
unbreakable I'm a fan and I'm definitely
looking forward to what they come up
with next year
Nokia's reputation is consistent hit
that subscribe button so you don't miss
the most durable smartphone Awards for
this year and thanks a ton for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
