s7 edge and the iPhone 6s plus these are
the most requested phones that I did on
my Twitter poll you don't follow me on
Twitter head over to Zach's jerry-rigged
and you can vote in the next one both of
the phones are stabilized on this little
rig so to hold them equally as I go
around filming stuff let's get going
something interesting to know is that
the galaxy s7 and the Galaxy s7 edge
have the exact same cameras but the
iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s plus do not
the big difference between the 6s and
the 6s plus is that the 6s plus has oh
is image stabilizing so as I shake the
image back and forth is going to
compensate for the image physically as
well as electronically it has dual
layers of stabilization where the iPhone
6s only has electronic or digital
stabilization so we're still filming in
4k right now we'll test a little bit out
with the Sun flare
one thing that I really like about
shooting in 4k is the ability you have
to zoom in on things check out the moon
and 800% so you might be wondering why
these two different windows are
different sizes the iPhone 6s plus
front-facing camera only films in 720p
the galaxy s7 edge camera films in quad
HD which is four times the resolution of
your standard HD that's why the windows
are different sizes the galaxy s7 is
literally that much bigger so all of the
resolutions are proportional but if you
watch this video pay close attention to
the quality on each camera because I
need you to tell me down in the comments
below which camera does better the
galaxy s7 edge or the iPhone 6s plus as
far as I know and neither of these
cameras have stabilization on the
front-facing camera they're not like the
lumia 950xl
or the HTC ten which both have
stabilization on the front-facing
cameras which is pretty nice one thing
I've noticed with the galaxy s7 is that
building behind me is completely washed
out on the front-facing camera but with
the iPhone 6s plus you can still see the
building a little bit better that's
interesting the front-facing camera of
the galaxy s7 has more in the picture
though I'm holding the phone at an arm's
length away and you can see a lot more
behind me with the galaxy s7 and you can
with the iPhone 6s plus that's
interesting you know those YouTube
bloggers that just walk around all day
talking themselves on camera I look like
one of those fruitcakes except for I
have a lot more cameras
so we're still filming in 4k check out
the definition of the grass and then
we'll autofocus on my hand back to the
grass filming in 1080p the stabilization
should be a little bit better because
now both phones have oh is and the EIS
is working at full capacity at 1080p so
check the image stabilization and the
overall quality
I'm gonna run for a second
still filming in 1080p the galaxy s7
technically has a slightly larger sensor
size and usually that coincides with
slightly better image quality we'll have
to see
these our smartphone camera so the
sensor is going to be pretty small
anyway so now we're going to film in
slow motion the iPhone 6s plus and the
galaxy s7 edge bolt film and 240 frames
a second at 720p so the slow motion test
should be pretty equal since both the
frame rates are the same so the sunset
shot will be the perfect segue into our
low-light shots all the settings are
still on automatic and we're still
filming in 4k resolution so it's
completely dark outside both phones are
shooting in 4k on automatic settings
we're testing out the low-light
capabilities of the cell phones so both
phones are still in Auto there's a
streetlamp up there the building in the
background and then we're going to come
down here on my truck you see the front
bumper and my light bar up on top so now
we need your help deciding which phone
wins the galaxy s7 edge or the iPhone 6s
plus which phone was better let me know
down in the comments you can also
respond to this poll question up in the
corner after that and you still want to
see more camera tests I have the galaxy
s7 versus the HTC 10 the iPhone se
versus the Nexus 5x the Nexus 6p verse
the galaxy s7 and the lumia 950xl versus
the galaxy s7 together we can find out
which is the best smartphone camera in
the world thanks ton for watching hit
that subscribe button give me a thumbs
up and I hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
