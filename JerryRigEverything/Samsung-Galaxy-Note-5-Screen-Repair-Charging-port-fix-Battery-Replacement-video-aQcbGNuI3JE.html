apart the Galaxy Note 5 in this video
I'm gonna show you how to take off the
back replace the screen the charging
port everything that's inside you are
going to need a heat gun to heat up the
back of the phone in order to take off
that back piece as well as a giant
suction cup this particular one is just
a windshield mount where you can take
your phone and mount it to your car
windshield I'll link all the parts and
stuff down in the video description
below make sure to take out the S pin as
well as the SIM card slot otherwise
you'll have problems opening the phone
later on and then heat up the back of
the phone you want to heat it up
consistently all over the the top and
the bottom in the middle of the phone so
that it's too hot to touch once it's too
hot to touch then you can take your
suction cup put it around the bottom is
where I started off with and then just
lift it up just barely enough to slip a
metal pry tool underneath use a thin
metal pry tool if you use like a razor
blade or something thicker it'll put too
much pressure on the glass and it'll
break the glass I've had it happen
before once the back is up high enough
you can take a plain card or something
thin and slide it between the glass and
the phone so that it doesn't reappear
back down to the phone again if it gets
hard heat up the phone a little bit more
because the phone cools down fairly
quickly so the more you heat up the
phone the easier it is to take off the
back this is a lot harder than it looks
I've sped this part up a little bit so
it doesn't take up as much time in the
video but it is really difficult to get
the back off of the phone you can take
your playing cards and just kind of
slice through the adhesive all the way
around the backside you can see the
white adhesive peeling off from the
phone and now the screws so there are 20
Phillips head screws all the way around
the back of the phone so you can take
those off I will link all the tools you
need in the video description below as
well and then the back of the phone will
just pop off from the motherboard you
can see that there's a little bit of
adhesive belong to the top there that
you have to remove as well you can see
here that there's these contact points
for the Qi charger those will just rest
up against the motherboard and really
quickly I'm going to show you how to
replace the camera lens there's this
little groove up along the top you can
just take a razor blade or a thin pry
tool and just pop that camera lens off
then the Kember lens itself will come in
two parts usually the metal frame and
the camera lens and you'll just adhesive
those together and then put your new
lens down into place if yours ever gets
broken or anything pretty
straightforward
now for all these little ribbon cables
they're kind of like LEGO pieces they
latch onto the mainboard
you can just unsnap them you can see we
have the earpiece then the screen then
down here we have these two wire
connections as well as the little ribbon
cable for the fingerprint scanner then
make sure they're all out of the way
while you lift up the motherboard and
there's one more ribbon cable connection
right down at the bottom and that's for
the charging port so snap that off and
then that frees up the motherboard now
that we have the motherboard we can look
at the cameras the cameras also have the
same ribbon cable connection also a
waffle connection that you can just
unsnap like a little Lego piece you can
see both the cameras right here to snap
them back into place it's also fairly
easy just take them line them up over
the little slot and press them down so
here's a little vibrator motor it's a
tiny little guy for such a big phone you
can see both the contact points that
just rest up against the motherboard
like a lot of the other components on
this phone so here's the charging port
kind of an interesting way they install
this thing there's the two wire cables
on top of it and one little screw as
well as holding it down but you can't
lift it off at this point because the
menu button in the back button are
wrapped underneath underneath the glass
of the screen so they're between the
plastic and the screen which is really
annoying with the galaxy s6 edge you
would just pop right off and then you
can replace your charging port right
there so in order for us to replace the
charging port we have to remove the mid
frame from the screen so we're going to
take off the battery first same thing
with this I'm just going to heat it up
with my hot-air gun make it so that's
too hot to touch and then slide just
kind of pry up with my pry tool making
sure not to slice underneath because the
battery will rip and you'll have to
replace it if it breaks open then it can
take my playing cards and kind of slice
through the adhesive underneath since
it's not metal the playing cards are a
lot safer now the battery is off kind
interesting you see the date up here at
the top of the battery and so right here
you can see the plastic frame pressed up
against the screen there's no glue along
this little thin side so I'm going to
take my playing card and just slide it
up underneath this spot and then heat up
the bottom because there is glue holding
the glass onto the plastic frame now
I've taken my little pry tool and slid
it between the plastic in the glass kind
of where that button slides down between
the two layers once they're separated I
can take my playing card and slide it
between them to make sure they don't
stick back together again and then treat
this the same way as you did the back of
the phone making sure it's consistently
hot because as soon as it cools down
that adhesive is going to read here and
be really hard to separate so be
consistently heating up the the plastic
frame on the screen and this is really
hard as well make sure you do not bend
this
brain at all or the LCD will crack and
you'll just need to buy a new screen
here is the screen it comes with the LCD
the glass and the digitizer they're all
one piece and so if you break one of
those layers either the glass or the LCD
you'll just have to replace the whole
thing I don't think a glass only repair
is possible with this phone I would be
very impressed if someone can do it now
that the screen is off I can work on the
charging port you can see that the
buttons were just wrapped around that
back plastic so once they pry those off
the charging port comes loose from that
plastic frame and you are good to go I
will link to replacement charging ports
and you know all the other parts down in
the video description just like always
you can see that the home button as well
can be replaced it just slides through
this back hole in the frame very very
similar to the the Galaxy Note 4 up here
with the earpiece just really quick I'll
show you how these come out there's this
little metal latch that pops up then the
earpiece and proximity sensor are all in
one unit so I'm going to unplug those
and then slide them back in their little
slots and pin and back down again so
replace your new charging port it will
come with its own adhesive usually if
you're not putting your same one back
down again just pin those buttons back
around in place and then you can take
your plastic and put it on top of the
screen new screens will also come with
their own adhesive if not you can use
that double-sided tape that I've put in
the video description you can see right
here there is a little groove in that
mid frame that sits right underneath
between the LCD and the glass layer so
make sure that it's lined up and it's
not going to pinch against that when you
press it down and again now we can set
the motherboard back into place making
sure to clip the charging port to the
bottom of the motherboard first and then
you can take the rest these ribbon cable
connections and pin them back down where
they came from pretty straightforward
take a little wire cable connections and
put them down into place as well and the
battery slips in on top of the mid frame
and plug that into the motherboard I
usually do that last so that there's no
electricity coursing through the board
while I'm working on it it's a little
bit safer way to do things then the back
frame goes on and then at this point you
can turn the phone on because that power
button is connected again with the two
little contact points everything looks
like it's working so I put those twenty
screws in place and then if you buy a
new rear back it will come with its own
adhesive but since this is my old one
I'm just going to use the double-sided
tape put that down push the back into
place and everything works there any
questions be sure to ask them in the
comment section below make sure to watch
the bin test video as well
that pretty interesting thanks dumb for
watching hope this video helped you out
