one plus three the new flagship killer
from the company oneplus luckily the
phone is not that hard to take apart
let's get started first thing we're
going to do is remove the dual SIM card
tray from the side and then there are
two screws along the bottom of the phone
similar to an iPhone works except for
these are a t2 screw I will link all of
the tools and replacement parts that you
need down in the video description I
found it was easiest to start on the
side of the phone if you remember during
my durability video the screen popped
out of the frame just a little bit along
that center line so I put my metal pry
tool between the edge of the screen and
the edge of the frame and then pry it up
a little bit and switch to my plastic
tool as soon as possible because metal
on metal doesn't work out so well for
electronics screen lifted out relatively
easily once it was up and here is the
single slab of aluminum that oneplus
talked about you can see the mill lines
on the bottom so they weren't joking
around when they said it was a solid
block of aluminum the alert slider has
the little contact points of the top
that also connect to the vibration motor
I will show you the contact points on
the motherboard here and this is how
those get their signal from the phone
itself there's one screw holding down
the two little clasps over these
extension ribbon cables we'll work on
those in a second after we remove the
battery connection this disconnects the
power from the board so it's safe to
work on
I will unclip the two extension ribbon
cables just like little Legos same thing
with the bottom you can see that that's
really all that this is is just an
extension ribbon cable from the charging
port up to the top motherboard there's
one little piece of tape along the top
of the battery and remove that and then
I can just pry the battery out from the
phone little pull tab on the side
similar to how the iPhone 4 and 4s
batteries were very easy no heat
necessary the biggest disappointment of
this phone is that the battery is not
read the oneplus one and the oneplus two
phones had a bright red battery which
was fun for repair guys like myself to
open up and see something a little bit
different but they went back to being
the original boring black batteries
there are seven screws for the charging
port remove those they are Phillips head
and then we're going to move the wire
cable and then two ribbon cables with
that Lego light connection and then the
charging port will just pop out from the
bottom side of the phone here is the
charging port it comes with the
headphone jack the loudspeaker and the
USB type-c connection
I'll try to find replacement parts for
these and link them down in the video
description here is the tamper evidence
screw on the top motherboard and the
water damage indicator we're going to
move the wire cable first from the side
be careful with that connection then
there's the screen ribbon cable from
this side as well as screws hold it down
these screws are all different sizes
make sure to keep them organized it is
very important to put them back in the
same hole they come from the volume
button and power button has little
contact points just like the vibration
motor does those just rest up against
the motherboard here that's how it
receives its signal so if your phone
gets wet and those buttons stop working
is because there's a little bit of
corrosion or something on the contact
points the front-facing camera can just
pop out is little bit of tape on the
back so peel that up this is an 8
megapixel camera we'll set that off to
the side the rear camera also on clips
from the mainboard has the same Lego
light connection this one here is a 16
megapixel camera and it does have oh is
image stabilizing so the camera itself
compensates for the shaking of your
phone while you're holding it pretty
cool so this is the screen it's got the
glass layer the AMOLED layer and the
plastic frame that gives the phone its
rigidity so when you buy a replacement
screen it'll most likely just come with
the glass and the AMOLED and you'll have
to pry it out from the plastic frame but
this kills the old screen so only do it
if it's absolutely necessary
I'm not going to transfer mine over
because it does sacrifice the screen and
I want to keep on using my one plus the
square around the battery is what I
imagine helps give this phone its
strength the battery presses up against
the sides of the plastic to give it
rigidity very cool design let's
reassemble this phone we'll put back
that eight megapixel front camera and
clip it into the board put the tape down
along the back again you can just
transfer the tape from your old camera
to your new camera if you're replacing
it the 16 megapixel rear camera gets
pressed down into place and then the
whole motherboard can just pre press
down into the frame of the screen
we got the ribbon cable for the screen
and the wire cable then we have the
eight screws that go in around the
outside make sure they go into the exact
same hole they came out of get the
charging port set down into place wire
cable and then the two ribbon cables
Bend those around the extension cable
and then clip those in there are seven
screws that hold this in place remember
there are different sizes as well so
keep them organized and then put the
boring black colored battery back into
the
I really hope to see a red battery for
the 1+4 now the two pieces tape along
the top aren't super important but since
they were there in the first place I'll
put them back on anyway and then I'll
clip on the extension ribbon cables that
connect the charging port to the top
motherboard as well as the little metal
bracket pinch one side in first and the
screw goes on the other side to hold it
down and the last thing you want to do
is just stick in the battery connector
that make sure there's no power going
through the phone while you're working
on it before I put the screen into the
back metal panel I'm going to turn it on
and make sure it's working looks like
everything is fine you should turn your
phone off before inserting it into the
back panel but I'm going to do it anyway
put the top in first and then pinch down
the sides and the bottom remember that
you are working with a piece of glass
here so don't put too much pressure on
it or you'll crack your screen I'm going
to put the bottom two t two screws into
place that was the tongue twister and
everything is good if you have any
questions leave them down in the
comments below thank you so much for
watching I did do it behind the scenes
snap story on this teardown if you want
to check out my snapchat I do a lot of
behind the scenes stuff on Twitter as
well as Instagram thank you so much for
watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
