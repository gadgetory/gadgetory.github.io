subscribers YouTube sends them a silver
play button as an award congratulations
and stories but recently you too started
sending out a different style of play
button is it made out of the same
material is it made out of a cheaper
material let's find out so there's a
couple differences that we can see right
off the bat this one is the one I got
about a year and a half ago right here
for jerry-rigged everything it's a
little bit smaller than this recent one
this one's for the what's inside family
and then why does yours have a hole cut
out of the center of it we already come
in and asked for our main channel and I
thought how cool would be to take the
play out of the YouTube play button so
they don't come like this with the
triangle out of the middle but we could
play out of it and I'm glad you did that
because that's the actual sample that
we're going to use inside of this
electron microscope so if you look at
this microscope the inside chamber right
here that we put the samples into isn't
super huge so it's nice when you have a
really small sample you get a better
analysis we've already done an elemental
analysis of the original silver play
button we realize that there is no
silver inside of it it's mostly nickel I
think it's like 94% nickel but now that
we have this play button
it looks like the interior is made out
of something different something besides
nickel and that's what we're here to
find out another difference is that this
award part right here is written on the
glass itself and for the western side
family channels nothing's written on the
glass it's all printed on the paper
inside which is probably more
cost-effective so what do you think Dan
do you think that they changed the size
the frame and the material to be more
cost-effective how connected there's a
lot more youtubers rating Emilia's ten
of
getting in under thousands and this is
our second channel that we share with
and so I'm serious 50 because we brought
our whole play button and our silver
play button up here and we were able to
see what this that machine you told us
what it was made of but he was this
newer cleaner I think it's going to be
different sugar the back of that look at
that
different where's the other one do you
have to go yeah maybe USA at least Haley
can we put the head on there literally
it's a lot more lightweight than bottle
alright let's check them out side by
side look at the difference or about the
backside mine looks a little bit cleaner
and more polished yours is like
industrial the you can see the like the
injection points from the mold that they
used to inject it the chunk of the
silver play button we have in this Cup
it's sitting in acetone so if it was
plastic you already would have been
dissolved but luckily it looks like it's
still in one piece so we know for sure
it's not practic we gotta find out what
it's really made of alright so this is
the electron microscope inside the
electron microscope is where we're going
to stick this sample the inside of the
silver play button just going to rest it
right there on top of that little
platform and here inside of the machine
this is a view that not very many people
get to see is this little platform right
here and there's a series of little
motors and pulleys and this moves the
platform inside so it can sit underneath
this little nozzle and that's where we
get our images from so this whole
machine right here cost about seven
hundred thousand dollars the parts that
were most interested though is this part
right back here this is the energy
expressive x-ray spectrometer and it
spits out x-rays into here to figure out
what the elemental makeup is of whatever
sample we have inside the electron
microscope is able to differentiate
different elements on an elemental level
simply by putting the sample inside of
this machine and that will tell us
exactly what the silver play button is
made of so if you listen very closely
there's a high-pitched sound and right
now it's pulling all of the oxygen all
of the air out from inside of this
machine because as you know oxygen and
all of the other molecules inside of the
air have their own elemental makeup and
so we have to have zero air inside of
the machine to get an accurate reading
on the play button itself
there are several cameras inside it's
electron microscope remember seeing
those motors and pulleys it's moving the
platform underneath the electron beam we
can also raise the sample up and lower
it with that same platform so this is a
live camera inside of the machine so the
simple thing regicide machine if you
remember when we put it down inside that
little platform the shiny side was
facing up as to what that shiny side
this is the elemental remember getting
from it right here it says that at 92
percent nickel and there's a little bit
of ink and a little bit of carbon the
carbon is kind of like the impurity
stuff you're going to have that with any
sample so we can pretty much safely
assume that will be at 92 percent nickel
and 2 percent zinc for that surface area
so now we're going to depressurize this
machine we're going to let air back into
it take the sample out flip it up on its
side and go for a second reading of the
internal of the play button
so now we're still doing the
cross-section and so here we can see the
internal section of the play button and
then this band right here this layer
that's the shiny part the exterior
here's another little shot of that and
so we know that this part does have the
nickel in it but now we want to see what
the actual center of the button is made
up of I think it's a super interesting
because the other play button is all
pure nickel the same page to be excited
it was this one the scientists that
we're working with here who does not
want to be on camera which is mine she
did she poison has the inside jump so
even she used like this in the term of
junk is basically denoting that it might
be a little active and material is not
as pure as what's on the other one so
here's the cross-section that we're
looking at here and then once we get
into this image you can see this is the
cross-section this is what the
microscope is actually looking at and
this is the elemental makeup of each of
the elements in that cross-section so
zinc is right here which is the majority
of the cross-section but as we get close
to the edge here we see that's where the
nickel is that and this color is
representing the nickel we have a little
bit of copper and I'm guessing that
copper is used to join the nickel to the
zinc there's also a little bit of
aluminum but we can see here that's only
four percent so that's pretty much a
non-issue here the majority of it is
going to be the zinc in the carbon and
we have the zinc and the carbon so the
carbon is mixed pretty well on side of
that which i think is pretty interesting
because when you take carbon and you add
it at iron you get steel and that carbon
is used to strengthen the iron to make
the harder material which you get it
steels
so I'm guessing what they've done here
with this button that added the carbon
to the zinc to make it stronger and the
play button will last longer that way
but carbon is also extremely cheap and
so is ink so let's see how much each of
these play buttons weigh the silver one
from before and the newer silver one and
then we can kind of get an idea of how
much each of them cost actually makes
all right let's go away these things
well before we weigh things back make
sure you put this on yeah
here is my silver play button this is
the original one we're going to go ahead
and drop it onto the scale and it looks
like we're at one third of a pound two
point three pounds and add on the
western side family channel we're at
0.38 plus right on 0.41 so it's a little
bit heavier so to recap this is my play
button this is the western side family
play button mine is made out of nickel
which is about $5 per pound if you're
just doing like the raw weight of the
middle this one is made out of zinc and
carbon which ends up being about 25
cents per pound just the raw metal
weight to put that into perspective last
year alone there are twenty four
thousand people that hit a hundred
thousand subscribers so and not
everybody redeems their awards but if
they did YouTube would be saving around
thirty two thousand dollars a year at
that same rate just by making this
button over that button so while mine is
bigger it's not as expensive as this one
a dollar sixty I think is what we map
that out to in about twenty five cents
not very expensive considering how much
this means to every youtuber that
actually hits the award but by making
this button less expensive they're
saving around thirty two thousand
dollars a year according to our
estimates and remember those numbers are
just for the metal weight itself we're
not talking about like the manufacturing
cost because like this button where it's
finished on both the front and the back
like a shiny night like finish this
button is not finished it all on the
back it has that raw industrial feel to
it which actually saves a lot of money
if we look really closely on the back
you can see the actual injection points
for the mold so they didn't bother to
finish that at all which makes sense
because no one's ever going to see the
back of the play button besides is the
first weirder for the only thing
channels are going to open these things
up one thing I really like according to
social blade there were 25 channels a
day in 2015
that would hit our Nadal subscribers in
2016 that was 44 channels a day so
almost doubling that number and so every
single year you're seeing more and more
people that are becoming subscribers on
YouTube that are gaining subscribers
even though YouTube can now make
probably about five or six play buttons
for the cost of one of these it's still
the most important part is that they
actually are giving away an award for
hitting a milestone I think they are the
only social media platform that actually
rewards their creators when they hit
these milestones and I am so grateful
for like we cook our gold play button
around the world like we really are
grateful for the award it's it's
prominently in our office really proud
of the achievement and really thankful
for all of our subscribers that actually
choose to subscribe like a hundred
thousand or a million those are a lot of
people that have subscribed I'm
certainly grateful for it like it's more
than the metal that's inside of it it
really is the subscribers like you guys
for subscribing to our channel it means
so much
I'm never going to melt it down because
I love my award as well I know a lot of
you guys that have watched what's inside
even one time are looking at this going
dan how did you cut that so perfectly it
wasn't me I promise but it was really
interesting later we cut it then is not
an expert with tools but if you want to
watch the video where he cuts this open
I will link that at the end of this one
and I do appreciate you guys a ton if
you haven't subscribed to my channel yet
go ahead hit that subscribe button below
I will link dance channels the end of
this one as well thanks for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
