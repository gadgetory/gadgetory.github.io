smartphone ever to remove itself from my
shelf of shame the shelf of shame is a
spot for smartphones that have failed my
durability test blackberry stepped up
super quick after the issue is brought
to light and fix their fatal design flaw
in the key one which is extremely
impressive of them but even with the
problem fixed this whole situation has
left me with two extremely broken phones
today's the day we bring them back to
life and if I'm successful in fixing
both I'll give one away let's see what
happens
I'm pretty sure that the only thing not
working on these phones is the screen
itself the rest the phones are pretty
solid we'll start with the phone I
tested first the one that had no
adhesive under the screen the back panel
can unclasp it'll never fall off on its
own but it's only held in place by
plastic tabs and a small bit of adhesive
towards the bottom much easier access in
any of the Samsung phones that are all
glued shut up at the top of the battery
the connector is screwed in with two
Phillips head screws I'll set these off
to the side and unclasp the battery
connector with a plastic pry tool the
goal here is a screen replacement so
I'll jump down to where the display a
ribbon cable connects the displayed
ribbon is under a bracket with two more
Phillips head screws I'll twist that off
to the side after the screws are out and
unsnap the screen ribbon just like a
little Lego the ribbon was previously
ripped in half during my durability test
leaving the old screen pretty useless I
did find two replacement screens though
pulling off the red protector reveals
that the replacement screens do not come
with adhesive pre-installed which is
fine there are several ways to attach
the screen I'm going to use my normal
double-sided tape method but it is
possible to buy the permanent glue type
stuff that Blackberry used for their
display the second time around
once my double-sided tape is in place
I'll tuck the little ribbon cable
through the slot in the frame and set
the screen down inside the phone then I
can plug the screen into the motherboard
from the back it's an incredibly simple
design screens are usually the first
thing to crack or break on a cell phone
so it's nice that Blackberry made the
repair so simple I'll screw the bracket
on over the screen connector to keep it
from popping off if you ever drop the
phone and I'll plug the battery back in
my phone was dead after sitting around
so long but plugging it in and turning
it on revealed that our screen
replacement was successful and the phone
is still 100% functional even after all
of its abuse since the screen repair was
so shockingly easy let's jump back in
and see how hardest to swap out the
battery on the BlackBerry key won
tournament looking the battery and then
jump down to the bottom of the phone
where there are seven Phillips head
screws guarding the charging port
removing these allow the back plastic to
pop off exposing a non removable
charging port this is unfortunate since
charging port replacements are rather
common in the cell phone repair world
not as much as a broken screen or
battery of course but it is nice when
they can be replaced now normally most
smartphones have an easy way to remove
the battery whether they have the
magical pull tabs like the iPhone or
adhesive that is softened by heat Alexa
Samsung's some batteries are relatively
easy to pull out even if they are
technically not replaceable and this is
not the case on the blackberry key1 the
battery adhesive is pretty permanent he
not soften the adhesive puncturing the
battery would be catastrophic but it is
hard to avoid when the adhesive doesn't
let go in the end it was brute force
that got out the battery batteries are
definitely not supposed to be bent like
this and I probably should not reuse
this particular battery anymore the
large chunk of adhesive under the
battery would have been the perfect size
for the back of the screen it's almost
like they should have switched those
around this battery replacement is a
nightmare and rather dangerous and now
for the second screen this is the lesser
abused of the two BlackBerry key ones I
have and this is also the one that I'll
be giving away if the screen replacement
is successful the process is identical
to the first phone pulling off the back
cover pun plugging the battery and
getting those two screws off the bracket
better holding down the screen add a
little bit of my own adhesive to the
back metal panel and I'll tuck the
screen ribbon through the metal back and
set the whole thing down in place again
this is seriously one of the easiest
phones out there to do a screen
replacement on testing out the screen
after all the screws are back in and the
batteries reconnected it is again a
success which means that one of you guys
now get to keep this phone I'll pick one
random retweet er of this tweet over on
my Twitter I'll also link this tweet in
a video description and that one random
person will get a blackberry key one of
their own I'll list all the details and
stuff down in the video description of
this video I'm sure to read through
those huge thumbs up to blackberry for
building such a solid phone this second
time around I'm definitely a fan come
hang out with me on Twitter thanks ton
for watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
