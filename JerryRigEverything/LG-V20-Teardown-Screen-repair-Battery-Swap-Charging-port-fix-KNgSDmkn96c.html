probably one of the easiest phones I've
repaired all year all you need is a
broken phone and a simple screwdriver
let's get started make sure the phone is
turned off before you get started with
this repair and then you can press the
back panel eject button on the side of
the phone to expose the battery remove
the battery and set it next to that back
panel then you are ready to remove the
21 screws that surround the edge of the
device it's always good practice to keep
these screws organized I always set them
on a separate piece of paper in the same
general shape and location that they
were removed from the phone put the
screws back in the same hole that came
from I will link all the tools and
replacement parts for the LGV 20 down in
the video description of this video
after the screws are removed with the
top and bottom sections of the phone
will pop off these are made of pure
plastic and are held very firmly in
place by a few clasps so you do have to
get semi-aggressive with them after
those remove the rear back plastic can
come off this exposes the loudspeaker
the fingerprint scanner the rear sensors
and the flash this is where we would
replace the camera lens as well which is
something I need to do someday soon so
watch out for that video looking at the
motherboard I'll unclip the little Lego
like screen ribbon cable at the bottom
and then adjust the front-facing camera
so I can lift out the motherboard
without that catching then I can pull
the board from the frame of the screen
this is what your replacement screen
will look like you will have to move
over the little tiny components like the
little circular vibration motor the
earpiece and the buttons along the side
and the most important component the
headphone jack having a phone without a
headphone jack would be like having a
president who doesn't believe in climate
change completely illogical I will link
the replacement screens in the video
description you can check the price
there they are already surprisingly
cheap compared to other recently
released phones I'm going to check out
the motherboard before putting the phone
back together again you can see the OIS
stabilization on the regular rear camera
lens the wide-angle lens does not have
the optical stabilization each of the
cameras can snap off like a little Lego
piece but unfortunately the charging
board is permanently soldered so if your
charging port breaks you are out of luck
unless you have a micro soldering
station and some major skills I'll clip
the cameras back into place make sure
you get them back into their correct
slots and orientations the motherboard
will sit
quickly on the frame of your new screen
and you can clip the screen ribbon cable
back into place there at the bottom then
I'll set the back plastic piece down on
top of the mainboard with each of the
two little end caps and all 21 screws
there are an incredible amount of screws
but at least the phone has a solid build
quality so yeah if you break your screen
it's going to cost you some monies but
at least it's possible to swap with just
a simple screwdriver you won't need to
go robbing hairdryers from little old
ladies to open this phone up like you
would a samsung those are much more
difficult to repair hit that thumbs up
button if you like easily repaired cell
phones and hit the subscribe button if I
helped you out at all today
or if you just found this video
interesting it does help me out and
follow me on Twitter and Instagram for
behind the scenes stuff and up-to-date
information on new releases and recalls
those seem to be happening way more than
they should in 2016
thanks dumb for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
