throttle position sensor on a Jeep Grand
Cherokee this is the throttle position
sensor is right back here by the intake
this little mechanism right there to get
it off there's two screws one on here
one on the other side and that actual
bit that you need to take it off looks
like this it's not one of those regular
you notice it's knowing your regular
little heads now might have this one
marked down as a t20 that is that's how
you do it so I'm gonna go take it off
and then I'll show you put the other one
on
okay so we got their sensor office is
the new one now when you put it on you
want to make sure that you don't adjust
the like you don't move the air intake
part of it you want to just slip it on
just enough so that it it doesn't
actually adjust anything so you want it
to like you know the little thing that's
inside of this that lets the air in and
out you don't want to move that when you
put this on so should go on really
easily and just just barely a like it's
it's just like that or you can focus a
little bit of play in it but it's going
to sit there not adjust anything until
you actually turn the car on so once you
do that you just put the screws back in
clip it in and you're good to go
let's how to install a throttle position
sensor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
