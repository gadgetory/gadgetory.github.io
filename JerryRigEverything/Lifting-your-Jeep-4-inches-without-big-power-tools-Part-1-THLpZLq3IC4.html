case basically have these two brackets
right here that you can drop some some
transfer case drop kits have little kind
of like cylinder things that just go
inside where the bolts go inside this
kit came with whole bars they go right
here so this is the support for the
transfer case is the frame of the car
and the spacer goes right in between
these two so you got a three bolts on it
and these two bolts are closer to the
front and they're closer together so the
spacer goes on the holes are aligned in
such a way that bolts just go right
through it so all right now I have a
jack supporting the center of the
transfer case I'm going to loosen all
six bolts this chief is missing one and
then I'm going to do one side at a time
so I have to worry about the whole
transfer case coming down so I loosen
all six drop this side put in the spacer
tighten it drop that side from the
spacer then tighten it it's going to
very slowly drop that that's what as far
as we need so be super careful when I do
that cuz you don't want the transfer
case to get damaged at all those things
are pretty expensive
okay so the bolts I took out or a 19
millimeter see the difference between
the old bolts the new ones there so when
I take the bracket right here the spacer
I'm on the top there's large holes on
the bottom there are some smaller ones
the reason this is is because usually
when you drop the transfer case mount
this will shift forward a little bit and
so if you have the wider holes in the
top when you stick the bolts in the
bigger space allows you to find the hole
there easier so the whole kind of
encompasses that whole map right there
so bonny I do now is just tuck this
bracket and it is my to know okay so
this four move over to the other side
I'm going to leave this side with the
spacer just unscrewed a little bit so I
have a little bit of play as I drop the
other side down I'm also this kit came
with little end caps so I can just tack
those in there you can do that my hand
pretty simple so if you are having the
probe the bolts not lining up you see
how this is kind of crooked in there
I've taken a tie down and strapped it to
the end of the plate there and then to
the frame here and I can take that tie
down and ratchet it down and get this
bolt to line up straight again
that so now I'll be able to screw that
in right
all rights just full time you notice to
make sure you're safe is possible and
you're doing this scene I got the back
go against the curb I have the jack
there I have a stand there I have a jack
there and I would stand on the other
side of that so I have four points of
contact while the wheel is up off the
ground and then the other three wheels
are touching the ground so there's not a
whole lot of a chance of this fallen
over because if it does fall while the
wheel is off you're going to damage you
know everything inside of there the Kalp
or the axle and you might die so let's
try to avoid that all right so today
we're going to push shocks on a 91 jeep
wranglers is this will work for any the
Y J's so we have the will already taken
off the car jacked up you can see the
shocks are right there you got the bolts
on the top bolts on the bottom these
ones are just rusted out so we're gonna
we're going to switch them so as I'm
trying to take off the top bolt
it's a 14 millimeter and as I spin it
you can see at the top of the shock is
spinning as well so what I do is I just
grab Berenices alright so we're just
gonna throw away these shocks anyway I'm
just going to grab on to the bar like
that with a pair of channel locks and
then keep on twisting that wrench I'm
cool thing I like about this wrench is
one of my favorite tools is that it's
got a little ratchet head in there so I
get out to keep on adjusting it just
always spins on its own I'll put a link
down the bottom of the video so you guys
can see yeah how much they cost that's I
got them off Amazon
they're pretty solid little tools anyway
so I'm just gonna get rid of that bolt
okay so we got it off in the bottom and
then make sure you just keep the
hardware as well for the bottom it's
usually shocks don't come with them
okay so we're moving the way bar links
and that's this guy right here that goes
down right below the leaf springs
there's a 19 millimeter on the top and
the bottom the top on the bolt back here
how you took it off but it's a has a
cotter pin through it so you gotta take
that cotter pin out and it just has a
little no not on like that the cotter
pin just goes through there so now once
you get the bolts off you just have to
separate these two I'll probably have to
use a dimming arm puller to kind of like
push it off is probably just pretty
stuck on there we'll take a hammer - and
see what happens all right so thankfully
we got it off with this little cat's paw
type thing just put it right in between
a little ledges hit with the hammer a
few times pop it right off so there you
go just keep in mind a few different
types of sleeves they come in two bags
there's the the crush sleeve is the
thicker one and the smaller sleeves go
on top of the sway bar links when I say
top it's either into both the same size
so I'll show you how to get this inside
basically I take my channel locks right
here I can grab the both the sides and I
can just squeeze in and pull it all the
way inside of itself that's needed way
to do what you do with a hammer you
plenty of ways to get inside of there
but it is pretty tight but you can't
really do it by hand okay so here's a
shot of the sway bar links just attach
it right up here at the top and then
bottom the bottom ones are the same
hardware that came that was on the old
links and then the top one you put the
new bolt and washers through that
okay so this is the track bar right here
underneath the Jeep this bolt down here
the then this mounted to the frame is an
18 millimeter we don't need to worry
about that part of there once you break
it loose there's a behind this 19 this
finest 18 millimeter there's a 21
millimeter nut that is the back of this
bolt well inside absolutely I'm just
going to prop that in place and then
just keep on ton tightening it and let
the frame of the G pull that in place as
far as the track bar goes this is the
bar itself this is the bracket that
comes with it so we're going to do is
hook the bracket this little hole right
there where my pinky is is going to
thread through the original hole and
then that is where we have to drill a
new hole through the frame right there
at the bottom so you can kind of see it
this whole piece pops up in there like
that and then this top hole is where the
track bar is going to go then we have to
drill that hole down there at the bottom
so I'll do that right now yes right now
we're gonna need the G this is right
next to the steering stabilizer is the
bottom the flange thing of the track bar
mount so it's barely wide enough there
to get a drill through and kind of see
so yeah barely wide enough I just get
right up in there and so there you can
see the back bar mount and how that's
all connected so I have the bolt down
here at the bottom the other bolt
screwed in there right an extra locking
washer that through on there just to be
extra sure it was going to stay and this
is just that's just something I can get
rid of and then we have the track bar
it's attached the top there
you
okay so Lauren the break runs lines is
pretty rough on that bolt right there is
the one you got to get off I missed the
brake line goes all the way to CalPERS
the easiest access is from here inside
the engine compartment I'm right
underneath the air filter you can kind
of see that a little screw right there
over here on the passenger side I've
already gotten this one off right there
you can see the screw I miss one of
these bolts or these uh these things at
the t 40 that fits in that slot I only
have a half inch socket it'll be a lot
easier if you have a smaller socket set
to get down in there and the nice thing
is this is a little bit flex which you
can kind of bend it down and get up in
there but now it's giving me some issues
I've gotten a little bit but gotta keep
going on it anyway so let's how you get
those brake brackets off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
