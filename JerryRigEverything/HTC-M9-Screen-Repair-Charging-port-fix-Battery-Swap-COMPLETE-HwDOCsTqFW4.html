the HTC m9 this is a very difficult
phone to work on so attempt it at your
own risk and go ahead and turn the phone
off unplug it remove my braided cable to
get inside of the phone you have to
remove this black plastic piece up at
the top just kind of slide a little tool
underneath and lift up one of the clasps
then there's some adhesive and then
another clasp along the other side pop
that out and put it somewhere safe it's
really important to stay totally
organized during this repair make sure
to keep all your screws in one spot what
you'll remember where they go I will
link tools and parts in the video
description below so check that out
remove the SD card slot and the SIM card
slot on the other side of the phone with
your sim card removal tool and then you
can take a plastic pry tool up at the
top of the phone and lift it out just a
little bit this was extremely difficult
to separate the screen from the back
metal housing of the phone I ended up
taking my pry tool leaving it in the top
and then sliding a metal tool between
the frame and the back plate and that's
kind of releasing the clasps that hold
the front of the phone into the back of
the phone and stuck in there pretty
tight so you have to be a little bit
aggressive with it once one side was
open the other side came out a lot
easier I was able to use my plastic tool
for that and then the back separated
from the front of the phone pretty
straightforward no adhesive or anything
else inside of there
here is the back metal plate you can see
little grooves along this backside
what's interesting is is a brand new
phone and there is a screw up in the
right-hand corner that's just completely
missing so I'm not sure if that missed
HTC's quality control or what
anyway unplug the battery I always do
that first just so there's no
electricity coursing through the phone
while I'm working on it don't want to
fry anything lift off those two little
wire cables and then each one of the
ribbon cables has a piece of tape on it
so lift that off
lift up the clasp and then you'll be
able to slide that ribbon cable out of
the connector lucky for you there's like
500 other ribbon cable connectors in
this phone so you get lots of practice
lift up each of little latches and slide
out each of the little ribbon cables
it's all kinds of fun this whole video
is pretty much watching me disconnect
things there's so many different
connections inside of this phone some
more wire connectors some more ribbon
connectors some metal tape along some
more ribbon cable connector
make sure to keep this tape in a special
spots you're going to be putting it back
on the phone when you're done it's kind
of a little shield lift up another
little clasp this is the ribbon cable
connector for the LCD screen there's
three screws holding on the motherboard
I'm going to move this black cable and
then another ribbon cable connector down
at the bottom this one's for the bottom
speaker it's a cute little guy just pull
that out of its little hole
and then the vibrator motor is
interesting that every single thing has
a connector on here except for the
vibrator motor four screws at the bottom
vibrator motor is just soldered onto the
main board which is silly
now the motherboard comes out and it is
connected to the bottom speaker just by
some adhesive so I just pop that out
bottom speaker is here I'll try to link
replacement parts in the view
description below
here's the wonderful vibrator motor
that's soldered onto the main board for
some reason and here's the charging port
charging ports are one of the first
things that go out in phone so I'll link
that down in the description below when
that becomes available has a little
metal bracket on top I'm guessing to
provide support there's four screws
along the top part of the motherboard
here's another connection here HTC light
connections so much they put connections
on their connections now that that's off
we can go ahead and lift up this other
ribbon cable connector on this other
side above the SIM card tray and then
there's a little clasp that holds the
camera in so make sure to undo that
class before you try to lift out the
daughter board the daughter board does
have two little latches up on the top
the app disconnect as well before the it
lifts out from the phone
beware of the front-facing camera as
well it tries to stay down in that
little hole cameras disconnect they're
like little Lego pieces from the main
board just unsnap those connections
here's a 20 megapixel camera the
front-facing camera has some metallic
tape copper tape is kind of like a
shield or a grounding tape so lift that
off try not to take off the cameras if
at all possible they seem to be a little
bit finicky when reinstalling them
also here is the water damage indicator
sticker looks like it was added as an
afterthought to the phone the overall
design of the phone isn't geared towards
self repair if you haven't noticed yet
here I am reinstalling my cameras again
and trying to stick down that metal tape
as well as possible whether it's a
grounding strap or not it is necessary
for the cameras functionality here is
the SIM card tray it also is attached to
the power and volume buttons so pull
that off gently if you're planning on
reusing it
and here is the SD card tray it's got
the connectors on connectors here then
the earpiece pops out of its little slot
your pieces are always magnetized so
here's a little tip if you take your
screwdriver and rub it on top of the
earpiece it magnetizes it so you don't
lose your screws so the battery is
pretty fun
there is a adhesive strip on either side
of the battery
I didn't heat mine up at all but you
know that's always an option I just
found it was easier to take a plain card
or a thin piece of cardstock
and slide it between and just cut
through the adhesive but my pry tool in
there to help leverage it up a little
bit once one side was cut out I could
use my pry tool and just kind of lift
off the other side pretty
straightforward batteries not too
difficult to remove just don't pry too
hard against the screen if you're
planning on keeping the screen so any
amount of leverage might break that the
battery selves at twenty eight forty
milliamp hour I will link those in the
video description as well when they
become available take off whatever black
piece that was if you're planning on
keeping the screen you want to be
incredibly careful with it
right now I'm heating up the phone to
soften the adhesive that's holding the
LCD and digitizer on to the mid frame
once the phone gets too hot to touch I
know the glue is ready to be separated
there is a little slot right here in the
mid frame that you can press up and
it'll lift the backlight and LCD away
from the mid frame far enough that you
can take a playing card or a thin piece
of cardstock and slide it between make
sure that you get between the backlight
and the mid frame on that far back layer
because there's many layers to a screen
like the glass digitizer LCD and
backlight and you want to be between the
backlight in the mid frame if you try to
separate any of the other layers you're
probably going to break your screen now
if your screens already broken obviously
you don't need to be as careful as I am
but I'm going to try to put this phone
back together in working order when I'm
finished with it so I'm not prying up on
the screen at all I'm just slicing
through that adhesive once I've made
sure I'm between the backlight and the
mid frame on that farthest layer and
every now and then I'll stop and reheat
up the phone to make sure that the
adhesive is soft enough for my card and
I'm not applying too much pressure to
the LCD and digitizer it is extremely
fragile and it can break
very very easily so be very very careful
when you're removing the screen also be
careful the ribbon cables on that other
side I'm making sure not to pry on that
side just so I don't damage the ribbon
cables then they'll slide out of the
little hole in the mid frame and you
should be good to go that's how you
remove the screen from the mid frame on
the HTC m9 I will link replacement parts
in the video description so check that
out your new screen might come with
adhesive if not you're going to need to
take some double-sided tape and put it
in place of the black adhesive that was
there before I'm going to head and slide
the ribbon cable through the mid frame
again as I'm installing my new screen
back onto the phone and then set it
right down inside of the mid frame not
too difficult for a screen repair
considering how many connections that
are in this phone putting whatever black
piece that is back on the ribbon cable
connectors again setting the SIM card
slot back in place with the power button
and volume buttons on that side SD cards
going back in place as well
earpiece press back into its hole
daughterboard also getting pressed down
in I want to make sure that camera slips
down inside of the little slot and gets
latch down here's the two little pins on
top of the motherboard make sure those
are pinched down camera gets pushed down
in place as well with that little clasp
and now we have a bunch of ribbon cables
to put back together this one above the
SIM card tray there's four screws on the
top that you want to get screwed in
slide the battery back into place you
can put a strip of adhesive down
underneath if you want but I think that
you know the frame of the phone is
pretty secure anyway get the three
screws that are holding the charging
port back into place set the speaker
back down there in the bottom corner now
we have a connector within a connector
make sure that's pressed down on to the
daughter board first and make sure
nothing is underneath the motherboard
when you're putting it down on top of
the battery there's lots of little
connections and ribbon so make sure you
pull those all up get that vibrator
motor pressed down into place now we got
three screws on the motherboard get this
black wire cable press down as well you
want to be careful with these little
connections so you don't bend them make
sure you don't use any metal tools on
these ribbon cable connectors either
because if you cut down through the
plastic onto the metal will short out
some of
connections so be careful with that get
that tape that you put off to the side
and put it back down on top of the
connectors it's a little shield and make
sure you get all the little yellow tapes
back into place over the little
connections as well that'll just help
the ribbon cables stay in place if you
ever drop your phone or just over the
life of the device your phone will last
a lot longer if everything is taped back
up again latch it down into place get
some more of these wire cables hooked up
press them down there's some more wire
cables down here next to the battery
notice I haven't plugged in the battery
yet because I want it to be the last
thing that I plug in after all the
connections have been made again and
tape back into place now that everything
is taped down and connected I'm going to
go ahead and put the battery in and then
get those last two silver screws screw
it into the battery connector you can
test the phone while the back is still
loft just make sure not to touch any of
the circuit boards that are inside and
then you just clasp the front of the
phone back into the back of the phone
it's kind of like a little clamshell
just snap it back into place it does
require a bit of force but as long as
your ribbon cable connectors lined up
where they should be you should be all
right press it down hard and you should
be good get those top two screws back
into place and then you have your little
plastic bit put one corner in first and
then the other side and you can kind of
press it back down into place the phone
went back pretty smoothly it would be
hard to tell that it was open before
just make sure you avoid around the
edges of the SIM card slots because
that's pretty fragile plug it back in
the charging port works fine if you have
any questions make sure to leave in the
