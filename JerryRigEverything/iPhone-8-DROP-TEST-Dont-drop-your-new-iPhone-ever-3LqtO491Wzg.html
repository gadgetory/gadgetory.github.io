test two drop tests I have two more
brand new iPhone eights which apple
claims to have the most durable
smartphone glass ever but it's important
to remember that even though it might be
durable glass it's still glass and the
unfortunate part about the iPhone glass
is that it's incredibly expensive to
replace even if you have Apple care the
back glass replacement is $99 and after
your to your Apple care is up or you
don't get Apple care at all it's three
hundred and forty nine dollars that's
expensive for a back glass panel with
Samsung phones you can usually replace
that panel for about 20 bucks so there's
a big difference today's drop test is
gonna be sponsored by the Rhino shield
mod case I'll be dropping one of the
phones the silver one completely naked
and the other one the black phone is
going to have the Rhino shield mod case
installed on it this says it's a super
tough modular case that changes
according to your needs so we'll put
that tough part to the test let's get
started
so both of these phones are brand-new
and 100% functional and the case that
the black one is going to be wearing is
from Rhino shield on the box that says
its impact resistant to 11 feet but I've
actually dropped a rhino shield case
from over a hundred feet and have the
phone survived so I'm pretty sure this
phone's gonna be alright inside the box
we have the bumper shield and as part of
the mod part of the casing we have a
back so you can have the case operate in
one of two ways one is just the bumper
shield or half the back installed as
well since both the front and back of
the phone are made from glass I am going
to install the back cover just so I can
avoid paying that 350 dollar replacement
fee if I wanted to install just the
bumper though I would just slip it into
the case like so it would have a raised
rubber lip around the front and the back
to protect it from impacts even keeping
the camera lens below that surface the
case fits pretty snug all the way around
the phone but does leave us enough room
for the ports around the speaker the
microphone and that charging port I'm
sure if there was a headphone jack there
would be room for that as well and the
buttons still have a clicky feel to them
getting the back glass protecting panel
into the phone is easy enough just
pulled out that rubber insert and drop
the phone into the case not too bad if
you're not a fan of the clear back they
do have some designer versions but I'm
gonna leave mine clear because we are
dropping this phone and I want to see if
the back panel is protected by the case
the last cool thing is that this case
actually comes with linz mounts so you
can increase the power of your camera
with additional lenses I'll be testing
these out in a second but first let's
drop these things just like last time I
will have two phones recording in slow
motion right now we have the Google
pixel recording on this side and then we
have the clear Galaxy Note 8 recording
on this side the Rhino shield mod case
does come in different colors I will
have all of these linked down the video
description if you want to check them
out the nice thing about all the
different colors of the Rhino shield mod
case is that they don't absorb stains
like from your pocket or blue jeans
which is a little bit more than the
pixel can say so I think one of the most
common times that I've dropped my
personal cell phone is when I leave it
on my lap and get out of my car
I'll leave that there for a second and
try it with the Rhino shield mod case
no damage done to the back of the
unprotected phone back or front both
seems to be working just fine and no
damage appears to have happened to the
Rhino shield either we'll try it one
more time for good measure getting out
of the car with the unprotected case
and getting out of the car with the
protected case
it looks like we have one giant crack
all the way through the back of the
phone starting up here by the antenna
line camera lens is still fine but now
we owe a police this taking off the case
of the Rhino shield just to double-check
and everything is fine in front of the
phone is also undamaged let's keep going
and just for the record that is about a
three foot drop from the edge of my seat
all the way to the ground and the
unprotected iPhone is shattered so now
we'll drop the phone's from about waist
high which is the second most common
drop just pulling it out of your pocket
and letting it go
looks like the screen of the phone is
totally fine and the back panel still
has that same crack but we're still good
and the Rhino shield is good on the
front and good on the back we'll do
another waist-high draw for good measure
this is drop number four
front of the phone is still good back of
the phone use these exact same front of
the phone is good and the back of the
phone is still not correct now we'll be
going about chest height this is drop
number five
take a look at the damage it looks like
we have a couple more cracks along that
side right there in front of the screen
up now we have damage on the front as
well we got a nick right there in the
corner as well as a crack in the top the
Rhino shield case we are looking totally
good on the front and if we pop the case
out it's pretty tight fitting case the
back panel is still fine so we owe Apple
nothing to fix this phone so far the
unprotected phone now has screen and
back panel replacements and with Apple's
in-house repair costs it might be
cheaper to buy a new phone at this point
all right now we'll be doing head height
as if it slips from your hand as you're
talking on the phone
taking a look at the silver phone same
cracks as before nothing new yet and we
have a new spiderweb in the corner of
the screen pretty safe to say that this
phone wouldn't survive any kind of drop
over three feet now we have the 11-foot
protected phone and the screen is still
fine and the back panel is still good
underneath that plastic so I'm about six
feet tall I'm gonna raise my hand above
my head and drop it from there just for
kicks and giggles see what happens to
both phones this is about an eight-foot
drop give or take
and it is pretty easy to tell that the
iPhone 8 did not survive that at all
even the camera lens is completely
shattered on that one we are doing this
drop test on asphalt to imitate a
parking lot you know whether you're in
your car and getting out
dropping it as you're getting groceries
both the screen and the back are
completely obliterated taking a look at
the Rhino shield case no damage on the
front will pop it off and take a look at
the back and the back panel of the phone
is completely fine
so now after having dropped four
different phones in two different drop
tests I think it's pretty safe to say
that it doesn't matter what Apple says
about their most durable glass ever
glass is glass and it's going to break
if it's dropped it's very unfortunate
about their super high repair costs that
I'm not a fan of personally I'll be
trying to find a way to fix it cheaper
than what they're charging as always but
until then a case is a very good idea
and the one we use today the Rhino
shield mod case holds up pretty darn
well like I mentioned before the Rhino
shield case does come with external
lenses we'll try out the macro lens on
the damage done to the iPhone eight
and this is the footage done with one of
the macro lenses attached to the phone
if we were to unscrew that lens the
footage wouldn't be quite as close-up
I'll also try out this wide-angle lens
super big thanks to rhino shield for
sponsoring this video by the way this
drop test would not be possible without
them just like a real camera lens that
thing is beastly so here's some video
with that wide-angle lens in place it's
got quite a big field of view with not a
whole lot of fisheye effect it's letting
us capture quite a bit into the image
I'm gonna unscrew the lens for kicks and
giggles easy and we are much closer up
I'll be linking all of those cases and
lenses in the video description of this
video so head down there if you need
protection for any of your phones once
again thank you so much for watching
I don't always delight in the abuse of
iPhones but sometimes it's necessary
thanks ton for watching and I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
