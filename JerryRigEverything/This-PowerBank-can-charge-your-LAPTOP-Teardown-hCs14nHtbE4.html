most powerful power banks with a full
fledge USBC charger that can charge up a
laptop
I've never torn down a power bank on
camera before I figured this Inger power
bank would be a good place to start I'm
curious to see what this thing looks
like on the inside
Anker sent me this twenty six thousand
eight hundred milliamp power base at
ninety six watt hours it is fairly
sneaks under the legal 100 watt hour
maximum capacity for traveling on
airplanes but what makes this particular
power bank special is the way the power
bank charges inside the box are two
cables a normal microUSB charger and the
more important USB C chargers all phone
manufacturers are slowly over the past
few years switching over to the USB C
style port for multiple reasons one of
the main reasons is because it allows
for stronger power delivery USB C
effectively charges your larger
electronics like laptops or Nintendo
switch gaming systems much faster than
typical USB ports could do a standard
USB port would never have the guts to
charge an entire laptop but USB C does
one of the few ports on Apple's new
MacBook Pro is the USB C so this power
bank with its USB C power delivery
system can charge the macbook pro in
just under three hours
a Nintendo switch can charge in about
two and a half hours which is pretty
much the same as the Nintendo dock
itself and this one is portable and even
better the whole power bank has that
premium feel of metal that we all know
and love
one big deal breaker for me in the past
was if a power bank could not charge
more than one device at a time there are
three ports on this thing so let's see
if they can all be utilized at once
power banks that can only charge one
thing at a time are pretty annoying so
right now I have my clear back to Galaxy
S a charging from that USB C slot
getting that full power delivery system
that we talked about earlier I have my
clear LG g6 getting charged from one of
the normal USB slots so it is charging
normally just without that power
delivery system and for the third object
I have a pair of Beats headphones
plugged into that second normal USB port
and all three objects are charging at
the exact same time so that's pretty
efficient and productive if you're
sitting at an airport with a bunch of
dead electronics and not enough outlets
to go around remember though for large
electronics like the Nintendo switch or
laptops that charge with USB C you have
to use the actual USB C port on the
power bank because that's the only form
capable of that P D or power to
every system required to charge those
things so keep in mind that there is
literally no reason for anyone to ever
take apart a power bank there's nothing
really to repair inside but I've never
opened one on my channel before and my
curiosity usually wins when it comes to
tearing down technology it was pretty
difficult popping off the end caps the
adhesive is pretty strong there are four
normal Phillips head screws under each
of those in caps holding the guts in
place same thing on the other side and
finally we can slide the chassis full of
purple batteries out of the frame it's
kind of fun fun something that most
people never get to see the interesting
part is that these lithium-ion cylinder
batteries are the same style of
batteries that we've seen an electronic
bikes and electronic skateboards and
even in Tesla cars it's just a ton of
these cylinder batteries all wired up
together and here we didn't see those
internal rails that the energy slide
along I think that a clear power bank
housing would be pretty awesome but that
might just be me I got the button back
in place and I slid the batteries back
inside of the metal housing screwed in
all of the Phillips head screws and then
got the plastic face plates over the top
of the port's having a power bank that
can charge multiple things at once
including laptops and then gendell
switch is very convenient plus with that
twenty six thousand eight hundred
milliamp hour battery I can get around
six or seven charges to my Galaxy s8
before needing to find a real outlet
I'll leave a link in the video
description for this power bank if you
want to check out the current pricing or
get one of your own what other
electronics would you like to see me
tear down on my channel let me know down
in the comments thanks ton for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
