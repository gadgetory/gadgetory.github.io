do a teardown and repair video for the
Nexus 5x this phone is made by LG first
thing you want to do is remove the SIM
card tray take a little tool put it in
the hole in the SIM card tray will pop
out you can remove it from your device
then the back plastic of the phone will
on snap from the screen it is held on
pretty tight so if you make a little
opening with your fingernail you can put
a pry tool in between the screen and the
back frame and you can unpop each of the
little latches from the frame and remove
the back there is no adhesive which is
very nice just slide your pry tool all
along the edge and all of the little
clasps will come undone we can see that
we'll need a screwdriver to remove the
back plastics from the phone I will link
all the tools down in the video
description to remove the lower plastic
bracket there's four screws and then pop
it off the base of the phone with a pry
tool and remove it this is actually the
loudspeaker of the phone you can see the
two contact points down here at the
bottom I will link replacement parts in
the video description below as well
there are six screws along the top I use
a razor blade to start the top corner
just lift it up a little bit and I can
unsnap the rest of the back plastic
piece off of the phone here's the
battery connection just unsnap that like
a little Lego same thing with the rear
camera and the front-facing camera and
then we have the LCD connection down
here at the bottom
unsnap all of those and then the
motherboard can be released from the
phone body here we see the LEDs for the
camera as well as some noise cancelling
microphones in the charging port down
here at the bottom unfortunately is not
replaceable it is soldered on to the
board so if your charging port ever goes
back here just out of luck unless you
can solder here's a SIM card tray at the
back as well this is not replaceable
either the battery is held in with
adhesive if you're going to pry it out
it is helpful if you have a sturdy metal
pry tool I thing you want to be really
careful of though is to make sure not to
puncture the battery at all that will
ruin the battery once it's lifted up
just a little bit switch to a plastic
tool because you are less likely to rip
anything on the battery itself here's
the battery I will link replacement
batteries down in the video description
usually they're pretty darn cheap here's
the rear facing camera this is a twelve
point three megapixel camera and if you
think that's a weird number it's because
it is here's the front-facing camera it
is a 5 megapixel pretty cute little guy
here's the vibrator motor you can see
the two gold little Springs that are up
at the top and those
rest in contact with the main board and
that's how it receives its signal here's
the earpiece it's got some metallic tape
along the top take that off and put it
somewhere safe you're going to reuse it
if you have to replace your earpiece you
want to put the tape back down on top of
it again pretty straightforward has the
two cold contact points as well that
just rest against the motherboard here
is the headphone jack has the same kind
of gold pins along the side that
communicate with the motherboard as well
here's the screen it is an IPS LCD
display similar to what the iPhones have
if you're going to replace your screen
there's a good chance that when you buy
it it will not come with the plastic
frame so you have to remove the screen
which is the LCD in the glass from the
plastic frame if your LCD is already
broken this won't be a big deal just
heat it up and pull it out from the
device I'm not going to do it in this
video just because the chances of my
screen surviving the removal from the
back frame is pretty slim if you can
find a screen that is sold with the
frame intact so the LCD the glass panel
in the front and the back plastic frame
that would be ideal and in the past LG
has sold them as whole units so
hopefully they continue to do that in
the future
go ahead and snap all the pieces back
into the phone again the front facing
camera the vibrator motor and then here
is the earpiece going to use that same
metal tape to tack it back down into
place here's the rear camera twelve
point three megapixels and the headphone
jack just going to pop that back in a
little holder that is there on the
plastic frame and then the motherboard
goes down into place as well make sure
the little ribbon cables for all the
parts are on the upper side of the
motherboard and then snap those down
into place like little Lego pieces and
make sure the motherboard is pressed
down along that headphone jack as well
so that the gold contact points will
touch the motherboard and receive their
communication put the battery back into
place clip it onto the mainboard and
then here's something kind of cool
there's a bunch of pins on the
motherboard and those come in contact
with this back plastic piece and that is
how the fingerprint scanner receives
this communication from the mainboard as
well there's a couple water damage
indicators one there on the back of the
phone and then one more if you saw
previously in the video in the SIM card
tray slot so those will tell if your
phone has been wet or not go ahead and
put that two loudspeaker back into place
and then put all screws and as well
remember all the tools and stuff are
down in the video description and then
the back plastic piece will just clamp
down into place it is very very secure
that back plastic panel does not want to
come off easy so you have to be use a
little bit of pressure to snap it down
into place if you have any questions go
ahead and leave them in the
