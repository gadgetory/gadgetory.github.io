around the corner it's time to check
Nokia's most budget smartphones the
Nokia 3 Cano key has built some of the
most durable phones I've ever tested so
be interesting to see if this lower
price point and lower specs constitute a
sacrifice and build quality my
durability tests are the only way to
find out let's get started
between the Nokia 3310 and the Nokia 600
kia has a reputation of extremely solid
build quality but if they compromise on
their low-end smartphones this
strikingly attractive white and gold
Android phone is one of the cheapest
Nokia smartphones on the market well
test the screen first my most picks
leave no question as to what the screen
is made out of with their different tips
a plastic screen was scratched at level
3 tempered glass screen scratched at
level 6 and that's what we're seeing
here this is advertised as an
unspecified version of Gorilla Glass
Nokia hasn't used sapphire yet on a
phone that would scratch a level eight
but maybe someday in the future we'll
see that utilized the front-facing eight
megapixel cameras tucked under the same
front glass so it's definitely protected
against scratches along with that Nokia
logo on the top right side of the phone
the earpiece is recessed below the glass
and unfortunately it's not permanently
attached it is loosely adhered in place
and it's relatively safe to assume that
eventually this little piece of screen
will fall out of place exactly like we
saw with many of the older Apple iPhone
4s the bottom of the phone has no
fingerprint scanner so if you're into
that kind of thing this probably isn't
the phone for you the capacitive buttons
are protected under the same slab of
front glass that the screen and front
camera are on the back of the phone is
where we run into our first issue a
plastic camera lens the camera itself is
8 megapixels and only films in 720p but
at the same time nobody wants scratches
on their camera lens no matter how
budget the phone is a plastic camera
lens is just asking for trouble
especially since it is flush with the
back panel prime scratching location
with zero protection speaking of
scratching the back panel is made from
plastic like most budget phones plastic
is cheaper to work with than metal and
plastic is fine while the plastic
scratching sound isn't as immensely
satisfying as metal on metal that we've
grown to love our class with cheriya
still a thing and look the beautiful
white background is now a snowflake but
just like the plastic camera lens a
large orange and white snow flow
isn't good for anyone the size of the
phone are made from metal which is a
pleasant surprise on a budget phone even
the buttons are made from metal usually
budget phone manufacturers flip in some
plastic buttons so it's nice to see
Nokia leaving the premium feeling
materials intact the top of the phone
has a headphone jack which adds to the
convenience on so many levels it even
has an SD card slot on the side for
expandable memory this budget Android
phone makes an excellent upgrade if
you're coming from any of the recent
iPhones the bottom of the phone does
have a micro USB slot and not the USB
see that is becoming standard on most
androids
I'll have to dock it a few points for
that one jumping into the burn test this
is a 5 inch 720p IPS screen which nokia
says will allow you to see better in
daylight it only survives about 10
seconds under my lighter though pixels
do eventually recover from the extreme
heat and that's one of the bonuses of
IPS displays since phones usually come
in contact with fire so often and
finally the ultimate test of build
quality the bin tests the construction
the phone is stressed to the max during
this phase of my testing and gives us a
good idea if the phone can survive two
years of abuse this Nokia three passes
the bin test even when flex from both
directions and survives my tests overall
the plastic camera lens is a huge bummer
but a simple case or maybe even a skin
would raise the surface of the phone
enough so that the lens won't rub on
anything you set it on besides the rear
plastic lens I think this is a good
phone for the money i'll leave a link
with the current pricing in the video
description if you're interested hit
that subscribe button so you don't miss
out on the new Nokia 8 test that's
coming soon let's keep our fingers
crossed that Nokia doesn't use that
plastic camera lens on their flagship
I'll be here to test out my phone on
purpose so you'll have to find out with
your phone on accident thanks for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
