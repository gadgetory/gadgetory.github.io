Apple's more colorful iPhone option
today we'll be taking apart the
fluorescent peach color and seeing what
a battery and screen replacements look
like the 10r has the same basic guts as
the iPhone 10s we took apart a couple
weeks ago but it's still good to see the
insides of each model let's get started
like with every other iPhone for the
past eight years we encounter to
proprietary pentalobe screws holding the
screen and the aluminum frame together
once those are out and set to the side
in an organized fashion it's time to
warm up the screen to soften the ip67
waterproofing around the edges I'll use
a large suction cup to lift up on the
screen while sliding my metal pry tool
between the metal edge of the phone and
the plastic buffer of the screen the
adhesive runs along both sides of the
display the important thing to remember
while slicing is that there's fragile
ribbon cables very close to the top and
right sides of the phone I'll pull down
gently on the glass at the top of the
screen unlatches from the phone frame
and the whole thing folds open revealing
the same basic design we've been seeing
in all the iPhones for the past few
years with minor variations in screw
placement and complexity I'll remove the
metal plate over the LCD screen
connectors with its two white triple
zero screws then I'll take off the plate
over the battery connector with its
three screws I'll unplug the battery
just on clips like a little Lego and
then unplug each of the two ribbons
running to the LCD there's one more
metal plate over the earpiece connector
this has five screws 3y triple-zero and
two phillips head if you're keeping
track that's three different
screwdrivers we've needed so far just to
remove the screen thanks Apple I'll dig
deeper into the screen itself in a
second but the good news is that the
10-hour LCD will be much cheaper to
replace than the OLED screens of the 10
and 10 s by hundreds of dollars now for
the battery the replacement seems easy
enough still Apple has always been
pretty good about putting in solid pull
tabs under the battery these things are
like magic
as they stretch out they literally lose
all grip on the battery defying science
and gravity at the same time there are
two more pull tabs up at the top these
ones are a bit harder to grip but
still have the same satisfying results
if one does happen to break it's almost
easier to grab the remaining and start
pulling again because Prime the battery
out manual aim is a bit on the dangerous
side since punctures are fatal to
batteries we try to avoid that
finally the battery is released from
inside the phone this is the 2900
milliamp little guy I'll try Lincoln
replacements in the video description as
they become available up top we have the
front-facing camera face scanner and dot
projector over there on the far right
let's take a quick look at the rear
camera while we're here two more screws
one of which is a standoff this brings
us to four different types of screws in
one single phone and we've barely
started taking it apart Apple does not
want people messing around in here with
the metal plate off to the side we can
unplug and pull out the camera unit a 12
megapixel sensor with optical image
stabilization this thing is a unit the
large surface area of the sensor is
probably what helps the iPhones maintain
such good image quality I'll put the
camera back into place plug it in and
get that metal bracket situated over top
now let's take a look at the LCD display
yeah it's resolution is quite a bit
behind the times but one massive perk of
having an LCD display over an OLED is
the replacement pricing Apple will
probably charge you an arm and a leg
either way but you can get a third party
replacement for last year's iPhone 8 for
$30 right now because it's an LCD last
year's iPhone 10 OLED replacement is
$200 quite a big price difference
LCDs like the one here on the 10r are
way cheaper when it comes to replacing
the back glass though still cost 399
dollars to replace and can only be done
through Apple there were four screws
holding down the earpiece and front
sensors three were Phillips head and one
was a white triple zero Apple's keeping
us on our toes these front earpiece
contraptions are pretty simple I'll link
as many parts as I can in the
description along with the tools I've
been using now the screen is assemble we
can start putting the whole thing back
together to make sure it still turns on
after all of our tinkering new battery
replacements will come with their own
adhesive but I'll just use a little bit
of double-sided tape for right now the
battery is set in place but before I
plug it in I'll get everything else
connected starting with the upper
earpiece ribbon and working my way down
to the
- LCD ribbons and lastly plugging in the
battery I'm always taking very special
care not to put any stress on the ribbon
cables they're about as fragile as a
piece of paper and can tear pretty easy
there's three more brackets going in
over the battery the screen ribbons and
the last one goes up top with its five
screws seriously though colored phones
are a fantastic idea the bright colors
are a nice change of pace from the
normal boring dull looking colors we see
everywhere else the top edge of the
screen tucks back into the frame first
and then gently sets down along both
sides finishing off with the final two
pentalobe screws at the bottom and there
we have it yeah it's over priced now at
the launch but down the road replacement
parts for the 10 arm will be much
cheaper than the 10s which is nice for
some reason Apple still isn't selling
any cases for the 10r right now
so be gentle if you own one of these the
back panel still costs four hundred
dollars to fix let me know if you have
any questions in the comments and coming
out with me on Twitter and Instagram
thanks ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
