here in the United States a few days ago
this is the latest and greatest flagship
from blackberry one of the oldest
smartphone manufacturers in the business
blackberry Peaks back in 2013 before
Android and the iPhone became the main
players lately though
blackberry has been dipping its juicy
fingers into the Android operating
system and that brings us to this key
one it does feel heavy in my hand so
we're off to a good start let's see how
this new phone holds up to my durability
test this is a completely brand new
retail device purchase right here in the
United States I've tested about 70
different smart phones now and like
always we start with the scratch test
the screen of this key one is a very
humble four and a half inches but I've
been told that that gets the job done
just fine my most pics to a great job
differentiating between glass tempered
glass plastic and sapphire plastic is a
three sapphires an eight or a nine on
the scale lately we see most flagships
using tempered glass which lands at
level six and this rectangle slab of
Gorilla Glass 4 scores exactly the same
hardness level you would see on a Galaxy
s8 or an iPhone 7 so far this blackberry
is holding up pretty well to its
competitors what's cool about this
satisfyingly clicky keyboard is that it
is touch sensitive so you can't control
the up and down left and right scrolling
of the screen from your keyboard without
actually touching the glass itself it's
kind of fun even with the extremely
heavy scratching from my razor blade
more than you would ever see in everyday
life the scrolling function still work
so you will never have to worry about
leaving your keyboard exposed thumbs up
for that
speaking of thumbs the fingerprint
scanner is cleverly hidden in the space
bar of the key one and it's the next
part to get tested even with heavy
scratches on the surface of the
fingerprint scanner it is able to read
and scan my fingerprint and unlocks the
device on every single try so far so
good
the front 8 megapixel cameras up here at
the top and this lens is made from glass
along with the opaque lens on the
opposite side with the proximity sensor
both are made from glass once slightly
underrated feature of smartphones these
days is the dual tone flash if
you ever have to use the phone in the
dark the dual tone provides a much
better image than one with just a single
color why flash this is covered by
plastic but that's pretty normal on all
flash LEDs the rear 12 megapixel camera
is covered with glass as well Pleasant
upgrade from the plastic lens on the
blackberry Prive it also has a thick
metal ring around the outside they'll
protect it from rubbing up against the
inside of your pocket or purse that
pockets and can be pretty vicious the
back cover is made out of a thin grippy
rubber like material a blackberry in
real life it's actually a type of
aggregate fruit which means that it's
composed of tiny little individual
fruits called droops droops are the
little juicy circles surrounding the
actual seat of the berry blackberry the
phone company chose the name blackberry
because all the little black keys on
their keyboard resemble the drupelets
on the blackberry fruit the same group
'lets you see in their logo see it's a
blackberry the back cover is
surprisingly resilient even to my razor
if you key the key one nothing happens
either the sharp edge of my coin was
able to scrape it up a little though
but that was with a lot of pressure
normal wear and tear won't hurt the
surface of this back panel and the sides
of the key one are made from sweet
sounding metal the power button is also
made of metal and up here by the
headphone jack there is a plastic end
cap but I'm not going to complain about
plastic because I'm just happy the
headphone jack is still there the rest
of the silver top surrounding the
headphone jack is the quality metal
including over here on the front of the
phone where the earpiece is Blackberry
did a great job with future proofing a
key one with the USB C port here at the
bottom and now the burn test this has
become increasingly more relevant now
that Trump has pulled the usa out of the
Paris climate agreement things are going
to heat up rather quickly and it'll be
nice to have a cell phone that can
handle the temperature I'm sure Donald
will be watching my videos to see which
phone allows him to tweet the longest
while the world burns this phone lasted
about 16 seconds which should fit his
attentions
and just fine the good news is that the
phone did completely recover there might
still be hope and now the bin test
testing the overall build quality of a
phone is essential to the people who
want a phone that will survive everyday
life and unfortunately this Blackberry
key one is not a survivor I was even
holding the screen when it popped out of
the frame it surprised me to see the
screen do that since most other screens
like Samsung have so much adhesive
behind them it takes a high-powered heat
gun or industrial hot plate to remove
them and this blackberry screen is held
in by nothing a quick Bend from the
other side and at this point my screen
stopped functioning entirely one the
power button was kinked says the glass
is adding zero structural support
without that strong adhesive and - with
the screen lifting up like it is the
first thing to tear is that ribbon cable
at the bottom of the display the whole
thing can be removed entirely by hand
because there is ZERO adhesive holding
it in place
no visible adhesive around the edges or
under the LCD of the screen nothing a
quick google search revealed that I'm
not the only one who has this problem
one guy dropped his phone on the center
console of his car and the screen popped
off and another guy woke up with a
detached display which is completely
believable if the displays are actually
shipping with no adhesive under them
this is a legitimate problem luckily for
blackberry though it is very easy to fix
and I'd be more than happy to make
another video if blackberry ends up
correcting this manufacturing oversight
so hit that subscribe button if you want
to stay updated on this situation I've
tested about 70 phones now most of them
are built very well and those that fail
end up on my shelf of shame only six
phones and two years have failed my text
and since my blackberry key one is not
currently functional it is going with
these six phones on my shelf of shame
until blackberry gets this figured out
at least it really does seem like an
easy fix so hopefully they will take
care of the problem and their customers
if you already own one of these phones
maybe grab a case that surrounds the lip
of that glass screen I'll pop the back
off the phone for kicks and giggles the
black PCB board is creative I am a fan
of that
there's a blackberry logo on the battery
it would have been pretty easy for them
to slip some wireless charging in here
as well but I think I've complained
enough for one day come hang out with me
on Twitter and Instagram
thanks Don for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
