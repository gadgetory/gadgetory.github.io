apart one of the brand new we use we're
to start off with on the bottom of the
system there are a bunch of little black
plastic stickers that are covering up
all of the screws so it's going to take
a little razor and then pry those up and
then save those somewhere so you can
stick them back on later there are six
screws around the edge and you're going
to need something called a tri wing
screwdriver a bunch of the screws on
this system are those these three right
here are just your regular Phillips head
and then on the side of the system
there's another little screw that holds
in the battery this little battery
sometimes if you're we won't start you
can just replace this battery it'll get
going two more screws along the side
also the tri wing and then the other end
of the system slides up and off which
shows us a few more screws still the Tri
wing once you get those off the black
plastic casing lifts up away from the
system itself now the front faceplate is
held on by two screws both Phillips head
so I'm going to release one right here
and then show you how to undo the ribbon
cable the ribbon cable is positioned
just inside and there's a little latch
along the edge that you have to flip up
and this unclamp s' the ribbon cable
from the system then you can pull on the
little blue tab which releases it and do
the other Phillips head screw on the
other end of the faceplate
and the whole faceplate will come up and
away from the system now the actual CD
drive itself is held in by four black
screws all Phillips head so unscrew each
of those so if your CD drive is stopped
working it's easiest just to replace the
whole thing pop out the screws and
there's a little ribbon cable underneath
that you'll see here in just a second
right here and if you take your little
pry tool and flip up the little black
lever at the bottom that will unwrap
unclamp the ribbon cable from the device
and here's the model number just in case
you need to buy another one now the fan
on the rear is also held in place by two
black Phillips head screws so I'm going
to unscrew those and then the fan just
Wiggles out a little slot that it's in
then you can unplug the connector and
here's a close-up shot of that
now there's two black screws holding on
the little black plastic bracket over
the heatsink so unscrew those and you
can get started on the really fun stuff
right here are all the silver screws
that are surrounding the metal part
that's covering the motherboard so
basically unscrew anything that's silver
all of the screws are pretty visible and
then the metal bracket is unattached
from the bottom plastic
now here you can kind of see where the
screw is attached to from the heatsink
on the top end so I'll show you what
that looks like as soon as we get this
metal bracket off there's a bunch of
little metal antennas that are on attach
to the plastic bracket and each one of
them are clipped in so you just bend
down the little clip and then untangle
the wires from the little plastic
brackets that they're in it's pretty
simple to see where they go but also
take a mental note where they're at so
you don't get messed up later also as a
side note make sure to keep all of the
screws organized as you're taking this
thing apart because the screws are
different sizes and go in different
locations here's the heatsink you can
see the little fins that help to
dissipate the heat and the four screws
that hold it on to the processor I'm not
going to show you how to take off the
processor just because it does require
new thermal paste as well anyway thanks
