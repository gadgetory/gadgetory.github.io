first grade math problem is on my desk
and ready to be taken far let's get
started oneplus is still using the rare
T 2 bit that is not normally included
with most cell phone repair kits I'll
link a kit that includes the bit in the
video description the build of the 1+5
is pretty similar to the iPhone which
has two little screws at the bottom and
then I can slip my metal pry tool
between the plastic rim of the screen
and the metal edge of the phone it's
still very securely snapped into place
so this takes a little bit of aggressive
persuasion I switch to a plastic tool in
the middle of the process to avoid
scratching the metal because I would
hate to do any damage to this phone and
definitely take out the SIM card tray
before you attempt any of this once we
get that last clasp undone we get our
first glimpse at the non red battery
oneplus used to include a brilliant red
battery inside the 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 but
stop with the red battery after the
oneplus x the 1 + 3 didn't have it
either
I guess oneplus didn't get the memo that
internal beauty is just as important as
external Beauty I have nothing against
yellow but red is definitely more cool
one interesting thing is that the
charging for it and the headphone jack
are still attached to the back panel
removing one Phillips head screw allows
me to pull off the silver metal bracket
on the motherboard and unclip the
charging port there are four screws
holding the two components onto the back
panel and once those are gone the
ribbons can pull free this is extremely
convenient because the charging port and
the headphone jack are some of the first
things that stopped working on a cell
phone a couple years down the road so
it's nice that they have easy
replaceable access there's a little
rubber ring around the charging port but
I would assume that this is more to
protect the port from stress of plugging
and unplugging and nothing to do with
water resistance
there's no adhesive around the port or
around the lip of the screen so I would
not trust this phone anywhere near water
we still have no access to remove the
battery yet but we can unplug it eight
normal Phillips head screws need to be
removed from the motherboard all on snap
two more ribbon cables they just unclip
like little Legos and one black wire
cable finally the board can lift away
from the frame giving us access to
unsnap the one remaining extension
ribbon hidden on the back I'm using my
plastic pry tool for all of this so I
don't hurt any of the fragile
electronics the dual camera setup comes
with two individual ribbons the
16 megapixel cameras on the left and the
20 megapixel telephoto camera is on the
right neither of which have the optical
image stabilization all of the Shake
Reduction is done internally
electronically which isn't always my
favorite the front-facing camera also
has that same electronic image
stabilization no oh is but it does come
with 16 megapixels of its own I'll snap
the rear cameras back in like little
Legos and then move back to the body of
the phone the little silver circular guy
is the vibration motor and now we have
access to the extremely average looking
yellow and silver colored battery
I don't read Chinese real good but I'm
going to assume this tab means pull
luckily no heat is required for the
removal of this battery - there are no
magical pull tabs but it's still pretty
user-friendly I'll give one plus a
thumbs up for that making our way down
at the bottom of the phone there are six
screws holding in the loudspeaker it's a
thin little guy with two golden contact
pads on the back to receive the signal
the extension ribbon can't come loose
and then the larger ribbon on the left
the last little connection is probably
for the capacitive buttons on the front
of the screen in the past 1 +
replacement screens came without the
frame installed so to complete a screen
repair you'd have to heat up the old
display remove it from the frame of the
phone and reuse the same frame with your
new display you can check the video
description for replacement screens I'm
going to leave my display intact because
the old screen will not survive the
removal process and mine still works
just fine now that the new screen is on
I'll clip the three ribbon cables down
into place including the extension
ribbon for the motherboard and I'll
screw in the loudspeaker this
loudspeaker does not have the
waterproofing mesh that we've seen in
water resistant phones like the iPhone 7
Samsung or even the HTC u 11 so once
again I would not trust this phone
around water
there has been some false speculation
floating around out there that this is a
water-resistant phone and that's just
not true the boring battery is back in
place though before I can set the
motherboard down I do have to attach the
extension ribbon cable to the underside
of the board after that's clipped in I
can drop the board down into the frame
I'll connect a few more ribbon cables
and then the one wire cable and make
sure all the screws get back into place
over here on the back metal panel we
have the charging port and the headphone
jack that need to be screwed in with
their four screws and I can plug it back
into the motherboard right next to the
battery connection both of those
connectors get covered by the metal
bracket and that
last motherboard screw getting the
screen to pop back in the frame was
easiest for me by lining up the top
first getting those clips in place and
then pressing down along the sides very
carefully overall is very nice opening
up a phone that didn't require heat gun
I might not approve of the battery color
or the lack of optical image
stabilization and it is kind of nice to
have water resistance on a phone but I
am a fan of this phone in general if you
haven't seen the durability test go
check that out and subscribe for more
videos like this in the future it's free
and I have plenty more videos coming
thanks ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
