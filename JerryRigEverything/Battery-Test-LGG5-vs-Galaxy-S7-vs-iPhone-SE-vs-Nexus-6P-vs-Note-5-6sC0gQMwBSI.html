battery test between multiple
smartphones so I have 11 high-end
smartphone set up in front of me on my
desk the iPhone se iPhone 6 LG g5 Galaxy
S seven LG v10 note 5 lumia 950xl
blackberry Prive Sony Xperia z5 premium
Nexus 6p and the Huawei mate 8 I also
have lined them up in order from
smallest battery to largest battery in a
perfect world the phone with the
smallest battery would die first but as
we all know with smartphones there are a
lot of variables that go into battery
life like operating system background
apps screen size and screen brightness
and a lot of other variables
most of these phones are unused the
iPhone 6 was used for a little bit and
the note 5 was used as my main phone for
about 6 months for this test all of the
phones are in airplane mode with the
screen brightness turned all the way up
I have a video that I made recently
looping on all of the devices I took a
han solo Star Wars Lego and turned it
into solid gold with the help of a
goldsmith which then fights Darth Vader
pretty awesome video you should check
out if you're done watching this one
I'll have it linked in the cards and in
the video description of this video here
have a listen for a second the Nexus 6p
wouldn't auto-rotate so I had to turn it
off and turn it back on again after
starting the test it had a few minute
late start but you'll see at the end of
this video that a few minutes won't
matter make sure you're subscribed so
you won't miss any of my future tests
and let's see the results of this
battery test the first phone to die was
the Sony z5 premium just before the
4-hour mark my theory as to why this
phone died first is because it's the
only phone with a 4k resolution on my
desk at the moment the video that is
looping on all of the phones is in 4k so
the Xperia z5 is pushing four times as
many pixels as the rest of the phones
which are playing the video at lower
resolutions so it's okay that it died
first in my mind because of how powerful
that screen is I imagine that in other
tests that don't involve video this
phone would have lasted a lot longer the
next phone to dim and putter to a stop
was the LG v10 when I turned on each
phone I left running any apps
turn on with the phone automatically so
I could be fair across all the devices
unfortunately for the LG v10 one of the
stock apps that auto starts is the
useless battery sucking lookout app this
was disappointing I had high hopes for
the v10 and it finally died at 4 hours
and 11 minutes the next phone to die
completely was the iPhone 6 this has one
of the smallest batteries so I was not
surprised did you know that the iPhone
6s actually has a smaller battery than
the iPhone 6 someone should let Apple
know that they're headed in the wrong
direction with battery capacity there is
a big gap between the third and the
fourth phone the microsoft lumia 950xl
died at 5 hours and 6 minutes the Nexus
6p did legitly die at 5 hours and 20
minutes then the LG g5 stopped playing
video and pretended to be dead with 16%
battery life at 5 hours and 21 minutes
trying to screw up my test but after
checking the battery history it was on
course to die at the 6 hour and 15
minute mark I'll have it scored
correctly at the end of this video the
iPhone se died at 5 hours and 33 minutes
even though it has a small battery it
also has the smallest screen so the
battery doesn't get used as hard as the
other phones which means it can last
longer the note 5 was the next to go at
6 hours and 20 minutes of screen on time
the BlackBerry privilege the ninth phone
to die at a very impressive 6 hours and
35 minutes the Huawei mate 8 has the
largest battery in the group but it also
has the largest screen it was the tenth
phone to die at 6 hours and 38 minutes
the last phone to die was the galaxy s7
with an impressive 7 hours and one
minute of video playing remember that
all phones are in airplane mode with the
screen brightness turned all the way up
here's a list of all the phones and how
long they stayed alive let me know what
you think of the results down in the
comments if you enjoyed this video and
want to see more like it in the future
hit that thumbs up button and subscribe
let me know in the comments what tests
you would like to see done next
I do phone giveaways sometimes through
my Twitter so bounce on over there and
see if I have anything going on at this
time thanks for watching hope see you
