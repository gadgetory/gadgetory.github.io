to replace the charging port on the iPhone
6.
If you want to watch the other repair videos
go ahead and click the links in the front
of this one.
Here’s the iPhone 6.
We’re going to go ahead and turn it off.
There are two pentalobe screws down at the
bottom.
If you need a pentalobe screwdriver go ahead
and check the video description right below
this video and I will link the parts and repair
tools that you’ll need there.
Get your suction cup and lift up a little
bit on the screen and then you can get your
pry tool and lift up on the edge of the frame
on the screen.
You want to lift up on the frame itself so
you don’t bend the screen and crack it.
If you crack the screen, obviously you’d
have a bigger problem than just your charging
port.
Lift up the screen.
There are 5 screws on this metal bracket;
pull that guy off.
You don’t need to take off the screen for
this repair but it does make it a lot easier
because the screen can’t be folded past
90 degrees while it’s still connected.
Lift off these 4 ribbon cables and then that
releases the screen itself.
Once again, replacement parts are in the video
description if you need any of those.
Now to get at the charging port you need to
take off this little bracket which is holding
down the battery connection; so get rid of
those two screws.
Keep them organized; place them right next
to this little bracket so you don’t lose
them.
Lift off the battery connector.
And you don’t need to take out the battery
for this video, but I am going to just for
the video’s sake.
It is a pain so don’t do it unless you absolutely
need to.
There are 4 screws on the loud speaker.
Disconnect that ribbon cable and you have
that wire cable here that I’m lifting up.
Then you can just kind of pull it out of the
little bracket that’s holding it down.
And then the loud speaker comes up and away
from the phone itself.
Once again if you need any replacement parts
I’ll have this linked down below as well.
So if your speaker is crackly or muffled,
or it’s been water damaged or something
like that, usually they’re pretty cheap.
So check those out.
Here are the two little connectors for the
loud speaker; also on the charging port cable.
Now we’re going to take out the vibration
motor.
So there are two little screws on either side
of that.
Remove those; put them somewhere safe.
And pull the motor out away from the phone.
You can see the two little connectors right
here and those are what connect the two little
contact points on the charging port.
Four screws on the charging port itself.
Another little bracket.
Keep the screws close by the brackets; that’s
the best way to stay organized I’ve found.
Then there’s another screw and a little
rubber piece down here by the microphone.
Take out that screw, keep it next to the rubber
piece and set that where you’re setting
the rest of your screws in a very organized
fashion.
Two more screws down by the charging port
and two more by the top of the headphone jack.
Remove those, keep them somewhere safe.
And then you can start peeling the ribbon
cable away from the phone.
Be careful once you get down around this spot
because the microphone and headphone jack
are kind of inside the phone’s frame.
So lift those up and out and then you can
see the entire component right here.
So these parts are normally pretty cheap.
I will link those down in the video description
as soon as they become available so check
those out.
Putting it back in, you want to start with
the headphone jack and microphone; putting
those inside the frame and then kind of bend
and fold the ribbon cable to match the contour
of the phone.
That way it lines up where it needs to be.
Get the metal bracket and those four screws
in.
Then these 4 screws and the one screw and
metal piece that hold the microphone in as
well.
If you kept all your screws organized, this
part will be easy.
Get the vibration motor placed down on those
two little contact points and screw it in.
And you have the loud speaker here.
Sometimes you need to push the top in first,
it’s got little guide in brackets, and then
the bottom will click in after that.
Get those four screws in.
Get the wire cable tucked down in that little
metal groove there.
And then pinch it down on its little connector
right here.
This one took me a couple tries just because
it’s so small.
You’ll hear it kind of click in.
And then you have the charging port connector
right here and then you just want to fold
the battery back down and clip it in as well.
Once again you didn’t have to take the battery
out cuz it’s a pain, but if you want to
you can.
Get the little metal bracket screwed down
as well.
And then the screen.
So many connections.
Clip them all down, all four of them.
They’re kind of like little Legos.
So position them right above the connector
and then you’ll hear it clip down in.
Don’t use too much force or you will bend
them and then your repair becomes much more
expensive.
Get the little metal bracket down and get
those 5 screws also put into place.
And then when you fold the screen down the
easiest way to do it is to guide the top into
place first.
It’s got these little grooves that match
up with the top of the frame.
And then you can click down along the sides
of it and it’ll snap in all the way down
to the bottom next to the charging port.
And then you can get those two pentalobe screws
back in and you are set.
If you have any questions be sure to leave
them in the comments.

helped you.

I put up videos fairly often and I hope to
see you around.
