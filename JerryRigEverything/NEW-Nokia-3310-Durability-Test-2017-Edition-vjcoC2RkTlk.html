most durable phones on the planet so it
only makes sense that I review the new
2017 successor with the same namesake if
you have the same durable
characteristics running the family the
important specs are listed on the box
with 31 days of standby time and of
course the snake game back in my day
playing snake on my dad cellphones one
of the coolest things ever so it's fun
though Kia brought that back and it's
pretty refreshing to see a removable
battery on a modern cell phone it's time
to see how the new Nokia 3310 stands up
to my durability test let's get started
now both of these phones might look
similar but the larger orange one is
actually a fake imitation that I found
on eBay claiming to be the real deal
it's fully functional but it's not the
same phone so be very careful when
purchasing one of these for yourself
online if you want a real Nokia 3310 the
fakes are rampant the imitation box is
the one on the left and the real
original box from Nokia is the one you
see on the right the more colorful one
I'll put a link in the description to
the real Nokia 3310 when it becomes
available here in the United States the
scratch test is always first
since this phone is what we call a dumb
phone or a simple phone I don't have
high hopes for anything premium like
sapphire or glass and my thoughts were
confirmed when my pick started catching
a level-3 and leaving full gouges at a
level for the screen of this new Nokia
3310 is plastic exactly like the old
version since the screen isn't going to
be doing any YouTube Netflix or social
media general a few scratches aren't
going to be a super big deal with
something on the inexpensive end of the
phone spectrum I would prefer a plastic
screen over a glass one since classic
does handle drops better the physical
buttons are made of plastic I tried
texting on the t9 pad for kicks and
giggles and even though it's been 10
years since I've owned a t9 phone it all
came back to me too presently quick
slick right on the black
besides the phone are made from plastic
and the top of the genuine 3310 is where
the microUSB port is located it's also
plastic up here the opposite into the
phone has EDD phone jack there's also an
FM radio as well as an internal SD card
slot inside the phone it's nice to see
Nokia producing devices equipped with
consumer-friendly ports it's got to be a
little awkward when this dumb phone has
more features than some people
smartphones these days the phones
complaining beeps drowned out the
scratches a little bit but you can tell
the phone is pure plastic all over
there's no screeching metal on metal a
little-known fact that starting with the
Nokia 6110 in 1998 snake was actually a
two-player game
connecting to phones in real time via an
infrared port at the top of the phone
kind of like how the old game boys could
connect to battle Pokemon
the Nokia 61 perm would allow the phones
to join their snakes and compete for
apples in
gained on the first neck to crash lost
again pretty impressive for old
technology unfortunately this new Nokia
3310 doesn't come with an infrared port
but maybe we'll see that perk come back
eventually in a future model one thing I
would change on this phones design is
the camera lens it is made of plastic
switching to glass would only cost Nokia
a few pennies but at the same time this
phone is made to be budget and durable
so I don't blame them too much just
remember that you're easy to scratch a
plastic lens will rest flat on any
surface you set the phone on so be
careful if you want to protect those 2
megapixels
now the burn test reminds me quite a bit
of the Nintendo switch since both of
these screens are plastic the display is
a 240 by 320 pixel 2.4 inch TFT LCD a
big improvement over the monochrome
display on the original 3310 but after
about 20 seconds the flame does
permanently disfigure the outer layer
it's still usable of course just keep in
mind that during any volcanic eruptions
or apocalyptic scenarios that top layer
might become a little blemish and now
the bend test flexing the phone the sets
of the construction and gives a general
idea of how the phone will hold up over
the coming years even though this device
does have a physical keyboard below a
screen the screen doesn't fall out on a
whim like we saw happen with the
BlackBerry key one black bear you might
want to consider buying a few of these
Nokia 3310 s for research purposes I'll
add a link for them in the video
description or better black bear you can
just wait for my teardown video and we
can all see what makes this little brick
of a phone so durable flexing from the
front or the back and the phone still
stays solid and functional nokia has
impressed me with the two phones I've
tested from them this year it'll be fun
to see what they come up with in the
future
this Nokia 3310 passes my durability
test coming out with me on Instagram or
check out my Nokia 600 billion to the
smartphone thing
Nokia has a long history of taking phone
build quality to the next level and it's
good to see that they haven't changed
thanks for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
