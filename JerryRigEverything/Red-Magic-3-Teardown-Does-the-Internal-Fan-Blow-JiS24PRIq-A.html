gaming phone we've seen so far this year from
a hardware perspective.
Yeah, it had the normal flashy LED lights
and high refresh rate display, but this gaming
smartphone has an internal active cooling
system with a built in fan.
This is the first time we've ever seen a fan
inside a smartphone.
Today we'll see what that fan looks like from
the inside, and we'll analyze the blowing
bits to see if it actually does anything...or
if it's just for decoration.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
There are 2 tiny t2 screws down here at the
bottom of the phone, one on either side of
the USB-C charging port.
I'll link the toolkit I used down in the video
description.
There is no water resistance on the Red Magic
3, so that will make things a bit easier.
No heat gun required.
All I need is a thin metal pry tool that'll
slip between the plastic lip of the screen
and metal housing, then the back metal panel
is just friction fit to the screen.
Little plastic tabs holding it in place all
the way down the sides in the bottom.
This is why we could hear it pop out of place
during the bend test.
Before I can open up the phone all the way
though, there is a small ribbon for the gaming
port that needs to be unplugged, then another
ribbon off to the left side of the phone for
the rear fan and LED lights.
The second ribbon is a Phillips head screw
holding down a metal bracket over top of the
Lego style ribbon connector.
The internal fan of the Nubia Red Magic 3
is still attached to the back panel with 4
silver screws.
It gets it's power and communication from
4 soldered wires.
Then there is a surprising amount of adhesive
holding the whole thing in place.
Once the fan has popped off the back, we can
see that the fan unit resides off to the side
of the phone right next to the exit vent.
And the center intact hole on the back is
situated above a very shallow channel.
The fan spins, sucks the air through that
back grill down through the shallow channel,
and spits it out the side vent of the phone.
But what heat is it dissipating?
In computers, fans are situated above the
processor.
Inside the Red Magic 3 it's kind of the same
thing in principle.
This thermal foam sits above the processor
and the motherboard, then the fan channel
rests on top of that thermal foam.
So as the shallow channel heats up, the moving
air flow through the phone cools it back down.
Nubia claims the fans can cool the phone guts
as much as 16 degrees under heavy load.
The channel did look and feel like plastic
initially, which would be dumb since plastic
isn't very good at dissipating heat.
But my razor blade reveals that the airflow
heat dissipation channel is indeed made from
metal.
So quite honestly, the fan is here for a reason,
and from the inside, it looks like it's actually
doing it's job of cooling down the phone,
and it's not just a gimmick.
Thumbs up for that.
The center LED light bar inside the back panel
is hidden underneath a large black sticker,
and kind of has the same design we saw inside
of the Black Shark 2, where the LEDs are off
at an angle, shining into some murky plastic
as a diffuser.
This explains why the lights have a more subtle
glow to them.
And just like in the Black Shark 2, the LEDs
can't be seen very well in well-lit environments.
I think if a company is going to add RGB LEDs
to their phone, they should go all out with
transparent plastic and none of this subtle
diffused stuff.
Gaming computers are flashy.
Gaming cellphones should be as well.
The battery connector is under this long metal
plate with its two screws.
Then I can unplug the battery like a little
Lego.
Unfortunately, this impressively large battery
inside the Red Magic 3 has no magic pull tabs.
And there's no easy way to remove it.
The adhesive below the battery is extremely
strong.
This is unsafe and dangerous to anyone trying
to repair to recycle their phone in the future.
And like I said during the LG G8 teardown,
because of this permanent battery installation,
if you're trying to decide between buying
this phone and another phone, choose that
other phone.
Permanent battery adhesive is bad.
It almost ripped the protective layer off
of this 5,000 milliamp hour battery as I removed
it.
And companies should stop doing this.
This top earpiece speaker comes out of the
phone next, with it's 3 screws holding it
onto the motherboard.
This little guy doubles as one of the dual
front firing stereo speakers.
There is no water resistance in this phone.
Nubia has placed a white circular water damage
indicator next to the headphone jack opening,
so if water does come in, it'll turn that
sticker pink.
Three screws hold down the motherboard to
the phone screen.
Then I can unclip the gold charging port extension
ribbon and the screen display ribbon cable,
along with the black wire off to the right
side.
Then the whole motherboard can lift gently
out of the frame, revealing an incredible
amount of pink thermal paste on the back of
the motherboard.
It's like a completely chewed up Double Bubble
back here...or a freak frosting factory explosion.
Or, last one, someone dropped a cupcake in
the phone and forgot to clean it up.
The rear facing 48 megapixel camera does not
have optical image stabilization.
Let's scrape off some of this strawberry pudding
and see what kind of cooling system we are
working with under the square copper plate.
It looks like just a standard heat pipe, but
it's routed under the screen, which means
we won't be able to see how long it is or
where it goes.
I'll come back to this in a second.
Down at the bottom of the phone we have the
other stereo speaker hidden below 7 screws.
When that's lifted, we can see a normal smaller
coin style vibrator motor soldered onto the
charging port board and the black USB-C charging
port, with another white water damage indicator
here at the bottom.
The bottom speaker has a bit of black mesh
over the opening, but does indeed have a small
slit, which lets the sound port out to the
front of the phone.
It's small, but still counts.
Now, normally I would reassemble the phone
at this point, but since is a gaming phone
and the heat pipe is important, I think we
should see what it looks like.
It is hidden under the screen though, which
unfortunately means...[cracking].
I do normally try to keep my phone's in working
condition during these tear downs, so this
is probably the last time I'll try to reveal
an under screen heat pipe.
Screens are so brittle and fragile, removing
them is usually fatal to the display.
Whether the glass cracks or the AMOLED part
cracks, the outcome is usually pretty bleak.
Peeling back the glass panel reveals that
the AMOLED is once again not glued to the
glass.
This time around the AMOLED is a more brittle
crispy glass style panel, and not the paperish
bendy one we saw on the OnePlus 7 Pro.
It does look super cool though.
The heat pipe is positioned lengthwise down
the body of the phone, and is about half as
long as the phone itself.
Not too shabby.
Nubia has made a pretty awesome device.
High in specs, cool hardware, and an awesome
internal fan.
If they manage to add pull tabs or an easy
removal system to the battery, I'd be happy
to recommend this to everyone.
What do you think?
Should I continue breaking phones open to
see the heat pipe?
Or are you good with just knowing it exists
and then reassembling the phone in one piece.

Thanks a ton for watching and I'll see you
around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
