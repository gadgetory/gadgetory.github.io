that I do a durability test on the sony
xperia z5 premium it's actually one of
the only phones on the market with a 4k
5.5 inch screen as an added bonus it is
also water resistant this is the
top-of-the-line phone from Sony right
now so let's see how it handles life
like always let's start with a scratch
test I have a set of pics that let me
see where the screen falls on Mohs scale
of hardness now Sony has not bragged
anywhere about having Gorilla Glass on
their phone all of the specs
specifically say tempered glass so it's
interesting that it scores the exact
same level of hardness that a normal
gorilla glass screen would score a level
6 leaves a mark on the screen but a
level 7 pick leaves the deeper groove
hit that thumbs up button for the sweet
reflective back on this phone now let's
test the camera lens this is always
important to photographers and
videographers especially since this
phone is rocking a huge 23 megapixel
camera unfortunately it looks like the
lens is made out of plastic and is
easily scratched even my level 3 pic can
scrape it is exactly like the plastic
camera lens on the blackberry Prive as
you can see the lens sits pretty flush
with the back panel of the phone so if
you ever set your phone down it will
receive almost no protection from that
little circular lip around the edge now
that you know those of you with this
phone can avoid damage there in the
future it looks like the back of the
phone is scratch resistant no marks can
be found underneath my razor blade it is
a huge collector of fingerprints though
the sony logo is actually on the
underside of the glass so it is
completely smooth on top the sides of
the phone are made of metal but can
still be scuffed up a little with razor
blades and keys onto the burn test the
phone is still fully operational at this
point I apply a little flame to the 4k
IPS LCD display that pixels reacts
pretty fast by turning off and going
black just like most other phones but
this one is a bit different after
turning black the pixels cook and turn
white in the center of the burn as we've
learned from other phones I've tested
black pixels recover while white pixels
do not and this phone has a combination
of both the heat leaves the phone pretty
quickly and you can see that I'm able to
touch the burned area directly within
seconds let's jump into the bin test the
initial force of my hand snaps the side
bar right next to the power button which
seems to be a theme with bendable phones
like the
iPhone 6 HTC m9 and the Nexus 6p that
power button is just a weak spot for
these phones the phone is still fully
functional at this point though there is
no catastrophic failure like the Nexus
6p when I bend it back from the other
side the side bar is next to the SIM
card slot break open so yes the phone
does bend not to destruction like the m9
or the 6p but it is indeed broken if
they could make the phone a tad bit
stronger and fix that camera lens it
would probably one of my favorite phones
right now thanks for watching if you've
enjoyed this video and want to watch all
of the other major flagship phones
tested in the future make sure you're
subscribed I post behind the scenes
stuff most regularly on Instagram and
Twitter thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
