to replace the screen on an iPhone 6 if
you want to see any of those other
repairs go ahead and click the links
here we have the iPhone 6 going to go
ahead and turn it off
grab my pentalobe screwdriver and take
out the two little screws in the bottom
these are the same size screws as all of
the other iPhones and grab any tools or
replacement parts in the video
description below I'm going to take a
suction cup and lift up the screen just
a little bit and so I can slip a pry
tool you can use a plastic one or a
metal one if you want just make sure to
lift up on the actual metal frame of the
screen
otherwise you might crack it as you pry
it up so be super careful with that as
you lift up the screen you'll show these
five screws on the metal plate take out
those screws remove the plate and then
unsnap each of these little clasps the
clasps are very similar to Legos just
kind of take a little pry tool pop them
underneath and they'll unclasp
from the little latch that they're on
anyway this is the screen there's a very
good chance that when you buy your
replacement screens you're gonna have to
move over all the individual parts from
one screen to the other we're going to
start with the earpiece there's three
screws up at the top take out those
screws and then the little bracket comes
off put that somewhere safe make sure
you keep all your screw is really
organized we're going to have problems
later here's the earpiece once again all
of the parts and tools for this project
can be found in the video description
below so go ahead and check that out I'm
pulling up the front camera and the
proximity sensor from the little
brackets that they're held in and then
pulling off the last little bit that's
taped down by the earpiece these parts
are really inexpensive at least they
have been in the past with the iPhone 5s
and fours so go ahead and check the
video description if you want to check
out how much these parts are there's
three screws on both sides of the metal
plate and then one screw down at the
bottom so take those out and then
there's two screws that hold the home
button in place remove that bracket and
then the home button is just lightly
taped down it's just lightly stuck so
peel that up and there's one little
connector right there just like little
connectors that were holding the screen
down those little Lego pieces so
unpopped that
and remember that this is the only home
button the one that comes with your
phone that will work with the
fingerprint scanner any other
aftermarket home buttons that you put on
your phone will not work with the
fingerprint scanner they'll just work as
a home button so keep that in mind
anyway I lifted off the metal plate you
can see the ribbon cable that connects
the home button up by the earpiece and
this is the screen check the video
description below for replacement
screens
I'll have them linked down there for you
and there's a good chance you might need
to move over the plastic brackets from
one screen to the other so they just pop
right out and then when you put them
back in you don't need to worry about
gluing them down or anything because the
actual ribbon cable will hold them in
the correct place that they need to be
and you'll see that here in a second
anyway I'm going to grab the earpiece
ribbon cable and put that back in lining
it up with a little peg up at the top
it's really easy not to mess this up
because there's little guiding pegs that
the ribbon cables sit on top of and then
each little component has its own little
slot up at the top so you can just kind
of see where each little piece goes the
earpiece is going to go down over the
top of the the camera and the proximity
sensor and then those gold little
connection points will fold right over
the top of the earpiece and the camera
will go in its slot once the cameras in
there you can take your backplate and
slide it up over that ribbon cable for
the LCD and line it up with the hole and
then you can grab the bracket for the
camera and put that over the top as well
remember that there's those three screws
that hold that down and then we can
start with the home button it should
still be relatively sticky from before
either way just put it down in place
over the hole and then fold over that
little Lego piece and snap that in place
just like a Lego and then you can grab
your bracket screw that in with the two
screws and then there are seven screws
around the side of that metal place so
make sure those are in as well now we're
going to take the screen and plug each
of those little connectors in there's
four of them just kind of work your way
down you'll feel it seat
on top with a little plug and then you
can just press it down the rest of the
way very similar to Legos get all four
of those in and then while the screen is
still up you can go ahead and turn your
phone on just to make sure that it's
working
so make sure that the touch sensitivity
is working and the LCD is working and
then turn the phone off before you do
anything else put the metal bracket back
into place you got those five screws and
then you can fold your screen down and
print it into place so make sure that
you start with the top of the screen and
slide it up and end a little groove so
it's super flush with the edge of the
phone and then you can press the edges
in as you go down around and torch the
charging port make sure you put those
bottom two pentalobe screws in and there
you go if you have any questions make
sure to leave them in the comments don't
