you how to replace the Wi-Fi antenna in
your iPhone five parts and tools can be
found in the video description below
start with the two pentalobe screws down
at the bottom and then grab a suction
cup one that is hopefully bigger than
this one if your suction cup doesn't
have enough cojones to lift off the
screen go ahead and grab a metal pry
tool or a razor blade and slip it
between the metal frame of the phone and
the plastic edge of the glass screen and
pry up very very gently along the edges
if you pry up on the glass you're going
to break something so make sure to stay
along the edge of the phone and pull it
up out of the little clasps that keeps
the screen down in then don't bend it
past 90 degrees or else you'll damage
some cables grab the three screws that
hold down this metal plate lift up metal
plate and put it next to the three
screws and then lift up each of these
little ribbon cables kind of like Legos
pull them up and away and that releases
the screen from the phone put that
somewhere special
and try to stay organized release these
two screws grab the metal plate put
those next put the metal plate next to
the two screws that you just barely took
out then you can unclip the battery the
batteries in there pretty tight the
sticky tape that they use tends to get
harder over time so the longer you've
had the phone the harder it is going to
be to take out your battery I found that
it was easiest to take a plastic pry
tool slide it between the edge after you
know playing with it for a little bit
and just pry it up from the outside just
like that I'm going to go ahead and
unclip the volume and power cables from
the mainboard because to get to the
Wi-Fi antenna it's plugged in to the
bottom of the motherboard so we have to
take out the motherboard and flip it
around in order for us to unplug it also
the vibrating motor is in our way so
we're going to go ahead and unscrew the
two brackets all the two screws holding
down the bracket and then put that
somewhere special next to the two screws
that came out with it
grab the one screw at the top and then
the vibrating motor comes free and this
is the little guy that spins around when
you get a text message
a phone call kind of cute go ahead and
put that away now there is a metal
bracket holding down the charging port
ribbon cable so I'm going to go ahead
and unplug that just like the Legos we
were talking about before and then the
cellular antenna going to unclip that as
well this is a wire cable and then just
kind of get those up and out of the way
so we can work on getting the
motherboard out there's two more little
ribbon cables that are in the way of one
of our screws so go ahead and pop that
out and then that shows us where all of
the screws are there are five of them
holding the motherboard down and then
another two up here by the camera once
the two by the camera are unscrewed we
can go ahead and remove that bracket
once again keep all the screws organized
so you can have an easier time putting
it all back together again and then
before we can pull out the mainboard we
also have to get rid of the SIM card you
can do this you know at the beginning of
the whole process if you'd like as well
probably a little bit easier that way
and don't forget these two screws very
very important they're the grounding
screws for the motherboard and if you
pry up on it it'll rip the cables and
you'll be in a pile of bad luck so grab
the Wi-Fi antenna unclip it from the
back of the mainboard and then set that
somewhere special and then here's the
Wi-Fi antenna itself it has a little
metal bracket so go ahead and pull that
out and then the rest of its glued down
to the back of the phone so just very
gently you know with a pair of tweezers
or with your plastic pry tool pull that
up and away from the back of the phone
and then you can just take your new one
and put it in the exact same spot pretty
simple this would fix you know if your
Wi-Fi is grayed out in the settings on
your phone this would fix it or if your
Wi-Fi is just not working very well you
know replacing the antenna would help
out a lot anyway if I helped you at all
