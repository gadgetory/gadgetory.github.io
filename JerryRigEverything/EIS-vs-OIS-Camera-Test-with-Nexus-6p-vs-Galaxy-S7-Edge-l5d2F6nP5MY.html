about OAS and E is optical image
stabilization and electronic image
stabilization I'll be comparing the
Huawei Nexus 6p and the samsung galaxy
s7 edge
we know that the Nexus 6p has electronic
image stabilization if I pop off the
back lens cover you can tell that the
camera unit itself is not moving at all
when I rock the phone back and forth all
of its image stabilizing is done
internally electronically now with the
Samsung Galaxy s7 edge when I rock the
phone back and forth you can see the
camera unit compensating for that motion
like a little gyro or a camera gimbal
built right into the phone it is
stabilizing with hardware and not
software hit that thumbs up button for a
beautiful circuit board so I have both
the galaxy s7 edge in the Nexus 6p in
front of me stabilized with this
homemade camera stabilizing rig that
will hold them both equally while I walk
around so we're going to test the OIS on
the Samsung s7 edge and the EIS on the
Nexus 6p so if I both of my phone's in
front of me how am i recording this
video well I'm glad you asked this is
the Galaxy Note 5 and I'm using this to
record the screens on my homemade rig at
the same time it's almost like breaking
the fourth wall you know what I mean a
little bit of camera inception that guy
is so weird so this is me just walking
down the trail right now I'm filming in
4k resolution both the Nexus 6p and the
galaxy s7 edge will be able to stabilize
at this resolution I'm going to try
again at 1080p though just to be sure
try a pan with the EIS and the OIS
basically what the EIS is doing right
now is as taking the digital image and
correcting it in the software as I'm
filming where the OIS is correcting it
in the hardware before it even gets to
the software it's stabilizing it
beforehand
I'm going to try to run a little bit I
am holding both the cameras equally with
my little rig that I put up it's evening
right now so the light is getting a
little bit lower both of this is being
filmed with the stock camera apps on
both phone
so now we've switched to 1080p we'll see
if the Nexus 6p can handle the
stabilizing a little bit better even
though the EIS option is available on 4k
it could be that it doesn't have enough
pixels to work with to stabilize the
image it does look a lot smoother in
1080p it's almost like a warp stabiliser
effect that you would use in Adobe
Premiere Pro while you're editing try
running so looking again at this 4k
footage which phone is on which side
I'll let you watch for a second before I
tell you keep in mind that there is a
$200 price difference between these two
phones the 6p is about $500 and the s7
is about $700 but it is still
interesting to compare the camera
quality between these two Android phones
even though the 6p has he is turned on
for shooting in 4k it does not stabilize
as well with that resolution as it does
with the 1080p footage with the hardware
stabilization or oh is on the s7 edge it
does a better job of stabilizing at all
resolutions please subscribe for my
future videos and let me know what phone
you think did best in the comments below
thanks for watching hope to see you
around
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
