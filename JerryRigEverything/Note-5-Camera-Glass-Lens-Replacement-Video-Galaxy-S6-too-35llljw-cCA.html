the back camera glass on your Samsung
note 5 is the same process for the
galaxy s6 the s6 edge and the s6 edge+
basically any phone with the glass back
from Samsung first thing to turn your
phone off you can see our cracked camera
lens there I'm going to use lenses from
bonafide hardware they are glass lenses
I bought two just to make sure they also
have the adhesive already installed on
the back double checking to make sure
the lens is glass taking my cutters and
snipping into the glass you can see the
glass shards fall away from the lens
there's a lot of counterfeit sellers out
there making plastic lenses lenses that
you can fold in half with your hands
significantly less quality than the
glass lenses much less clear so make
sure that you do have a glass lens now
before we remove the broken glass let me
show you what optical image
stabilization looks like the most
important part of this whole process is
making sure that you don't get any glass
shards or dusts down inside of the phone
itself there's three places that you
want to avoid getting glass around the
edges on the lens itself and in these
little cracks any glass shards will stop
the image from stabilizing and the lens
from focusing the glass lens itself
won't make your images blurry but if
there's glass shards down inside of the
camera mechanism itself your camera will
stop functioning because there are
moveable bits down inside of there to
remove the lenses pretty
self-explanatory we're just going to
take my razor blade and tweezers and
remove the glass you want to do this and
as big as shards as possible I did
manage to get a lot of dust and shards
down inside of there you want to avoid
this if at all possible the more dust
you get down inside of there the more
you risk your lens not focusing when
you're done also make sure that every
single glass shard and glue is off of
that little metal frame as well I'm
going to pull out my new lens remove the
plastic protection off the back on the
front sometimes they ship without the
plastic protection not a big deal just
make sure that your lens is clean on
both sides the front and the back I'm
going to remove the protection for the
adhesive and you can see here that the
lens is just a little bit dirty I'm
going to take a cloth and just kind of
rub off that dirt and make sure you
don't use tissues or paper towel for
this because those do have fibers in
there that will scratch the glass now
that the lens is clean I can twist it
around and plop it down into place in
the metal housing making sure that there
is no glue or glass shards in the
housing itself because if there is that
little
his point will crack the glass when you
press it down into place so make sure
that it's completely smooth inside of
that housing before you push the glass
down and be gentle with it guys you know
it is glass there we go
it's installed it's pretty simple
process you can see here that it focuses
pretty well on my business card as well
as near and far distances if you have
any questions leave them down the
