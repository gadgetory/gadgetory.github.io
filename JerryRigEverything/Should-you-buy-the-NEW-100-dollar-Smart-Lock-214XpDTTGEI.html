a super high tech smart lock.
That was pretty cool and had a lot of promises,
a lot of cool features, but some of the models
had a defect where you could rotate off the
back panel and unlock the lock with just a
small simple screw driver in only a few seconds.
Not a feature you really want to have on something
that's protecting your stuff.
Well Tapplock reached out and said they did
a total redesign of the lock and added a few
more cool features, and invited me to retest
this new version.
This is not a sponsored video.
I bought these 4 locks with my own money.
The real question is, am I taking apart this
smart lock because I actually care what's
inside?
Or is it because I want to use my brand new
18 volt, brushless, deep cup, portable bandsaw?
Let's get started.
[Intro]
I bought 4 of these locks myself, in order
to have a sample size large enough to analyze
properly.
A smart lock is kind of like a regular lock,
except it has a fingerprint scanner.
It can also hold 500 fingerprints and stay
charged for up to a full year.
With the app you can share access to the lock
remotely, and it keeps a history of who's
unlocked the lock.
There's a lot going on.
There's also really nothing wrong with owning
a regular normal style combination lock, but
it is cool to see how the technology is adapting
into different industries.
The main physical problem with the original
Tapplock One that I tested previously was
that the back wasn't latched properly on some
units, and it could just twist off, exposing
easy access to the internals.
This time around I'm using the same super
sticky GoPro mount to grab that circular back
panel and try to rotate it off.
And lucky for Tapplock, these back panels
are all staying attached and in place.
So far, the Tapplock One Plus has better construction
than it's predecessor.
So far, so good.
But we still need to get inside.
And now for the fun part.
[Sawing sounds]
My saw did a really good job of cutting through
the regular zinc alloy metal body, which is
to be expected.
But when my saw reached the hardened stainless
steel shackle, things got way more difficult.
I flipped the lock around to the back side
and started cutting again.
[Sawing sounds]
Getting somewhere.
You can definitely smell the battery that's
in there.
So it looks like a back panel right here,
and even with it cut in half, it's still not
rotating off, which does mean Tapplock has
solved that problem.
It's definitely much more difficult to get
inside of than last time.
Let's see if we can pry this open a little
bit.
Nope.
[Sawing sounds]
Phew.
Finally.
Even after being sliced in half, the lock
is still locked.
You can see the cross section of the fingerprint
scanner going to the motherboard which is
separated by massive amounts of metal from
the internal battery.
The battery itself lasts for 3,500 openings,
or up to a year without it needing to be recharged
again.
And the whole contraption is also ip67 water
resistant, so using it outside in the weather
should be just fine.
It looks like Tapplock has also updated the
internal screws which was another one of my
suggestions in the last video.
These screw heads are like nothing I've ever
seen before.
So even if someone does somehow manage to
get inside, they still can't access anything
without the proprietary hard-to-find screwdriver.
That's a huge improvement.
You can also see the charging port down here
at the bottom with it's rubber sealant to
help keep water out.
That's another perk over the previous design.
Here's a closeup look at the top half of the
lock.
We can see the same proprietary screw holding
the front and back halves together, and how
much metal is involved in the overall construction.
Tapplock has done a much better job this time
around with the redesign.
Nice work.
With the different internals, the screw redesign,
and the added water resistance, the Tapplock
One Plus is what a smart lock should be.
But like with most technology, it is relatively
expensive.
I'll put a link down in the video description
if you want to check the current pricing.
And yeah, thumbs up to Tapplock for acknowledging
a fault, switching up their design, and coming
out with something better.

Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you
around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
