series 3 Apple watch the one with a
special red dot on the side this
particular box contains the most premium
version made from a sapphire screen and
ceramic body and because of these
premium materials the price jumps
considerably compared to the $329 base
model is it worth it and more
importantly is Apple using pure sapphire
on their watch this time around or is it
the same scratch well sapphire they put
on their camera lenses there's literally
only one way to find out let's get
started the presentation inside this box
is rather exquisite there is a definite
premium feel emanating from the
packaging the back of the watch lists
its build materials sapphire and ceramic
pretty premium stuff top-of-the-line
construction I purchased another pure
sapphire crystal T so watch to test as
well and I'll be honest
it hurts me more to scratch the Tissot
than it does the Apple watch let's hope
the Apple watch can hold its own against
my most hardness picks this Mohs
hardness scale has been used to
differentiate between minerals for over
200 years with talc powder being a level
1 and diamonds being the hardest at a
level 10 every mineral has its place on
the scale normal glasses of 5.5 so we
see most smartphone screen scratching at
level 6 since something can only be
scratched by a material harder than
itself sapphire crystal like on one of T
so spree Miam high-end watches scratches
at a level 8 or 9 even HTC managed to
use real sapphire on one of their HTC u
ultra sapphire Edition displays that was
pretty impressive I've been slowly
working my way around the numbers of the
watch face with each corresponding most
pic finally reaching a level 6 this is
normally where we would see regular
glass star scratching sapphire should
still be immune to this pick but we
start seeing permanent marks on the
surface of the Apple watch the pure
sapphire crystal on the T so watch is
still impervious to the scratching I've
even been wearing this watch for a while
now and there are zero blemishes let's
bump it up to a level 7 and see what
happens
and we have yet another line on the
sapphire crystal surface of the $1,300
Apple watch sapphire while a premium
material is not exceptionally rare nor
does it need to be that expensive this
Tisa watch only costs about $300 a $1000
price difference between the two and the
Sapphire on the tee so watch gets no
damage from the level 7 pick in the
exact same lighting it looks pristine
finally let's take it up a notch to
level 8 where Sapphire should normally
start to scratch and here is another
mark on the Apple watch
giving Tissot a turn with the same level
8 pick as where we finally start to get
a reaction damage has been done at a
level 8 right where we would expect
sapphire to be so what does this mean
and did Apple lie to us about their
sapphire being sapphire before we grab
any pitchforks apples not lying
this tool detects heat conductivity in
gemstones sapphire and diamonds being
some of those gems and the display of
this series 3 Apple watch registers as a
gemstone which means that the sapphire
is present the same way that this Tissot
walked registers glass however like on
this iPhone 8 transfers heat differently
and does not register as a gemstone this
means that the Apple watch does have
sapphire in it I tested the lens on my
Galaxy S 8 which is also made from glass
and it has no reading on the diamond
selector tool but the sapphire camera
lens of the iPhone 8 does register so if
the iPhone 8 camera lens and Apple watch
screen are registering as sapphire why
do they scratch at an earlier level than
they should I studied a cross-section of
the camera lens under an electron
microscope and made a whole video about
the subject which I'll link in the video
description of this one I found that the
camera lens is made from aluminum oxide
which is sapphire but has impurities
while the Tissot scan came out as an
aluminum oxide as well but with no
impurity z' so Apple is using sapphire
but in my opinion it's not as pure as it
should be hence the fracturing and the
damaging that happens earlier than it
should checking the ceramic
body shows that it scratches at a level
eight in the bottom corner but no marks
were made with a level six pick in the
top right or seven in the bottom right
so no issues with the ceramic it's
normal in all honesty Apple's version of
sapphire is most likely more scratch
resistant than just regular glass it's
just not as scratch resistant as
sapphire on the tee so watch face or HTC
sapphire screen on the ultra I think the
Apple watch is revolutionary and truly a
fantastic invention legitimately shaping
the future of wearables I'm not saying
don't buy the Apple watch but you might
be better off buying the base version as
it does the same thing and save yourself
a thousand dollars the stainless steel
has sapphire in it as well
that's six hundred dollars just don't
buy it specifically for the sapphire it
did occur to me that the permanent
fractures that appear on the watch could
be from the oleophobic coating that
covers the surface of the screen when
I've done my burn test on the 75
different smartphones on my channel the
flame always removes any oleophobic
coating in the spot that's burning so in
theory if the oleophobic coating is
scratched and then evaporates the mark
should be gone as I remove the flame
from the Apple watch the marks remain
and don't rub off oleophobic or not the
marks are permanent and here is the Tisa
watch one more time in the exact same
lighting and the exact same zoom on my
camera with no markings at level 6 or 7
so what do you guys think about all this
let me know down in the comments and
remember I'm just one guy with one watch
but I have a pretty solid sample size of
scratch phones and watches on my channel
and an Apple sapphire is just well
unique the rubber seems to be legit
though thanks for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
