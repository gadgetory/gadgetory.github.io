and durability testing every single new
smartphone that has come out for the
past couple of years cell phones are
some of the most abused pieces of
technology on the planet and durability
is pretty important today I'm going to
show you which phone is the most durable
phone of 2016 and which phone is the
easiest to repair I will talk about some
of the phones that failed in 2016 as
well let's get started
let's start with the least durable
phones of 2016 I tested about 30 phones
this year and only three of them
completely failed my tests to show me me
five the next fit Robin and the redmi
note 3 hands-down the weakest phone of
2016 is the next bit Robin designed
purely from plastic there is no
structural integrity whatsoever inside
the device the motherboard screws go
directly into plastic instead of metal
like they would on a normal phone keep
in mind that this isn't a bad phone I'm
sure it's great
it just didn't last long enough for me
to try it out now let's talk about the
most durable phone of 2016 this was
actually a really tough choice so many
solid phones this year my personal
favorite the Samsung Galaxy s7 felt
super solid during my bin test but both
sides of the phone are made with glass
and glass does break easily when dropped
unfortunately the ceramic me mix is
literally unscratched ball but once
again the ceramic material is even more
brittle than glass so I have to go with
the HTC 10 as the most solid and
structurally sound phone of 2016 its
metal body and angled corners turn this
phone into a very solid beast but this
also leads us to our next segment the
least repairable phone of 2016 this
award also goes to the HTC 10 not only
is the thin glued shut but there are 14
screws after the glue with 13 different
connectors and a mid frame inside the
phone that makes it a nightmare to
repair the easiest screen repair in 2016
is actually the Google pixel the glass
back of the pixel keeps it from winning
any durability awards but when it comes
to repair ability all you need is some
heat and pop off two little screws and
the screen is set for replacement and
the
best part about it is that you can
replace the screen without touching any
other components inside the phone since
they are protected by a middle separate
layer it's a pretty brilliant and
foolproof design a close runner-up for
the easiest phone to repair is the LG
v20 there is no glue inside of this
phone which is refreshing but you do
have to remove every single component
from the phone before you can swap out
the screen which gives more opportunity
for something to go wrong during the
repair as everything has to be touched
and reconnected currently right now at
the end of 2016 an LG V 20 screen
replacement costs 105 dollars and a
pixel screen replacement cost 135
dollars both of which are about the same
price as an insurance deductible
speaking of design the most innovative
phone of this year is the show-me me mix
with the edge to edge display and
ceramic body this phone is extremely
good-looking and stands out in a very
eye-catching way so huge thumbs up to
show me for taking risks and pushing the
limits of cell phone design the least
innovative phone of 2016 is the iPhone 7
after years of camera optical image
stabilization being implemented in other
smartphones Apple finally catches up and
adds it to their camera on both the 7
and 7 plus but then they go and remove
the headphone jack promising that
wireless headphones are the future but
then even Apple has so many issues
producing the wireless headphones that
they are delayed for the average
consumer until January of 2017 which is
five months after they were announced
I've been using the iPhone 7 plus for
the past two months to give it a fair
chance and well I'm switching back to
Android I'll have my full review posted
in about a week or so so make sure
you're subscribed so you don't miss that
the LG g5 had potential to be innovative
but failed pretty hard when it came to
advertising their phone correctly even
on their website right now they are
still claiming that the LG g5 has a
metal alloy body when clearly it has the
warmth of plastic and a thick layer of
plastic primer surrounding the entire
phone the word alloy is defined as two
or more metals joined together not
plastic covered metal and finally 2016
wouldn't be complete without mentioning
the note 7 it had the potential to be
the best smartphone in the world but
after many explosive recalls two million
no sevens have to be returned to Samsung
every major carrier in the USA is
pushing out an update that will disable
the phone entirely at the end of this
December which means the no 7 will no
longer be able to charge or make phone
calls so if for some crazy reason you
still have one be ready for that I did a
Twitter poll earlier today and 75% of
you guys keep your phones longer than a
year which means durability is pretty
important if you're looking for a phone
on the cheaper end of the spectrum the 1
plus 3 does a really good job
either way 2016 was an amazing and fun
year for phones pretty much no matter
what you buy the phone is going to be
good as long as you stay away from the
phones that are on my shelf of shame
which one is your favorite let me know
down in the comments below and make sure
you're subscribed with your
notifications turned on because I plan
on doing a ton more durability tests and
tear downs in 2017 thanks ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
