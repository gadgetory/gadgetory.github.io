fixing the honor 5x from Huawei I'll
show you how to replace the screen the
charging port and all the different
components inside you will need a size T
three bit for this I will link all of
the parts down in the video description
as well as the tools that you'll need
there are two screws at the bottom these
are the only two screws that you will
need the t3 bit 4 remove the SIM card
trays from the side of the device and
then once those screws and trays that
are out you'll be able to take a pry
tool and pry between the back metal
frame and the screen make sure you do
evenly all around the outside you'll see
all the clasps here in a second here's
the back panel of the phone you can see
a little bit of foam around the back
panel for the battery and for the
fingerprint scanner it is a metal and
plastic mix another nice thing about
Huawei's they put little arrows and all
their metal components you know what
direction is up when you're repairing it
there's one screw at the side for the
battery port and the screen port there's
like little Lego connections where you
can just unsnap them from the
motherboard there's two screws holding
down the little metal bracket for the
extension ribbon cable that goes down to
the charging port unscrew that and
remove it make sure you keep all your
screws organized there are six screws
down here for the plastic bracket remove
those and lift that up this is also the
loudspeaker for the phone there's the
two contact points that just rest on top
of the charging port so it'll get its
signal there's one wire cable also
attached to the charging port and then
the bottom of the extension ribbon cable
now that that snapped off you can set
that off to the side the charging port
itself is glued down to the frame of the
phone you can lift that off on the
backside of the charging port you can
see the microphone that's also there now
for the battery it is interesting there
is one pull tab that will remove the
adhesive from one quarter of the battery
but there's still permanent adhesive on
all the other three corners so it's
interesting that they would have the
pull tab there in the first place lift
that off make sure when you're prying it
out do not damage that screen cable
right there i've unsnapped it from the
motherboard especially if you need to
reuse your screen or if you're just
doing this repair to replace the battery
there's five screws on the top of the
motherboard and then the power button
and volume buttons are plugged in here
to the side you just lift up the back of
the little clasp and then you can slide
out the connector for the volume and
power buttons there's one plastic
bracket up at the top of the phone set
that off to the side keeping your screws
organized on the top of the wire cable
on clips and the motherboard can slide
out of the
it also has a funky little hat just like
the Nexus 6p and then the front-facing
camera can unclasp from the motherboard
just like a little Lego same thing with
the rear facing camera just unsnap that
the top camera the front-facing camera
is a 5 megapixel then the rear camera is
a 13 megapixel you're just going to snap
those back into the motherboard placing
them over the connection and pressing
them gently in a place you'll feel them
click down just like a Lego now here is
the screen of the phone it has the
plastic back then the LCD and then the
glass on top so this is the part that
you'll buy when you crack your screen or
your LCD he'll just have to transfer
over the vibrator and the earpiece to
your new screen and then put them back
into place
luckily for the honor 4x right now the
screens are only about $30 so hopefully
these prices are the same for the honor
5x when they become available I will
link those down in the video description
as soon as they become available I'm
going to go ahead and put the
motherboard back into place snapping
down the screen ribbon cable and the
wire cable onto the bottom of the
motherboard right there and then
plugging in the power and volume buttons
make sure you do this or else the power
button will not function this is the
only communication it has with the
motherboard lock it down into place with
the plastic bit then there's those 5
screws get those back into the
motherboard as well then down here at
the bottom of the phone we're going to
set the charging port into place and
then I'm going to connect the bottom
portion of the extension ribbon cable
and then set the battery down underneath
the fingerprint scanner and then I can
set the extension rivet cable on top you
can see here that I forgot to plug in my
wire cable make sure you do that on your
phone before you set the black plastic
bit down in there's six screws down
there along the bottom and then the top
of the extension ribbon cable needs to
be plugged into the motherboard as well
as the battery get those two screws and
bracket in place and then the one screw
and then this bracket over the battery
connection then I'm going to turn on the
phone to make sure everything's
functioning before I put the back cover
on everything looks good now my back
covers a little bit bent from a bend
test video I did a second ago I will
link that here as well so I'm going to
bend that back into place since metal is
bent it never goes back perfect but I
think I got it pretty close I'm going to
put the screen and the phone back into
the metal housing and then clasp it down
around the outside everything looks like
it's working if any questions leave them
down in the comments make sure to like
if this video helped you and all the
behind the scenes stuff on my Instagram
and Twitter thanks for watching hope to
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
