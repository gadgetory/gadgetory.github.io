down the Samsung gear VR to see what's
inside first off we have this focus knob
on top that will adjust the phone's
distance from your face while you're
wearing it and on the side we'll have
the back button and the touch pad and on
the bottom we have the charging port
that will both power the device and
charge your phone when not in use
the gear VR can also be powered directly
from your phone as well so it does not
need to be plugged in to function the
proximity sensor is in between the two
lenses on the inside and that can tell
when your face is pressed up against the
device this isn't so much of a repair
video because I doubt many replacement
parts will be available for this device
it's more to satisfy my own curiosity of
how this thing works
if replacement parts do become available
you can bet I will link them down in the
video description just like usual let's
open it up there are four screws around
the outside shell hidden by rubber caps
pop those bad boys off and then two more
screws are hidden under this black
plastic sticker when lifting off the
faceplate there is one wire reaching
from the phone microUSB port to the
mainboard so I'll be gentle with that
you can see the focus knob moves each of
these five towers to adjust the phone
distance from your face there are three
screws holding on the plastic protector
over the mainboard
then I will unclip the microUSB ribbon
just like a little Lego now there are 10
screws holding the inner plastic shell
in place some of these screws are
different from the others so I will keep
them all organized as I remove them I'll
also disconnect the touchpad sensor from
the mainboard then the whole plastic
frame and charging port can lift out of
the white shell the circuit board is
adhered to the black plastic but it can
be separated
here is the back button and the ribbon
for the touchpad and the other ribbon is
for the inner proximity sensor I thought
the adjustment system is pretty cool
each of these little gears sit at the
bottom of these little towers and allow
them to raise and lower I guess that's
why they call it the gear VR I am so
funny the lenses are very secure I doubt
they will ever fall out on their own
even if the headset is dropped a few
times the only way to get them out is to
remove this black plastic frame that
holds them in place and then the lens
just comes out of the hole we can
inspect the lens it is made of optical
plastic I got the Samsung gear VR s
little brother here Google cardboard
let's poke his eyes out so you can see
both plastic lenses they have the same
relative curvature but the gear VR is a
bit
bigger overall the build quality of the
VR headset is pretty solid there are
plenty of screws and everything seems
secure time will tell
check the video description for
replacement parts and current pricing on
the gear VR and Google cardboard thanks
