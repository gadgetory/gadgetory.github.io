how to fix and repair almost anything on
the Wii U controller we're going to
start off by taking out the battery it's
underneath two Phillips head screws
underneath the back battery door take
that off and then just unplug the
battery from the main controller
they do sell bigger batteries I'll link
those in the video description below
gives you a whole lot more playtime so
you can check those out and then there's
a bunch of little black plastic tabs
covering all the screw holes right here
and underneath all these little tabs is
a screw that's called a tri wing so you
can take that and unscrew all the little
screws and then the back plastic bit
just pops right up there is a little
plug holding the back plastic part to
the mainboard and so you're just going
to grab that and unplug it
pretty straightforward and then you can
see that all the little buttons so we
got the triggers right here that just
pop up and out same thing with this
other side they're just kind of stuck
down in a little clasp these have to
wiggle free the same thing with these
top buttons the left and the right just
slide down in little grooves and then
right here this is the little
contraption that controls the majority
of the buttons so there's a bunch of
screws holding that in place then you
can see this little ribbon cable you
have to lift up the latch and unlatch it
and so if your buttons stop working most
likely you'll need to replace this guy
right here or just the ribbon cables
depending on what they're selling now
the little stick that you're going to be
playing with these break a lot and so
the whole pad comes up with the circuit
board and just plugs into the main board
that you can see right here so if it
ever stops working or if it gets stuck
or broken just by a little contraption
and plug that in you'll be good to go
now the bottom sync button as well as
the port is plugged in to the main board
as well as has that little ribbon cable
connector
so I'm going to unplug both of those
things and then wiggle it free from the
little white bracket that it's in it's
got the little hooks on the side there
and now that's free and there's four
screws holding on the main board to the
controller so once those are done you
have a few more power cable connections
and ribbon cable connections to undo
lift up the little clasp pull the ribbon
cable out lift up the other clasp pull
that ribbon cable out it's all kinds of
fun and then I'm going to take apart the
other side button control panel I guess
you can call that just so I have more
room to work with you don't necessarily
need to do this if you're just getting
in to replace the screen or something
and then just unplug that other joystick
get rid of a few more little tiny
connections and this one's pretty
important so lift up at two points on
that little latch so you don't break it
if you lift up at one point OPA not be
too much pressure and it might snap it
anyway keep on working with all the
little connections that are attaching
the main board to the controller going
to pull those loose just working my way
around the outside
and now that release is most of the
things attached to the mainboard there's
two sensors that are still attached up
at the top but you need to lift up the
mainboard in order to get to them now
remember what remember the orientation
of the wire as you lift this out so
right now the wire is facing in towards
the board and then on this other side
the Y wire it's still facing the inside
of the board as well so untangle that
and then lift it up from the slot you
can see right here I take apart the
volume slider switch remember that when
you put that into the motherboard it has
to fit on the groove of the little
slider as well otherwise your volume
will stop working and there's the main
board you can see right there the camera
as well on the backside and then right
here you can see the little pad so if
you're going to take that apart to clean
it there's a little notch in the corner
there that aligns where it needs to be
and now for the screen bracket so
there's four Phillips head screws around
the outside of this that you're going to
unscrew and the plastic screen bracket
just keeps the screen in place so once
those screws are undone that will come
loose and you'll be able to pry up the
screen be super careful while you're
doing this and only pry up on the metal
frame of it and don't pull up on the
screen in any way that'll break the LCD
underneath now when you're replacing the
screen it could be one of two things
they might come with the digitizer which
is the outer part or it might just come
with the LCD underneath so you might
need to separate that little contraption
in order to finish the repair but it's
not too bad there's just little clasps
that hold the two sections together now
the buttons are kind of fun remember
that game used to play as a kid or like
the plastic square wouldn't fit in the
circle hole and the circle wouldn't fit
in the square hole is
same thing each of these little buttons
has its own little notch so one button
won't fit in the other buttons hole if
that makes sense it's kind of fun
interesting way to keep all the buttons
in the right spot anyway if you have any
questions be sure to leave them in the
