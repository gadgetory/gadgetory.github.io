know where that went
don't you do less hairspray
harassing mr. hit again
we need an endcap you need the piece
that the end cap screws into you need a
footlong combustion chamber you have to
have the piece that connects the chamber
to the barrel and then my barrel is
going to be you know three three and a
half feet long haven't quite cut it to
size you get the abs cement and a
barbecue igniter the reason I'm using
the ABS is because it's stronger than
PVC when PVC breaks it kind of shatters
into lots of different pieces abs kind
of it doesn't shatter so works better
for the potato gun
you also need two screws that we're
gonna drill in between this this is a
four foot no sorry four inch diameter
pipe so make sure your screws are at
least two and a half inches so they kind
of cross over each other and they're
inside of that it also helps to have
some little screws drilled inside of
here so that when you're pushing things
down in the barrel it doesn't go all the
way through into the chamber so you
stick just like a little screw and so it
sticks out probably about half way
through in there and that just stops
anything from entering the chamber
itself somebody right now is I'm gonna
take some sandpaper and just kind of
rough up the insides from where the glue
is gonna go just so it has a better
sticking power I'm taking this glue
right here and I'm covering from the
outside of this and the inside of that
I'm doing both surface areas then as I
put it in I kind of twist it I'm into
place so I make sure did the glue on
every single part of it okay
all the parts are glued together I let
it sit and dry for a little bit before
we put the screws in through the
combustion chamber
so I have the barbecue uniter I
connected the wires to the bottom and
the side and so now every time I click
this it'll snap across there we're gonna
attach those to the screws on the side
of the gun itself that side and that
side and then this spark will be
transferred across the screws instead so
I have the wires wrapped around the
screw I also put electrical tape all
over the igniter as well so I don't get
zapped and it holds the connections in
place as far as the screws go there to
screw it in over the top just like that
they're pretty close together this kind
of spark there you can also see that
other screw I'm down there where the
barrel changes to the 2-inch that's
what's gonna keep the you know whatever
you're launching the potato of the golf
ball whatever they keep it from coming
inside the combustion chamber there you
have it a potato gun potato launch short
that's short</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
