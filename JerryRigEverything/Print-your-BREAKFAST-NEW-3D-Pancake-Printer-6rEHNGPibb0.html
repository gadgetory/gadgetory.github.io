and being able to prototype and make
stuff out of plastic you know machine
just printing it out for us but what
about food the future is here there is a
3d pancake printer that literally 3d
prints your food and now my buddy Jared
here and we're going to build this
together
all right so this is everything inside
of the box I'm not exactly sure what
everything does yeah this is the griddle
where like the pancakes actually go on
I'm really surprised on how few pieces
there are I mean this can't be that
difficult right I know I'm sure hope
it's not that difficult Conway and then
this should rest right on top of this
other side here right okay so right now
we have the gantry and flakes I'm going
to slide this down to the end which is
actually pretty interesting it's got
this little rubber belt drive right here
and that's what's going to control it so
ever seen a 3d printer it's got it's
different axes and so right here at this
bill is going to bring it back and forth
and then this belt right here is going
to control the actual pancake mix itself
and go left and right that way through
the computations of the system it can
get pancake mix wherever we want it with
whatever artwork we're going to be
printing at the time so I'm going to
slide this all the way back I'm going to
put this over here in the corner and
then I'm going to set the griddle into
place so obviously this is where your
pancake mix is going to go and you see
that there's a few different slots right
here that's going to identify your
printing mode and your standby mode so
we want to make sure that we have that
in the right position and then that just
drops in and then you can change your
different mods here and then this is
your air tube and that just plug them
right there at the top and then it will
print out the phone what's nice about
the pancake bot is that it does come
with an SD card and an SD card slot so
it's a little more high-tech than the
newest macbook from apple so I think
we're done right it still it's all the
way done five pieces went together
really really quick really impressive
that was a lot easier than I thought
so now we need some pancake mix right
and then we'll get some design and we'll
print something
okay what's right
we're going to do the t-rex first you
pull the t-rex yeah alright I said it's
working
something's moving okay we're in a bad
spot there we go
was it going to start burning the t-rex
on the edge what is going on all right
that doesn't Oh freaking need this the
air compressor hose oh it's Berbick Greg
get it on there all right is it working
now we are terrible pancake runners it
does the air pressure definitely makes a
difference though doesn't yeah it is
coming out more if this were on that
probably wouldn't squeak okay maybe
because you have the suction and the
suction would have kept it in that's a
leg right high so I don't dissipate I I
don't think our first print is a success
no no but that's not that's not the
printer process I think it is a leg look
this was supposed to be a leg if we have
this setup right look this is the mouth
right here here I'm going to turn this
down so that we might be burning it so
that's good to know if it starts to burn
too fast then you can just turn down the
heat like for the bigger design to take
longer to print so that'll be good and
now it's filling in
oh hey we can dial in the air pressure
so it looks like we're on low pressure
right now
and if we dial this up oh yeah looking
at two or four now it's actually like
pouring anything and then yeah yeah
alright so there's some years definitely
some dialing in that you have to do to
get the art just right you can increase
the air pressure you can turn up and
down the heat so it cooks slower but yes
you look when the air pressure was low
it was barely filling in but now that we
turned up the air pressure a filled in
solid we just gave our dinosaur cracks
with all we're really I see the
potential though I see potential in this
thing yeah look at that tail do we got a
tail
I'm gonna let you try to flip this one
okay I miss Bachelet it almost looks
like a dinosaur skeleton yes you can
have the pressure turned up all the way
and that's what we are going for yes
skeleton yeah exactly there's nothing
yeah so we have one dinosaur right here
slightly dilapidated we're going to see
if we can make them a friend now that we
kind of know how the system works we're
going to jump in here to the so last
time we did a t-rex I downloaded the
Triceratops file so let's try that one
hitting play now it's working and we're
not drizzling out this time that's good
we got the air hose in place
all right so this is our second attempt
we have our dinosaur buddy of mr. dead
t-rex over there and it looks like you
know I haven't flipped it yet so it's
still in one piece but one thing I would
change that every time this goes back to
rest in the corner it drizzles out a
little bit from the nozzle so if pancake
bot is watching this I would put like
some kind of spill catch on this very
end thing because like as soon as the
machine turns off its going to start
dripping out of that nozzle ready I'm
ready
whoa oh wow that's not that bad that
actually looks pretty cool yeah it does
looks like we had a little bit of
spillage right here lucas de la as we
were thinking that we had to turn down
the heat for the forums because they
were starting to curl a little bit but
it looks like we need a little more heat
for the coloring yeah okay so now we are
going on our third dinosaur we're gonna
reprint the t-rex see if we can get a
little bit better than skeletal over
here we've got to redeem him you know
all right I think we finally figured out
the magic recipe for this we have the
consistency of the pancake batter to
that about of egg nog maybe like a warm
in-and-out milkshake I think that's a
pretty good example - all right but it's
working it's filling in pretty well the
only problem is when we have the heat to
high like it starts to cook and curl up
a little bit on the edges so with the
tail sometimes with the feet right now I
have it turned on low you can also see
over here the horns are starting to lift
up a little bit too
whoa look at that
and that's look sweet look it's got the
eyes on her and everything
that's awesome whoo that's insane
it only took four hours the boner yeah
at least like six different dinosaurs
buried in here like sometimes it was too
thick
that was terrible but we finally won
look at the Hat the consistency of
eggnog that's what it is we get a level
for eggnog batter and then it was like
on like a low heat so it wouldn't curl
up on the edges victorious so we finally
got the design down finally got the
settings where we want it to be but this
is someone else's design so let's go
ahead and try and make one of our own
and see how that goes you go to the
website and get all kinds of different
drawings and stuff like here we have a
dog here we have Sudeikis Saurus a teddy
and Easter Bunny this is also where we
got you know the Tyrannosaurus Rex that
we've been doing so you can download any
one of these or order the pancake bot
program itself and you can draw whatever
you want right there and it'll print
that in pancake mix or we can import a
picture by clicking here
drop the logo in and then you can just
kind of like trace around it wherever
you want and color in the logo has some
pretty thin lines but hopefully it
prints out pretty well I mean I've drawn
in most of the area like I'm missing a
few gaps I wish there's more tools with
this drawing program it's called the
pancake printer but you know we gotta
work with what we have you can do
straight lines really well but I wish
there was more like circle tools and
stuff anyway
file and export for printing and then I
will save it to the SD card as EJ and
it's exporting so I say that it's EJ so
we're going to go to EJ and then we play
and now it's going to make our design
I'm anxious to see how it follows the
pattern you know if they know that the
circle or if it's just going to like
scribble in everywhere well see how it
turns out I mean isn't already yeah
looks like it's working out for you
we'll remember it's also it's printing
it backwards because it's going off of
when we flip it so the J is on the left
and the e is on the right this time
getting that outer layer in yeah nailed
it ha ha ha ha ha Oh maybe it's not good
for legs superfine drawings but like for
kids artwork or we're just normal I work
in general I think it looks pretty cool
I did too as far as 3d printing printing
I think the future is definitely here it
was definitely fun to attempt for the
first time once you get everything
dialed then you get like a good
understanding of where your mix is where
your temperature is and where the
pressure is I think you'll be able to
have a lot of fun with it and you'll be
able to create some pretty cool things
huge thanks to Jared leading it's used
his kitchen I'll put a link for his
channel here he does a lot of family
vlogs with his family and I'll also
include a link for this pancake bot in
the description of this video as well so
take a look at that it's on Amazon and
it's a relatively well price for the
ease of assembly and what you can do
with that I definitely agree it was a
fun project thanks for watching I'll see
you around
but it's my hair okay yeah you're both
of my opponents s occasion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
