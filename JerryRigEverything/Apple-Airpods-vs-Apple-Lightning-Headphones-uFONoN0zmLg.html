of Apple earpods I also have the remains
of what's inside their pods that they
demolished on their own channel and I
don't know about you guys but I would
much rather analyze what's left of the
what's inside air pods and give away my
brand-new set to one of you so stick
around till the end of the video to see
how to win let's get started
the unfortunate thing about the Apple
earpods is that once they've been taken
apart they can never be put back
together again
so I'm glad I don't have to destroy
another pair that would be unnecessary
this is the leftover air pod that what's
inside did not destroy and I can see a
faint scene around the head of the
speaker and that's where I'll start my
attack while the air pods might look
like a glorified q-tip in a dental floss
container there's actually some
interesting technology inside
remember that water-resistant screen
that covers the ports on the iPhone 7
that same type of screen is found here
inside the air pods it lets sound and
air pass through but not liquid it helps
the ear pod stay water-resistant the
proximity sensor ribbon did get torn
completely in half when I ripped off
that outer shell see what I mean by non
repairable and now for the good stuff
this is the actual speaker inside the
air pause the first thing that stands
out to me is the clear speaker cone made
out of smooth flexible rubber like
material let's compare it to the speaker
inside the regular corded headphones
that are included inside every new
iPhone 7 box I would recommend against
applying pressure with the razor blade
in such close proximity to your
fingertips
but just remember I am a professional
the wired earphones are definitely
easier to get inside and I can already
see the difference with the speaker cone
instead of the smooth rubber cone of the
air pods this has more of a folded
plastic feel to it the textured ripples
are noticeably different the cone
material doesn't matter a whole lot
though for a speaker this size the sound
difference between material would be
minimal both materials are water
resistant unlike a paper or cardboard
cone found in some car audio speakers
for a speaker this size but sound
difference between materials would be
minimal underneath that cone though by
something more important the magnet the
regular corded apple headphones have a
copper coil diameter of 7 millimeters
while a coil of the wireless Apple
earpods is 7.5 in die
ammeter this means that the
electromagnet inside the air pot is
slightly larger than the magnet inside
the corded headphones a larger magnet
means a more powerful speaker obviously
the 0.5 millimeter difference is
extremely small and the average person
won't notice any major differences but
it's still interesting to see the copper
coil from the regular iPhone 7
headphones can fit inside the coil from
the air pot so if you're the type of
person that needs every half millimeter
you can get air pods are probably the
headphones for you just for kicks and
giggles I'll open up the shaft of the
air pods this allows the metal charging
tip on the bottom to come loose and the
inner battery to be exposed most
everyone I know who owns these air pods
and uses them says good things about
them so whoever wins the brand-new set
of air pods is going to be lucky indeed
I'll include a gleam link in the
description of this video where you can
enter into the contest I've included
what's inside social media in the
giveaway since without them this free
pair of air paws wouldn't be possible
the air paws do work with Android phones
as well so everyone can enter into the
giveaway hit that thumbs up if you like
saying tech reviewed from the inside and
I'll continue to make videos like this
in the future thanks ton for watching
I'll see you around and if you've made
it this far in the video hit me up with
your favorite color in the comments
lately my favorite color is red</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
