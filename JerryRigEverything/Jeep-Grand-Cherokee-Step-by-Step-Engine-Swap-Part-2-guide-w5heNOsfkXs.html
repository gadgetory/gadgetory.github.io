we took the motor back out on my truck
threw it in here took us probably about
three hours or so to do there was just
two guys me and another guy doing it we
I took off the exhaust pipes on here
because they were cracked so I'm going
to go ahead and put the ones from my
newer engine on it that's got to go pick
up a gasket for it as far as back along
the where it meets up with the
transmission
I suck two bolts in or connects up with
the transmission I looked two of the
bolts in to the heavy-duty once and then
we tried to put the engine mounts back
in but apparently the engine mounts are
a different size on the motor that they
gave us so I had to switch the mounts on
the motor with the mounts off of my old
motor to hook up with the engine mount
in my Jeep did a switching around here
and there I did end up taking them both
of the mounds off actually to be able to
get the first part in everything else
about it one thing I did notice though
is that I'm going to have to remove this
pump as well looks like it's for like
the radiator and stuff cuz the fan and
everything on this motor is in different
places than on the other one but it
should be pretty simple to swap out
everything else from here on out looks
like it's just kind of plug and play and
hopefully it all works
okay so back on word in the engine again
basically all the brackets that were on
my old engine need to be switched over
to this one apparently they changed even
though the block is still the same
around the 92 the the brackets all
changed between the 92 and 95 luckily
all the bolts are still in the same spot
though so I'm moving over this bracket
the other one I got to take off this the
water pump and put on the other one from
the other from the other motor I got all
the bolts back around the bell housing
that was a pain especially the one on
the bottom the left side where there's
like a some kind of some kind of cable
going through there it's almost
impossible to get that bracket off what
else I think everything else is about
the same once I get these brackets on
and get my old exhaust and air intake
manifold back on and replacing this
gasket here I also be replacing the
gasket underneath the with a water pump
everything else should be should be the
same now once I get those things on and
then it's just all plug-and-play from
there to take off the water pump on Jeep
Cherokee motor it's underneath this
pulley right here so you can see the top
of the engine kind of lines up take off
these these bolts right here to get off
the pulley itself and then here's a
motor I've already taken out once the
pulley comes off and we've got four
bolts holding it in two three four then
it just pops right off usually there is
a gasket that covers the inside of this
you can just get that thing it's like
three bucks or any part store put the
gasket on and then just go ahead and
reseal the water pump back down on top
of that it's a quick little update we
got the star in I haven't gotten a wired
up yet
pretty straightforward the longer bolt
goes in bottom top the top bolt is the
shorter one um
after that we got the and the manifold
in getting that in was pretty simple as
well as make sure you have a new gasket
my old one was a pretty shot scraped it
out really well getting the old gasket
all off of it after that just kind of
screwed it on there's four bolts up at
the top I'm in the bottom bolts I
believe there's three of them one along
the bottom and it's just plug and
playing so you got those four right here
and this one just kind of you know
remembering where you put them the first
time around I disconnected my the gas
where the gas goes in for the injectors
I disconnected excitement want to work
with this connection right here I don't
want to make it so I had to redo that
whole cable so I just reconnected that
it's all pretty straightforward you know
right now I'm going to make sure that
these bolts are all the way on for the
the engine mount and then I'm got to do
the front half of the engine okay so
this time around I got a yeah power
steering fluid pump I just follow the
bolts in place they're still pretty
loose so I can adjust it back and forth
when I do the serpentine belt I also
when the old engine blew run it through
Iran a bunch of oil came up through the
air filter so I went in and clean all
that out most of it anyway really hard
to get oil and stuff out of the filter
that's been sitting there for two years
anyway everything else should be should
be pretty good
a quick update I got the alternator on
be careful with bolts in the back don't
tighten them down super tight those
bolts do come loose the little
connectors can't take a whole lot of
torque got that on yesterday down there
on the starter I got that all wired up
got all the spark plug is tightened in
and the distributor cap the cables are
tightened on to them we just click them
in that's it for now there we go
bring them very roll
so finally got everything up in place
just going to talk about a few things
everything pretty much went back in the
same way that it came out once I got the
the brackets all back in place the AC
compressor obviously I haven't recharged
this yes the AC is not going to work the
fans and everything will be fine with
the radiator fluid it helps if instead
of just filling the coolant you know the
overflow and inside the radiator if you
fill up a little bit inside the engine
as well it's like once you get that
bottom hose on just pour some radiator
fluid down into the top just so it
doesn't have like air pockets and stuff
inside mine's just been slowly cycling
through so I have to fill that up let it
seep in fill it up let it seep in so
there's multiple ways of doing that the
two big things as well is that the the
whole engine needs to be grounded so
there's a ground wire that you got to
attach then there's also there's a on
each on the wiring connections there's a
few places where you can attach a ground
wire I just attached mine to the body of
the of the Jeep and that was sufficient
ground for the whole thing that works
like when I went to go start at the very
first time and the starter wouldn't go
because it wasn't grounded I was pretty
excited there was only a simple solution
like that to get the whole thing running
and the last thing that gave me some
issues was the fan so down inside of
there you can kind of see that there's
four bolts that hold on that fan
connector the bolts that come out of
that are double-sided so there's one
that screws into the engine itself like
a little it's a little pulley thing and
then the other one that the nut attaches
to to hold everything together
so I didn't have it attached tight
enough the first time around us with a
fan wiggled itself off and destroyed my
serpentine belt
luckily the serpentine belt something
like 25 bucks so it's was pretty easy to
replace just uh you know something that
can be avoided other than I had to
refill the steering fluid a little bit
of that came out and then just make sure
all the wires are in the same place and
really everything works great the check
engine lights not even on pretty stoked
that it turned out as well as it did
