different and slightly more serious
there's been a lot of talk in the news
lately about something called a bump
stock now where I live in Utah shooting
guns is a fairly recreational activity I
would say Texas Utah and Idaho have
plenty of guns distributed between the
general population and it's kind of like
a hobby thing people go out to shoot
guns it's even a great date idea and
I've owned plenty of guns in my life and
my family and it's just kind of like
part of the custom and part of the
culture but lately there's been
something in the news called a bump
stock and how it attaches to a
semi-automatic rifle now I've never used
a bump stock before but I am curious as
to how easy it is to install what's it
made of and what it can actually do so
yesterday I went out and bought an ar-15
this particular setup is about 1,500
bucks I walked into a local sports store
picked out the gun I wanted they did a
background checked and I walked out of
there so the thing about an ar-15 is
that it's pretty customizable you can
swap out the barrels you can swap out
the lowers you can put scopes on the
rails you can swap out the back stock
and this stock part is what we're gonna
be talking about today because the bump
stock replaces the handle of the gun and
the stock of the gun and allows you to
fire at an automatic rate with a
semi-automatic weapon I'll explain what
those mean in a second so while I'm
pretty familiar with guns I am NOT a gun
expert by any means
I literally just bought this gun
yesterday and this video is purely to
just see what a bump stock is capable of
doing after major tragedies like the one
in Las Vegas or the one in Texas people
call for stricter legislation on guns in
general and particular these bump stocks
but only by learning about them and
knowing what they're capable of can we
make the most educated decision I was
able to purchase a bump stock of my own
these are available online from multiple
websites and local classifieds this one
cost me about $400 so we're gonna
install it on the ar-15 right now and
see what it can do so right now we're
gonna shoot this several times right now
the bump stock is not in place and we're
gonna see how many rounds we can get off
without the help of a bump stock so this
gun is semi-automatic so every time I
pull the trigger there's going to be a
bullet leaving out the end of the
chamber so I'm gonna cock back the gun
that puts a bullet into the chamber
safety is now off and I'm ready to fire
I was relatively quick so this is a 40
round clip and so every time I pull the
trigger 40 times I can lose all the ammo
inside of that clip and that was pretty
fast you can get a lot of shots off in a
pretty short amount of time so now let's
install the bump stock and as a noob
I've never shot with the bump stock
before we'll see if it's possible to
shoot faster than it is with just a
straight trigger
so how bump stock work is actually
incredibly simple the gun slides around
inside of the stock and uses the recoil
of the gun to shoot more bullets
this piece is pretty important I'm a
right-handed shooter so I use my right
hand to pull the trigger and so I'm
going to take this piece of plastic
slide it onto the gun and it blocks the
trigger on one side so when I grab the
gun I rest my finger on that piece of
plastic on the far side and then using
the gun I can pull forward with this
hand my finger connects with the trigger
pulls it and then the gun will bounce
back and forth and each time it hits my
finger it'll shoot another round and
since the gun is doing it all
automatically it can pull the trigger
faster than I can pull the trigger
hence the full auto function of the bump
stop so these are the bullets right here
we have a five five six and it's just a
whole box of these things these things
are about 40 cents apiece so I also got
these clips these clips hold 40 rounds
they're about $20 each and I can take
little bullets and just pop them into
the top and then the whole clip just
slides into the gun when you're ready to
shoot
this is my first time shooting with the
bump stock so we're gonna see how it
goes I got the clip in place the stock
is functional safety is off we're loaded
and let's see how this works
that was that was faster than I expected
okay so that shot much faster than I
anticipated
obviously and each time I shoot one of
these clips by the way it's about 16
American dollars 16 US dollars so it's a
lot of ammo going very very quickly what
we're gonna do right now is I'm gonna do
it one more time but this time we're
gonna shoot it in slow motion using a
galaxy s 8 and you can pay attention to
the stock and the trigger and watch how
the gun is recoiling inside of the bump
stock so we can get a better idea of how
it works so watch here as my hand pulls
forward on the barrel of the gun this
brings the trigger up to my stationary
trigger finger my finger never moves but
still connects with the trigger due to
the forward motion of the gun the gunman
fires and the recoil brings the gun back
to my stationary finger over and over
causing the trigger to be pulled again
and again very quickly until I run out
of ammo accuracy is severely compromised
but accuracy isn't really the point of
full auto here's the semi-auto firing
rate one more time my finger was pulling
the trigger manually and here it is
again with the currently fully legal
buff stock installed on the ar-15
I'll be pretty honest I'm pretty blown
away with how well the bump stock works
and how much Emma can throw out of the
gun as fast as I did I was not expecting
that now as far as all the controversy
goes I'm not gonna jump into that on
this channel personally I think that you
know guns are a great hobby but not
everyone in the world is sane and they
can turn something good and fun into
something absolutely terrible
not just with guns but with cars
vehicles anything can be turned into
something bad like always you're more
than welcome to comment about this stuff
in the comment section right below this
video but make sure to keep it a
conversation and not an argument let's
keep it constructive and productive so
even though this video was quite a bit
different than what I usually do on this
channel I think it was interesting and
useful knowledge is power and now we
know what bump stocks are capable of
what they can do and we can make more
educated decisions on whether they
should be banned or just kept in
existence let me know what you think
down in the comments and keep it
constructive and not destructive we're
here for the conversation thanks a ton
for watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
