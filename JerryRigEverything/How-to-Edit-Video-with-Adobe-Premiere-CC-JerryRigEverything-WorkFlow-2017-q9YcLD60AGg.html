bit different I'm going to show you the
entire process start to finish of how I
edit one of my YouTube videos now since
this is the entire process the video is
going to be rather long and the audio on
this is just going to be live I'm not
going to go back through and cut or edit
anything on this video just because of
the extreme length so what you've seen
so far during this process as me taking
the raw clips from my camera which is
the Panasonic gh4 that I used to film
most of my cell phone durability tests
and my tear downs and I'm going to take
those clips and drop them on to my
desktop now I personally have two SSDs
inside of my computer those are two
different hard drives I have my
operating system and my program which is
Adobe Premiere CC on one and then I have
all of my footage and files on the other
SSD so that the SSDs don't have to all
be recording off of one hard drive it
distributes the load across both of them
evenly and you know Adobe is supposed to
run smoother that way anyway so now that
I have the files transferred from my SD
card to my SSD or my hard drive I'm
going to take them and just drag them
and drop them into Premiere I imagine
I've never used Final Cut Pro or any of
the other professional editing
software's so everything that I go off
of today is just going to be strictly
from Premiere now all the files are
dropped into Premiere and I can take
them and if I right-click on any one of
these files I can create a new sequence
this means that it's going to set the
format of Adobe Premiere to the exact
same size and frame rate as the files
that I shot with my camera
normally I shoot in 4k at 30 frames per
second so that's just going to build the
sequence or the format around that one
nice thing about Adobe Premiere is that
I can adjust any of these windows and
rearrange them how I want so I'm going
to take my timeline and drop that down
into the bottom right hand corner and
that's where I usually keep all of my
clips that's all so you know where the
storyline is going to be in that bottom
timeline
so if I double-click on one of these
little boxes in the bottom left-hand
corner these are all the clips that I
just dragged in it's going to pull one
of the clips into a source window which
just shows me what's inside of that clip
this is like the preview window of each
individual clip that I can take and I
can take and choose which portions of
the clip I want before it goes into my
actual program window which is going to
be more of the final copy so the video
that I'm gonna be working on today is
from the LG and it's a pretty easy phone
to take apart mostly held together with
screws so I figured it would be a good
video a good simple video to use as part
of this instructional how I edit my
videos video it's kind of like the
inception of video editing here the mic
that I'm recording on is a samsung
meteor mic I'm going to talk about that
more later in the video as I explain how
I do my voiceovers so what I'm doing
right now is I have my first clip in my
source monitor and I'm choosing which
parts of that clip are important
obviously I have about 25 minutes worth
of footage with the LG g5 and most
people don't want to sit down and watch
a 25 minute video on how to fix it so I
take all of the important bits which
usually ends up being about five minutes
and condense it and condense it down
into one short little video that more
people are interested in watching the
most important hotkeys that I use during
this program are the JKL I and period
keys and the O key so they're all over
there on your right hand side of the
keyboard so the J is like a reverse the
K is a stop and the Elza forward and I
use those while navigating inside of the
source monitor and program monitor and
on the timeline so I can choose which
clip and then the I sets an end point
and the O sets an out point and I can
use the period to drop that down into my
timeline so it's important to use as
many hotkeys as possible because that
really does speed up your video editing
and I'll kind of mentioned a few of the
other hotkeys that I use as I do this
video editing video so what I'm doing
right now is I have a few little
templates set up during when I you know
set arrows and everything to my videos
because you know people don't want to
watch me take out 20 different screws it
is one
see where the screws are at and if they
really want to pause the video they can
I'm all about you know streamlining
everything and make everything as simple
as possible on my youtube channel ain't
nobody got time to watch super long
videos so I have this template set of
four arrows I am just these arrows I got
from a font I think it's called
wing-dings
three or webdings three you can see that
on the right hand side of the screen
there if you want you can make this
video fullscreen it'll be a lot easier
to tell what's going on since you know
there's a lot of little details all over
the place I had counted the screws on
this phone during the teardown and I'm
just taking each of these little arrows
and lining them up with the holes of
where the screws came from and this is
important obviously for the viewers in
the future we're going to repair this
phone I'm making this video showing how
I edit my videos to kind of give back to
the YouTube community I'm not super you
know nervous about sharing all of my
secrets online because you know I really
doubt there's many people interested in
making cell phone repair videos on the
level that I make them but when I look
back as I started my youtube career
videos like this helped me out a ton
I remember watching a few videos exactly
like this one from Ben Brown and also
from one of the editors over at Linus
tech tips
they made the full walkthrough of how
they edit their videos and I learned a
ton from them so if I can help out and
give back a little bit back to the
community you know I'm all about that I
will link both Ben Browns video and the
Linus tech tips video that I mentioned
earlier down in the video description
and I will try to keep on top of the
comments below this video as well but
you know I do get a lot of comments on
my channel so things are kind of falling
behind at this point I'm a one-man band
as far as editing and comments and all
of my other stuff goes so it's hard to
keep on top of all the little stuff but
either way hopefully this helps and if
you have any tips for me also leave
those in the comments I like how the
comments section usually turns into like
a community forum for people who are
attempting the same projects YouTube is
a fantastic place for do-it-yourself
projects I will speed up some of the
more boring parts of this video like now
that you've seen me organize quite a few
Aeros we're going to skip on to the next
part basically I'm just you know using
my mouse to drag these little arrows
around and the font is the wing-dings or
the webdings 3 now that's done I can
drag that little title page over onto my
timeline and line it up where you know
generally where I want it to be later in
the video right now I'm just doing a
really really rough edit taking the
important bits that I want to use in my
final video and laying them all out I
think I have about 30 minutes worth of
raw footage I'm taking my mouse and just
kind of scrubbing through the initial
timeline right there in my source
monitor because that gives me an idea of
what's inside of the clip then I can
just use those hotkeys again the JKL to
play pause and reverse or rewind and the
in and the out key I and the O and the
period to drop it down to the timeline
again now normally I have four computer
monitors set up on my desk so I have you
know the source monitor on another
screen so I have more room on my main
monitor for the program monitor which is
kind of like the preview and the
timeline you know things spread out it
was just a little more organized for me
it's how my mind works
but since I'm doing this screen
recording I'm taking everything and
putting it in one window it's a little
bit you know tighter spaced but you can
make this video a full screen if you
want to see like little details and the
words and everything that I'm using so
once again still taking my mouse and
just grabbing that little blue icon and
scrubbing through the footage to see
what I have to work with usually I edit
my videos right after I do the teardown
so I you know it's fresh in my mind and
I know kind of have I kind of have a
general idea of what I want to say
during the tear down video so at this
point you can see me trying to remove
the back obviously people don't want to
watch the many failed attempts at me
opening a phone and usually I'm one of
the first people on the planet to ever
open up one of these devices so there's
not often that I get to watch someone
else do it first sometimes you know on
YouTube there is people who get to the
phone before I do especially if it's one
like the LG g5 and I have other phones
that I'm working on in the mean time so
I will use other videos to watch and get
tips on how to
of them and I've talked to I fix it and
a couple of the other guys you know we
have a pretty tight-knit community as
far as cell phone repair goes and you
know they all do the same thing if I get
a video out before I fix it they watch
mine if they get a video up for me i
watch theirs it's just you know
community we're all friends and we're
all trying to accomplish the same thing
which is to help people repair their
devices
that's how communities work I chose the
LGV 20 to make this video on because
it's so simple and easy and you can get
a basic idea of how I edit my videos
usually the timeline is much more
complex than this especially if I'm
working on an iPhone or a samsung phone
which has a lot more screws and you know
there's a whole different process using
like a heat gun to separate that back
glass panel from the phone so luckily
the LGV 20 came out and I'm able to use
that phone the simple phone to make this
video with so for this clip I finally
figured out how to get removed the back
and pop off these two top pieces and
bottom pieces and so I realize that
that's the important part of the clip
that I need in my source monitor so hit
the I key and the O key to do the in and
the out points and that marks it on the
source monitor timeline that you can see
there and I do the period to drop it
down into my timeline you can also take
your mouse and grab you know C in the
center part of the source monitor you
can grab just the video or just the
audio from that clip and drag those and
drop those down into your timeline as
well so still just watching from my
source monitor finding the important
bits and we're just going to do you know
a rough cut and drop those all down into
my timeline it's a pretty monotonous
process you know this is I've made over
400 videos now on my youtube channel so
I do you know phones once you've been
inside one you've been inside pretty
much all of them they're all relatively
similar just a few minor variances here
and there with each new model anyway so
I finished all of those clips on my
first little tiny clip down there in the
bottom left or you know keep everything
organized is like my little library the
camera that I use the Panasonic gh4 only
lets you record in four gigabyte files
so you know a video like this where it's
16 gigabytes there's quite a few files
and plus I'll stop and start the camera
a couple times during the video you know
to answer a text or
because I'm bored or if I need to you
know see something up close or research
something I'll stop I'll have a few
extra clips to work with so when I
finish one clip I'll double click on the
other one which opens it up in my source
monitor and then I can do the same thing
scrub with my mouse find the important
parts and use the I the oh the JK and
the L to navigate you can use your mouse
because you can see all of those keys
down there at the bottom of the source
monitor you know the stop the play and
you can use those the only problem is
when you're using your mouse a whole lot
you're slowing down and you're wasting
time because you know transferring your
hand from your mouse to your keyboard or
clicking on things just you know takes
longer and you want to streamline the
edits as much as possible especially
with YouTube when you're trying to
create content daily you know like a
vlogger or any type of content like that
it's just the least time the least
amount of time you can spend in front of
a computer the better honestly editing
video is the worst part of being a
youtuber it's so time consuming and you
know it's just it's just not the most
fun publishing content is fun creating
the content is fun editing the content
is not as fun so you can see while
you're watching the source monitor
sometimes I'll reach up and adjust the
focus of my camera because my camera is
not autofocus I want to be able to
choose what's in focus at any time with
my lens that I'm using it's the Sigma 18
to 35 I'll link that down in the video
description and the gh4 has something
really cool called focus peaking and I
talked a little bit about that in my
studio set up to where of 2016 I will
also link that in the video description
and all of that extra you know that
footage where I'm adjusting needs to be
cut out I am pretty lucky doing these
cell phone repair videos that all of my
lighting remains constant in the same
and so there's not a whole lot of like
color grading or lighting the screens
that I end up doing all of that is done
in camera I have my white balance set
just with the computer inside of the
camera internally Adobe Premiere does
have an effects panel where you can get
in and do some color correction
I'll just if my white balance seems off
I can just jump into the fast color
corrector use the eyedropper and click
on the background
automatically correct that to white but
since my camera does a pretty good job
with the white balance I don't need to
use that very often inside of the
effects panel as well if you're doing
color correction you can also brighten
it sharpen it you know there's anything
that you can do with your Instagram you
can also do with Adobe Premiere change
things to black and white luckily with
my line of work I don't need to work
with that stuff too much which helps
streamline the process so the screen
record that I'm doing right now is on my
desktop PC which is a pretty powerful
machine and I'll show you the specs of
that at the end as we do the render
section but my laptop which is actually
what I'm doing this voiceover and this
particular video on of how to edit isn't
as powerful because it's a laptop and so
if I need to I can jump in on the source
panel and the program panel which is the
center and the top right and I can drop
those resolutions down from full to half
so I can edit 4k footage on my laptop
but since my laptop screen is 1080p it
doesn't need to be displaying 4k because
that's just not possible so if I drop it
down to half it uses less of my
computer's resources to display the
image as I'm editing so keep that in
mind if your computer is not the most
powerful you can still work with
powerful footage using Adobe Premiere
just drop the resolution down while
you're working with it and then when you
render it you can render it out at full
quality not a problem the lower you drop
your resolution the less choppy the
playback will be so now you can see I am
reassembling the phone I did a couple
videos way back when I started you know
my first 30 or 40 videos some of them I
didn't put back together again and
people started complaining about that a
little bit because you know reassembling
the phone is half the process so I make
sure to include that part of the video
in all of my videos you know in the
future because my whole premise about
being a youtuber is to make life easier
for other people when they're attempting
repairs of their own I'm pretty I'm an
environmentally friendly guy I enjoy you
know not I enjoyed not wasting things
and so when people throw away a phone
that still has value or that they could
have sold for money like that kind of
stresses me out a little bit inside and
so it's important you know the easier I
may
the repair for people the more likely
they are to do it themselves which you
know makes the world a better place in
general less phones end up in landfills
global warming slows down basically by
repairing your cell phone you stop
global warming it's as simple as that so
you saw me do right there as I took that
same arrow title that I used before and
I went to the top left corner of that
title panel and I did new title based
off of current title which basically
just duplicated those arrows so I didn't
have to redo them all as dragged and
drop that back into my timeline with the
new title so basically I have two
identical title screens and I can just
them independently of each other without
you know disrupting the first one it
just makes life a lot easier and it's a
little trick that you can use when you
have titles that are similar to each
other and you don't want to create the
new one from scratch you can either
choose a template or you can do that
button I just showed you which is create
a new title based off of the current
title each time I finish scrubbing
through a clip and getting the pieces
that I need I can just drop down into
that bottom project window where all of
my little clips are and I can just
double click and then start a new clip
in the source window and repeat the same
process over and over again until all of
my clips are used up and I've gotten all
the important footage that I need out of
each of them so right now it looks like
I have successfully put the phone back
together again and the phone is
functioning that's always a good sign so
I'm going to take my screen and I'm
going to work on the I don't normally do
this but in this particular video I
lined up the phone and the tools to make
a thumbnail because it's always hard to
get an interesting thumbnail from a
teardown video sometimes with my
durability videos I can get a good thumb
or you know like an explosion video
where I was working with air bags or
something there's always a good
thumbnail you can use with that but in
this thumbnail for this particular video
I staged it which you know is obviously
fine I'll make another video about how I
edit my thumbnails later you know making
the background white and everything in
Photoshop this particular video I'm just
going to be talking about video editing
so I did take a screenshot with adobe
premiere of that tile right there my
source monitor and I save that in the
same folder and the same SSD that all my
program
files are on to kind of keep that
organized so the rough edit is now
complete I have all of the little tiny
clips that I want from my you know
footage I have about 30 minutes worth of
footage and I've taken all the important
bits out of that and stuck them into my
timeline and during this whole time
during you know the teardown itself and
this rough edit I've had these ideas
coming into my mind of what I want to
say during the actual video how I want
to explain things any stupid jokes that
come to my mind you know I don't
actually we Matt for the most part
during my during my voiceover so I have
this little script that I set up in this
video the LG g5 I didn't have a whole
lot of ideas coming to me during the
process so I'm pretty much going to
write the script from scratch as you see
it right now so I'm going to rewatch the
video from the beginning and just
explain you know word-for-word what is
going on during the video this goes back
once again to just making the videos as
short and to the point as possible when
I first started making youtube videos I
would go and you know I was Nate I was
repairing cell phones before I was a
youtuber and I would go and watch a
YouTube video on how to repair a certain
cell phone you know back when there was
you know eight screws and it was
relatively simple to take apart and
these videos would be like 30 minutes
long and 40 minutes long and I'd have to
like you know scroll through them and
like find the most important parts and
these people would be talking about
their lives forever and ever and ever
and it's like whoa dude I don't want to
see your dog I just want to see how to
repair this cell phone so I make it a
point in my videos to be as to the point
and concise as possible it no one wants
to hear about my life they just want to
see you know their phone fixed and I
feel like that's pretty important for
you know any do-it-yourself video so by
creating the script there's not a whole
lot of you know um Xan repeating myself
over and over again kind of like what
I'm doing right now with this particular
voiceover because I don't really have a
script I'm just kind of explaining
things as I go along so I hope you have
your popcorn or your cereal or whatever
you're doing because
yeah anyway back to the important stuff
in some professions there's always this
like general idea that you don't want to
share your secrets with the rest of the
world because you know hurt your chances
of success but like really with YouTube
it's the exact opposite you actually get
more from the system as you share more
with the system it would always bug me
when I would go to college and see you
know I'd be paying thousands and
thousands of dollars to go to my college
classes I actually graduated in business
but I would go to class and my teachers
would pull up a YouTube video to explain
the subject that I was paying them to be
teaching me and you know obviously the
YouTube video explained it better than
they could and so it was good for them
to use you know the best resource
available but it was annoying because
you know I can go find that video myself
I'm pretty good at googling things it's
just like why am i paying my professors
thousands of dollars to be teaching
something that I can learn for free on
YouTube so I'm pretty stoked to be part
of this super awesome free system which
is YouTube that benefits the world on so
many levels the more I can contribute
the more I get back from it so it's a
win-win for everybody
plus I've literally talked to about a
thousand people about starting their own
YouTube channels and maybe one or two
has actually started one and been
serious about it most people don't
realize how much work and effort goes
into making YouTube videos and how much
time it takes out of their day and so
they'll quit you know after the first
couple videos but in reality being a
youtuber is actually a pretty awesome
job and you really do make time for what
you want most in life so if you want to
become a youtuber you can you just have
to spend the time and you know the hours
to do it and there is an incredible
amount of time and hours required most
of them is sitting here editing videos
like this so a couple more things I can
mention as we're finishing up writing
this script the camera mount that I use
the tripod I mentioned it in my 2016 set
up to her video which I will link in the
video description is actually a tripod
that the legs extend and there's no
bracket holding the legs together so I
can make them as wide as possible
and the camera of the Panasonic gh4 that
I'm using is actually attached
underneath the tripod so the legs are
spread and the tripods facing straight
down onto my desk the camera is facing
straight down out of my desk the white
background is G is just a white piece of
paper and it's a wooden desk that I'm
working on
so that'll won't bend or flex as I'm
using my screwdriver or prying on the
screen at all which you know was a
problem I had when I use a plastic desk
in the past you know one of those
Walmart desks that you get those flexed
and they made the video quality not as
good I also used a camera with autofocus
previously and that to a would get
annoying for people watching the video
as well it would be constantly going in
now to focus basically I don't improve
my video quality until I start getting
complaints about different things and
I'll mention that as I go along I didn't
go to school for video editing or
anything all of this stuff I learned on
my own or by watching youtube videos you
know like VIN Browns or the line is tech
tips or any of Adobe's free videos that
they have online as well basically if
you have any question about anything and
you know how to word it you can find the
answer to it a lot of learning how to do
video editing is learning the vernacular
you know which words like what scrubbing
means what editing all the terminology
used for editing so I'll try to use
those same words as I do this video so
now that I've completely watched the
video and I've written the script for
the entire video I'm going to go through
and read it just one more time obviously
speed is an issue in trying to get these
videos up I don't want to spend too much
time you know reworking something over
and over and over again it's better to
get content out that's slightly
imperfect then spend an extraordinary
amount of hours trying to make it
perfect time is money and you don't want
to fret over the little tiny things plus
my voice over isn't going to be perfect
at the end anyway the script is more of
just like a general idea of what I'm
going to say it's also important for the
closed captions because part of Google
system you know how it scans your videos
it obviously the Google algorithm has no
idea what is inside a video so it's
really really important that you try to
do closed captions whenever possible not
only it does not only to
to help the people who can't hear they
can read your video but it also helps
Google's algorithm so it knows what's
inside of the video and it can rank it
accordingly so if you want your videos
to rank higher and do the CC or the
closed captions for your video some of
my videos are shot live so I don't have
a script written up for it not my tear
downs are my durability test but like
other videos like when I worked with
Brian's mobile one the guy who got me
started with YouTube four years ago and
we exploded some air bags that video was
shot live so in that case when I don't
have a script I'll have my older sister
transcribe the video for me after it's
done and so she's actually transcribing
this video because I don't have a script
for this one either and I apologize
profusely for it being so long and
boring but huge shout-out to her even
though she doesn't repair cellphones she
is fantastic at transcribing and I
appreciate it because it helps people
who can't hear like I mentioned before
and it helps the video rank higher
because Google actually knows what's
inside of it due to those subtitles so
now that I have proof read my script and
made any slight adjustments that I want
I'm going to jump into the actual
voiceover itself now the mic that I use
is called the Samson meteor mic and I
will link that down in the video
description this is the same mic that I
use to record the voiceover on the LG g5
video as well as the sound that you're
hearing right now on this how to edit a
video I usually have four monitors
spread out in front of me so I have the
script on one monitor
I'll have the source monitor on a
different screen and I'll have you know
my main video editing on a third screen
and then I'll have like a research
screen on my fourth monitor so
everything you know spread out in front
of me does help considerably but as you
can see it also works just fine on one
screen it's just more consolidated so
you don't need a huge studio to get
started when I started my youtube
channel I was recording everything with
a cell phone which is like the old Evo
4G way back in the day that only
recorded at 7:20 and then I was editing
on a laptop so my first 50 videos or so
our shot with a cellphone and edited
with the laptop not even now you know I
have a nicer laptop but still some of my
videos are shot with a cell phone I see
so many youtubers who are like oh I need
this nice camera before I can get
started or I need a really nice computer
before I get started and like those are
the dreams you know it obviously
everyone who wants to start a business
wants these nice things in order to run
their business but these nice things are
not a prerequisite to running your
business you need content before you
need things to run the YouTube channel
you should start your YouTube channel
with what you have and then let your
YouTube channel pay for the nicer
equipment once you've proved that you
have content worth watching then you can
spend it on the extra toys ok so jumping
into the voice-over itself I'm going to
mute that first track just by hitting a
little M button and then I'm going to
hit the microphone button which will
start the recording I usually have this
script on a different screen but for the
purposes of this video so you can see
everything I'm going to drop it down in
front of the program monitor and the
Adobe program so you can see what's
going on so I'm reading through the
script right now just word for word and
then adding anything that I you know
come up with off the top of my head as
I'm reading it it's not super important
to line this up with the video just yet
I'll be doing that all with the editing
process after the recording is done
while recording all of this there is
going to be quite a few mistakes but I
can always edit those out later on when
I streamline the video and drop it down
you can see that the video currently is
about five and a half minutes and I'm
going to shorten it down quite a bit
after I get my voiceover finished one
thing that I like to do is I don't want
to destroy any of the original footage
so you see that the original footage has
you know it's video timeline and it has
its audio timeline I'm leaving that
audio timeline there just in case I want
to use any of the screwdriver sounds or
the unclipping sounds or any of the
sounds you know of the phone breaking
during my durability tests so I'll leave
that intact and I make sure to do the
voice-over you know the recording in
that second audio stream
so that the original audio doesn't get
damaged it's always nice to keep the
original never destroy something that
you might need later especially since
it's so easy to keep it intact the first
time around okay so you can see that the
voiceover is now done you can see all
the little audio peaks and the spaces
between the audios where I've taken a
breath or I've paused for a second
during the voiceover them and I'm going
to edit all of these out to streamline
things so I'm just going to do I'm going
to press the C button which pulls out my
razor tool and I can just clip the audio
wherever I want to and then drag and
drop it to delete segments as I jump in
so for this video I am going to use my
original audio so I'm going to jump into
the audio track mixer and go to my first
track and drop that down a few decibels
usually about 4 to 6 depending on the
video that way the video from my camera
that Panasonic gh4 is going to be less
prominent than the audio from my Samsung
the voice over might so people can still
hear the sound of the screwdriver and
the phone moving around but my voice
over will be way more prominent so I'm
still using this C button which is the
cut or the razor tool and I'm using that
to cut out all of these extra spaces
remember YouTube has a very very short
attention span usually about 3 to 5
minutes for my type of video so I'm
going to cut out all the extra junk so
they don't have to sit through that
watch time is also very important for
YouTube's algorithm lately so if a
person is watching my video and they
only watch 20% of it YouTube is going to
think my videos not very important so if
I make my videos short and consolidated
and important to watch the whole thing
people end up watching 60 or 70% and a
good watch time you know is obviously
greater than 50 so the more I can get
people watching my video the better
that's why I only leave in the important
things during the rough edit I took out
all the parts that I thought I might
need for the final edit and now that
we're doing the final edit since the
voice-over is done I can shorten the
video down quite a bit so this is the
intro section of my video so I'm going
to shorten it to the clips that I want
just right clicking and then click
you can also use the Delete key to
delete anything you want now this is the
intro I'm going to do a video
specifically on intros here in the next
week or so on how I make a video intro
like this and you can't do for your
YouTube videos in the future this one's
at 1080p so I'm going to right click and
scale to frame so it fills up the entire
4k sequence that I set at the beginning
of this video now if I hit alt I can
drag the video side of the clip down and
leave the audio intact because the audio
actually goes longer than what I want
the video to be a little bit of black
screen that I got rid of there I'm also
going to drop down the audio of that
intro because some people were
complaining that it was too loud drop it
down for decibels or so and you can do
that on the actual audio clip itself
just by dragging down or on the left
side in the effects panel as well you
can drag that and I'll show you how to
do that in a minute so now this part of
it is going to be a lot of rewatching
the clips that I'm editing just to make
sure that things flow smoothly and I
have the clips in place that I want I'm
going to be scrolling in and out of the
timeline with my scroll wheel but you
can also use the plus and minus buttons
up on the top of your keyboard above the
letters this is different than the
numpad those keys the plus and minus
don't work you have to use the plus and
minus above the keyboard itself also
during this voiceover you can hear the
sound that my lips make when I talk I
had someone complain about that as well
and so I usually clip those out you know
during sentences you know what happens
to every youtuber during it you know
when you're recording on a mic even on
the super nice mics I'm using a
relatively nice mic I believe it cost
like 360 50 I don't know cost like 60
bucks maybe so you know it's not a
thousand dollar mic but you know it
sounds pretty good
even the thousand dollar mics don't cut
out all of the unwanted sounds so you
can see a little peak right there so I'm
just going to drag the clip over and
hide that peak and hide the breath that
I took right there as well people lose
interest when you take breaths so I'm
going to get rid of all of the
unnecessary ones
and these parts are ones where I
stuttered or said something wrong or I
didn't like the tone of my voice when I
said it so I just reset it and then I
can click and drag and just erase the
clip that I messed up on
if you've ever wondered why youtubers
always say you know leave a comment or
like and subscribe all that stuff it's
because the viewers don't remember to do
those things so right now I'm explaining
that they can find the toolkits in the
video description because in the video
description you know there's a lot of
ways youtubers make money you know
whether it's through affiliate marketing
or selling their own products I send
people to the description so they can
find the products that I'm using in my
videos and at the end of the video will
always tell them to LIKE and subscribe
where I'll mention it throughout the
video so they don't forgive you know
even me I'm a professional youtuber and
I don't like the videos that I enjoy on
YouTube unless I get reminded sometimes
so it's always good practice to slip it
in there not excessively but when it
makes sense so to streamline this video
a lot of the times I'll just cut the
clips like I used with that C button I
can also right-click and adjust the
speed of the clip so right click speed
duration sometimes I'll do one hundred
and fifty percent sometimes two hundred
percent rarely will I go up above that
because it starts to get choppy with the
footage and so you know one hundred
fifty two hundred percent is about as
fast as you know it looks good on my
computer screen and in my opinion so you
can also right-click in between clips
and do a ripple delete which just gets
rid of the blank space between clips and
also on the timeline I have that little
snap icon clicked which means that as
I'm dragging dropping these clips it'll
automatically snap to the clip that's
closest to it so it won't you know
overwrite it or leave a little bit of
black space or blank space in between
them it's always annoying when you
render your final clip and you find like
two seconds of blank space in between
two clips and you have to go redo the
whole thing
because the snap wasn't enabled and the
clips were butted right up next to each
other so there's two ways of listening I
can just hit that play button and play
it and listen to it naturally or I can
speed it up with that L button then when
I press the L button the faster it will
play forward the more I press the J
button the platt the faster it'll play
backward or I can also just click that
little blue I
on and drag it is called scrubbing
through the timeline and I can listen to
it there's you know there's a ton of
preferences and stuff you can set up
like if you go to edit and preferences
you can get rid of the sound that it
makes while you're scrubbing but I
actually really enjoy that I can hear it
very quickly and get all the information
that I need it's also very important to
brand your videos at the end of this
video I will show that I drop a water
market at the bottom left corner of
jerry-rigged everything it's weird but I
have a lot of people stealing my
teardown videos now I'm not sure why
someone you know would want to steal a
very boring teardown technical video
like this but it happens a lot and so
with that watermark it's very easy for
people to notice that it's my video and
come and tell me because I don't always
see them first I usually have you know
someone shout out to me on Twitter or
send me an email saying you know hey
this guy stole your video and YouTube is
incredibly good about giving credit to
the person who posted the video first
so I'll get in there and file a
copyright claim and is usually taken
down within one or two hours not a big
deal at all the filing copyright claim
only takes a couple minutes you know
hardly three minutes
you just have to link the offending
video and your own video and you can
even file multiple complaints in the
same complaint form so huge shout out to
YouTube for making that an easy process
for creators like myself I really
appreciate that so there's probably a
hotkey for changing the speed duration I
don't use it I just find right clicking
and then going up but for the speed
duration is you know fast enough for me
and the speed duration boxer is also a
clip that if you're changing the speed
of multiple Clips it'll automatically
shrink them all together not leaving
that black space in between them all so
you just have to find what works best
for you and your workflow whether you
want to use you know a ton of hotkeys or
if a mouse works just kind of like how
I'm doing it on my computer
like I mentioned before I didn't go to
school for any of this stuff this is all
stuff that I've learned you know from
trial and error or from YouTube or
Adobe's free videos on how to you know
create content
you can really learn anything you want
on YouTube is pretty incredible so for
this clip I did throw in a political
Donald Trump joke you know which happens
every now and then general Trump is an
easy guy to make fun of and so I just
grabbed a little PNG file off of Google
Image Search and then I can drop that
down into my playlist just like you
would with a title take that title image
and drag and drop it right down into my
timeline there's a whole huge
controversy over like the fair use and
stuff like that I haven't had any
problems with using still images like
that I just make sure that you know if
there is a watermark or branding on the
picture I leave that intact when I post
it into my video or you know if the
website has specifically stated that
they want credit for their picture or if
they want or if I don't want to use
their picture at all obviously respect
that but as long as you're not claiming
someone's creation as your own fair use
usually is pretty fair so I'm still
using my mouse wheel a ton while I'm
editing this timeline I'll he'll done
that Alt key and scroll in with my mouse
and scroll out with my mouse to focus on
these little tiny intricate details that
I'm adjusting when I drag and drop that
timeline to eliminate a breath I'm
usually just eliminating like Oh split
second or two now these don't seem
important if I'm just talking about them
but in a video where a youtubers
attention span is so short these are
very very important and that's why
you'll see some of the most popular
youtubers doing these jump cuts to you
know where they cut out all of their
breaths to keep people's attention
longer
one of the best ways to learn how to
YouTube is just to you know not copy the
guys who are on top not copy them as in
like their channel and you know their
videos word for word but their style
like their editing you know figure out
how they do their cuts and their zooms
and you know all of these different
little tiny things that most people
wouldn't notice unless you're in the
actual business and I'll explain some of
that as we go along so you can see that
I'm using my mouse to start and stop the
timeline a lot and I'm used you dragging
it all along the screen and this is
actually probably pretty bad practice
you know it's slowing me down the more I
use my mouse if I was able to use more
keyboard shortcuts it would speed things
up considerably now if you jump it up
into the edit you can scroll all the way
down and see a list of shortcuts that
adobe has and I would recommend learning
those as you're beginning and using them
because it will speed you up later on I
wish I used more keyboard shortcuts and
I'll probably try to focus on using them
more in the future but this video right
here is just showing how I you know edit
now I could technically be using the
spacebar button to start and stop the
video as it's playing I think it's
because I'm you know just using my mouse
to drag and drop so many Clips my mouse
is already you know in motion so I use
that just to start and stop them as well
as I'm dragging and cutting things all
over the place
the way I got my timeline to look the
way it is you see the audio graphs and
you can see the peaks and the low points
I just hovered my mouse over that left
side and use my scroll wheel to expand
that particular section of the timeline
whether it's the audio or the video if
you expand it you can see more detail
and this helps a lot when I'm using that
audio timeline to splice different
mistakes that I've made together like
let's say I start saying a sentence and
I stop halfway through and repeat that
same sentence over again I can take the
correct part of that and splice in the
corrected part of that into the correct
part and it makes it easier when I can
see the actual timeline and what the
features look like in the audio visually
so earlier in this video I created that
second title using the same title as the
first one that just kind of duplicated
it and allowed me to create a second
image of it so I can edit the second one
and it won't change anything on the
first title and that'll allow me to get
the screw locations matched up to where
I was as I reassemble the phone since
it's not going to be the exact same
position as it was when I took the phone
apart so I need the arrows to be in a
different spot anyway so I'm dragging
that second title into place during this
second rough edit of the footage I
usually do the first edit which you saw
where I get all the important bits out
the second edit which I go to I match it
to the voiceover then the third edit is
when I do like my zoom ins and my crops
and I you know make sure everything is
streamlined and that didn't miss
anything and then I usually watch it
through a couple more times just to make
sure that there's no mistakes and then
render it and I'll walk you through all
that stuff right now and as you can see
you know I make a lot of mistakes when I
do my first voiceover for the video
whether I don't like my you know
intonation as I'm recording or if
there's just different mistakes
different mispronunciations there's a
lot of editing that goes into the
voice-over itself and you know that adds
you know a lot of time to the actual
video editing process if I was able to
just record it live and post the video
it would take a lot less time than it
does but one of the reasons that I am
the most watched and viewed cell phone
repair channel on the Internet is
because I can take a lot of information
and consolidate it into a couple minutes
so these extra couple hours that I spend
editing my videos you know they pay off
in the long run so for this final clip
of the voice-over I notice this myself
as I was watching it on my phone one
time is that if I just stopped the audio
it'll make kind of like a popping noise
and if it doesn't fade off its its
abrupt and people notice it so I can set
a keyframe right after the audio stops
and then I can drop the audio
gradually with a second keyframe at the
end of the clip and you can set the
keyframes as you saw in my video just by
clicking that little icon and then
moving the timeline a little bit farther
on and setting the second keyframe and
that's how you do it there what I'm
doing right now is I'm setting the in
card screen so the in card is something
that YouTube has recently started and it
only goes for the last 20 seconds of the
video so I'm going to make my endcard
screen just those last 20 seconds I
added the it's free part because a lot
of people on YouTube don't know that
subscribing to a channel is free
especially someone who's only coming to
YouTube to learn how to fix their phone
they're obviously not on YouTube a whole
lot you know not usually sometimes they
are but they'll think that oh if I hit
that subscribe button is going to charge
me like a monthly fee or whatever I
found that I did get a large increase in
subscribers once I started mentioning in
the video that it doesn't cost anything
to subscribe so that's why I do that and
then I also do the shout-out you know
with the Instagram snapchat and Twitter
if I didn't mention you know hey follow
me
I wouldn't have any followers over there
on Instagram snapchat and Twitter
because people just you know don't do
anything or don't realize that you want
it unless you tell them specifically
that you want it communication is really
important I find that my subscribers and
my followers are directly related to how
many times I tell them to follow me and
subscribe so it is important now I did
have a screen preset a template preset
for that title this is my watermark in
the corner you can set the opacity of
this watermark to whatever you want
since my screen is white and my
watermark is white and there is no
border around the text I leave my
opacity at 100% because it just blends
right into the white background anyway
it's not obstructive and it's not too
large but it is definitely there so
people can find my video if it's ever
stolen and come and tell me about it
which I super super appreciate so I
locked that top bar you can see the
video timeline up there I locked that so
I can click and adjust anything below
that because if I click on the pro
Grahame monitor its going to only select
the one screen that's on the top the top
layer of it which is the watermark and
you know I'm mostly going to be
adjusting the video and I don't want to
touch the watermark so since it's locked
I can accomplish that so in this
particular run through the video I'm
going to adjust the volume so right
there there was something in my main
audio footage from my Panasonic gh4 that
I didn't want so I just clipped it and
then drop the audio down all the way so
it's out and people can't hear it
anymore I'm also going to be going
through this footage and zooming in on
things that I want to focus on or draw
attention to or show one thing I learned
from the behind the scenes channel of
Devin Supertramp is that you want to
show something in a way that people
haven't seen before that makes it
interesting to them
that's what keeps people around and so I
will zoom in on things because normally
people don't see things that close up as
they would with a 4k camera also you see
right here that I'm doing just a super
super quick zoom in on something and
you'll notice that it logic a lot of
huge youtubers do this as well when they
want to emphasize something that they're
saying they'll crop in on themselves
just ever so slightly so I'll click on
the frame and then go over to my left
side on the master panel there where
it's suggesting the clip and I can
adjust the scale so if I'm doing just
like a general zoom in i'll usually jump
in you know like to 125 or so but if i'm
going to do a massive zoom in on
something that I need to show
specifically for a repair i can go all
the way to 3 or 400 percent since i am
working with 4k footage here zooming in
super far with for kake footage you
don't lose very much image quality which
is awesome and one of the main reasons
why I have a 4k camera in the first
place is purely for that zoom feature
most people don't have 4k monitors to
watch things on but anyone can
appreciate a good zoom without that
catching so after I've zoom in I can
double click on the monitor and since I
have that top watermark locked it's not
going to move
and I can move just a screen underneath
it or the layer underneath it is better
said still using my alt button and my
mouse to scroll in to the timeline so I
can see those little intricate details
and the timeline sound that I'm zooming
in on looks like my joke is placed
correctly along the side and the most
important component and scrubbed through
it a couple more times just to make sure
my headphone jack would be like having a
president a lot of planning goes into
these jokes
so I zoomed in about 300% on that one
and the image quality is still pretty
darn good a lot of these second third
and fourth run-throughs is just a lot of
watching to make sure that the timing is
correct between the voiceover that I did
and the original footage because you
know that's what video editing is if you
want to move the effects from one clip
to another like let's say I've cut a
clip and I've zoomed in on half of the
clip but I want to zoom in and arrange
the other half of the clip the same way
but I left the cut there in the center
you can just copy the attributes and
then paste the attributes to the other
one or any of the other clips on the
timeline that you need to so right click
copy and then right click paste
attributes and that'll you know change
the speed of the clip as well as you
know the crop of the clip and the zoom
of the clip any of the attributes that
had changed on the first one will then
copy over to the rest of the clips I'll
go to that new place I fake it that's a
good way to not have to change each clip
individually now I'm going into that
second title screen where I you know
just duplicated the first arrow screen
and I'm making sure all these arrows are
lined up back to keeping people
interested in your video you know using
those subtle crops you'll find that a
lot of big youtubers use it when they're
you know making a joke or when they want
to emphasize something I notice mkbhd
usually does it a couple times during
his videos it's super super subtle so
you won't notice it unless you're
actually paying attention to it but as
you watch his videos watch for that
it'll be showing him just talking and
then it'll zoom in for just a couple
seconds then zoom back out just you know
a quarter of an inch or so but it'll
happen and that keeps you interested
subconsciously
go robbing hairdryers and little ladies
open is filling up like you would a
Samsung those are much more difficult
for their funny like you so we are
reaching the end of my video you can see
the end card up there with the Instagram
snapchat and Twitter icons those are all
PNG files which means they have a clear
background which is nice also side note
if you use that snapchat icon on your
snapchat will actually direct you
straight to my snapchat so it's
specifically designed for my my snapchat
so now that I've done the third
walkthrough which is just kind of you
know taking all of the little different
clips and setting those you know doing
the zooms and making sure that it all
flows smoothly I'll usually watch it you
know a couple more times just to make
sure that there's no other mistakes or
errors and everything is the way that I
want it to be and then I can move into
the actual exporting of the file and
uploading it to YouTube which is a whole
new ballgame all by itself it is always
a good idea to save your project a ton
of times as you're you know working on
it also set your auto saves do you know
every 15 or 20 minutes just in case
something bad happens to you during a
project okay so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to export this right now I'm
going to click on the little file name
right there little part in blue and then
I can save it as whatever I want to this
is how you get your video you know
stitch together into a viewable format
for YouTube so I'm just going to name it
the LGB 20 tear down I think I called
this the LG g5 a couple times during
this video I will LGV 20 is what I meant
to say and so I'm going to save it as
that and then as far as the export
settings goes I'm going to do the h.264
which is what YouTube prefers and this
matched source high bitrate crap is a
big mistake on Adobe's part because this
high bit rate is only rendering it at 10
megabits per second which is completely
way too low for what YouTube uses so I'm
going to take this and adjust it up
because my camera is shooting at 4k 100
megabits
second and this is just something I
pulled off of Google's website talking
about what bitrate your footage should
be as you upload it so if you're doing
1080p you should be at 8 megabits a
second or you know 12 if you're using
those higher frame rates and if you're
doing 4k there's no way you should ever
upload something at 10 megabits per
second you need it to be you know I the
minimum that I would ever do is 50 but
since my camera is doing 100 you know I
might as well render it at that the way
that the h.264 is like encoded though
it'll end up being about 80 megabits per
second and that's just how h.264
converts the image into h.264 and I'll
probably make a video about that in the
future but it is very important so
rendering at maximum depth is talking
about the color whether it's 8-bit or 10
bit most monitors can only do 8-bit so
you don't need to worry about the 10 bit
or rendering at maximum depth and then
the maximum quality or maximum render
quality is talking about blending frames
together and that's important if you're
doing a lot of special effects but since
I don't do a lot of special effects I'm
going to leave that unchecked so yeah I
think that hits all of the exporting
settings when I though I learned about
bitrate and stuff when I was doing my
Nexus 6p video and a lot of people are
complaining that they couldn't see the
Nexus 6p logo on the back of the phone
when they were watching a 720p or lower
and that's because of YouTube's
compression since I uploaded that at 10
megabits per second that particular
camera I was using was 50 megabits a
second I was losing out on a bunch of
that quality and YouTube was just
crushing the video at 10 megabits per
second people weren't able to see the
detail anymore unless they were watching
at 1080p which is extremely frustrating
so from then on I made sure to use the
higher bitrate on every single one of my
videos and so if you want your videos to
look crisp or clear use the higher
bitrate when exporting at h.264 so my
computer at home is a beast this desktop
because I'm rendering it that higher
bitrate it's using less of my CPU during
a render if I was using a low bitrate my
computer CPU would be
thinking a lot more about the
transcoding process I'm not sure why it
does this this is something that adobe
you know has their own issues with but
you know it is still pretty fast and I
usually use the Adobe Media encoder
instead of using Adobe Premiere to
encode it and that just frees up the
Adobe Premiere so I can use that when
I'm setting up my thumbnail I can do my
screenshots and everything Devin
Supertramp has some good behind the
scenes stuff and the line is tech tips
video that I mentioned earlier also is
fantastic as well as Ben Brown has to
how I edit my videos and I'll link all
of those at the end of this video and
you know if you have any tips for me
also leave those in the comments and you
know because that will help out other
people as well not only myself and
YouTube is a fantastic platform for
sharing tips and tricks and and that's
the way you know education is going you
can learn everything you could possibly
want to for free online and that's the
