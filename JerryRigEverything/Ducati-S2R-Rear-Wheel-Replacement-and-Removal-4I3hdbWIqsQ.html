have this metal clip cap this washer
right here and then you have another
sorry that's not right here and there
another washer inside of this wheel and
we're going to have to break loose in
just a second and as far as the exhaust
goes with my bike before I can slide the
tire off I need to replace or need to
remove on the exhaust pipes so I'm going
to do this nut here and then this allen
bolt here in this animal here I've
already taken those off so now this
should be loose enough to slip off of
the exhaust
so we've worked with this bad way back
together when I take some grease and
kind of get some grease on this back
axle just kind of put a thin layer all
the way around it not too thick because
a lot of it will scrape off when I put
the tire on anyway
so now we're going to take this right
here and stick it on first in this guy
we're going to tighten it down all the
way now we got to get it on far enough
so that is tight and holds the wheel
straight and then we also have to be
able to put on this cotter pin all the
way through so it sticks is oh yeah
so this little pin there's a little hole
right inside of there that this needs to
attach onto it goes thread through
anyway it's on there so I'll put a
listen on the video description of
everything that you need to do this like
the The Stand the ratchet size for this
the video the tires tires are really
cheap in the video in the on Amazon so
I'll post a link for those in view of
the back tire in place the exhaust back
on me
everything's good to go anyway if you
have any questions make sure to leave
them in the comments don't forget to
subscribe and like if this video helped
you thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
