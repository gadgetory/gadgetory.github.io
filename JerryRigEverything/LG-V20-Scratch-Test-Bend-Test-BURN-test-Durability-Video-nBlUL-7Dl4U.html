of the LG family the LG V 20 the LG v10
past my durability test last year with
flying colors it was probably one of the
most durable phones of 2015 so let's
find out if the LG v 20 lives up to the
same legacy refreshingly the LG v 20
comes with a removable battery flagships
tend to be shying away from user
replaceable batteries lately so I'm glad
to see LG stick with their usual theme
the back panel has its own eject button
and the battery slides in then the phone
is ready to rock the phone does come
with its own pre-installed screen
protector but I'll take that off before
I begin my scratch test I have a set of
mineral pics that tell me where the
screen falls on Mohs scale of hardness
plastic scratches in the three range
glass normally scratches at the five or
six range and the harder minerals like
sapphire will scratch at an eight or
nine this phone is perfectly on par with
the normal tempered glass scratching at
a level 6 and a deeper scratch at a
level 7 the glass will not be marked up
by keys or coins when sitting inside
your purse or pocket remember this is a
very big phone it is the exact same size
as my iPhone 7 plus that I am trying out
for a few weeks
normally I'm an Android guy but we'll
see how this iPhone performs as my daily
driver my review video will be coming
out later this month back to the view 20
the bottom and top sections of the phone
are pure plastic it is not primer or
paint it is just regular old plastic
just like with the v10 from last year
the speaker grille is metal and all of
the buttons are metal as well so at
least those have the premium feel to
them metal buttons won't fall out with
wear and tear like older plastic buttons
would so that's a plus checking the back
of the phone down by the USBC charging
port it is also plastic but if we jump
up to the back battery door it is solid
metal you can hear the sound difference
at scratching the plastic and metal
makes let's mosey on up to the
fingerprint scanner it also has a little
protective film over the top to protect
it from scratching I'll remove this and
well you know scratch it
luckily even after being scratched to
oblivion the fingerprint scanner still
functions 100% at the time so as long as
the scratches are superficial on the
scanner it will continue to recognize
your fee
print the back metal of the phone can be
scuffed up by keys and coins though the
iPhone 7 tends to hide these marks a
little bit better so maybe a protective
case is still a good option with the v20
now the camera lens has a little screen
protector on it and I would recommend
leaving this in place while you own your
phone and let me show you why the camera
lens is made of glass so it will not
scratch easily I can check to see if it
is sapphire though with the same level 7
pic that I used on the front screen the
level 7 pic does leave a mark so we know
it's not pure sapphire but with that
small abrasion from my pic the lens
shatters on its own let's watch it again
in slow motion I foresee this being a
problem down the road with the LGV 20
since a small abrasion can weaken the
glass considerably I recommend leaving
that little screen protector over the
camera lens because that will keep the
abrasions to a minimum or even having a
case with any kind of lip will help
protect that large protruding camera
lens out of the back so that is never
rubbing up against anything like it is
inside of your pocket or when you set it
on a table the burn test the LG v10
lasted about 6 seconds before the pixels
went black and turned off and the IPS
LCD of the v20 lasted the exact same
time so let's give this magically
recovering screen a thumbs up and now
you know that you'll have 6 seconds to
save your phone screen if you drop it in
a campfire since that happens so often
the screen is cool to the touch within
seconds onto the bin test I've tested
over 40 phones now and most of them
survived only a few have catastrophic ly
broken you can check out my shelf of
shame playlist for those durability
failures the LG v10 passed with flying
colors last year this year when bent
from the back the LG v 20 flexes more
than the v10 did but it still does not
break so I'll flip it over and try
bending from the other side the back
panel pops off followed by the battery
but the phone still works when I turn it
back on
without the structural support from the
back panel or the battery the V 20 flex
is quite a bit but it does not
catastrophic Lee snap which is what we
are looking for while I don't recommend
it this phone is probably safe to sit on
it can handle the forest of a gentle
bend without giving up the ghost and
it's not permanently kink like the
iPhone 6 the LG v10 is definitely the
more durable one in the V family so if
you're going for Pierce
drink stick with that one those
stainless steel rails were durable but
the LGV 20 does pass my durability test
the biggest issue you will find with the
LGV 20 is scratching and shattering the
camera lens but any kind of case will
add enough of a lip to keep it protected
and you can leave that protective film
on as well since it doesn't actually
cover the camera part of the large lens
so it's not a deal breaker by any means
my Twitter followers tomorrow will know
the results of the Google pixel test
before the video goes live on youtube so
head over to my Twitter @zacksjerryrig
to be one of the cool kids if you
enjoyed seeing this tech reviewed from
the inside hit that subscribe button it
is totally free and you'll be the first
to know what a phone is made of before
you buy it yourself thanks for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
