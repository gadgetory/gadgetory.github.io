right there on the end have any extra 30
ounces of gas on there give me about
another 20 miles of distance on my bike
if I ever need it only cost about 20
bucks and then another seven or eight
bucks for the little mount thing this
mount can hold up to 300 pounds so I
have an extra couple pounds of fuel on
there I don't think will be a problem
for it I'll show you how to mount that
in just a second
I think it looks pretty good matches the
bike pretty well I've seen a couple
different styles of this there's a guy
who has two of these fuel bottles
mounted up underneath but it was more of
like the sv650 type where the back goes
up and there's more room if I would have
mounted this underneath my tire would
have been scraping on it so I took it
off to the side just like that anyways
pretty darn secure alright so this is
what it looks like without the plastics
on the bike so I got my three eights
with the 16 thread size right here mine
was an inch and a quarter long so it fit
right through the middle frame then I
have a locking washer right here and it
fits right into a little contraption and
the whole thing is super sturdy just not
moving at all just moving with the bike
and then under here I bought another
bolt like this that's a little bit
longer
this one is an m6 1 by 50 that tightens
it down long enough so it'll stick
through and give me more room to work
with
holds the bottom super tight
is in your new bolt here for the frame
and a new bolt on the other side to
clamp it shut so this is what little
connector looks like it's got the nut on
top and it's got this little adjuster
screw right here this thing is rated to
hold 300 pounds it's got a little rubber
under liner down here that grips the
tank pretty securely you need one that's
two and a half inches to grip that 30
ounce fuel tank
