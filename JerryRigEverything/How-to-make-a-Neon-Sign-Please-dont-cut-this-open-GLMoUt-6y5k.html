so I decided to get a Christmas present
for Dan and Lincoln I'm a little bit
late but I think they'll forgive me when
they see what we've made I talked these
guys into letting me film a little bit
about how neon signs are made and I
think you'll enjoy the process let's get
started so neon signs are all over the
place lighting up cities lighting up
exit signs letting up open signs it's
hard to walk around without seeing a
neon sign they've been around for about
a hundred years started over in Paris at
the Paris Auto Show in about 1910 neon
is a rare gas present in the air all
around us and is separated from the air
around us by a liquification and then
pulling it out of that liquid kind of
like how the king of random was getting
liquid nitrogen out of the air in his
basement remember that video I made but
before we get into the gas part of the
signs let's talk about the glass tubing
now the glass tubing comes in all
different shapes sizes and colors the
inside of the tube is coated with a
powder the powder can be any color we
got red we got blue yellow orange but
the coloring of the tube doesn't
necessarily signify what color the lamp
is gonna be when the gas is actually
inside it's an interesting process with
a lot of chemistry and it's an art form
so to make this sign for what's inside
we started off with a singular piece of
glass tube and glass when warmed up gets
soft and malleable you can see it kind
of drooping down here in the video and
we take that piece of glass tube set it
on a piece of paper and line it up in
the finish shape we only have a couple
seconds to do this because as the glass
cools down it hardens and will be in
that shape permanently now obviously
this was the easiest Bend and probably
the only one I could master since I'm
not an expert at creating neon signs to
make the tighter bins we have to go to
something called
a crossfire with a lot more you know
flame in the middle and we fold the
glass tubing in something called a
double back which makes the tighter
corners for the inner letters of the
what's inside sign once the glass tubing
is bent two electrodes are placed in
either side which kind of completes a
circuit electricity needs to bounce
around inside of the tubing in order to
ignite or light the gas that's inside of
it we take it over to the manifold which
successfully pulls all of the regular
air out of the glass tubing and inserts
argon one of the gases that exists
in the air around us but in very small
amounts one cool thing with the
electrodes on either side of the glass
tubing is that they needed to be heated
up in order to get rid of any impurities
or imperfections on the metal itself so
the inside of the contraption can burn
cleanly remember throughout this process
were being very careful not to damage
anything because glass is glass and
glass can break after the glass is
warmed up and the burnin is complete we
can inject a very small amount of argon
into the vacuum that we created inside
of the tubing remember this small ball
of mercury we're gonna come back to this
later you can see that the natural
burning color of the argon is kind of
like a pinkish color almost it's a
smooth red obviously this parenthesis
from the Watson side sign is still
connected to the vacuum system so we'll
take the hand torch and put it all
around the small glass tubing and
because of the vacuum inside it
naturally wants to pinch itself shut as
it warms up successfully keeping the
argon inside of the glass tubing and
allowing us to remove it from the vacuum
machine the manifold will let it burn
for a minute to make sure the tubes good
and there's no small leaks make sure
everything's functional then we'll turn
it off let it cool down for a second and
we'll take the small ball of mercury in
that little glass bubble and slowly tip
it into the tube itself the reaction
between the silver mercury and the kind
of pinkish argon is what turns the tube
lighting white and you can see the color
change as the mercury drop drips into
the entire tube we have the electrode on
one din burning the bluish white and the
electrode on the other end burning pink
because the mercury hasn't gotten there
yet
once the mercury has touched both sides
and everything is burning clean and
white we can tip it off and remove that
last little niblet of glass from the
parentheses then we can cover both ends
in a small piece of rubber and mount it
to the back plate of where it's going to
live permanently there's something
called a transformer on the back of the
back plate that allows electricity to
flow through each of the connections
inside each letter each letter has two
electrodes completing a circuit inside
of each of the glass formations one
interesting fact is it has little glass
pieces to separate it from the back
plate right now the what's inside logo
is mounted on plastic but if it was
mounted on metal it would need like an
insulator between the electrified glass
and the metal plate so these plastic
standoffs with the copper wiring keeping
everything in place is what gives it
that insulation the cool thing with all
of these colors is that depending on the
powder coating on the outside of the
tube and the electricity flowing through
it depends on what color we get and how
bright it is you can see we have a 6,500
white right here and a 4500 color
temperature white over here basically
anything is possible
and finally when everything is complete
we have a finished what's inside logo
right here and I think it turned out
pretty sweet and I hope Dan and Lincoln
aren't too mad at me for missing
Christmas and giving it to am a little
bit late I've learned that creating neon
signs is not just chemistry but it's
like an art form there are so many
variables that go into the shaping of
the glass as well as the gas and the
mercury and the different elements that
go into coloring the electricity even
I've learned a lot today if you have any
questions leave them down in the
comments and I'll try to answer them I'm
pretty excited the way it turned out
thanks for coming along with us huge
thanks to the rainbow neon sign company
here in Salt Lake City for helping me
out with this sign they've been around
since 1945 making neon signs for quite a
while they know a lot more than I do
about this stuff I'll put a link for
their website down in the video
description if you have any questions
for them
I hope what's inside likes their neon
sign thanks ton for watching and we'll
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
