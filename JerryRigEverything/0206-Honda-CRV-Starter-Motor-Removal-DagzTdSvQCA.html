going to replacing the starter motor the
starter motor is actually underneath the
intake manifold so I'm going to do is
I'm going to pop these two bolts off
I'll tell you what size they are in a
second remove the manifold and then get
underneath and take out the starter
motor let's do it
first things first I'm going to remove
the battery taking off those two
terminals there and popping it out so I
can have more room to work as well as
nothing will short out when I'm taking
wires off and stuff these little guys
are ten millimeters just pop them out
and that little plastic shroud comes off
so I'm going to start by removing this
for the air filters the hose that goes
from the intake manifold to the air
filter box so there's a little plug
right here that is too disconnected and
then there's a tube that plugged in
right below that on to a little spout
that is pulled off now I'm going to
loosen up this Philips head screw right
here as well as this Philips head screw
right there where my finger is and that
will release the clamps that hold this
hose down so I'm going to pull that out
and detach it from the intake manifold
we're removing this black segment right
here is what the ultimate goal is now
I'm going to work on getting everything
that's attached to this metal part right
here disconnected so it looks like
there's a bolt down there on the side
that holds this cable in I've got a plug
here hose here plug there disconnect
that another plug down here at the
bottom and then that should give that
should get rid of all the attachments
attached to that and then I can unstart
bolting the black part of the manifold
there's two hoses down there at the
bottom that need to be disconnected as
well ones right there that you can see
and then the other ones directly behind
it that I haven't disconnected yet so
they get my shadow out of the way here
but there's a plug for this end of the
manifold there's a plug right here and
then there's another plug down
that great thing that you can see right
there that's a plug as well that I have
to take off and there's a hose in the
center of the manifold right here that I
need to remove as well just pop that out
and then these bolts right here are 12
millimeters so I'm unscrewing all of
those there's another one right back in
here sorry about the shade and then
there's another one in the center right
here this is the engine right there and
then deep down in on it there's that
little green tie I just snip that with a
pair of plastic snips because there was
a cable attached to it and that freed up
that cable then over on this end this
was attached to that little guy right
there and then there's like two more
cables that are up inside the manifold
as well those just slide right out of
little slots at their end I'm also going
to tuck off this latch right here just
for kicks and giggles so I can pull I
have more room to pull that manifold out
when the time comes there's not a whole
lot of gap between that the manifold
these are 10 millimeter bolts right
there around the edges there's three of
them and the hardest part is done that
is the intake manifold where it connects
to the engine and everything when you're
disconnecting these bottom two hoses at
the bottom liquid will drain out of
those so what I've done is I've taken
just my screwdriver bit and I just
plucked up that hole so none of the
liquid drains out you want to keep as
much in there as possible anyway that is
the starter right there there's a couple
different connections this guy right
here just clips in like that and so just
bending back this rubber part and then
just pull it back make sure you pull on
the connector itself and off the wire
this guy down right here is a 17
millimeter this one is a 12 millimeter
and this one back here is a 14
millimeter that long bolt so once you
get all those done the starter itself
should just pop out from the engine body
all right here we have both of the
starters just want to make sure they
have the connections in the same spot
and the same size and everything like
that same ole number
Amazon cell starters are pretty cheap I
will link this in the video description
below so go ahead and check that out
right below this video they're pretty
cheap anyway so there's a couple of
videos on YouTube kind of explaining how
to do this one of the guys comes up from
the bottom but as you can see once the
starter sitting in here in this spot
that bolt on this side would have been
almost impossible to reach due to this
coolant line and you know a couple of
these other hoses
it's just guys with big hands have
problems we can and it holds that small
so I recommend coming in from the top
honestly it only took me probably I
don't know an hour so to get all the
hoses disconnected and everything that
was my first time without a good video
to watch so you should be able to do it
in a quicker amount of time what's
really nice with my method is that the
only thing that came out was really the
intake manifold and the starter itself
like I didn't have to take apart the air
filter I took apart the battery
obviously just give me a little bit more
room to work with and this connection
right here but there's other guys on
YouTube who were taken out like weird
stuff like the radiator another guy took
out the air filter box like you don't
need to touch any of that just this
manifold right here so a relatively
simple process I would say an hour to
take out our to put back in two hours
total not too bad so something that
would make your life a little bit easier
here the little on the side of the
engine this guy or on side of the
manifold just plugs in with a little
tube right there so if you want to put
this into the manifold first and then
just plug it up into the top just like
that it would make it easier because you
don't have to like reach in and find the
little plugs in on the side so they're
on the intake manifold itself as where
these two little guys plug in so I'm
going to reattach them it's a lot easier
doing it when you can see it that's it
you have any questions make sure to
leave them down in the comments below
