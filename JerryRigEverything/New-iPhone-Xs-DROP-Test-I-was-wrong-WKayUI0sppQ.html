have the most durable glass ever on a
smartphone today we're gonna put that to
the test my theory is that glass is
glass and glass is still gonna break
huge thanks to LastPass for sponsoring
this drop test and making this video
possible
switching phones is a hassle every new
app needs its own password and you're
probably like your grandparents using
the same simple password for everything
one app that makes remembering passwords
super easy is LastPass used by millions
of people LastPass has the ability to
generate long super secure passwords
that are encrypted which means they are
secure and you never need to remember
what they are since they're saved inside
the LastPass app since LastPass
remembers your passwords for you you
never need to write them down or use the
same password for everything whether
you're on your computer or your cell
phone the app itself is 100% free but if
you want a few extra perks like a
gigabyte of encrypted storage it's only
2 bucks a month I'll leave a link down
in the description below this video
huge thanks once again to LastPass for
making this drop test possible let's get
started so today we're gonna be dropped
testing two of Apple's brand new iPhone
10 s's Apple says they raise the bar
with iPhone glass yet again and we're
gonna find out how durable it is when
dropped completely naked one phone will
be without a case and the second phone
will be covered in Amazon Prime's
absolute cheapest case you can buy it's
five bucks and we'll see how long each
of the phones last with simple drop
tests from starting from the knee and
the waist then chest and we'll see what
happens when they drop from your ear
down to the ground
I will be giving away the least broken
of these two phones spoiler probably the
one in the case away on my Instagram
I'll leave that link right here okay so
I'll be dropping the phones from right
there out of the cab in my truck and to
record the phone's dropping in slow
motion I have the iPhone 10's max that I
used for my durability test and teardown
and then also recording in slow motion
we have the poco phone f1 which I also
did a durability test and a teardown on
so hopefully they can catch the drops in
all of the slow-motion glorious detail
that we need so protecting one of the
phones is this case right here which is
the cheapest case on
Amazon Prime clear has the soft rubber
around the edges and a little harder
plastic in the back should do a pretty
good job okay first drop test will be
doing the iPhone 10s in a case and will
simulate as if you were sitting down
standing up and forgetting that your
phone was on your lap and it's sliding
off your leg and hitting the ground
bones on the leg right about knee height
standing up
and now let's do the other iPhone that's
unprotected it's on my knee I'm gonna
stand up all right looking all around
the edge of the phone there is no damage
surprisingly not even any scuffs along
the gold side looks like right there
along the tip of it we have one little
scuff on the corner which isn't too bad
and of course the iPhone inside of the
case is probably just fine no cracks
along the back glass yet everything
appears to be working just fine let's
drop it from a little higher up this
time I'll be dropping it from waist high
we'll start with the unprotected phone
and then finish off with the protected
phone amazon's cheapest case so just
pulling it out of my pocket and then
dropping it
all right so far no damage on the back
glass there's a few minor little scuffs
and dings along the sides but that's not
too big of a deal and then pulling the
$5 case out of my pocket letting it drop
and it looks like once again everything
is still in one piece
nothing is cracked or broken anywhere
yet and obviously there's no dings
around the edge on the stainless steel
with the one that's inside of a case so
that's good okay we'll try waist height
one more time just because I feel like
that's the most common drop that's gonna
happen with people you know pulling it
out of their pocket or having it fall
off of a table and most tables are about
waist height make it phone first pulling
it out of my pocket
still no damage done to the display or
the back glass surprisingly and the
protected phone the one inside the case
every time I hear the glass backed
iPhone 10s hit the ground like I cringe
a little bit but whenever the one inside
of the case hits the ground I feel like
Oh everything's fine both phones are
still working 100% and there is no
damage done on the back glass at all yet
just a few little scuffs on the gold
iPhone 10s so this time around I'm gonna
be holding up to my ear and letting it
slip out of my fingers and hitting the
asphalt so we'll just be talking on the
phone well that could be a bad one
no way the bad glass is still totally
fine all the way around the edges okay
I'm a little bit impressed let's do the
one inside the case talking on the phone
letting it slip
so taking a look even now there is still
no crackage on the back glass this is
actually pretty impressive let's take
off the case yeah still no damage done
I'm impressed
let's do that one more time okay the
unprotected cellphone is in my hand the
gold version we're gonna go ahead and
talk on the phone more time and drop it
shoot
still nothing what that is impressive
no cracks at all I remember when I did
this with the normal iPhone 10 like with
the very first drop we had a crack up
here by the camera lens now literally
nothing one more time with Amazon
Prime's cheapest case no damage along
the edges and no damage on the back
glass or the front everything is still
working as it was when it came out of
the box alright so I'm gonna drop it two
more times and if the iPhone doesn't
break I'm gonna give away both of them
on Instagram instead of just one I
honestly thought they would break by now
okay talking one more time remember this
is a realistic drop test as if I'm
talking to you on the phone and it's
slipping
it scares me every time still nothing
I am completely impressed and the case
version dropping from the ear
yeah the iPhone is still functioning
100% no damage to the back glass okay
last time okay last time if it survives
this last drop from my ear Apple wins
the drop test and I take back I don't
take back everything I said let's give
this a shot
unprotected iPhone up to my ear dropping
right on the corner we'll drop test the
one in a case really quick before we
pick that up up to my ear dropping
I just feel so much more secure when the
one inside the case drops no way it's
still alive that is really impressive
both of the phones are fully functional
with zero damage okay fine
both phones survived the bad glass did
not break I was proven wrong a little
bit is having a case a bad thing
no it's not should you have a case
probably yes because what I did here is
not indicative of every single drop
situation that can happen I've heard of
people complaining that their phone
dropped off a desk and cracked fell on
the parking lot and cracked now it makes
me want to take a Samsung phone and drop
it from head height three times and see
if it can survive because in my mind
glass should break from head height not
really sure what to do with my life
right now
am I gonna switch to iPhone probably not
I'm still kind of annoyed that these
back glass pieces cost five hundred
dollars to replace because even though
it survived three drops in my particular
test right here doesn't mean it's
absolutely invincible and glass will
break eventually either way as of right
now I am super super impressed with the
iPhone 10s when I dropped tested the
iPhone 10 it broke in the first and
second drops so Apple might have done
something new this year who knows over
on my Instagram I will be giving away
both of these phones right here is my
Instagram handle go check it out I'll
have all the instructions over there and
I will be giving away a 10 s max on my
Twitter like I promised during my
durability test video thanks a ton for
watching multiple drops from head height
with no damage is very impressive Apple
stills probably not my favorite but they
definitely won this round
thanks stuff for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
