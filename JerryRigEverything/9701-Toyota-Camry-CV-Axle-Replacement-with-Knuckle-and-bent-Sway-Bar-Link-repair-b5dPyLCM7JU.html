this wonderful winter day one of my
friends accidentally slid into a curb
and broke her tire you can see that the
CV axle in there is broken as well as
the knuckle and a couple other things
are bent so I'm going to do right now is
I'm going to change it out I have to
tire off now got the car supported up
and you can see right here that the
steering knuckle is broken completely
snapped off right there and then back in
here you can see that the CV axle is
also snapped right out of that little
holder that it's in right next to the
engine mount we just need to make sure
that this line right here doesn't have a
whole lot of tension on it because the
caliper can't support its own weight so
I'm going to strap that up so I have to
worry about it so right here and the
rotor there's a little cotter pin so
I've taken the cotter pin and bent up
the little edge of it so it's
straightened out and then I can grab it
from the underside just wiggle it on out
of there okay so now there's a big old
nut right in the middle of that wheel
that's attached the CV axle so we need
to take it out I have a big old breaker
bar and without air tool sometimes that
nut can be stuck on pretty tight so you
can get another like a hollow bar and
stick it over the end of that to extend
your leverage and lift it up and get
enough force to actually break loose
that nut luckily for me this bar was
enough I'm so now that not inside of
there is coming loose so I took the tire
put it back on attach two lug nuts to it
and then set it back down again so that
wouldn't spin while I was trying to
rotate the nut off it held the tyre in
place so that I could remove the whole
thing now I'm going to jack up the car
take the tire back off and then work on
getting the rest of the broken parts off
so the CV axle is this guy right back
here and it is the thing that is
connected right inside of here with this
nut so what I've done is I've taken this
nut and put it right on the edge of the
bolt like that so I can hit it with the
hammer and not damage any threads so
if I take my hammer it's pushing that
right back through and this car
amazingly isn't that stuck I'm just a
couple light taps and it started to feed
all the way through so now that it's
moving I can just remove this nut the
rest of the way
found it through and that will release
the rest the contraption from the broken
CV axle this is the part where the CV
axle goes into the transmission and you
just got to make sure that this is the
old one right now so you can see how
flush it is when you pull the new one
out it's got to be that same you know
stuck as far in there as you can all
right so I missed a step
but get the top part of the knuckle out
there are two bolts right up here at the
top that are 24 millimeters sorry 22
millimeters as I put my wrench on one
side my ratchet on the other side and
just kind of twisted them
counterclockwise to get that top part
out and this is the part that was broken
so once those two nuts were out I just
pulled that right out now we're gonna
come in here get that castle nut off now
normally when you're replacing the CV
axle it's not going to mess with your
alignment very much unless you of course
hit something and then you will probably
be off of your alignment because the
alignments you know done off of whether
the components in the car are straight
or off of this part right here which is
they adjust these little nuts and it
makes your alignment on or off all right
so this nut right here is on where the
steering connects to the actual knuckle
of the car so I'm going to release this
cotter pin right here and then take off
this castle nut and then that'll allow
me to separate this shaft from the
necklace self click right here for a
second the hardest part of this whole
job you know the CV axle is not that bad
the hardest part of this job is that the
knuckle is broken right here
and so when I try to twist any nut like
let's say this nut back here on the
caliper the whole thing kind of shifts
like the whole thing rotate
so that I can't get any traction
anywhere with it now what I've done to
fix this problem is taking a huge
crowbar put it right back in there the
crowbar is this guy on the set
Pittsburgh on it and I have propped it
up with my leg here and then when I try
to rotate this instead of going forward
to just rest itself on the crowbar which
allows me to take off these nuts so that
one I've just barely got it spinning
obviously I can't hold the camera
support the car and twist the nut but
I'm pretty proud of myself so once I get
this nut off and the other one hopefully
I can get that off by just the same
position as well then we'll be able to
remove the caliper from the knuckle
itself and hopefully be able to get the
new knuckle on there and keep moving
forward
so as I'm trying to do that lower nut on
the caliper where that ratchet is right
here the breaker bar and I had to take
the crowbar and pin it underneath the
frame down in there and over the top of
this joint right here I kind of just
pressed down on both of those at the
same time to get the right leverage that
I needed so yeah it's working out pretty
well
okay finally got the caliper off and
that kind of leaves us more room to deal
with the bottom ball joint so I have the
cotter pin lifted up I'm going to slide
that out through the castle nut pop the
castle nut off and then separate the
broken knuckle from the ball joint and
then finally pop this end off as well I
already have the nut down off the other
side I actually just had three cop cars
pull up wondering what the heck I'm
doing behind the Big O tires at one
o'clock in the morning when it's seven
degrees out they actually pulled up from
this side and then another guy came up
from over there thinking I was stealing
something but nope is just finals week
and Sunday at midnight is the only time
that I can work on cars
so right here has I'm trying to get off
that bottom ball joint and I have this
thing right here called a tip in polar
and so basically what it does is this
little guy right here screws and
unscrews and so as I tighten it down
onto the top of this bolt right here
it's going to pull the knuckle up
because it has these claws down there at
the bottom
so hopefully that pulls it up and out of
the way because with how loose
everything is that everything's broken
there's no good way to hit that or pry
it off even if I had like a pickle fork
or something to stick between there it
wouldn't really work out very well all
right got everything
disconnected pretty stoked about it
that little tippmann puller down there
and did a great job pulling off that
busted knuckle all right so now I just
need to pull off the rest of that CV
axle so this is half of it right here
and the other half is still inside of
there attached to the engine mount you
can see the very back of there it's
attached into the transmission my
Mountain Dew froze so that is where we
connect into the transmission and this
is where it is bolted on to the engine
mount so in order to get this part out
of the engine mount you have to remove
this little pinch bowl right here which
kind of sticks it up inside of there
then what I did is I took a can of that
pv blaster which is that guy over there
sprayed it up all around this opening on
the inside sometimes this little gizmo
whatever this is seizes up inside and
then after that took my little cat's paw
right here and put it up inside of that
little opening right there and then hit
it a couple times with my hand again a
sledge hammer and then after I hit it
then it popped out I've seen a couple
other YouTube videos where they took out
this engine mount that seems like an
incredible amount of work and I don't
have any power tools so brute force and
some Q blaster did the trick
for me so there's that also I took this
is kind of a little pinch thing that's
holding it up inside this groove right
here if you just grab both of those with
the pliers and pinch a shut that
releases it from the groove and then you
have to transfer this over to the other
CV axle anyway so now that that is out
I'm going to grab the new CV axle clean
up the inside of this and then press it
back into place all right here's a
little trick I learned from eric the car
guy he's another youtuber post a link
for his channel right here
he knows quite a bit about cars anyway
so he says to line both of these CV
axles up together and check to see if
they're the same one which is a great
idea because when I got about here I can
tell that my CV axle the one that broke
doesn't have this which happens to be
the ABS a little gear sensor thingy so I
have to wait till tomorrow morning so I
can swap that out to get the one that I
need here's a sway bar and this is
actually the easiest part of the whole
deal all you have to do is take off this
14 millimeter bolt here 14 millimeter
bolt on the side right here and then the
whole thing just pops right out if the
bolt on the inside of sway bar starts
spinning when you're trying to unscrew
it just kind of grab the sway bar and
can't get sideways so it pinches the
bolt and then it'll bracket and then
that I'll let you get this off the end
of it because of it when it's pinched
inside the bolt like that it won't spin
around all right so these are sway bars
right here sway bar links you can see
what the new ones they're a lot thicker
than the old ones are I'll put all of
the parts and stuff in the video
description below so if you need to
replace this on your vehicle it'll be a
lot easier to find it I usually do
Amazon Amazon is the cheapest place to
get this kind of stuff to get the sway
bar on there's a little nut right here
on the side that you can just get on and
then you can continue ratcheting it down
the
over there see hold still with this one
Ratchet it with the other one and we're
off to a good start this morning the CD
axle I just took it gently press it into
place and it looks like it is sitting
exactly where it needs to they're going
to put in the bottom bolt right here
you're going to want to make sure to do
this before you put the CD axle in place
because you can't get that nut on there
once it's all put back together ask me
how I know all right got these top two
bolts in got the king nut and the cotter
pin through here now I'm going to take
the caliper and put that back on the
bolts that it was on before all right
got this final nut in place it's not
tighten down as far as we go yet I'm
going to wait till I get the tire back
on and then drop it down and then finish
tightening it up but we're all finished
on the inside caliper bolts are
tightened down as far as they can go and
there you have it I replay the CV axle
anyway I will list all the parts and
stuff you need in the video description
below but they look at that place the
sway bars CV axle everything else if you
have any other questions make sure to
leave me in the comments like this video
