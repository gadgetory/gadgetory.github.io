kilometer road trip through France and
Spain in one of their brand-new 2018
Mercedes G classes the Mercedes vehicles
are pretty impressive especially if
you're into the luxury off-roading
market the G class is exceptional the
thing I'm most excited about is the
three locking differentials not just one
or two but three lucky for us Mercedes
is letting us take these off-road in
some pretty extreme conditions so we'll
see how they hold up literally on a
cliff right now let's get started
obviously we've already done some pretty
heavy driving in this but I'm gonna run
you through the exterior so this is
pretty much the same design as the
previous Mercedes G classes except for
they've managed to shave a hundred and
seventy kilograms off of the total
weight which is pretty sweet it still
has the same iconic markers on the side
which side note is actually pretty cool
if if this ever hits a pedestrian this
whole thing will collapse inside the
frame not damaging the light and more
importantly not damaging the pedestrian
same iconic grille with the Mercedes
logo and the same relative boxy shape
that the normal G classes have always
had for the last 30 years
one thing Mercedes has bragged about is
the same style of door handles they've
always had with the push button on the
side and the spare tire on the rear and
it comes in two different styles this is
the G 500 and there's also a G 63 and
I'll talk about those more in a bit so
inside of the back you can tell we've
been driving for a minute we have the
same opening style handles we have back
right here and inside the car
these seats actually fold completely
flat so we can lift these up set these
down and there's a lot of room for
activities back here the thing I'm most
excited about though is the triple
locking differentials not only one in
the rear but there's also one in the
front and one in the middle and I'll
explain what I mean so every car has
something called a differential that's
in between the two tires that lets them
spin independently of each other my
truck my Toyota Tacoma has a rear Locker
which means that it can lock the
differential and make the tire spin
together at the same time which helps
you get out of sticky situations let's
say you're in a patch of mud and one
tire is spinning the other tire won't
move while that tire spinning so with
the locker it makes it so that both
tires have to move at the same time
which means that if this one's spinning
it transfers the power to the one that's
not spinning and also makes it move so
in this G class undercarriage right here
we have the front of the car and here we
have the rear differential with the
locker which is pretty standard on
off-road cars but we also have a center
locking differential here which means
that the front and rear tires won't spin
independently of each other they will
all have to spin at the same speed at
the same time and then this G class also
has a front differential with a locker
basically with all of those lockers
you'll just never get stuck in
g-class but rather than just talk about
the locking differentials how about we
show you how they work
so inside the g-class we have a plethora
of buttons these control the seats over
here we have two big monitors which I'll
talk about in a second right now we're
going to talk about these dynamic select
programs here we have obviously your
basic slippery individual comfort Sport
and Sport Plus modes but if we jump down
here into the differentials and we put
on the center lock then it brings us the
different kind of trail modes so we have
the regular trail mode and then we also
have a rock mode and then we have the
sand mode here and each one of those the
tires act differently depending on what
mode is set to and also if you check
right here as I'm moving this steering
wheel
you can see the angle of the front tire
as I turn the steering wheel back and
forth so most of the cars that have
driven have the exhaust coming out the
back and it sounds you know like a
normal car normal truck but here in this
Mercedes g-class
the exhaust sounds completely different
and first of all comes out the side
right next to the back passenger rear
tire and secondly it sounds more like a
harley-davidson
motorcycle
than anything else so now we have the
g-class 500 we're gonna take it off
roading up at these mountains behind me
this one it doesn't have the side rails
and it doesn't have those tailpipes that
stick out the side so the sound of this
500 is quite a bit different than the 63
that we are in before but this one is
better for off-roading because it has
that additional ground clearance it's
time to see how it handles for real
though so even though we're going uphill
right now and I can't see the road
directly underneath me we have the
camera here which can see the road
directly underneath me and I can see
over the crest of the hill which to my
eye is looking over the bonnet we're
looking over the hood I can't see over
the hill so it's nice to have these
additional cameras
it's the one thing that I've noticed
taking this G class off road remember
this is the 500 is that it is super
super quiet when I'm driving the only
thing you can hear is the sound of the
engine as it's revving there's no wind
noise there's no nothing else and that's
because the cab of the vehicles air
tight like it's water tight you can feel
it when the doors are slammed you can
feel the pressure of the car so right
now we're going over this muddy terrain
area in front of us and there's a huge
puddle up ahead and it's kind of crazy
because the water level as we get deeper
the water levels going to come up to the
doors and the doors should stay
watertight so we're going to go through
the water
how deep you can see how deep it is
coming up to the doors and there's zero
water getting inside of the cab it's
insane so a is watertight and B all of
that water tightness helps keep the
noise level down as well
solid day a bunch of water cover in the
hood yeah the water level was definitely
above that bottom seam at the door you
can see the dry patches right here in
the wetness right down here so above
this bottom hinge the whole bottom foot
of the door was underwater but still
nothing got in the car that's impressive
so we've done a lot of the off-road
driving we've tested the off-road
capabilities but to be honest with you
with how expensive this is it's more of
like a luxury vehicle and so I imagine
most of the time it's going to be on
road because you don't want to scratch
something that cost this much so as far
as the on-road driving goes it feels
like a luxury vehicle still and one of
the things that comes with luxury
vehicles is performance and speed and
even driving
I have freeway speeds it still has a lot
of acceleration left over to get even
farther past legal speed limits but with
that Mercedes has put a lot of effort
into making the vehicle more quiet the G
class is not an aerodynamic vehicle by
any means it is a box and has the
aerodynamics of a box and while that's
great for keeping the same style from
the last 30 years of the G class it's
not so great for wind noise but since
this thing is pressurized and waterproof
it does keep a lot of that exterior
noise out including the road noise and
cars next year so as far as the interior
goes on the G Class this is another 500
with a white leather interior and it
looks phenomenal check this out so right
inside the door here we have the
speakers we have all the seat controls
like every single aspect of the seat can
be controlled up down left and right
back and forward and this seat also this
is the leather Dan and his son Lincoln
chopped up one of the s-class seats and
this has the same technology inside of
it so it has like the massaging air
pockets and these sides as you turn the
steering wheel back and forth the sides
grip your body with each turn of the
vehicle it's pretty sweet
plus it has heating and cooling in the
seats with these buttons right here
normal window buttons and just the white
leather everywhere inside the vehicle we
have a display right here as well as a
second display over here on the side
that's the same kind of thing we saw in
the a-class when me and Dan went to
Amsterdam for the a-class reveal
one thing that I'm not super fond of and
I've noticed in every single G class
that I've been in I think this is number
six or seven in this road trip is that
with the 2008 teens the reflection of
this vent right here is in the rearview
mirror you can see that little circle of
the vent in the mirror all the time and
it's not super distracting and you might
not always notice it but I have there
are buttons everywhere on this I feel
like some of them are a little bit
redundant and like down here we have a
back button right here we have a back
button right here we have a back button
there's just so many different places to
control the electronics inside of the
car that wherever your hand is at that
time you can control basically
everything whether it's down here at the
bottom or up here on the steering wheel
couple more buttons up here at the top
and a sunroof which I love there is five
billion specks we could talk about
safety is one of them to want to talk
about that so with the seatbelts when
you clip them in there's a little motor
of tapas inch isn't tied across your
chest I thought that was cool my truck
doesn't have that and then there's also
the normal safety features that cars in
2018 have so it has the lane assist it
helps you stay between the two lines and
the thing is is that it's actually
pretty strong if the car thinks that I'm
just naturally drifting into another
lane it'll take the steering wheel and
jerk it back into the lane whether it's
you know a center stripe it'll do it
like insurance segments or if it's a
solid stripe like on the edge of the
road it'll do it hard it almost makes
you think that you hit something on the
side of the road because it jerks you
back into the center so I haven't quite
decided if I like that feature yet but
it's still interesting that it's there
also when you're changing lanes and
signaling to go in one lane or the other
there's little LED markers on the
sideview mirrors that tell you if
there's a card or blind spot which is
super super helpful
there's at least 50 buttons within my
grasp right here and a lot of them do
the same thing like the back button that
I pointed out before there's three of
those all within reach of my right hand
but for those of you already familiar
with Mercedes vehicles these buttons are
pretty standard and it is good to always
have easy access to the buttons you
press the most also didn't realize the
mercedes-benz logo lights up that's
pretty sweet
we finally made it to Barcelona after
over five hundred kilometres of driving
from France to Spain to be honest with
you before this video I knew that the
g-class was a little on the more luxury
side of things but I didn't know it was
as capable off-road as it actually is
and super huge thanks to mercedes for
letting me and dan put that to the test
literally today and yesterday the fancy
seats and the three lockers are still my
favorite things of the g-class let me
know what you think is best down in the
comments and thanks a ton for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
