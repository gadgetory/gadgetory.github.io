The first durability test of 2018.
It's time to play with the Huawei Mate 10
Pro.
I'm a fan of these glass sandwich phones normally,
especially when the back glass is replaceable.
I've already torn down the titanium gray colored
Mate 10 that Huawei gave me, so if you haven't
seen that video yet, check it out after this
one.
This midnight blue version I bought myself
since I only do durability tests to brand
new phones so I can keep things fair.
Let's... get started.
[Intro]
I always start with the scratch test to check
what the screen is made from.
Not all screens are made equally.
This Mohs scale of hardness let's us find
the difference between plastic, glass and
sapphire.
I hear that Blackberry just released a new
phone with nano diamond scratch resistant
coatings, so that test should be interesting.
Huawei has included a high quality plastic
screen protector covering their phone, which
is nice of them to go the extra mile.
But I am going to remove that for this test.
Plastic scratches at a level 3, tempered glass
at a level 6, and sapphire would be a level
8.
This Huawei Mate 10 Pro scratches at a level
6 with a deeper groove at a level 7.
Very normal so far.
The Huawei logo under the glass is permanent.
The front facing camera is also under the
glass and protected.
The earpiece grill is metal with small holes,
so if the magnet does attract metal shavings
or dirt, it should still be pretty easy to
keep clean.
The sides of the phone are made from anodized
aluminum that you can see me scraping away
with my razor.
Drops and dings might show up as silver, as
you can see here, but Huawei is nice enough
to include a free case in the box - still
going the extra mile.
At the bottom of the phone there is one hole
for the USB-C charging port and nothing else.
There is no headphone jack which I guess is
fine for most people these days apparently,
but for me, a headphone jack is kind of like
a toothpick - you don't need one every day,
but it's still incredibly nice to have one
when you do need it.
For now, my daily driver will always have
a headphone jack.
The sides and buttons are made from metal.
Thumbs up to Huawei for consistency and quality
materials.
Even up here at the top of the phone it's
still metal.
We also find a little infrared sensor at the
top next to one of those little microphone
holes.
Now, the back of the phone has two lenses
- the one at the top being a 20 megapixel
monochrome sensor covered by glass.
And the bottom lens is the 12 megapixel color
optically stabilized camera, also covered
with glass.
Both lenses are aesthetically tucked into
rectangular banding at the top of the glass.
The metal lens circles do protrude a bit from
the glass, but not as much as we've seen with
the new iPhones.
The fingerprint scanner has a plastic coating
over the top which can scratch pretty easily
with a razor blade.
You know how it is.
But even after heavy damage, it can still
read my fingerprint surprisingly quick.
I do like the positioning of this sensor right
below the camera lenses.
I don't ever use the fingerprint scanner on
my current phone, the Galaxy S8 Plus, because
it's in such an awkward spot.
So at least Huawei has the placement right.
And now for the burn test.
I still haven't found a reason for this test
yet, it's mostly just fun to watch, since
as we know, AMOLED screens don't ever fully
recover from the flame, while IPS displays
sometimes do.
In this case, the HDR10 6 inch AMOLED display
lasted 40 seconds, which is one of the longest
lasting displays yet - right up there with
the Galaxy S8.
Definitely don't try this at home though because
it does melt away the oleophobic glass coating...and
burning your own phone is just not a smart
thing to do.
I'm a professional phone burner.
While maneuvering the phone into the bend
position, I noticed the screen dropped down
into the lower third of the phone, I assume
for easy one-handed operation.
I'm not sure how I managed to do this, but
it's kind of a nifty feature, especially for
bigger devices like this one.
Still fully functioning with the display back
in it's fully extended proper position, we
commence the bend test.
Not all phones survive.
The glass HTC U11 last year was one of the
least durable phones, snapping under the pressure
of the bend test.
But this Huawei Mate 10 is faring much better.
Whether bent from the back or the front, there's
hardly any flex to the phone, with no damage
being done to the glass screen or the glass
back.
Not even a crinkle near the metal power button.
The Mate 10 Pro passes my durability test.
This is only the first durability test of
2018 - I think we should test many, many more.
Let me know what other phones you want to
see tested this year in the comments, and
come hang out with me on Instagram.
Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you
around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
