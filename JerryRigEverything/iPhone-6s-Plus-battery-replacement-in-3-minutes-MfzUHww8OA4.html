replace the battery in your iPhone 6s
plus it's not too complicated and you
can save a lot of money by doing the
project yourself you are going to need a
screwdriver I will link replacement
parts and replacement tools down in the
video description below
first thing remove these two screws on
the bottom of the iPhone these are
pentalobe screws then you can take your
suction cup and metal pry tool and lift
up gently on the frame of the screen and
the frame of the phone making sure not
to put any pressure on the screen at all
because if you crack your screen this
will turn into a much more expensive
repair there's a little bit of adhesive
around the edge of the screen as soon as
I can fit my plastic pry tool and I
switch to that to cause less damage to
the frame and then I can lift the screen
up from the main body be careful not to
bend the screen past 90 degrees or you
will damage the ribbon cables there's
two screws holding down the metal plate
that protect the battery connector pop
that off with your plastic pry tool then
we can remove the screen connections
there's five screws holding down that
metal plate then we can lift each of
these little ribbon cables off like
little Legos on snapping them one at a
time and then lifting the screen off
away from the body now here's the
battery the battery is held down with
three adhesive strips underneath you can
grab these little strips and pull them
out be careful though they are really
fragile if you catch any of the little
strips on the corner of that taptic
vibrator motor it will rip the adhesive
and then break the adhesive and making
the whole battery much harder to pull
out I was a lot more careful with the
second one and still managed to damage
it so let's try this third one being
super careful not to touch it against
any of the components down by the
charging port and luckily with this
third one I was able to pull it all the
way out removing the entire strip of
adhesive from underneath the battery one
out of three is not too bad
but it definitely makes the repair
harder now that I slept two adhesive
strips under there here you can see kind
of how the Bateses
looks it's kind of has a rubbery feel to
it anyway here goes the pry of Shame now
that I have two adhesive strips still
underneath the battery I'm using a
plastic pry tool if you manage to
puncture your battery it will damage
your phone so be very very careful and
don't use anything metal underneath that
battery I pulled out one of the
remaining adhesive strips and then
lifted the battery off of that last one
you can see how it reacts and holds to
the back of the phone for this video I'm
just using normal double-sided tape I
will link more professional adhesive
strips down in the video description can
you take your new battery which I
linked in the video description as well
plug it into the bottom and I'm going to
plug in my screen to test and make sure
everything functions sometimes the
batteries do arrive dead so plug them in
and let them charge up for a while if
your phone doesn't immediately turn on
everything looks good the screen is
functioning if you have lines or your
screen is gray after you plug it back in
your connections might be bad so just
unsnap those ribbon cables and snap them
back in and hopefully everything works
screw the two screws in down by the
connector for the battery get the five
screws in for the top plate and all
those ribbon cable connections then you
can line up the top of the screen with
the top edge of the frame and then
gently press down on the screen working
your way from the top to the bottom get
the bottom two pentalobe screws in and
everything is good any questions leave
it down in the comments if you're super
bored follow me on Instagram and Twitter
I do post a lot of pictures behind the
scenes thanks for watching hope see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
