said go find X well I finally found it
this is one of the coolest phones I've
ever seen and it's actually also the
first Oppo phone I've ever tested so I'd
like to officially welcome Bob Lowe to
my desk and my durability test I perform
these tests on over 100 different phones
mostly flagships I'm not sure the exact
number it's just probably bordering
insanity at this point but here we all
are let's get started the cool thing
about this phone is the motorized
cameras not just the front camera like
the vivo next phone I reviewed and made
clear this app will find X has a whole
motorized top section that contains all
the front sensors earpiece and front and
rear cameras it's a pretty hefty load up
top banking on that motor never failing
or getting stuck if that motor ever jams
or stops working no more cameras for you
the motor itself seems okay so far if I
pull the top out of the phone body while
the camera app is not open it'll just
pull itself right back inside kind of
fights with you for a little bit when
the camera app is open though and the
top is fully extended the whole
contraption has a little bit more play
than I expected
jiggling back and forth front and back
just kind of moving all over not near as
solid as the vivo necks wiggle room is a
bad thing
wiggle room means there is space for
stuff to get caught down inside the
moving parts Pocket lint is called
Pocket lint because every pocket has it
and gunk accumulates in your pockets
it's not a good thing for a phone with
moving parts the find X does come with a
high-quality screen protector which is
nicely any protection is good protection
especially when the phone is so
expensive the back glass has no
protective layer but that's pretty
normal
let's jump into the scratch test as
always this most scale of hardness has
different materials on the tip of each
tool to tell the difference between
different minerals plastic would be a
level-3 glass of level six and sapphire
would be an eight or nine with diamonds
following at a level ten
here we see marks at a six with deeper
grooves at a level seven pretty normal
for a flagship this find X is using
Gorilla Glass v Gorilla Glass six just
got announced and we fun to check out in
the future there's not a whole lot more
to test here on the front of the phone
it's
pretty much all screen with no visible
cameras or sensors or even buttons on
the glass just one super good looking
wall-to-wall no notch display thumbs up
for that
besides the phone our middle which does
provide a sense of solidity metal is
included on the power button as well the
top chunk of this phone the portion lift
up is also metal nothing up here to look
at except for the little microphone hole
the far side of the phone has the volume
buttons both metal but is otherwise bare
the bottom of phone has our USB C port
and no headphone jack it might be a good
thing or a bad thing depending on who
you ask I prefer my phones to have one
though with a motorized opening on a
phone like this obviously there's no
hope for water resistance but this dual
SIM card trade does have its own little
rubber ring around the edge so it looks
like Oppo has put some thought into
liquid protection hopefully we'll find
some more protection inside when we do
the teardown
as expected the back is glass and
unscratched will buy my razor the Oppo
and find X logos are printed on the
underside of the glass and won't be
rubbing off but I'm sure we can make it
clear if we need to let's get a closer
look at the motorized bits the whole
area covering the front of the
mechanical lift is glass which means the
25 megapixel front facing camera and all
the high-tech sensors for the face
scanning feature are protected against
scratching as the mechanism actuates up
and down so far so good
interestingly enough this exterior
earpiece lock is just a hollow hallway
for sound to pass through from the
actual earpiece in the race bit behind
it so if that actuated motor does break
and stays closed you'll still be able to
make and hear your phone calls which is
kind of important for a cell phone
flipping over the phone for the rear
dual cameras we get 16 and 20 megapixel
cameras but no telephoto or wide-angle
and that's rather unfortunate having two
cameras that do the exact same thing is
like buying a Swiss Army knife where
every single blade is the same if you
have a spot for multiple cameras they
should accomplish different things
that's my opinion you might be thinking
to yourself hey yo Jerry you didn't
scratch the fingerprint scanner and
you're right there is no fingerprint
scanner on this phone which feels kind
of strange on a 2018 flagship but Oppo
has some major confidence in their
facial recognition system and
did not include the fingerprint scanner
this time around now for the burn test
seems only fitting to start this fire
right on the weather app since it's so
hot outside and only getting hotter the
six point four inch 1080p display his
AMOLED and after 14 seconds we got proof
of that with the rather nice white burn
mark in the center of the screen that
never recovers LCDs usually recover but
amyloids burn white and stay that way
now for the bin test bin tests are
important because they show how
structurally sound iPhone is and gives
us a general idea of how well it'll hold
up over time with accidental abuse
remember I've tested over a hundred
phones and the vast majority of the
phones I test survived even the previous
motorised vivo necks commencing the bend
on the Oppo find X I instantly knew
something was wrong with this phone it
bent way too far and never locked out or
stopped bending like most phones do some
parts of the phone can handle the Flex
like the metal frame but one thing that
can't handle the flexing is the rigid
and brittle AMOLED display panel that
display underneath the glass cracks
rendering the screen pretty useless
since the colors now have a mind of
their own the back panel starts lifting
off and both the front and rear glass
shatter into oblivion you might be
thinking yeah of course it broke you
just bent it in half but keep in mind
that over 90% of the phones I get my
hands on are strong enough to withstand
this exact same abuse and go on to live
long happy lives until I harvest their
organs for parts you know it is this
Apple find X is dead it's important to
never sit on a phone like this or
accidentally step on it after a drop or
even drop it at all cell phones are
probably the most abused pieces of
technology on the planet and the find X
cannot handle abuse as well as other
smartphones it's going on the shelf of
shame
I love the innovation and direction that
Oppo is taking this phone is a winner on
so many levels just not with durability
let's take a closer look at the inside
of that camera mechanism it looks like
the glass layer has laminate backing so
it'll all come off in one piece a clear
addition would have been awesome bending
back the fractured glass you get our
first look inside of the phone one
singular stepper motor with the same
lead screw technology we saw only find X
except for this lead screw is pushing up
way more
wait and is not as stable and also has a
much more valuable payload since
literally every sensor in the phone
depends on that little motor lasting for
years I have my doubts it's putting a
lot of trust in something that's Wiggly
and jiggly my intention here is to not
crush Oppel into oblivion innovation
like this is pretty much the coolest
thing ever and apples doing a fantastic
job of leading the market in the
direction it should be headed the phone
looks awesome but hopefully their next
phone is just a bit more durable I'll be
pulling glass out of my fingers for the
next week pulling off the rest of the
back glass reveals our weak point in the
frame there's not a whole lot of metal
in here keeping things together and
pretty much nothing structural all
between the battery and the motherboard
which is the weakest point in the phone
it's pretty much the same thing we saw
in the Nexus 6p back in the day now Oppo
does include a case in the box so if you
do own this phone slap that on as soon
as possible any protection helps the
phone's released this year have been
awesome the bezel is high-tech motorized
phones like the find X are great but in
the mathematical quest for the perfect
durable smartphone the find X is the
equivalent of texting your ex just don't
hit that subscribe button to be notified
about future durability tests and come
hang out with me on Instagram and
Twitter thanks dumb for watching and
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
