the fuel filter on a 1990 Jeep Wrangler
this little guy right here is the fuel
filter so on your filter itself I
already have the new replacement part
they're pretty cheap on Amazon so I'm
going to put a link in the video
description below for that and then in
the filter itself you can see it says in
right here that's saying from the gas
tank into the filter and on the outside
that's going out to the engine the
gasoline it's a little bit easier on
this type of fuel filter because there's
two nozzles on the side that goes to the
engine and one nozzle on the other side
I have worked with other jeeps in the
past I think the four-cylinder Jeep the
fuel filter is underneath by that back
tire but on this particular six-cylinder
engine is right here by the by the head
anyway so I'm going to go ahead and take
out these three screws right here right
here and right here to loosen up the
hoses one thing you also have to
remember while doing this is that there
is gas in that filter so there is going
to be a lot of leakage I wouldn't
imagine there's going to be more than
3/4 of a cup half a cup in there I was
going to take some paper towels and put
it up underneath the engine to absorb
all that extra gas
and there you go there's the old filter
right there a lot of people online
recommend changing needs about every
30,000 miles or so or every two years a
lot of the manufacturers say that they
never need to be replaced so it's just
kind of depends on what you want to do
I personally every time I get a new
vehicle I swap out the fuel filter just
because you never know what kind of gas
has been in it before one bad tank of
gas could mess up a fuel filter and
they're cheap enough as you can see from
the link in the video description I'm
going to take my new filter and just pop
it in the same hoses that it was in
before and then tighten down those same
screws
there you go that's how you change the
fuel filter on a Jeep Wrangler thanks
for watching
so I smashed open the old filter you can
kind of see like this is just what
filters out the old gas is just like a
bunch of little cardboard like paper
strips almost and the gas inside of this
was a lot Brown a lot more Brown than
what it should be you know when gas
comes out of the nozzle it's kind of
like a golden color this is like a dirty
brown so it's definitely time to switch
this thing out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
