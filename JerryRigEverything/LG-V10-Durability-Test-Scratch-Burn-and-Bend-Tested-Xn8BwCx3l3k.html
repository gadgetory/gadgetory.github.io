this phone has been very popular among
some of the top reviewers on YouTube
mkbhd even put it second place for the
top big phones of 2015 right behind the
Samsung Note 5 let's see how it holds up
to my durability tests we'll start with
the scratch test
just like in my previous videos I have a
set of picks that let me see where the
glass of the LG v10 falls on Mohs scale
of hardness the LG v10 has Gorilla Glass
4 so it's no surprise that my picks
leave no mark up until level 6 you can
see a slight scratch and then a level 7
pick leaves a pretty hefty groove this
means that you don't have to worry about
keys or coins scratching your device
when it's rolling around in your pockets
or purse now onto the camera lens this
phone is a bit different normally when I
have tested camera lenses like on the
Moto X pure edition or even the iPhone
6s the glass is consistent with the
front screen and resists a level 6
picker higher this particular camera
lens scratches at a level 5 but that
still is pretty tough especially when
compared to the plastic rear camera lens
of the BlackBerry Prive which scratches
at a level 3 the back of the LG v10 is
removable it is covered with a
high-quality rubber coating you can see
how thick it is as my razor blade slices
through it it is very scratch resistant
and my keys leave no mark when I press
them hard up against the surface the
front plastic at the bottom and top of
the screen scratches very easily though
it will get marked up by keys or coins a
unique addition to this phone is the
stainless steel sides most smartphone
manufacturers use aluminum nowadays so
it's nice to have something a little
classier and stronger running down the
sides of the device it scratches much
less than aluminum would in the same
situations and is tougher overall on to
the extreme heat test while I'm sure
none of you plan on holding your phone
over open flame it is still interesting
to compare how the different flagship
devices handle extreme situations some
phones get permanently damaged like the
oneplus X or the Nexus 6p but this
particular phone does not you can see
the pixels go black and turn off from
the heat but they turn on again as soon
as the heat is removed and the screen
cools down the heat does not remain
inside the IPS LCD screen for long I am
able to touch it with my fingers just
seconds after removing the flame let's
get
LG a thumbs up for a quality display now
the bend test this is one of my
favorites when I try my hardest to bend
the device you can tell that it has a
decent amount of flex to it but there is
no catastrophic failure like the HTC m9
or the Nexus 6p even when trying to bend
the phone from the front it still
remains intact the stainless steel body
probably has some structural integrity
to it it'll be fun to see how the sides
are integrated with the rest the device
when I take it apart tomorrow hit that
subscribe button if you enjoy seeing
top-of-the-line devices durability
tested and torn down to assess repair
ability thanks ton for watching let me
know in the comments below if you have
any questions or would like me to add
any other tests to smartphone durability
videos in the future hope see you around
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
