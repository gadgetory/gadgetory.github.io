X is ready for my teardown with a fully
functional display on both sides of the
phone it'll be interesting to see how
this is put together from the inside and
how it differs from you know a normal
single screen phone let's get started
I'm usually one of the first people
opening up brand new phones to explore
the insides and a phone with
back-to-back screens is definitely in
uncharted territory I'm going in blind
I'm going to assume that the back is
what comes off first
one wrong move though and the whole
phone might get destroyed heat and large
suction cups are my best friends when
opening up glued shut glass sandwiches
the heat softens the adhesive and allows
my razor blade to slip in and slice
through the black sticky stuff holding
the phone halves together if my metal
pry tool or razor blade gets too deep
though I might end up damaging some of
the sensitive ribbons the battery or the
rear screen this time around and since I
have no idea what I'm in for I'm going
pretty slow and being super careful
after a little gap is created I can tell
that this green ribbon cable is up along
the top and I can fold the back glass
away from the phone without putting any
stress on the fragile ribbons they can
tear like paper no normally it's a bad
idea to wake the patient up halfway
through an operation but it might be
pretty cool so let's try this I don't
believe that man's ever been to medical
school even with the rear glass panel
and back screen completely removed from
the phone everything is still working
thumbs up for that the AMOLED display
has its one wire connection reaching
back towards the motherboard with
everything being so incredibly thin the
extra screen doesn't really add any bulk
to the phone itself we'll put the
patient back to sleep again and see what
else is inside the phone normally I try
to disconnect the battery first so
there's no power running through the
device but everything is still hidden
under this large black sticker and also
screwed in and held down under the top
metal plate so I'll risk it unscrewing
the little silver latch over the rear
AMOLED connector and pop it off with my
plastic pry tool just like a little Lego
a clear phone definitely won't be
possible this time around trying to
remove a display panel that's glued to
glasses like brain surgery on a potato
chip something is gonna crack so I'll be
leaving it alone this time around the
table metal plate has eight screws
holding an
place I'll remove those setting them off
to the side in an organized fashion
there's one little ribbon cable for the
rear sensors still attached to the
motherboard I'll unplug the battery
though first with my plastic pry tool
and then proceed to the small sensor
ribbon I'll remove the dual SIM card
tray and then make my way to the row of
ribbons down at the bottom the right
finger print scanner ribbon the charging
port ribbon the front LCD screen ribbon
and the left finger print scanner ribbon
down here at the bottom of the phone it
has its own seven screws the plastic
loudspeaker can't quite pull away on its
own yet though it has one of those black
wire cables built-in going all the way
up at the top motherboard the large
silver internal battery has no magic
bullet apps it's one of those permanent
pry it out and hope it doesn't explode
style batteries but the adhesive isn't
too bad this time around it's a pretty
big 3,800 milliamp hour battery the
charging port has one gold ribbon
connector a single black wire cable and
one tiny silver screw holding it in
place after that the whole thing can
lift up and pull away from the phone
along with this large coin style
vibration motor that's soldered onto the
board it's got a little circular white
water damage indicator this bone is not
water resistant and of course we have
the USB C port down here as well making
our way back up to the top we can see
the ribbon path from both fingerprint
scanners that plug into each side of the
motherboard the motherboard itself has
one screw holding it in place by the
little square earpiece speaker and then
the whole thing can pull away from the
phone body revealing its bubble gum like
thermal paste that uses the aluminum
frame of the phone as a giant heatsink
the rear camera connectors are hidden
under this metallic tape the Nubia X has
16 megapixel and 24 megapixel cameras no
wide-angle or telephoto lenses just that
portrait mode stuff
neither of the lenses have optical image
stabilization these dual cameras also
double as the front-facing selfie
cameras when the rear screen is
activated pretty unique the front LCD
screen is glued into the metal housing
you can see the ribbon cable coming up
through a hole in the frame any attempt
to remove the front glass screen for
metal frame will probably result in a
shattering so I would only attempt a
screen replacement when it's already too
broken to be useful anymore the rear
screen replacements a piece of cake
compared to the front screen as long as
you can replace the whole back glass
panel at the same time the motherboard
is back in place with its one screw
along with the charging port board and
it's coin style vibrator it's pretty
ingenious to have
Green's on both sides of the phone
definitely solves the notch issue and
allows for better looking
larger edge-to-edge front displays it's
always refreshing to see something
unique and innovative in the smartphone
world when most of the big smartphone
companies are playing it pretty safe the
batteries back in place and all the
ribbon cables are plugged in including
the battery ribbon which clips on last
the top metal plate with this little
ribbon is back in place and the 15
screws for both the top and the bottom
boards are all screwed back in as well
here's the moment of truth as we take
the rear back glass panel with its
AMOLED display and plug it back into the
motherboard it's got a silver metal
bracket to keep the connector from
coming loose definitely an impressive
design the simplicity of adding a rear
display to the phone changes basically
nothing from a normal glass packed phone
like a Samsung or oneplus just one rear
ribbon to watch out for like we would
have anyway with a rear mounted
fingerprint scanner I'm impressed with
how simple it is and surprised we
haven't seen it before now I'm even more
surprised though when I fold the glass
screen back over hit the power button
and the whole thing still turns on it's
alive and functioning just fine do you
think dual sided smartphones are the way
of the future or is this more of a
gimmick that'll fade away with time let
me know down in the comments come hang
out with me on Instagram and Twitter
