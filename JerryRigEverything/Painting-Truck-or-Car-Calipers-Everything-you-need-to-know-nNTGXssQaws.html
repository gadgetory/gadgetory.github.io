caliper in my truck got a 98 Toyota
Tacoma nice tan the rooms right here
a lighter gray or darker gray and we're
going to be putting a copper colored
paint on the calipers so mostly you know
it's not something that's super visible
you know during your everyday driving
b√©zier as your wheels are spinning
you'll be more visible kind of a gloss
call it to it so yeah right now we're
just we have a jack up off the ground
we're taking the tires off that's right
now we're just scraping off all the dust
and the mud stuff that's on the
California all nice and clean surface to
paint on all right next step is to just
kind of isolate the caliper make sure
you put tape over all those inside you
know components because you don't want
paint on the on the actual rotor itself
and it's how it kind of works itself up
underneath the caliper and around the
backside so you don't get paint on
anything important the paint we're
actually using where does that go right
here it's actually a high temp paint so
it's a says it's good up to 1200 degrees
which I've worked out pretty well
because the calipers get pretty hot but
if they get you know up to a thousand
two hundred degrees you have more
problems on your hand besides a chipping
paint so
all right we're doing a second ago we
waited prod out ten minutes or so now
our eyes when you're spray-painting want
to make sure you keep it about you know
you know 10 to 12 inches away and then I
do a short verse just so I don't get any
runs or drips or anything going off of
this just kind of like that make a
church non drip and this is the third
show we're going to be three
all right so we took off all the tape
and the towels one thing you want to do
is if you're going to let it dry
overnight one important thing is to do
take off the tape though otherwise the
tape the paint on the tape sticks with
the paint on the caliper and it'll peel
off and chunks will just kind of like
peel off like a sunburn if you know I'm
talking about all right so the truck you
can see the caliper right inside of
there obviously as the wheels spinning
you're going to be able to see it a lot
better it's a lot more noticeable than
that a black just kind of faded black
color it was before anyway I'm so young
that's how you paint the calipers on
your car if you have any questions be
sure to ask me in the comments if itself
to make sure you like it and subscribe
thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
