91 jeep wranglers is working at the Y
J's um basically of better shaitana
shock mount already so we have the shock
right there and we've got the bottom
bolt we got the top hold and that's on
the passenger side are you good these
are nineteen millimeters um I've already
taken these ones out that's what that
looks like here just can I got the
washer and the nut and then a little
spacer right there that you can put the
shotgun so the shock usually comes
pre-built like this with a little rhythm
pulling it in place and you're going to
want to mount on the bottom into which
is this end over here in place before
you break that ribbon because it's
pretty hard to compress them once
they're uncompressed and then when you
do it at the top end it will kind of
spring out a little bit and you just
want to line it up with the the top of
the mount and I'll kind of show you how
to do that
okay I cut that ribbon and expanded up
into the Jeep
you know these things are pretty strong
so I had to kind of manhandle it on that
little bolt there anyways once you get
most of the way on you can get this knot
there you just tighten that snug and
then I'll push it as you can kind of see
it's a little bit gap right there but as
you tighten it it'll pull a whole shock
and I'm into the car so and I do it you
like to have the letters and stuffs
facing outward so that on the next guy
when you comes along you can read what
part number it is you know not to use e
from the bolts or anything like that
very straightforward it bolts off
sometimes to break or more and then some
people like to say that the shocks need
like a boot or a sleeve to protect that
with my research that I've done online
you know yeah it's nice and yet helps
but you know you don't need it in every
case a lot of shocks are designed to
kind of before they're designed to not
let dirt and stuff inside of them right
there so these ones should be fine
without the without the boot but you
know some people like them for aesthetic
purposes as well anyway that's how you
put shocks on a on a YJ Jeep Wrangler</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
