down galaxy s7 etrade supply and notice
that I destroyed my old screen during
the removal process and they were kind
enough to send me out a replacement so
thank you very much for that before I
put this phone back together let's just
appreciate for one quick second how
thick this aluminium frame is and if you
remember one of my complaints about the
Nexus 6p was that none of the screws
went into metal if you look at this s7
all of the screws go into metal it is
one very well-built phone the only
downside is it sent it's glued shut it's
kind of hard to work on so let's get
going like always replacement tools and
replacement parts like screens and
charging ports will be linked down in
the video description below the
fingerprint scanner will slide through
the frame and then sit down in that
little slot that was built for it the
charging port also needs to slip through
the frame before we can put the screen
back on push the charging port down into
little slot itself at the bottom of the
phone making sure the buttons wrap
around to the front side there are two
screws on the charging port and then
make sure the buttons are sitting down
inside of the little groove that they're
made for the back button and the menu
button there should be a little bit of
leftover residue on the buttons
themselves so they'll stick down and
hold themselves tight now some
replacement screens will come with
adhesive built into the panel
other screens require double-sided tape
to be set down inside of the frame you
can buy professional adhesive I would
recommend doing that if you're going to
do this repair for customers here is a
replacement screen I'm going to remove
the protective plastic and then slip the
screen connector through the frame
making sure that the connector is not
bent or pinched it all inside of the
frame itself I'm going to use the
earpiece to help line up the slot on the
top of the screen with the phone and
then the home button is well on the
bottom making sure that it all sits
tight down inside of the frame it's a
perfect fit now we can work on the
headphone jack
slip that down inside of the groove and
then put one screw on the side of that
as well now remember that the charging
port does connect to the bottom side of
the motherboard so clip that in and then
you can set the motherboard down into
place making sure not to pinch any of
the other connectors underneath the
motherboard because we will need to plug
those in once all those connectors are
on the right side of the phone we can
take the fingerprint scanner and press
that down into frame same thing with the
power button and the screen itself push
the front-facing camera down into his
little slot same thing with the earpiece
and the front sensors and then the
volume buttons on the side also get
plugged into the mainboard
there are two wire cables that rest
the charging port and the motherboard so
get those down into place sitting down
inside that little groove and then we
can take the battery it's gonna be the
last thing that we plug in and push that
into the motherboard we can't test the
phone at this point which is a good idea
make sure everything's functional before
we put the back tape and put the back
glass back down everything is good we're
going to turn the phone back off again
flip it around and then put all the back
plastics on I'm going to start down here
with the loudspeaker set that into place
making sure that I don't pinch any of
the wire cables in the wrong spot then
the wireless charger goes on and the top
plastic piece and there's a bunch of
screws around the backside get a little
screw it into place then we have the
funky golden band-aid we're going to put
that back down into place if anyone has
any idea what this is for please leave a
comment down below there's even some pre
drawn brackets for it I have no idea why
they would put a gold sticker on there
there is professional adhesive available
for the rear backs I will link that down
in the video description below and
everything is good if you have any
questions leave them down in the
comments subscribe if you haven't
already and follow me on Instagram and
Twitter for behind the scenes and future
projects and one big last thank you to
eat trade supply for sending me out the
replacement screen thank you so much for
watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
