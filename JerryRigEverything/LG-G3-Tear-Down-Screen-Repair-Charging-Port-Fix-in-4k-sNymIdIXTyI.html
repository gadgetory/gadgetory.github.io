here with the LG g3 today we're going to
take it apart show you how to fix
everything on it the screen is actually
pretty difficult but I'll explain that
in a second we're going to go ahead and
take off the back of the phone the
battery the SD card and the SIM card if
you have one in there and then there are
11 screws around the outside of the
phone as well as 2 screws right next to
the camera go ahead and take those all
out and then I found it was easiest to
take my pry tool and put it up right
around the corner of the phone and that
would kind of release all the little
clasps on the back plastic housing on
the top one really cool thing I like
about this phone is that this power
button right here is connected to a
bunch of little connections or
connectors right inside of the top that
connect onto the motherboard so if your
power button ever stops working make
sure all these little connections are
clean and they're not bent and that
should fix any power button issues that
you've been having there is the
loudspeaker down at the bottom of the
phone and if you ever need to replace
this it's kind of the same deal as the
power button you have the two little
connectors right there as well as the
silver speaker itself and there's a
chance it would come with the plastic
housing when you buy the parts or you
would just need to swap it from your old
phone to your new phone there are four
ribbon cables connecting the motherboard
to the housing lift all those up you got
the front camera rear camera and then
you have the screen stuff down here at
the bottom remember any replacement
tools and parts will be found in the
video description below right below this
video is where that's at so go ahead and
look there if you need any of these
replacement parts the motherboard lifts
up and out make sure not to kink any
those ribbon cables that you just pulled
off nothing else is really replaceable
on the motherboard
you have the charging port down here at
the bottom but as you can see it's
soldered in there's really no easy way
to go about repair repairing that unless
you have specialized soldering tools
same thing kind of goes for the SD card
slot and SIM card slot I still think
Samsung has the most repairable phones
out of all of the smart phones but you
know LG is doing pretty well the
front-facing camera does pop out and
shoot across the room it can be replaced
pretty easily same thing with the
rear-facing camera if you ever need to
get those out and clean them or anything
like that they're just kind of held in
with double sided tape
remember any replacement tools and
replacement parts
found in the video description below so
go ahead and check that out and also
don't forget to leave any questions down
in the comments I do respond relatively
regularly once that's back in you can
see that the earpiece also pops out if
you ever need to clean any metal
shavings or anything out of the top of
that relatively easily and then you have
your just left over with the screen so
the screen is the glass on the front
then the LCD which actually displays
your content and then the plastic frame
so there's a good chance when you buy
your screen it won't come with the
plastic frame so go ahead and just heat
the phone up to about eighty or a
hundred degrees Celsius and that will
allow the glue to separate from the
frame and your old screen so keep that
in mind if you ever decide to repair the
screen by yourself now I'm going to go
ahead and pop the motherboard back into
place making sure that the ribbon cables
are not kinked or anything below the
motherboard when I put them in remember
they kind of snap in just like Legos
you'll definitely know when they click
into place go ahead and clip the top two
in and then the bottom two down that
kind of are in charge of the screen and
the LCD and clip those into place once
again if you have any questions make
sure to leave them in the comments down
below and then as you're putting in the
bottom plastic part just make sure all
the edges are clipped in same thing with
the top clip all those edges in around
the outside and then make sure to get
all of the screws in there you got the
11 around the outside and the two by the
camera put your phone back together
again hit that power button and you're
done feel any questions leave in the
comments I do respond fairly regularly
and don't forget to follow me on
Instagram and subscribe to my youtube
