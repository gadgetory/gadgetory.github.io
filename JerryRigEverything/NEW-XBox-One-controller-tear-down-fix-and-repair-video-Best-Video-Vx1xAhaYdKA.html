one controller we're going to be taking
it apart today and seeing what's inside
to start off there are these little
ridges down along the bottom that you
can pop off the plastic piece this is a
series of little snaps that connect the
plastic piece to the actual controller
itself so you can see there's two up at
the top three at the bottom and then two
on the other side same thing with this
one over here you have to be kind of
aggressive with it but they are pretty
sturdy then to get the four screws out
from the controller you have to have
that special bit that has a little hole
in the center of it Microsoft use these
special security screws to keep this
thing shut and there's one more screw
hidden underneath this plastic label
underneath the battery cover so I'm
going to pop that out as well and then
that releases the front plate of the
Xbox controller exposing the buttons and
the vibrators beneath I'm also going to
pop off the back plate where the
batteries are held as you can see and
then this is the whole controller
nothing's really replaceable on it which
is kind of disappointing I'm you can see
the vibrators right here there are two
different sizes
I guess that gives kind of two different
feels depending on what happens in the
gameplay then you can kind of see that
even cleaning out the buttons would be
pretty difficult at this point there's
not a whole lot of room to go off of
and then so here's the vibrators like I
mentioned before there's also two little
hidden vibrating motors hidden up in the
triggers which I thought was pretty
interesting as you can see right here
you can see that the bigger vibrating
motors can actually pop out but they're
not replaceable because they are
soldered into the motherboard and now
I'm just going to put on the back
plastic again they can
to line up the screw holes and the front
plastic goes over the buttons again
pressing that into place and then before
I screw down the back plastic I'm making
sure that these big trigger buttons are
put underneath so they can keep on
moving if you tighten it down while the
chairs are on the outside then the
triggers will be stuck in the out
position even a screw tighten down into
place and then getting those four screws
making sure all the buttons still work
they're not stuck at all getting those
four screws put back into place and then
the back plastics clicked in you can
hear how they how solid they are the
controller is by no means fragile you
can get replacement controllers on
Amazon I'll put a link in the
description below usually they're pretty
cheap if you have any questions make
sure to leave them in the comments don't
