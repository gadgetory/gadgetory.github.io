end of 2016 this water-resistant
rectangular phone from Sony survived my
durability tests and now it's time to
open it up see what makes it so strong
and see what can be replaced let's get
started
the screen replacement process for the
Xperia XE is actually really really
similar to the Google pixel there is a
thin band of adhesive around the entire
front glass of the phone remember that
this phone is water-resistant so if you
are doing a screen or battery
replacement your phone will not be
water-resistant when you put it back
together again right now I'm taking my
heat gun and warming up the edges of the
phone until it's just barely too hot to
touch this softens the adhesive and
makes it more pliable softer and easier
to work with I use some business cards
or playing cards to cut through the
adhesive around the edge after my super
thin metal pry tool does the initial
penetration the LCD panel under the
glass panel is very fragile
so keep your tools away from that black
part especially if you are planning on
reusing your screen there is one ribbon
cable attaching it at the motherboard so
I'll remove the bracket holding that in
place and then unsnap the connector just
like a little Lego so this is what the
screen replacement looks like I'll
include a link in the video description
for the replacement screens you can
check that for current pricing since
that always does change with time
luckily Sony screens aren't too
expensive even when the phone is new my
screen is still functioning after the
removal but that is only because I've
done this procedure hundreds of times if
this is your first time removing a glued
down screen like this don't plan on it
still functioning after the screen is
taken off it is extremely fragile and a
bit harder than it looks on video this
type of design is really brilliant if
your screen is already broken you can
replace a broken screen without touching
any of the internal components and I
really love that about Sony's let's see
how the rest of the phone looks there is
one screw holding down the little metal
bracket over the battery connector and
this needs to be removed and the battery
unplugged before doing anything else
make sure to use a plastic tool to
disconnect the battery connector metal
will cause a short and might ruin your
phone once the battery is unsnapped and
this little copper tape is pulled away
there are nine more screws holding down
the middle metal mid frame make sure you
keep all of your screws organized and
here is my second favorite part of this
phone the battery is attached to the mid
frame and completely pulls out away from
the phone body away from all the fragile
electronics on the top of this mid plate
it has the NFC pad on it which is
located on the front of the
right under the screen the two little
gold contact points rests right on the
motherboard interesting placement but
hey if it works it works and let me tell
you why having the battery attach the
mid frame like this is a good idea
you see these magical pull tabs under
the battery these are supposed to help
you remove the battery without a lot of
force or prying but sometimes they do
snap forcing you to attempt a prime and
when the battery is right next to a
motherboard like on any of the iPhones
prying becomes very difficult because
you don't want to put any pressure on or
damage any of the fragile components
when the battery is adhered to a
removable mid frame like this you can
just pull it away from the phone and
there's nothing to damage if you're
forced to start prying pretty darn smart
on sony's part now obviously I should
have removed the SIM card tray before
starting this repair I seem to always
forget that step but at least I use my
blinker while I'm driving
you win some and you lose some this
little black card pulls out of the SIM
tray and has your phone's IMEI and other
information so that's something new
let's take a look at this charging port
in order to get at the charging port
there is one screw holding down a little
black plastic bracket and here is the
part that I don't like about Sony phones
there is actually a ton of little
plastic brackets inside of this phone
they did the same mumbo-jumbo over on
the z5 premium too there is a bracket
for the charging port another over the
signal wires one over the motherboard
and another under the camera Sony was
doing such a good job of keeping things
simple up until this point anyway back
to the charging port a ton plugs from
the main board and then there is a
signal wire to unplug from the bottom
board and then the whole thing will just
pull up and away from the base of the
phone there's a couple interesting
things here first we have that rubber
ring around the charging port itself
this will help keep water out of the
phone but the board itself does not have
any of the clear glue covering the
components like an iPhone or a samsung
sometimes have so I still recommend not
trusting any kind of waterproofing and
just keeping your phone dry as much as
you can the little plastic side board
with its two signal wires can pop out
next and then we can work on the
motherboard there is yet another black
plastic bracket thing up here
surrounding the cameras and this one is
actually pretty hard to remove
after it's out the motherboard and has
two cameras can pull away from the frame
there is no optical image stabilizing on
these cameras the rear is a 23 megapixel
camera and the front is a 13 megapixel
camera they do have electronic
stabilization No maybe I'll have to do a
side-by-side camera test on this phone
let me know in the comments which phone
you want me to put it up against check
out the adhesive around this headphone
jack there is no way water is getting in
around this port maybe Apple can learn a
couple things from Sony the jack itself
just has a small plug that snaps into
the motherboard the only bad part about
reassembling this phone is that there
are so many seemingly pointless plastic
brackets to put back into place Sony is
really the only company that does this
I'm making sure the motherboard is set
in place without blocking any of the
ribbon cable connectors and then I can
snap in the extension ribbon the
headphone jack and then try to get the
top black plastic bracket back into
place as well as I can it never fits
quite right the second time around the
side plastic goes into place with this
little signal wires and I'll tuck those
into the grooves that came from and then
I can get the charging port pushed back
into the little slot remember that the
phone is no longer water-resistant since
I took it completely apart there is a
black plastic bracket down here in the
corner with its little screw and I'll
get the signal wires plugged in over
there little circular connections on the
board the little vibration motors in the
very corner of this phone then you can
see that here spinning the plastic
brackets go into place on the right side
of the motherboard and then I'll clip in
the charging port extension ribbon and
the two little signal wires I'll add on
a couple other random plastic bits and
the battery if I do get a replacement
battery it'll probably have its own
adhesive but I'm just going to reuse the
one I have and set it back into place
then set the middle metal mid frame down
over it there are a total of 10 screws
now that we're screwing in don't forget
the little metal bracket over the
battery plug that is important and if
you kept your screws organized during
this entire process it'll be pretty easy
plugging in the new screen is simple
enough just make sure the plug protector
is in place this helps make sure that
the connection won't come loose if your
phone has ever dropped your replacement
screen should come with its own adhesive
as well I'll have to add some of my own
since I'm just reusing my original
screen but everything is still working I
super appreciate the EZ screen
replacement and the easy battery replace
since those are the two most common
repairs that people will do on this
phone but the rest of the phone is kind
of a design nightmare and that's fine
since the average person will never need
to get that far inside of the phone it
is interesting to see though let me know
a phone you want to see tested and torn
down next in the comments I do read the
comments and I'm always looking for new
devices to check out come follow me on
Instagram and Twitter and that's where
the real party is at thanks for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
