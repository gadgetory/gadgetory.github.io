edition this is the 2015 version if you
are not in the USA this same phone is
called the moto style just like always I
take smartphones and test their
durability it's nice to know the limits
of your device so you can always stay
within a safe operating range let's
start with the scratch test I have a set
of tools that will allow me to tell
where the hardness of the screen falls
on Mohs scale of hardness the pure
edition is actually rockin Gorilla Glass
3
apparently the main difference between
Gorilla Glass 3 and the newer Gorilla
Glass 4 is that 4 has an eye on silver
antimicrobial coating on the top while
Gorilla Glass 3 is slightly thicker it
does not have the antimicrobial coating
as I'm going through the test I was
surprised to see that my level 6 pick
did not scratch the glass my level 7
left a small mark and the level 8 left a
deeper groove Gorilla Glass 4 scratches
a whole level sooner than Gorilla Glass
3 probably because that ion silver
coating on top of the glass is just a
tad softer than the glass itself either
way they are almost the same exact
hardness with this phone scratches
should be a little less of a worry than
usual
you'll still have to watch out for sand
and some of the harder minerals you'll
never have to worry about your keys or
coins scuffing up your screen let's
check out the back the back rubber has a
pretty nice feel to it
you can hear the ridges as Mikey scrapes
over the top pretty durable and my keys
don't leave much of a mark the razor on
the other hand can slice through the
rubber and you can see here as I shave
it off that it is surprisingly thick now
onto one of my favorite tests scratching
the camera lens I personally think that
having a durable camera lens is just as
important as having a scratch proof
screen the 21 megapixel camera on the
pure edition would be pretty worthless
if the lens scratches easily luckily you
can see that my razor blade does not
damage the lens plus it has a huge
protective wall around it so the chances
of anything touching the lens anyway is
pretty small pretty good camera design
onto the burn test the pure addition has
a 5.7 inch IPS LCD display similar to
what the iPhone screens use the lighter
will heat up the pixels until they turn
off and go black but then they fully
recover once the heat is removed from
the screen the only phone that did not
survive this
heat test was the Nexus 6p the 6p pixels
went white turned off and never came
back to life again but as you can see
the Motorola X pure edition fully
recovered and there's no mark on the
screen indicating it was ever burned
onto the bin test the Moto X pure has a
metal body with a total of twenty-one
screws holding the metal frame to the
front housing this allows the phone to
bend and flex quite a bit but there are
no obvious weak points I even twist the
phone a little bit to check the metal
near the power and volume buttons and
noting the phone is solid it will be
just fine in the back pocket of your
skinny jeans I am very impressed with
this phone the quality's on par with
galaxy s6 and the price point is way
cheaper thanks ton for watching feel
free to check out my smartphone
durability playlist if this is the first
video you've watched a mind you have a
lot of catching up to do
thanks for subscribing hope to see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
