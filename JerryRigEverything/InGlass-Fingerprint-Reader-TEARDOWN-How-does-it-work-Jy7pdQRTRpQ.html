open up the VEVO X 20 plus and see what
that in screen fingerprint scanner looks
like from the inside even though this
phone survived my durability test at the
end
the screen went black when it got
cracked over the top of the fingerprint
scanner so now let's see how it's all
put together and see what can be
replaced let's get started
there are two visible screws at the
bottom of the vivo x20 both of which are
82 screw I'll link the tool kit I use
and any replacement parts I find in the
video description like usual once those
screws are out I'll slip my metal pry
tool between the plastic edge of the
screen and the metal edge of the phone
I've taken apart several other phones
with a similar build to this and it's
held together with a series of clasps
around the outside so a few
strategically placed pry tools should be
able to pop the screen out of the back
metal housing luckily since my screen is
already shattered I don't have to worry
too much about being gentle and keeping
it in one piece there is a little bit of
adhesive holding the back to the front
panel but there's nothing special
attached to that back metal so I'll set
it off to the side and start taking out
the three screws holding down the large
C shaped bracket and then I'll set that
off of the side and next to the screws
to keep things organized this phone is
pretty complex inside unfortunately I'll
unclip the battery driven cable first
and then the button ribbon and then the
charging port ribbon unsnaps like a
little Lego which is actually super
interesting because the microUSB
charging port is only held in place by
two little screws down here at the
bottom then the whole port comes out
this is literally the easiest charging
port replacement that I've ever seen
there's two screws holding down one more
silver bracket over the two extension
ribbons that I'll explain in a second
I'll fold those down gently making sure
not to kink anything and then grab the
little green battery pull tab and remove
it from the frame the 3900 milliamp
power battery is actually pretty easy to
remove and to replace compared to other
mainstream phones the motherboard has an
incredibly small eccentric rotating mass
vibration motor tucked over here
underneath the camera you can see how it
rotates and spins around on its little
motor I'll remove four more screws that
are holding down the motherboard and
unclip one of the two main camera
ribbons over here on the side just like
a little Lego same here with the
earpiece resting in the center of the
motherboard there are two wire cables a
white and a black one on either side of
the phone then the motherboard can pull
up and away from the phone body looking
at the motherboard we get a close-up
view at the sim and SD card tray along
with the dual camera setup both 12
megapixel vivo doesn't advertise oh why
yes so this little movement and the lens
might just be the focusing mechanism
moseying are way down at the bottom of
the phone to look for that in screen
fingerprint scanner we find another a
screws I'll keep these organized by
setting them on the table next to me
arranged in the same shape they were
well inside the phone the black plastic
pops off revealing the loudspeaker and
protective plastics and then all we have
left attached to the phone is the
extension ribbon for the headphone jack
then the headphone jack itself and
finally the last remaining ribbon now
the screen is very permanently glued on
to this metal frame and by permanent I
mean any attempt to remove the screen
will end up breaking the display and the
glass luckily mine is already broken so
I don't have too much to worry about
but it will all need to be removed in
order for us to get a glimpse of how
that fingerprint scanner functions I've
been warming up the phone with a heat
gun getting it barely too hot to touch
this softens the adhesive under the
screen allowing my thin metal pry tool
to slip in between the glass and the
plastic edge cutting through the soft
esup the display has the fragility of a
potato chip underneath that glass so
this definitely destroys the display and
this is also why I only remove phone
screens that are already completely
broken when they're glued in like this
once my fried tool has cleared all the
adhesive around the edges the whole
thing can pull up and away from the
frame if I were to replace the screen
right now I would just clean up that
frame and reuse it with the new screen
finally we get to see the backside of
the in display fingerprint scanner it's
got a little latch style connector tying
it into the screen ribbon cable I'll
unlock that with my plastic pry tool and
very carefully pull the fingerprint
scanner up and away from the back of the
screen it's very lightly adhered to the
slot that it's sitting in and it is
pulling away with some of the little
bits of fragile AMOLED display attached
to it you can see inside the slot the
screen has different layers the clear
glass layer on the outside and then that
brownish display layer made up of tiny
LEDs that I compared to a fragile potato
chip and then finally this little
rectangular fingerprint scanner called
the FS 9500 made by a company called
synaptics that little orange block in
the center is the sensor that captures
the image of your fingerprint and turns
it into an equation based off of the
contrasting points of your fingerprint
ridges this sensor is designed to work
pretty much covered and in close range
so it's not the exact same as the
colorful normal camera sensor like the
one we saw inside of the LGV 30 tear
down both of the cameras are designed
for different tasks but it's still
interesting to see the two sensors side
by side thumbs up for that let's take a
closer look at
the display panel since the fingerprint
scanner essentially takes a picture
through the LEDs displaying the images
you see with your eyes on the phone
display the shards are semi translucent
and you can see light to the rectangle
where the sensor used to be the only
reason the rest of the display is as
black as it is is because of this black
layer of tape covering the AMOLED panel
without this black layer of tape the
rest of the panel becomes as translucent
as the little rectangle above the
fingerprint scanner confirmed by the
translucent nests under Neath the tape
that I peeled away pretty fascinating
stuff like mkbhd said in his video he
really can't put that finger print
scanner anywhere and make it as large as
you want since it just works underneath
the LED panel lbh seemed to see how the
technology improves and progresses this
is the first phone ever with an N screen
fingerprint scanner and I imagine we'll
see it more often in the future and I'll
definitely be here to show it to you
from the inside so make sure you're
subscribed normally at this point I
would put the phone back together but I
don't have the replacement screen on
hand yet so it'll have to wait come hang
out with me on Instagram and Twitter and
let me know what other phones you want
to see the insides of thanks Don for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
