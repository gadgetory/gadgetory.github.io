inside a pixel the latest Android phone
from Google I'll show a screen
replacement how to swap the battery and
even take out the charging board let's
get started while the phone is glued
shut the screen replacement is
surprisingly easy especially if you
don't care about your original screen
anymore
I'm going to use heat to soften the
adhesive around the inside edges and
then using a very thin pry tool slide
between the glass and the metal frame of
the phone a good rule of thumb is to
just not plan on your screen surviving
this process but if all you need to do
is replace a battery or something and
you want to keep your screen make sure
the metal does not touch the black part
of the screen under the glass the black
part is the display or the LED the top
glass can handle some abuse but the LED
underneath is like a potato chip and
will crack and crumble if you even look
at it the wrong way you'll see the
ribbon cables to avoid here in a second
as well they have the strength of paper
so try not to rip them either I'm
heating up the screen about every 20 to
30 seconds keeping the glass barely too
hot to touch this keeps the adhesive
that holds the glass to the frame soft
and pliable each time I stick my tool
under the glass I keep it away from the
display underneath and after removing
the adhesive all the way around the
frame the screen lifts off exposing one
long ribbon cable I tested my screen at
this point to see if I was successful
during the removal process luckily I was
able to remove my screen in one piece I
turned the phone off again and then
loosened up the two t5 screws holding
the silver bracket in place over the
ribbon cable connection then using a
plastic pry tool I can unsnap the
display from the phone just like a
little Lego here is the entire display
the glass layer and the LED layer make
up the screen look how thin it is I will
link the replacement screens in the
video description right below this video
I imagine they will come with a
pre-installed adhesive making the
installation fairly easy if all you came
for was the screen repair just plop your
new one back in and you are good to go
I'm going to continue delving deeper
into this device there are nine more t5
screws around the mid plate it is always
good practice to keep your screws
organized even if they all appear the
same size put the screws back into the
hole they came from the mid frame has a
little gap at the bottom perfect for a
little pry tool there is no more
adhesive under this frame that is just
wedged into the middle of the phone
after the clasps are released the mid
frame folds up with one more little
ribbon cable at the top for the
earpiece holding it to the phone body
I'll unclip that and set it off to the
side and then unplug the battery this
helps keep anything else from frying as
I'm working on the phone there is a long
extension ribbon cable going from the
main board to the charging port the tape
is shaped a little bit different on each
of the ends it is imperative that this
gets connected back oriented the same
direction it started in so stay
organized and remember how it looks
before you take it off it looks like the
battery has a long strip right down the
middle so it can be turned into a
pull-tab rip the battery and then pull
it out but since I'm going to reuse my
battery I'll pop it out the
old-fashioned way with a little bit of
leverage do not puncture this battery or
it will start on fire watch my note
seven battery exploding video for that
visual
as always replacement batteries for this
phone will be linked in the video
description right below this video it is
fun that the aluminum frame of this
phone is as blue on the inside as it is
on the outside it really is really blue
there is one t5 screw holding the USBC
charging port into place the vibrator
motor comes out with it make sure to
detach the two round signal wires from
the bottom as well here is the charging
port if you are replacing your charging
port and the new one does not come with
a rubber microphone housing or vibrator
make sure to transfer those components
over to your new port this is the
loudspeaker it gets its signal from the
two golden rectangle contact pads there
at the edge it is held in place by that
same metallic tape that you see in other
places on this phone moving up around
the motherboard it has two t5 screws
holding it to the frame and two more of
those round signal wires
I'll unclip the power and volume ribbon
cable and pop out the SIM card tray
which I should have done before opening
the phone earlier but it's okay because
on this SIM card tray we find a little
easter egg this includes the address of
Google headquarters kind of fun
after that SIM card tray is out the
motherboard can be lifted up this part
is only useful if you are going to
replace the fingerprint scanner which is
plugged in with that same Lego light
connection as everything else as weas
off my durability video the scanner is
pretty durable but nothing is invincible
and someday might need replacing the
scanner can be pushed into the phone
from the outside now here's the back
glass panel which can probably be
removed using the same heating method
that we used with the front glass I'm
wondering if the curved edge of this
glass is refracting light into the
camera unit contributing to the halo
effect that some people are seeing on
their camera
pictures here is the motherboard the
copper tape is probably there to help
heat dissipation I'll be removing the
front and rear cameras both are plugged
in with the same little Lego connections
this close up of the camera lens shows
that neither of them are using any
Hardware stabilization or oh is only
electronic stabilization is being used
with this phone which isn't always my
favorite the HTC 10 had oh is or
Hardware image stabilization on both the
front and rear cameras I'll have to do a
camera test of my own on this pixel to
get a better opinion the cameras clip
back into place easy enough just line up
a little connector and you'll feel it
snap in right there next to the
beautiful and always useful and very
much appreciated headphone jack make
sure you're plugging in your fingerprint
scanner into the non copper colored side
of the motherboard and then when you put
the motherboard into place make sure
nothing is trapped underneath like the
power button ribbon or the two round
signal wires the loudspeaker drops into
place and then I'll plug the signal
wires into the bottom of the charging
port and set the charging port into
place inside the frame next to the
little vibrator there is one screw on
the charging port and two more screws on
the motherboard that need to be
tightened I'll set the battery into
place but I'm not going to plug it in
just yet before that happens I'll have
to take care of the extension ribbon
cable making sure that it's oriented in
the correct direction look at the shape
of the tape on the ends the phone will
not function if you plug this in
backwards ask me how I know after the
extension ribbon the power ribbon the
battery ribbon and the mid plate
earpiece ribbon are connected take that
mid frame and tuck the top into the
phone first before pressing down the
sides then use the 95 screws to hold
that down then we can test out our new
screen make sure it functions before
finishing the installation the screen is
plugged into place and get that little
silver metal bracket over the top with
its two screws and it looks like
everything is functioning so far the new
screen will sit flush with the outer
edge of the phone I'm just reinstalling
my old screen so it's not looking as
pretty but the new screens will look
much better I'm most active on Twitter
and Instagram so if you want to see my
future projects and behind the scenes
head over there and if you enjoyed this
