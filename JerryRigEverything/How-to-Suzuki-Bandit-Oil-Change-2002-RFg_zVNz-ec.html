the oil on a 2002 Suzuki Bandit to do
this project you're going to need
something to catch the oil in getting
the oil filter itself gloves oil a 21
millimeter socket wrench and then funnel
as well to boil it pour the oil in so we
start off right now the bike is warm I
took it around the block a couple times
just to make sure that the oil is going
to pour out easily right here underneath
the bike there is a drain plug so here's
a 21 millimeter side of the plug for the
oil so once I take this out oil is going
to start pulling pouring out of the
engine so you're going to want to have
something underneath to catch all of the
oil in all right so I broke the nut
loose right here with the wrench and
right now you're going to want to have
your gloves on something about oil
causing cancer to the citizens of
California I'm going to try not to lose
this down the oil bucket or burn myself
with the oil coming out of the engine
perfect okay so let all that drain out
so it's been sitting here for about four
or five minutes it's just barely
trickling out I mean says the bike is
warmer more oil has come out than it
would have if the bike was cold so I'm
going to go ahead and put the drain plug
back in just by cancer right now and
I'll tighten it in when I have more
space all right so here's the front of
the bike and the oil filter is right
here so now that we have the oil drained
out I'm going to go ahead and reach in
there and see if there's a wrench you
can use they'll grab on to the filter
and that'll make it easier to take off
I'll link that in the video description
below alright so some oil will start to
pour out of here
make sure you still have your bin
there we go let that drain out for a
second that's what the oil filter screws
onto okay so with the new filter which I
have right here you are going to want to
take some oil so I just have some of the
oil on my finger I'm going to take it
around the seal on the outside and this
will just help it stick to the engine
better I'm going to create as a better
you know seal between the filter and the
engine and once that's all covered I can
reach up into here and screw it back in
to that all right so now the new oil
filter is in place right here and as I'm
tightening it I'm just tightening it as
hard as I can with my hand I'm not using
any tools to tighten it because you
don't want to crush the filter itself so
now that that's on now I can ditch this
oil pan
I can tighten down that screw down there
the oil drain bolt and I can fill her up
with oil okay so the oil fill is right
here on the top of the engine this one
just needs a little bit over three
quarts you can kind of see that sweet
valve a milliliter there and then we
have the oil fill window right here you
can see low and full so I'm going to go
ahead and put the three quarts in there
and I'm going to drop it off the center
stand let it cycle through the engine
for a couple minutes and then make sure
the bike is level and check it and then
I'm going to make sure add enough oil so
it's right in between these two lines so
you can see the oil fill window right
now when I tip the bike up to a writing
position you can see that the oil is
right there in between those two lines
so when I start the engine and run it
the oil is going to filter through the
system and go into the oil filter that
we just installed so it's going to dip
down just a little bit that's why I run
the bike for a second and then brief
like tip offs top off the oil after it's
been running anyway
that's how you change the oil and s
Azuki bandit I've listed all of the
parts that you need the oil the filter
the funnels the tools everything is in
the video description below so if you
have any questions make sure to leave
them in the comments like if this video
