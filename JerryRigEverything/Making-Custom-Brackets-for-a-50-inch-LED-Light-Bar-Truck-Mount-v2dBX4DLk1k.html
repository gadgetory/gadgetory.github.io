inch light bar on my truck let me
explain what I've done so far I that
piece of duct tape right there in the
center is marking the center of the
windshield and as you can see as you can
see on the light bar myself I'd also put
a piece of duct tape signaling where the
middle of the light bar is so I can just
line those two pieces up then I've built
this contraption between two ladders to
help support the light bar and so the
light bar just going to be resting on
top of this I've put the level on the
center there so I can make sure that the
level is in the right place for the
light bar the lab parts gonna be a level
when I mount it it just held up with
wood duct tape and some scaffolding and
now I'm going to set the light bar in
place on the top now the light bars in
place positioning where it needs to be
I'm going to put the level back in front
of it just so I can make sure that those
boards always stay level so right here
this is how we're going to design the
brackets for it so from the top corner
we're going to screw the brackets in
right along here under the frame of the
truck and it just has to extend enough
so that we can screw into the side of
the light here so the metal has to be at
least 6 inches long and I'm going to
kind of curve it to go with the lip of
the metal here and then bend it out just
a little bit so that it will fit so bend
it out angle it out just a little bit
like that so it will mount with the edge
of the light bar itself now if you
bought a shorter light bar you'd have to
angle your bracket in and then curve it
up I've seen some of those with like the
40 inch light bars but since this one's
15 just a little bit longer than my
truck is we have to bolt it angle it
straighten it and that's it
a lot of cars will have similar seams or
creases in the frame on either side of
the car so this crease right here is the
exact same on the other side and so you
kind of use those to reference where you
want to pray place the metal bracket to
hold up the light so my is just going to
go just a little bit over this line and
make sure that it goes over the same
distance on the other side to keep it
universal
right now it's bent perfectly so that
the curve of this will never touch the
bottom part of the bracket and I'm going
to mark where I can bend it up so that
it will connect with that where it bolts
into the light
right about there now we'll give it
enough clearance for this and allow it
to bolt into that so now I just need to
bend it up so it's parallel with this
bottom part down here that mounts into
the car
you're choosing the correct drill bit
for the bolt that goes on the side to
hold up the light you want a bit that
will cover up all of the threads you can
see on this particular bit you can see
some of the threads up at the top and
the bottom of the bit so we're going to
go ahead and switch to a bigger bit and
that'll make it so that the screw slides
right inside the slot without gripping
on the threads or destroying any of the
threads now I can drill a hole in the
side of the mount since I have it all
pinned up against the truck this is just
like a rough placement right now when I
finally put it on I'm going to put a bit
of caulk in between this and the bolts
so that no water or anything will seep
inside and plus I got to paint it and
trim it so it doesn't look like a just a
piece of iron now I'm just going to trim
it down a little bit so it will match
with the curves of the truck perfectly
so it will sit flatter against the rock
now I have the light bar bolted in on
this side and right now I have to get
this hole lined up so that the light is
on this level from the top and it's
pointed straight forward so how I'm
going to do that is to level it you know
up and down with the ground with the
truck is pretty easy I just need to
raise and lower the light bar until that
little bubbles right in the middle of
the level so it needs to go up a little
bit on this left side and then as far as
pointing straight forward I'm just going
to make sure that the gap between the
windshield and the light bar itself is
uniform on the whole side and so I have
to do that both at the same time while
I'm getting this in place to figure out
where to drill the hole on this bracket
now before I install the finish bracket
in place which is this guy now that it's
all painted up I'm going to take some
clear silicone sealant and just go ahead
and like put it on all of the little
holes that way it won't leak and it
won't get water inside of the truck
it'll help kind of weatherproof it a
little bit now the silicone is in place
and I can go ahead and install that
bracket the mount is installed super
sturdy the reason I use a couple
different kinds of screws are because
even though these are both 2 inches
they're slightly different lengths and I
wanted to make sure that the nuts on the
inside were able to stay on so you can
kind of see the nuts right there and the
reason I use these two darker screws
right there because they're a harder
grade of screws they're more durable but
they didn't come in the 2 inch lengths
that I needed and those ones as well are
just tied in with nuts they're in the
back so on the wiring harness this end
right here with the black and red cables
this is what attached to the ground
which is somewhere on your frame and
then this attaches to your battery
terminal and then these ends go inside
the cab that end right there connects to
the light bar itself and then this end
connects to the little switch that turns
the light bar on and off I'm going to do
is I'm going to take these ends and
stick them inside in the firewall
there's a little hole inside of there
you can see that I already have one wire
coming out for my car alarm and so I'm
just going to take both of these stick
them through that hole and then they'll
end up inside of the cab underneath the
dashboard so as far as wiring goes I
mentioned before that I came back out
through the firewall and then I screwed
this on just to a mounting bracket just
you know that something else was mounted
onto and then I have the grounding screw
here that some of my other things like
my stereo and HID lights are grounded
too and then I just took the power and
just wired into the power terminal of
the battery and as soon as you do that
this guy will turn red
and you can just press the button and
the light will turn on and off so as far
as the wiring for the light goes that
it's drilled another hole in a cab a
little bit bigger than the cable and
I've also silicone that as you can tell
and so the silicon going to keep the
water out not the most beautiful job but
I can clean it up in a second on the
inside of the cab I have that big black
wire coming down here this is for my car
alarm and then I've connected the wires
there ran it down underneath and I'm
just going to clean that all up and then
stuff it up and I meet the firewall and
the switch which is what turns on and
off the lights I'm probably going to
mount this right down here kind of out
of the way because that light is going
to be on all the time I don't want to
just point at me so I'll just have it
down here where I can just reach out and
click it wherever I want so presently
enough the weatherstripping actually
went back on even though those nuts and
bolts are in place so the whole thing is
still going to be relatively quiet and
waterproof because the weather stripping
fits on if it wouldn't fit I would just
cut it here and here and left the
weather stripping on either side instead
of right there where the bracket is all
right so now for the cotter pins on the
side I assumed that this would rotate
fairly easily but actually when you
clamp these down I actually have a
locking washer inside of here as well
and one on the other side when you clamp
it down it actually holds it really
tight so I'm not super worried about it
but the cotter pin idea was that I could
take a cotter pin a really a long one
and just stick it inside of that hole
right there and then as it goes into the
hole it'll go through the sides and the
heatsink
just like that
can't really see if my camera angle but
it's going right in between these little
fins right here and since there's one on
this side and one on the other side it's
going to keep it level straight up and
down or whatever position I angle it out
so I can take the pin out rotate the
light down and put the pin back in
obviously with this camera you can't
tell a whole lot if it doesn't pick up
all the lights from the headlight but
you can tell a huge difference when the
50 inch light bars on one more time in a
cemetery so you can see that the normal
headlights can show about you know the
three headstones out and then with the
50 inch LED light bar you can see quite
a bit farther
if you're interested in buying a 50 inch
light bar I've linked that down below
the one I bought was about two hundred
and fifty bucks so pretty cheap that is
