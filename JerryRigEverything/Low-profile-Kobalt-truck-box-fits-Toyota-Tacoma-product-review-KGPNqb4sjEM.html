fit at the Tacomas I have a 1998
two-door Tacoma the extended cab and
finding a truck box so it fit it was a
quite the ordeal I finally found one is
the Cobalt
at that low sells it I'm fits pretty
darn good just kind of thread with a
little edge there that only comes in
silver though so I had to paint mine
black worked out pretty well it's kind
of covered in the insulation dust right
now but as far as the Box goes it does
have a lock and reviews I read about it
online says that the lock is usually the
first thing to go on this and from what
I can tell it's pretty sturdy so when
it's locked it just doesn't open up at
all till it is pretty secure obviously
you know you can get in it if you wanted
to but opening up kind of go slow I just
hit a couple drywall jobs and stuff so
I'm pretty full right now but other than
that the boxes worked out pretty well
and it's a like I said it's one of the
only boxes that will fit in it to coma
I'm I wanted the low profile for mine
just because I don't like it when they
stick up past the window it's kind of
annoying so yeah if you have any
questions let me know I think the the
whole box cost like 250 bucks from
Lowe's the thing is if you go to the
post office and get like a moving kit
I'm usually they have a 10% off coupon
that you can just use towards any
purchase as far as like the lock
mechanism inside goes it's just this
little bar that goes up into the top and
then down to the other side that's the
same kind of mechanism over there one
guy on the forum so that when the lock
mechanism breaks he just took a metal
bar and put it straight across from the
to have a more secure metal bar he said
that worked out for him really well so
yeah I haven't had any problems with it
so far it doesn't come with a mounting
kit either you have to buy a mounting
kit at the at the store basically it's
just two little bars and they go in kind
of clamp on
- you're the lip of the truck bed like
right underneath there so pretty fun
when you don't have a garage together
I've got to take care your tools somehow
let me know if you have any questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
