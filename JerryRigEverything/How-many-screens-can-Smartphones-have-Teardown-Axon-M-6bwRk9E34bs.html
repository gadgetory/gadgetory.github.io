and pretty ingenious if you remember
from my durability test video the axon M
only has one camera someone asked me in
the comments of that video what would
happen if I tried opening snapchat and
the normal camera app at the same time I
decided to try it on an app people
actually used Oh
like Instagram and then also opened up
the regular camera app at the same time
and interesting ly enough both apps
stayed open but only actively displayed
the camera on whatever side of the
screen I touched last so only one app
works at a time simultaneous live
streams between different apps aren't
possible right now but maybe someday
this teardown is sponsored by
Squarespace if you need a quick and easy
way to build a website I'll leave a link
in the video description let's get
started
a question I have is can you add more
than two screens to the smartphone let's
jump inside this dual screen acts on em
and see how it's put together there are
seven little plastic squares covering up
little screws the exterior screws are
all t5 and do a good job of securing
that back panel with the screws gone the
back panel pops up and away from the
back of the phone giving us our first
look inside the W Knox if the battery
needs to come out first this got us two
Phillips head screws holding on that
silver bracket I'll remove that and
unplug the battery connector just like a
little Lego now ZTE added a sweet little
pull tab to their battery but don't let
this fool you it's purely decoration and
doesn't actually work sometimes brute
force is the only option
this 30 180 milliamp hour battery might
be a little small to be powering dual
screens but it does get the job done
there are five more Phillips head screws
down at the bottom of the phone holding
down the loudspeaker plastics you can
see the golden contact pads on the
bottom which receive communication off
of that charging port the charging port
itself unplugs and pulls away from the
phone easy enough this little black
board is USBC and includes two more
contact points for the vibration in
order off to the side same as the
loudspeaker this circular vibration
motor receives power and communication
through that charging port board I'll
pull out the SIM and SD card tray next
cuz that's still in there and while the
motherboard doesn't have any extra
screws holding it in place it does have
a lot of connections the front screen
extension ribbon cable the charging port
extension a few circular wire cables
side button ribbons and finally the
interesting plug here on the left is the
secondary rear display ribbon which
looks quite a bit different than a
regular screen ribbon connection we'll
look at that more in a second now here's
where I made a mistake I assumed the
small gold ribbon under the headphone
jack was for the headphone jack I was
wrong
it's actually for the front sensors so
now those just won't work anymore the
singular camera on the axon M is a 20
megapixel Beast but does not have any
optical image stabilization the acts on
M's camera doubles as the front and rear
camera
there are screens on both sides of the
phone it's got some pretty powerful
selfies inside the frame we have the
normal thermal foam stuff between the
processor and the middle of the phone to
keep things cool and down here at the
bottom we can see how the front screen
is connected like most androids these
days the screen is glued into the frame
of the phone from the front which means
removing it is catastrophic to the
screen but if it does need to be
replaced the new little ribbon would
feed through this hole and extend up to
the motherboard now for the secondary
screen it's got two very large screws
holding itself to the main body of the
phone and then the whole thing lifts up
and away from the phone body interesting
to see a lot of the wire cables running
through that hinge and this is it one
screen connection and two screws as all
this secondary screen has just like
plugging in a second monitor into your
desktop computer
if ZTE were to add one more screen plug
into the motherboard and another hinge
on the opposite side of the phone I
don't see why we couldn't have a triple
screen phone in the future it's pretty
similar to razors project Valerie or my
own triple screen laptop that I built
myself last year looking closely at the
screen connector it has the same
contacts we see inside the standard
ribbons but this one's designed to be
flexed over and over again inside that
hinge constantly a normal Lego style
thin ribbon wouldn't be able to stand up
to that kind of abuse but these
individual insulated wires can thumbs up
for that
I'll get the round wire cables tucked
back inside the hinge and the secondary
screen screwed back into place let me
know in the comments would you ever buy
a triple screen phone I think if they
were able to shrink the bezels down a
bit between the hinges it would be
pretty awesome it's kind of like having
a tablet in your pocket the motherboard
is back into place with this beautifully
torn front sensors it's kind of one less
thing to worry about right I'll get the
side buttons plugged in along with the
normal front screen extension cable and
the charging port ribbon there are three
wire cables going back into place these
guys are fragile and their heads can pop
off if you pull too hard so I'm being
gentle as I smoosh them back into place
since the secondary screen connector is
a bit different than the rest mostly
just more thin I'll clip that in with my
tweezers and plastic pry tool the
charging port board can snuggle back
into place there is no water resistance
on this phone whatsoever I'll plop the
loudspeaker back over the charging port
with its five black
Phillips head screws and finally the
battery with its now deceivingly weak
pull tab ripped off can slip back into
the square slot it came from I always
like to plug the battery in last before
we can test the phone and see if it
still works
I'll get the silver bracket back into
place with its two screws and then I'll
press the power button so far we have at
least one screen going so that's good
I'll smash the back panel back into
place with his seven screws and it's a
success both screens are fully
functional you know - the front sensors
if you're looking to get ahead in the
online world or even just get found you

selling products or just want your
resume online Squarespace makes it
