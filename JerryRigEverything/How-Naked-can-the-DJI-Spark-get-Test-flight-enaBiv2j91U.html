and not even flown yet it's time to take
it apart it's hard to describe how small
this thing truly is so I brought a
banana for scale let's get started the
DJI spark has some pretty unique
construction there are a total of six
screws holding on the top plate the
screws are accessed from the bottom of
the drone under the batteries including
one on either side of the gimbal it's a
1.5 allen bit 50 screws I'll link a tool
kit in a description an interesting
thing is that there are two dollops of
clear rubber glue on the two middle
screws this probably helps keep the
screws tight with all the consistent
propagations had to remove both blobs of
rubber before my bit would fit inside
the screw once the six screws are out
the top plate is still extremely secure
I doubt it'll ever come off on its own I
was able to use my metal pry tool and
some aggressive negotiating to remove it
exposing the pretty incredible circuitry
to the camera even the chips are branded
with DJI the top red cap has vents on
the side to dissipate the airflow from
the massive metal heatsink and fan in
the center of the drone I think a naked
spark looks pretty fantastic the
different colored sparks look pretty
good of course don't get me wrong but
the target market of tech enthusiasts
have been building clear computers for
years and a clear spark would be pretty
darn impressive clear plastics have been
around since about 1950 just saying TGA
I want to consider a clear option for
your next drum if that thumbs up button
if you want to see more clear
electronics in the future I know I do
the props come off easy enough just
press down and spin the blade to unlock
in the direction indicator on the
propeller the silver colored circle on
the prop indicates which motor they are
attached to and now for the nitty gritty
getting inside this thing is rather
complicated there's a bunch of silver
tape sitting on top of the connectors
I'm saving the tape to put back in place
later remember normally you'll never
need to take apart your own spark unless
you happen to have a few wrecks Sparks
and you're trying to frank and send them
together to make one working drone i'm
unequipping both signal wires at the
back and pulling them up and out of the
way then i'll remove the three screws
attached to this silver bracket next to
the fan the screws are all different
sizes so I'm keeping them organized off
to the side there are three more silver
screws around the backside of the drone
and some more silver tape covering those
connections around the fan there's a lot
of this now these two connections below
the fan are
are interesting these are not the normal
ribbons that we see inside of cell
phones these have exposed wires I'm
assuming these lead to the gimbal
without supporting ribbons attached to
bare wires I'm being much more careful
with these plugs on the top and left of
the fan we have normal-looking ribbons
the ones we are used to the same little
Lego connections we see inside cell
phones all the time but this time around
there is white silicone plopped on
either side of the connections to help
hold them in place
I think this is a fantastic idea since
drones typically have a high probability
of hard landings and accidental wrecks
the silicone will help keep the
connections from popping off during
these events it also has the added
benefit of water resistance with the
super tight plastic top and the silicone
on either side of the connections inside
of the drone it'll help keep water out
I'm no advocate for getting your
electronics wet but the silicone is a
sign of proactive quality manufacturing
before the board can fully pull away
from the drone there's one more normal
ribbon hidden underneath this metal
bracket this covers the motor connection
unsnap that like a Lego remove the
motherboard and now we can see inside
the spark here's a close-up look at that
fan the heatsink and the DJI branded
component along with the micro USB
charging port and the SD card slot these
are not replaceable but it's still a
pretty compact system for such a
powerful little device now the joan has
four motors and each of these motors
have little black wires headed down to
the backside of the drone these are
soldered onto one board and the solder
joints are covered with that same white
silicon we saw earlier for extra
protection then I assume this is the
ribbon that controls all four motors and
leads up to the motherboard at the other
end of the drone we have the stabilizing
gimbal you can see how it moves around
to compensate for the jig leanness of
the drone this keeps your camera image
steady and now I explode it all back
together to make sure it works the
motherboard gets tucked back into place
the motor ribbon doesn't have any
silicon around it because it has its own
metal clamp the rest of the ribbon
connections
need to be lined up perfect so no
silicone gets clipped inside the
connector on accident it's definitely
not the easiest thing to repair but at
least as possible make sure the silver
tape is back into place as well before
putting any of the metal brackets on the
signal wires are the same type of
circular connection that we see inside
most cell phones these are just a bigger
thicker version there are three more
silver screws around the backside of the
board to go in place and then the silver
bracket and the
three screws around the fan area go in
next it's interesting that each of these
little screws have a bit of blue loctite
on the threads to help it screw stay in
place without the blue stuff the
vibrations of the flying drone might
cause the screws to unscrew on their own
DJ eyes attention to detail is a very
good thing I feel like they built this
product to last a while the last thing
that screw in is the bracket over the
motor control ribbons and now that
everything is back into place I'll pop
in the SD card and a time for the bad
idea of turning it on and flying in this
half-naked day so far so good let's see
what happened
well I think that went much better than
anticipated even with the Top Gun it was
still able to track me and fly around
use GPS everything was still functioning
on this device the Wi-Fi was even going
as well now I would not fly it like this
though as soon as I get home I'm going
to put that top back on and seal it down
just to keep all the components safe
from the dust and stuff I'm sure you saw
when I was landing it there was a lot of
dust kicking up and now that's all
coating the circuit board so flying like
this isn't very smart but if DJI was
able to make a clear cover over the top
of this just saying I would buy another
one
now all the footage you just saw was
filmed in 1080p upscaled to 4k because
the DJI spark can't film in 4k just
1080p but it should give a pretty
accurate representation of what the
image quality is like I'll leave a link
to the DG I sparked down in the video
description along with this rad power
bike that I had behind me as well
