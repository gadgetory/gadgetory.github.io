massive screens on both the front and
back of the phone it's time to take this
unique looking contraption apart and see
how its put together next thing you know
they'll be taking things a step farther
and trying to go bezel this on both
sides instead of just the front totally
fine with me this video is sponsored by
audible let's get started when I open up
a strange new phone for the first time
I'm usually going in blind it's not like
vivo includes a disassembly instruction
booklet with the phone I am the
instruction booklet there are two
visible t2 screws down at the bottom
that can be removed but then I'm left
deciding which side of the phone comes
off first the rear like most glass back
phones and the previous dual screen
Nubia X or is it the front that comes
off I decided to heat things up and
start with the rear and I chose wrongly
the goal of these tear downs is to
reassemble the phone and get it back
together in one piece after I take it
apart so obviously we aren't off to a
very good start the phone still works
though just a cosmetic crack so I'll
turn the whole thing back off again and
we'll try to enter the forbidden
internals through the front route we
don't know the adhesive level of the
phone since there's no IP rating but I'm
going to warm it up anyway because
that's just what usually needs to happen
with modern smartphones now sliding my
tools between the plastic edge of the
big screen and the metal frame of the
phone we can start to see a gap forming
meaning this time we're going in the
right direction from a build perspective
having screens on both sides of the
device makes it hard to tell which side
needs to open first and this phone is
even weirder than I anticipated when
lifting off the screen the entire phone
body comes with it battery motherboards
and everything is attached directly to
the screen I did not see that coming
removing the screen leaves only the
metal frame and secondary rear screen
behind the back panel does have two
ribbons snaking up towards the
motherboard I'll unscrew the five silver
Phillips head screws holding down the
long metal ribbon cable bracket and I'll
unclip the sensor ribbon but I'll leave
the screen ribbon intact for now I kind
of want to see if we can get both
screens working side by
instead of front and back this might not
be the smartest thing to do but I've
already done Dumber things today
what can I hurt might as well see if
it's possible while I'm in here I got
both greens that you waited side by side
and I can press the power button with my
finger and it looks like we're
successful so far I can use the three
finger slide trick to transfer the
screen from one side of the phone to the
other and since the phone still thinks
it's in one piece it works we should
totally try out one of these apps to see
if that works too hmm huge thanks to
audible for sponsoring this teardown and
supporting my channel the latest book
I've been listening to is called Artemis
by the same author that wrote the
Martian except this time around instead
of being on Mars it's a new story about
a mining colony on there you know with
smuggling explosions and all kinds of
science a near-death experiences and
stuff you can get a free audiobook when

whether you're in it for the
entertainment or keeping your mind
active while learning new things
potables worth a shot I use it regularly
while at the gym or driving audible.com
slash jerry-rigged I'm really glad that
worked and the phone is still alive
I'll put it gently back to sleep so we
can continue deeper inside unplugging
the battery like a little Lego and then
I'll move over to the AMOLED screen
connector ribbon and pop that off
releasing the back panel and the rear
screen I guess technically the rear
screen can be replaced without replacing
the whole housing but with the weird
circular camera lens thing it's hard to
say for sure how exactly that might
happen
weird phones make for some weird repairs
we'll know more when replacement parts
hit the market all unplugged the side
button ribbon to make space for the
battery removal super nice of evo to
make removing the battery easy no broken
pull tabs and no damage done to the 3500
milliamp hours during removal there are
two more Phillips head screws holding
down the long silver plate overtop of
all three rear camera connectors then
I'll find the two more screws over top
of our little friend the head
jack up here at the top corner it's got
its own little metal plate but when that
comes out look how small this guy is
it's super impressive that vevo can have
two massive screens a big battery and
still have room left over for the
headphone jack I'll remove the four
screws holding down the motherboard
keeping the screws organized of course
and then I'll unclip the two bottom
remaining extension ribbons and the two
wire cables then the motherboard is free
for us to take a look at surprisingly
there is no thermal paste on this board
like there is on most other flagships
these days and even though this phone
has only been alive for a few hours the
metal above the processor does appear to
be discolored by heat I'm no expert but
I would like to see this phone
benchmarked next to a similar respect
flagship and see which one thermally
throttles first no thermal paste might
be an issue down the road up here we
have something called a tof camera or
time-of-flight it's a self-contained 3d
system that measures distance and can
produce some pretty cool 3d renderings
of objects
I think vivo is mostly just using this
for fancy beauty modes in the camera
settings for right now but the future
applications might be pretty fun there
are two regular cameras in here as well
a 12 megapixel main camera with its 2
megapixel depth sensor sidekick the main
camera does have optical image
stabilization and both cameras are
housed in separate units if you remember
from the durability test this phone has
a speaker grille on both the front side
and the back side the ambidextrous
smartphone can make calls from either
screen and the earpiece inside is what
makes this all possible allowing sound
to escape from both the front and back
of the speaker pretty cool the vibrator
motor is this cute little guy over here
on the left
it's an eccentric rotating mass motor a
bit different than the coin style or
taptic vibrators we are used to seeing
these days but even though it's an older
style vibrator it still gets the job
done remember this phone does have an N
screen fingerprint scanner which is
hidden down here at the bottom under the
8 screws one of which has a warranty
void sticker on it which means we should
probably stop the teardown
just kidding man that joke never does
get old I'll pop off the protective
metal plate over the extension ribbon
and under screen fingerprint scanner
connector then I can remove the
loudspeaker this thing does have a bit
of the water-resistant mesh covering the
speaker hole which is good for the
charging port board I'll unplug the
extension ribbon and the white wire
cable and then the board itself
congestion
me out of the frame we see a bit more of
the water resistance here around the
USBC opening with this black rubber ring
we also have a square white water damage
indicator residing next to the SIM card
tray if you remember vivo was the first
smartphone manufacturer to introduce an
in screen fingerprint scanner back in
2017 back then it was a literal square
chunk of the screen that maid repair
pretty impossible but this time around
vivo is using the same style of sensor
that we saw in the oneplus 60 a simpler
version quite literally just a camera
that shines up through the display to
take a picture of your fingerprint you
can see the hole in the middle frame
that lets us view the underside of the
AMOLED screen and the light from my
personal phone can shine up through the
screen into the hole it works the other
way around as well when the screen is
turned on it lights up your finger with
an animation so the camera underneath
can take a good picture thumbs up for
that vivo is definitely one of the
leaders in innovation right now they've
been making some pretty phenomenal and
unique phones
I'll get the charging port back into
place along with the loudspeaker and the
eight screws holding everything down
then I'll get the two rear cameras back
in place and scooch the motherboard down
over the top making sure that no ribbons
get pinched underneath the itty bitty
but always useful headphone jacks
knuckles down into its slot in the frame
and then I can screw in the motherboard
slide the battery back into place and
make sure all the ribbon cables are
plugged in with the metal brackets
holding everything tight since both
front and rear screens are pretty
difficult to replace this phone's not
going to be winning any repairability
Awards but at least the battery can be
swapped out pretty easily and now that
we know how the phone opens that
particular step will be easier in the
future as well I'll take both of the
rear panel ribbons and clip them onto
the motherboard along with plugging in
the battery then I can screw down the
large metal plate that keeps the
connections secure I'll turn the phone
on before sandwiching it back together
just to make sure everything's working
and lucky for us everything still
functions the triple finger swipe still
swap screens and let's just pretend I
opened up the phone right the first time
around and I didn't damage anything all
right I don't see any cracks do you
congratz DeVivo
for keeping the smartphone world
interesting I'll be looking forward to
seeing what they have in store for us
