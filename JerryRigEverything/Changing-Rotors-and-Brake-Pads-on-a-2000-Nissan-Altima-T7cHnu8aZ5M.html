on the 2000s on Altima
it's not the car basically all we got to
do is take off the tire remove the
caliper here and then get rid of the
rotor that's inside of this the rotors
themselves I just got it at a local
parts store o'reilly and they cost like
32 bucks apiece i'm not too big of a
deal yeah I'm a mechanic would normally
charge about 160 to 180 bucks to do this
so you're saving you know about a
hundred bucks do it yourself all right
so the lug nuts on these things are a 21
millimeter ya 21 okay so now you have
the tire off the next thing you got to
do is take off these two bolts right
here on this right there the other one
is down there with my wrenches both of
them were 19 millimeter and pretty stuck
on there so one easy thing I did to get
it off is if you have your wrench right
here usually just around the other way
if you have your wrench like that then
you take another wrench and you put it
inside the little slot like that then
you have an extra long wrench and you
get more leverage on the whole thing so
as I push down on that one it's
connected to the first one and that
gives you like an extra foot of leverage
anyway so that helps you I don't have
power tools or something okay so to
remove the caliper once you got there
those two bolts out you get to the
actual caliper off of the car make sure
you support it on something and I have
an extra jack stand because you don't
want to put any weight on that cable
right there
you change the brake pads all you got to
do is take out these pads right here
these are the brake pads these ones look
like they have a lot of life left it I'm
still on both sides you can see so I'm
going to go ahead and leave these in
there
so if you do decide if you are going to
take off the brake pads all you got to
do is kind of wiggle and loose out of
these brackets right there and that
comes out of on both sides the pads will
come out when the pads are worn down
though what happens is this big piston
right here sticks out farther that's
when you put the new pads on there's
going to be less space in between the
two so they won't fit over the rotor
over the edges of the rotor so we have
to do is you have to compress this
piston back down inside of itself before
you put the pads on so you can put it
over the rotor usually people use like a
big C clamp like this I'll just put one
side on the piston right here and then
the other side on the edge of this and
just kind of keep on twisting it down
until the piston compresses itself
enough they should be able to do it
we'll probably have to do a little bit
of that today because this rotor might
be slightly thicker than this one just
because of the time that this one has
been wearing down shouldn't be too big
of a deal though anyway as far as
getting the rotor off this rotor has two
holes in it right here and so you have
to go by some bolts these ones were you
see it there the EM tins by 1.25 doesn't
really matter the length of them as long
as they fit inside that hole you just
keep on tightening them until they until
you hear the thing pop off sometimes if
the rotor is not super tight on there
you can just grab a rubber mallet and
just kind of hit it a few times and pop
it out that way but in this case it's
kind of rusted so I had to use these two
bolts just keep on tighten them down
equally until the whole rotor just pops
off
all right just getting a shot of what it
looks like beforehand and I got to do is
just line up the big holes with the
holes on the bolts and you're good in
this case I did have to do a little
trick with the c-clamp
that guy to compress it just enough to
get the caliper over the rotor try not
to touch that part of the rotor right
there just because the oil from your
fingers will mess with the brake pads
and trying to touch the brake pads
either themselves like the airflow pad
part anyway so I got the caliper lined
up with the two bolts in the back just
tightening those down again this the
rotor itself will have a little bit of
play in it just because you haven't
tightened down the tire yet the tires
with a whole set all in place all right
that's it
got the new rotors installed there and
it's the same on both sides both the
parts and the process was the exact same
anyway if you did have to compress your
caliper with the brake pads on it make
sure when before you take off you before
you start driving you pump the brake
pedal a few times to get those back
pressed up against the rotor so it
stopped so you'll be ready when you
actually start moving anyway I do put up
videos you know every week so if you
like what you see if you want to see
more make sure you like if this helped
you and subscribe there right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
