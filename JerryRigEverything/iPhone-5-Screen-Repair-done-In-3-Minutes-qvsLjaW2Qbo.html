iPhone I wish I had a take off and
replace the screen in three minutes to
start off with you grab your little star
screwdriver and there's two screws right
next to the charging port so unscrew
each of those it's the same size of
screwdriver that you would have used
with your iPhone 4 or 4s
which those around grab
little suction cup the bigger the
suction cup the better and then now you
just have to pry off the bottom of the
screen in hindsight I probably should
use a plastic tool as I'll keep that in
mind there's a ribbon Cable's up along
the top so be very careful when you're
pulling it away because if you damage
those ribbon cables especially on your
new screen then you'll have some
problems there's three little screws
right here that you have to take out to
unplug the ribbon cables from the phone
I'll show you those this little bracket
comes right off as soon as you get the
three screws undone giving the iPhone
five screen isn't much easier than doing
the iPhone 4 or 4s screens to replace
the screen you had to do undo about 30
screws
little bracket just slipped right off
and then as far as the Flex cables go I
me just pop them off with a flat tool
they're just like little snaps kinda
like Legos so there's two of them right
there and the third one is underneath
and that releases the screen
so take the get rid of your old screen
and put your new screen on just grab a
nice little flex cable just like you
would have the Lego and just placing
them down into place and snapping him in
once I got them all placed down I just
use my finger to just give them one
little more push just to make sure
they're all connected
keep in mind that these screws are also
different sizes the two bottom screws
are the same size but the top screw is a
little bit longer I'm gonna speed this
up a little bit just because the screws
were hard to get into place there you'll
when you're putting the top back on make
sure you slide the top in first and then
you can take the phone down the sides
and clip it all into place after you're
done and it's all back in place you can
put the bottom two star screws in
there you go if you have any questions
make sure leave in the comments I don't
forget to like if this helped you and
