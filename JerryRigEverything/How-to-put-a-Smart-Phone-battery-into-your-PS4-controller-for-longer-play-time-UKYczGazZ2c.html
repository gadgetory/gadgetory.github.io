and close your ps4 controller go ahead
and click the link in the upper left
hand corner in this video I'm just going
to teach you how to splice in a
smartphone battery to increase the
battery life on your ps4 controller
here's the original battery for the ps4
controller and you can see the
overcharge protection right there in the
top the battery itself is pretty small
it's 1,000 milliamp hours and 3.65 volts
the replacement batteries which I'm
going to list in the video description
below on Amazon have a ton more battery
life they last a lot longer
this one is 1500 milliamps is called the
C - x2 battery we would have thought
that something useful would it come from
blackberry you can see that it's almost
the same size physically but it's much
bigger internally so it lasts a lot
longer than the original battery does
I'm going to cut off the leads to the
old battery now because I need to use it
to attach the new battery to the
motherboard the battery that I'm going
to be using the leads are a little bit
farther away than the old one so I need
to extend the wires most I'm going to
show you how to do with electrical tape
but you can take a little dab of solder
using a solder gun and attach the wires
that way I just figured most people
wouldn't have one of those things laying
around so here's the electrical tape
version make sure you twist the wires
together so they don't come apart
remember that any smartphone battery can
be used as long as it's between 3 point
6 volts and 3.7 the more important part
you got to worry about is just the
milliamp hours and as long as it's over
a thousand you'll be making an
improvement now my leads are a little
bit longer I'm going to go ahead and
find myself a little bit more wire at
the end that I can use I'm going to kind
of curl it up into a little bit little
ball that way I can press it into the
leads on the battery and not worry about
it coming loose when I have the tape
over the top of it
keep in mind that a half a million
things could go wrong when you open
these up so make sure that you aren't
too emotionally attached to your
controller if you decide to operate on
it now that I have the little balls in
place I can just press it onto the leads
of the battery and the batteries are
going to have a plus or minus sign next
to the leads most of them do anyway and
the red will go on the positive and the
black will go on the negative
I'm just taking the electrical tape and
putting it on at a diagonal and pulling
it tight so that will hold the leads in
place
make sure not to use too much electrical
tape even though that there is a little
bit of extra room inside the ps4
controller there's not a whole lot so
you don't want the electrical tape
bunching up and propping up your battery
at an angle otherwise it won't fit
anymore
now you can see the plastic bracket at
the bottom is a little bit smaller than
my battery so I'm going to go ahead and
shave it down just a little bit so my
battery will fit in a little slot
the C - X - battery that I mentioned
before fits perfectly in the slot so I
would recommend getting that because it
actually gives 50% more battery life
whereas the one I'm using right now just
does 30% now I'm going to go ahead and
plug in to the motherboard using the
same leads that were in there before so
adding 50% more battery life to your
controller let's say it lasted seven
hours before you put you over ten hours
which is really nice now that I have it
plugged in I'm going to go ahead and
turn it on let me turn off my lights for
you get a better view of that blue light
if you want to see how to close your ps4
controller go ahead and click the link
in the upper left hand corner again to
get the full walkthrough with that if
you mess up your controller will always
work without a battery in place as long
as it's plugged into the console now I'm
just playing a little bit of Call of
Duty show you that it works you can buy
a brand new smartphone batteries to
splice into your controller for
seriously pennies a piece on Amazon so
check the video description below for
those anyway if you have any questions
make sure to leave them in the comments

it was interesting to you don't forget
