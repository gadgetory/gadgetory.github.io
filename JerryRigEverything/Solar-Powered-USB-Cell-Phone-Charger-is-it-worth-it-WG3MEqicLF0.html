Havasupai and away from a charger for a
couple days I thought it would be really
nice to have something that was
solar-powered so I could recharge my
phone my drone and my camera batteries
having a decent working solar panel
would mean I wouldn't have to carry as
many batteries or power banks on long
trips if you have a solar panel you
could even take your pokemon hunting
expeditions way out into the boonies so
I decided to finally get a solar-powered
charger so today we'll see how well it
works or even if it's worth our time to
set up inside we have four panels that
can receive power from the Sun and there
are four little rings two on each end so
you can hang up the panels from trees or
hammocks or tents and angle it towards
the Sun on this side we have some
instructions and on the inside it comes
with one micro USB charging cable and it
has four USB outlets
two of them are 2.4 amp and two are
regular one amp USB ports it also comes
with a little carrying sack and two
carabiners so now that we have it let's
take my galaxy s7 active with its four
thousand milliamp battery and charge it
up outside using only the power of the
Sun so I just plugged in my galaxy s7
active it's a little bit damaged but
this phone is freaking expensive so
we're going to use it for another video
it's going to take an hour and three
minutes to charge it's at 45% so I'm
going to switch it over to the solar
charger and see how long that takes
so obviously solar panels work a lot
better when there's a lot of Sun in this
guy so today there's hardly any clouds
it'll be the perfect day to test out our
solar panel so it might be a little hard
to see but it says an hour and thirty
two minutes until fully charged so a
half hour longer we'll see if that's
what it actually takes it's completely
unfolded we got the two hooks at the end
just in case you want to hang it on a
tree or a hammock or something like that
we have the four panels here and then we
have four USB ports and a little LED
light to tell if there's power going to
it or not so I have in one of those two
smart ports the 2.5 amp and I'm going to
tuck the phone underneath so it doesn't
get hot from the Sun
there we go so it's been a half hour and
we have 52 minutes until fully charged
and the phone is at 71% so it's moving
along pretty quick that's impressive
so we'll leave it plugged in a little
bit longer and see what happens
so it's been plugged in for about an
hour now we have 28 minutes left until
it's fully charged it's at 85% we
started at 45 percent so it's a little
bit slower than plugging into the wall
but still this one is being charged by
the Sun so now I'm testing the charging
on my one plus three and my galaxy s7
and it's charging them both at the same
time so this can charge multiple devices
at once
so obviously plugging your stuff into
the wall is going to be little bit
faster than using a solar powered
charger but sometimes you don't have
wall power access I imagine that the
easiest thing to do would be to pair
this with a power bank and just leave
this at your campsite or wherever you're
working and charge up the power bank all
day just keep in mind that when you
charge up your power bank and then use
your power bank to charge up your phone
after that it's not as efficient and you
lose some power between each transition
so it's much more efficient to plug your
phone directly into the solar power
charger so you don't lose any energy
between the transitions
either way I'm pretty impressed with how
fast this charged my phone
it went from 45 percent all the way up
to 100% and about an hour and 20 minutes
I did start charging my phone at the
peak brightness of the day though I
started at 1:15 so you'd get less power
in the morning and less power at night
but if using a direct sunlight right in
the middle a day that's when you get the
most power from it if you have any
questions leave them down in the
comments below I will keep this video
updated in the video description I'm
going to be using this over time I'm
headed to Thailand next week and I
imagine I'll be using it quite a bit
over there so we'll see if it starts to
fail or if it stops charging as fast as
this first time thanks stuff for
watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
