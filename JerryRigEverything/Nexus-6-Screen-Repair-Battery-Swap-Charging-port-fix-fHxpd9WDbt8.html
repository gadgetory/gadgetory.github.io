apart and fix everything on the Motorola
Nexus 6 to start off go ahead and turn
the phone completely off and then grab
your little SIM card removal tool and
remove that SIM card from the top of the
phone just pressing even a paper clip
down in that little hole will release
the SIM card then use the same tool and
press through the little hole in the SIM
card slot to the back of the phone to
remove the back cover from the phone
when you push it through it leaves a
little gap that you can slide like a
razor in or maybe like a playing card
and you can use that to separate the
adhesive from the backplate of the phone
from the phone body itself pretty
straightforward then just pull off the
rest of the phone back you can push like
a little pry tool in between there as
well and then set that off to the side
try not damaged it because you do need
it for later remove the little rubber
casing off the battery connector and
then you can unplug the battery right
here if your phone is acting up
sometimes unplugging the battery and
leaving it unplugged for 30 seconds and
then plug it back in we'll fix it so
keep that in mind when you're working on
your phone this is for the volume
buttons so a ribbon cable you can undo
this latch right here and slip out the
ribbon cable and for the rest of the
phone there is 84 Torx head screw 22 of
them actually and they're all around the
outside of the phone once the screws are
all taken out you can release the front
of the phone from the back of the phone
front of the phone has the motherboard
and screen back of the phone has the
battery and the Qi charger you can grab
that little pull tab and the battery
will pull away from the phone be careful
with the Qi charger that little ribbon
cable up at the top is in the back of
the frame pretty well just make sure to
separate that before you do any heavy
pulling and you can remove the Qi
charger from the back of the battery if
your charging port is broken
unfortunately it's not user replaceable
on this phone but you can use a wireless
charging pad I will link those in the
video description as well along with
replacement batteries if I can find them
here's the headphone jack pretty easy to
pop out of the phone once again all
parts and tools will be found in the
video description below
here is the magnetic earpiece I'm going
to go ahead and pop that back into place
as well and here are the volume rockers
to screw you left in at the beginning is
how you replace those you just pulled
screw out and the buttons will fall out
as well there's one more screw holding
the motherboard in same size as all the
rest of the other ones and now I'm just
removing the yellow tape from the top of
the ribbon cable connections to remove
these connections you just lift up a
little tab and then you can slide the
ribbon cable out from the slot and lift
it off the mainboard
same with this other one lift up a
little locking lever slip out the ribbon
cable and pull it away from the
motherboard then you can pull the
motherboard away from the frame of the
screen here's the motherboard not a
whole lot can be replaced on this the
SIM card slot is soldered onto the board
the front-facing camera can be replaced
I will try to find replacement parts and
link those in the video description
getting rid of that yellow tape
unlatching the rear-facing camera it's a
13 megapixel camera going to tuck that
back into place as well tap it down and
then latch it back in pretty easy to
replace the rear camera as well so
here's the screen if you're going if
your screen is broken like the glass is
broken or the LCD is broken this is the
part that you need to buy in order to
replace and fix your phone you might
need to transfer over this metal plate
to your new screen as well but this is
the part if the screen you buy does not
have those ribbon cables or the front
glass or the LCD you bought the wrong
part and you need to check in the video
description below for this part doing a
glass only repair is extremely extremely
difficult and we're not going to cover
that in this video
get the motherboard back into place and
get the ribbon cables back in we're just
putting the phone back together again
now latch it down to protect that ribbon
cable and put the tape over the top of
it to keep the latch secure same thing
with this ribbon cable over here tuck it
in make sure it's in as far as possible
and latch it down and then get the
yellow tape and put it over the top of
all of these ribbon cable connections
that you've undone pretty simple
get that one screw and the little metal
drop bracket back into place at the top
of the motherboard and the motherboard
has two little latches as well so make
sure that it's tucked down into that
frame
now with the Qi charger I put this in
first before the battery making sure
that the top of the Qi is lined up with
a little slot that it's in there's a
little pin in that frame that the ribbon
cable sits in and then you line the top
of the Qi up with the frame and there's
two holes in the Qi charger as well that
you line up with the back of it just to
make sure it's in the perfect spot if
it's not in the perfect spot you will
not be able to charge your phone so it's
super important that it's lined up
exactly where it needs to be same thing
with that little ribbon cable right
there it's going to line up on the
motherboard and I'll show you that after
I'm done with these volume rocker cables
so that's where it touches on the
mainboard so when you're putting your
phone back together again make sure
those line up press it down all the way
it should click in fairly easily if
you're having problems with it closing
it it might be that your motherboard
didn't get latched into the back or
front screen frame very well get that
battery clip back in make sure it's
really secure and then I'm testing my
phone make sure it turns on before I
finish putting in those 22 screws and
making sure that it charges up and I
have everything in the correct spot with
the Qi charger everything is looking
good so i'm gonna turn the phone back
off again and then 22 screws get all
those babies back in there get the
rubber protectors over your ribbon
cables volume and power and then your
backplate if it doesn't have enough
adhesive to stick down by itself which
it should unless you've done this a
couple times you can use that
double-sided tape that i showed you to
put around the edge and then clip it
down again get that sim card back in
there and you should be good to go fill
