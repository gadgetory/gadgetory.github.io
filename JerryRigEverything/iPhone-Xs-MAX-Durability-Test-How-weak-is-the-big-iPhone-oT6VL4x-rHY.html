latest attempt at selling the same thing
over and over again is here this time
with a couple new backgrounds and a
slightly larger screen size is it worth
your money
I've systematically durability tests at
about a hundred different flagship
phones over the past few years and it's
time to see if Apple's gold excess max
is durable let's get started so far
things look pretty much the same just a
larger iPhone X which is cool screen
real estate is important inside the box
we get our usual lightning port
headphones and a short lightning to USB
charging cable but this time around
Apple has decided not to include any
dongles in the box why though it's
pretty simple actually when comparing
two dongles side-by-side if I wanted to
bulk manufacture a USBC headphone dongle
it would cost me about 39 cents each
super cheap it would be pretty safe to
assume that the Apple dongle cost about
the same since they have the same
materials and do basically the same
thing but it doesn't Apple gets massive
royalties from third-party manufacturers
because their lightning port is
proprietary so why would Apple include a
30 cent accessory in the box when they
can bleed a $5 royalty out of you later
even if you don't buy from Apple
directly last year Apple sold over 2
million iPhones that's a lot of
potential dongle sales the reason Apple
removed all the ports from their phones
and laptops is because the 23 different
dongles they sell on their website are
basically pure profit and everyone still
needs to buy them Apple claimed that the
iPhone excess has the most durable glass
ever than a smartphone let's see if the
scratch resistance has changed at all
it's pretty safe to assume that glass is
glass and glass breaks and my most scale
of hardness will let us know how scratch
Abul it is we've seen plastic phone
screen scratch at level 3 glass phones
would start scratching at level 6 and
sapphire crystal display starts
scratching at level 9 no surprises here
when the glass starts scratching at a
level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7
it's important not to trust apple's
marketing jargon this new iphone screen
will scratch just as easy as your last
iphone grab a screen protector there is
a thin layer of plastic between the
glass and the metal frame of the phone
what
is a nice little impact absorption layer
I'll do a drop test later but glasses
glass so I'm pretty sure we already know
how that video is gonna end up there is
no home button or a fingerprint scanner
on the phone this time around the
front-facing seven megapixel camera and
face ID are both protected by the same
front glass the earpiece grille is made
from metal and it's not going anywhere
it's pretty secure and won't fall out on
its own one thing I am a huge fan of is
Apple's stainless steel frame gold
coloring might not be your thing of
course but the weight of stainless steel
and the durability that comes with it is
impressive stainless is harder than
aluminum and more difficult to scratch
it can still get scratched of course but
the sound and the damage inflicted will
be less on this steel iPhone than an
aluminum iPhone which is a good thing
Apple has included a dual SIM card tray
with a little rubber ring around the top
to keep water out for that ip68 rating
still no expandable memory slot but
Apple's never had one so iOS users don't
know what they're missing the buttons
are also made from metal and can't be
removed from the frame stainless steel
also conducts less heat than aluminum so
it'll usually feel colder than touch
every time you grab it good for that
premium external feel but bad for the
internal processor heat dissipation I'm
still a huge fan of the Meuse which I
feel like every phone needs one of these
the volume buttons are also made from
metal down at the bottom of the phone we
still have no headphone jack Apple owns
both wireless air pots and beats so of
course they would prefer a fuming
Wireless Apple kinda creates a problem
and then charges you for the solution
incredibly good business plan but bad
news for your wallet Apple didn't become
the first trillion-dollar company by
being generous speaking of lack of
generosity if you crack the back glass
on your iPhone excess max it will cost a
whopping 599 dollars to replace that
risk for something as fragile as glass
makes apples glass phones the most
cosmetically fragile and delicate pieces
of technology on the planet a
replacement back glass for a samsung
phone is around $30 huge difference if
you've already given Apple all of your
money ID brand the phone with the skin
or a case no reason to give them free
advertising as well now for my favorite
part
says they're all about those premium
materials which is great for the most
part they do a pretty good job but Apple
is still bragging on their website about
using sapphire crystal on their camera
lens to protect the dual 12 megapixel
cameras sapphire crystal would be
extraordinary if it was pure sapphire
remember glass scratches at level six
sapphire should resist scratching until
a level eight or nine just shy of
diamonds at level 10 apples impure
sapphire as you can see starts
scratching at a level six the same as
glass this tea so watch though built
with a pure sapphire face does not
scratch at level six back to the iPhone
excess max camera lens we see more
scratching with a level seven pic also
in line with what glass would be doing
the Sapphire Tissot though is still
scratch proof even at that same level
seven on the max camera lens using a
level eight pick where sapphire should
start scratching we see another mark
taking that same level eight pick back
to the T so we finally see some faint
scratching in my opinion if Apple's
impure sapphire isn't doing what
sapphire is expected to do they
shouldn't be calling it sapphire let me
know what you think in the comments at
least the Tissot watches are always
consistent as long as Apple keeps using
their inferior sapphire I'll keep buying
more watches to show up premium actually
looks like now for the burn test Apple
is a pretty fascinating company to watch
they get away with making beautiful yet
cosmetically fragile and super expensive
to repair smart phones where you have to
buy back basic functionality like some
EA game loot box you might be like whoa
Jerry tell us how you really feel all
right I will
it's like Tim Cook walked on stage with
the fully functional galaxy note 9
snapped his Thanos fingers to remove
half of the cool features raise the
price and we got left with an iPhone
excess max maybe next year Apple will
start leading an innovation again but
I'm not getting my hopes up
there's better profit margins with
dongles the 6.5 inch super Retina
display lasted over a minute on my burn
test which is pretty cool
just like the Galaxy s8 a few years ago
and now for the bin test every phone is
not created equally some snap in half
and end up on my shelf of shame Apple
has done an incredibly good job of
making structurally sound phones the
last couple of years and as much as I
would like to see this phone snap in
half it does not
Apple has once again constructed an
incredibly solid and structurally sound
device unless you end up cracking the
back glass of course that extra 600 are
charge will test anyone's sanity so be
ready the iPhone excess max passes my
durability test but is it the cure to
unhappiness probably not
I'd say skip this one and spend your
extra cash on memories and experiences
your current phone is probably fine and
it's not worth the marginal upgrade I do
have an extra excess max though and I
definitely don't want it for myself
I'll give it away over on my Twitter so
come hang out with me over there you can
slap a skin on it and pretend it's an
Android or just sell it to a poor soul
who doesn't know better things are out
there and keep the money for yourself
