the galaxy s7 edge the LG g5 the iPhone
6s plus and the lumia 950xl
the best course of action for you is to
make this video fullscreen for your
complete viewing pleasure
your mission should you choose to accept
is to decide which of these flagship
smartphones has the best video camera
let me know which camera you think is
best in the comments of this video I
will also leave a poll question at the
end of the video so you can vote there
as well looking at the color quality
which phone is more vibrant image
stabilization white balance and clarity
all of these phones are currently
filming in 4k with the stock camera apps
on auto settings and all of them are
mounted to the same stabilizing rig to
hold them equally at the same time all
of the phones also have oh is image
stabilizing so the camera itself is
moving around inside of the phone like a
little gimbal to stabilize the image
while the camera is filming but none of
the cameras are created equal so it's
important to compare the different
cameras and see which one you like best
before buying an expensive phone I don't
want you spending money on a camera you
don't like my channel is dedicated to
reviewing tech from the inside and
comparing the quality of different
phones side-by-side I have plenty of
other camera tests on my channel very
similar to this one I initially uploaded
this video in full resolution of 8k to
YouTube but it turns out that they ended
the beta 8k upload period in this video
just sat processing for the last 40 days
so here we are back at it again with the
4k hit that thumbs up button if you
enjoyed this test and hit that subscribe
button for more videos like this in the
future let me know what you think do you
like side-by-side comparisons or do you
like seeing four cameras at the same
time I show all my behind the scenes
stuff over on Instagram Twitter and
snapchat all @zacksjerryrig
and don't forget to answer that poll
question in the upper corner thanks done
for watching hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
