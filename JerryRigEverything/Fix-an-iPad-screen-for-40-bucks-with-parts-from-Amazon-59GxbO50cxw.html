quickest way to fix an iPad the original
version now there's a few videos online
that are super long kind of shorten it
down for you the main thing is if you're
going to replace the digitizer on the
digitizer is just a glass part there's
no LCD underneath there's that one
ribbon cable right up there the top that
fixes it
but that connects as it connects it all
around the outside of this frame there
are little Clips right here you can kind
of see the little plastic parts that
kind of poke into the metal thing to
keep it on all intact
I will show you those as I replace it
around the version I have does not have
the plastic frame or the home button so
I'll be showing you how to replace those
as well so as far as getting the screen
D attached from the frame you can kind
of see that there's a metal part here
then there's a rubber part and then
there's the actual screen itself and we
need to pry you're going to want to pry
between the metal and the rubber and not
the rubber and the screen I just took a
screwdriver and then used a guitar pick
to kind of separate I'm put a little bit
of a gap right in there then the
screwdriver fits right in you need to
have something you know that is
substantial you hopefully if you have
one there's a little bit thinner than
this but it needs to be able to not bend
or give it all when you pry it upwards
and the wider the head like the the more
width it has the better so you can kind
of see where I'm at right now you can
still see our little plastic Clips all
around the edge of the frame there's a
another clip right here around the
outside it looks like this one actually
broke off well didn't it definitely um
so basically I would just kind of lift
it up spread it open a little bit with
the pic put these little guys in there
and then use the actual screwdriver as
my main prying tool if you did buy the
digitizer with the frame around it you
won't need to worry about the old frame
so I'm going to go ahead and just
continue opening it up just prying it up
little by little all the way around the
outside
I'm not going to lift it completely off
yet though because there's some ribbon
cables underneath that I need to detach
now we have the iPad
lift it up a little bit away from the
screen itself and we're going to take
apart the digitizer cable and right here
is where the digitizer cable comes in to
the mainboard and there's this little
lip right here at the very end you have
to lift this end of the cable up I've
already done it right here so you can
kind of see that it's up in the upright
position and then once both of those are
up you can just kind of pull the ribbon
cable out and it looks like that this
other one right here is already come
apart so this is for the speaker up top
and this is more of a clip-on so it's
kind of like a Lego piece this snaps on
to this right there so the pretty solid
they're not that hard to take off and
they're pretty durable so they're not
going to break very easily either just
make sure you don't put a whole lot of
pressure on the upper part of this cable
so now we have the iPad pulled away from
the back casing and we're going to
release the led the LCD from the frame
so what I've done is I've taken out
these screws right here that little Torx
screw little like the star head screws
and there's one two three four five six
seven seven of them around the outsides
and now I'm just taking my little pry
tool and I'm going between the le LCD
and the frame and just kind of lifting
it up right here all the way around and
you can see that it's going to get loose
you can't heat it up if you want I'm
just I'm just going really slow and just
lifting it up without the heat makes a
little bit simpler so here we have the
old digitizer and frame I mean you can
see the glass I tried to pick it out
away from the frame right here at the
bottom it was almost impossible even
heating it up but the gun is still
wouldn't do it so what I had is just the
old replacement glass but it was
seriously would have taken me a couple
hours to separate the glass from the
frame there so we ended up just spending
the same amount of money and getting a
digitizer and attached to the frame
already this one has the home button
already installed all I really need to
do is transfer the camera from this
digitizer to this one right here and
I'll save a whole lot of time so buy the
frame with the digitizer it'll be a much
happier person okay so the digitizer in
the frame has a piece of plastic that's
covering up the top of it so we're going
to take that off and then take the LCD
that we have gotten all the dust off of
and then fairly quickly just put it
right down on top of it so with the
camera there's a heavy-duty tab at the
bottom he's got to pull up there's some
sticky stuff around the lens and the LED
but all you have to do is just take it
make sure that little hole was cleaned
out there's no dust or anything down in
there and then just place the camera
back in that slot
so we got all the screws backing around
the outside you've got the front camera
ribbon cable attached the other cables
the digitizer cable still taped to the
front of the screen so now everything is
ready to go all of my pins all my
brackets are set and ready to rock all
you do now is connect the three cables
and then press the screen down into
place and let it clip in around the
outside there we go all you really need
to do is just line up the right side
first it kind of slips down inside these
little grooves then you just gently
press it around this other side and then
it evens up perfectly with everything
else anyway if you have any questions
make sure to leave them in the comments
it just video help you don't forget to
Like and now don't freak for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
