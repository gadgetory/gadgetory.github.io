manufacturers in the world their new me
5 smartphone is one of the current
flagships there are two versions a
regular version and a pro version the
main difference being memory and the pro
version has a ceramic back my Twitter
follower said I should just test the
regular me 5 since I have it so here we
are about to start my 22nd high-end
smartphone bin test 20 smartphones that
I have tested have survived so far and
only 2 phones have catastrophic we
failed so let's see what happens to the
show me me 5 let's start with a scratch
test the me 5 has Gorilla Glass 4 which
we have tested before on other
smartphones the most scale of hardness
pics that I have revealed that the
screen starts to scratch at a level 6
and the deeper groove starts with the
level 7 pick this is on par with other
high-end phones so no surprises here the
back glass of the phone is also Gorilla
Glass 4 the logo is on the underside of
the glass so you won't have any issues
with it chipping or rubbing off lucky
for us the camera lens is also made of
glass it won't get scratched easy like
the Sony z5 or the BlackBerry Prive
plastic camera lenses the home button is
also made of glass so it will not
scratch easy either
besides the phone are made of metal you
can see that the scratches are on the
surface there is no thick primer or
paint covering or hiding anything
just like on the galaxy s7 the metal is
on the outside the phone is very
lightweight at 4.9 ounces now the burn
test it took about four seconds for the
flame to have any effect on the screen
the pixels turn black
but then fully recovered once the heat
had dissipated you can see that the
phone is cool to the touch within
seconds of the flame being removed keep
in mind there are a million factors that
you take into consideration when buying
a smartphone not just durability but
durability is a factor and that's where
I come in now on to the bin test
this phone broke faster than a soggy
graham cracker so let's watch it one
more time in slow motion
not every aluminum-alloy way is the same
Apple learned this the hard way with the
iPhone 6 and upgraded their newer iPhone
6s to the 7000 series aluminum Xiaomi is
offering top-of-the-line flagship
components in a subpar brittle aluminum
body it has basically the same
components as the Samsung Galaxy s7 but
costs $200 less and now we see why so
let's jump into this wreckage to analyze
I don't want to buy another phone to
prove any points I want to point out
show meas tamper evidence stickers on
the inside of the phone as well it looks
like it broke right along the battery
line where the phone is the weakest
similar to the Huawei Nexus 6p also a
lot of phones will have two frames like
the LG and Motorola phones even the
iPhone will have a separate frame that
attaches to the screen of the device and
another frame that houses all the
internal components these two frames
whether plastic or metal will add
rigidity to the device and the knee 5
only has one lower quality aluminum
frame for everything having only one
frame saves a ton on manufacturing costs
but also sacrifices when it comes to
durability I've had twenty other phones
past the bend test with flying colors so
not every smartphone will Bend I would
recommend that me 5 users buy a case
well I'm going to set this on the Shelf
of Shame next to my Nexus 6p s and my
HTC m9 if you want to watch the 2 other
catastrophic durability failures go
ahead and click these videos or if you
want something on a happier less
destructive note check out my golden
star wars lego video it's rather
entertaining bangs it done for watching
hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
