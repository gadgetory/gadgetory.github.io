on a 2007 Honda Accord this is the v6
the starter is right down inside of
there you can see that brown who's kind
of coming out of it basically what's
going on is that the whole car will
start like all the lights will turn on
the radio turn on and everything so it's
not a battery issue but the car itself
won't turn over like it won't start at
all what I've done so far is I've
disconnected the battery because when
I'm disconnecting the leads from the
other side of the starter I don't want
any sparks back there then I have my 17
millimeter socket and that is going to
take off the bolt on top and on bottom
as you can see on the replacement
starter top and bottom basically how the
starter works is like when you turn your
key it gives electricity to the starter
and this part pulls out and start
spinning and this is what cranks your
engine so as it spins it cranks the
engine and then it'll go back in as soon
as you let off as soon as you let y'all
let off your key have you ever tried
turning your ignition while the car is
still running this will spit out and
grind a little bit inside of the engine
so that's what is happening when it
makes that noise Amazon is a great place
to buy replacement starters I'm going to
go ahead and link a replacement starter
for this car in the video description
below so go ahead and click that and
check it out they're pretty cheap and
with Prime you get fast shipping not a
bad deal specifically I've done is I've
attached the ratchet to the bolt on the
bottom and then I've taken another
wrench and set it on the handle like
that then I took a third wrench and laid
it right here and press down on both
sides of it with my hand pressing it
down and that's what turned the wrench
down there it gave me enough leverage to
do that and then with that top bowl
right there I have the wrench hooked up
to it and then I just took another
wrench slip it down over the top of that
and then it gave me enough leverage to
pull the whole thing off
just by doing that also if you want to
make your life a heck of a lot easier
just go ahead and take that black
battery plastic box out and that will
give you a lot more room to remove the
connections and remove the starter
itself this little guy right here just
going to take that wiggle it off this
one right here underneath the rubber
piece is a 12 millimeter and then now
that the bolts are done little things
should just come off okay so on the
backside of the starter there's this big
connector right here and that is a 12
millimeter and then this one right here
just pops off like I showed you before
and then this one will stay on X that's
what connects the motor to the control
all right time to put the new starter
back in the short bolt goes up at the
top and the freakishly long bolt goes
down at the bottom as a side note when
you're tightening down the power
connections again this bolt right here
can't take a whole lot of torque so you
want to make sure that it's tight and
snug but you don't want to put all of
your weight into it otherwise that bolt
or the solenoid will just snap
completely off so but it's definitely
not going to go anywhere either so don't
be too afraid
there you go you have any questions make
sure to leave them down in the comments
below don't forget to like if this video
helped you and don't forget to subscribe
I will list all of the parts that you
need in the video description below so
just take a look down there if you need
the starter or any of the tools and let
me know if anything else I'll put it
there as well
thanks for watching
yeah it is bad it pops out and it runs
but it should be like quick like
high-speed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
