me five which failed miserably and the
redmi 3 pro which survived but only
barely today I have a third xiaomi phone
the redmi note 3 and it's time to see
what we can expect durability wise from
this device accidents happen and it's
better to know beforehand whether your
device can survive the next few years at
your side this device has the dual SIM
version with the 16 megapixel rear
camera right off the bat we noticed
there is a considerable size difference
between the note 3 and the redmi 3 pro
besides the abnormal amount of sticker
residue the exterior designs of the
phone are very similar the same
thickness and the same basic aluminum
shell with plastic end caps let's start
with the scratch test already with the
pick number three we can see that the
glass is thin enough to let the pressure
leave a design on the IPS LCD similar to
the LG g5 that thinner glass means less
protection for the display the hardness
of the glass remains the same though not
scratching until level 6 so that part is
still good the front 5 megapixel camera
is protected by the front glass as well
so it is scratch resistant the speaker
grille Wiggles around inside of the
phone and seems to be free-floating like
the old iPhone 4 and 4s speaker grille
the rear panel does look and feel like a
metal in the outside of the phone you
can hear the sound in my razor makes
when I stretch the logo this particular
ShowMe logo is inlaid into the back just
like with the older Nexus 6 phones those
phones ended up having little bits of
plastic logo pop up and out with time
but since the redmi note 3 is back and
logo are both made of metal I doubt
we'll see any issues like that but at
least now we know what to look out for
the regular redmi threes logo does not
pop off as suspected the top and bottom
of the phone are made from pure plastic
and the fingerprint scanner is the same
type that is on the redmi 3 and can be
scratched but even a heavy scratching
such as this does not affect the
functionality of the scanner my
fingerprint can still be set and read by
the phone even with the heavy abuse so
no worries there this camera does have a
dual LED flash bonus
points for that and the rear 16
megapixel camera lens is also made of
glass which is great it should withstand
the basic wear and tear better than a
plastic camera lens would one perk of
the redmi note 3 over the regular redmi
3 is that the buttons are made of metal
instead of plastic the average person
might not notice but if you're watching
my videos and enjoying yourself you
probably aren't the average person time
for the fire this 1080p IPS LCD display
lasted 10 seconds before turning black
the screen did recover completely and
was cool to the touch within seconds
still no comparison to the Moto Z's 50
second resilience but at least it
recovered unlike the galaxy s7 some
phones are just stronger and more
durable than others so let's start the
bin test as we start the Flex it is
immediately reminiscent of the redmi 3
pro with the screen flexing out of the
frame you can see the plastic edge crack
on the display
the major difference here is when the
note 3 screen actually comes up and out
of the back panel I was not expecting
that to happen as it seems like common
sense to screw all the components
together instead of freefloat them it is
built very similar to the HTC m9 which
also failed the bin test because of that
free-floating unscrewed and unattached
back cover the rest the device is pretty
much a goner at this point literally the
only thing holding the back cover to the
phone is a series of clasps along the
edge and that little tiny SIM card tray
so since now we have the phone open
let's figure out why it is fun failed
and why the 30 other phones I've tested
did not fail remember I am NOT saying
that this is a bad phone durability is
just one of the many many factors people
consider when buying a phone knowledge
is power and now we know that this phone
can be broken so steps can be taken to
prevent it like putting on a case or not
sitting on it I can see a few flaws that
contributed to the demise of this device
the first of which is that there are
zero screws holding on the back panel to
the mid frame which means that the whole
back side of the phone is just a cover
instead of a structural component if
show-me added three or four screws from
the back panel
into the mid frame the test would have
had a very different outcome even though
the regular redmi 3 has the same
design as the note 3 it survived because
it is a smaller phone and has less
surface area kind of like how a
brand-new pencil is very easy to snap in
half but a stubby Shore pencil is very
difficult to snap in half the note 3 is
larger and therefore weaker the second
thing I notice is that the back panel is
mostly made of plastic on the inside you
can see here that the majority of the
back covering is just a plastic frame
with a thin covering of metal over it
not near as much metal as you would see
on the 1+3
the iPhone 6 or the HTC 10 those phones
were all metal and all past the bin test
the last thing is that Xiaomi is using
the same Brita lumen on for the mid
frame that they used on the me5 if the
aluminum was just slightly stronger all
of their phones might have survived
instead I have three expensive
paperweight shedding glass shards all
over my desk so what do you think
normally phones survive my tests should
I keep testing the next series of show
me like the me6 the redmi note 4 or
should we play by the
three-strikes-you're-out rule and give
show me a break from the carnage let me
know what you think down in the comments
below
my snapchat followers saw the outcome of
this test before the YouTube video was
posted and other behind the scenes stuff
can be found on my Twitter and Instagram
thanks ton for watching hope to see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
