Nubia Alpha.
A flexible display smartwatch made by the
same company that designed the dual screen
Nubia X – a smartphone with screens on both
the front and the back.
Now they've gone and made a curved flexible
OLED smartwatch that costs just about as much
as an Apple watch.
Is it too good to be true?
Nubia says this watch can survive 100,000
bends without breaking....
... but they haven't met me yet.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
The whole thing paired pretty easily to my
Android phone, which is nice.
There are two colors of the watch: gold and
black, and two versions: one that has a built-in
cellphone, and a Bluetooth version.
Mine's the Bluetooth.
They all have the same flexible curved display
that wraps around your write and flexes as
you put it on and off.
Pretty ridiculously cool...if it's durable.
It's the same bendy screen technology that
Samsung is, or was, using in the Galaxy fold.
With the super long 4 inch display, it's hard
to see every side at once, but since you can
scroll and swipe through to other menus, it's
not too bad.
There is a built-in camera, and can send text
messages.
The Nubia Alpha is using its own operating
system, and because of that, responding via
text is done with the old-school T9 texting
method, you know, tapping each key a certain
amount of times to get the appropriate letter.
I don't think there's going to be a whole
lot of texting done with this watch.
Linus made a great in-depth video talking
more about the software's and features and
bugs of this watch, so I'll let you watch
that if you're curious about more.
It's time for me to check out the durability,
and as always, we're going to start with the
scratch test on the flexible screen.
This is my first time scratching a flexible
OLED, so it should be pretty interesting.
We know that hard plastic usually starts scratching
at a level 3.
Glass starts scratching at a 5 or 6, and sapphire
scratches at a level 8 or 9.
Being flexible, I thought for sure we'd start
seeing scratches at a level 3 with deeper
grooves at a level 4.
But after taking the watch off my wrist, we
can clearly see marks all the way down to
a level 2.
The plastic of this flexible OLED on the Nubia
Alpha is so soft, it starts at a level 2.
Pretty crazy.
Now there is a raised metal lip around the
edge of the screen that'll help protect the
surface from brushing up against stuff.
And Nubia also has programmed in some hand
gestures so the display won't always need
to be touched...you know, Jedi-style.
But I found that the gestures weren't always
recognized.
Nubia says that the watch is made from stainless
steel, which is true for the band, but the
top central housing unit for the sensors and
camera is made from plastic.
Each of the side links and bottom plate are
made from stainless steel though.
You can see the silver shining through the
electroplated black color.
The gesture and light sensor cover is plastic.
And the 5 megapixel camera lens is made from
glass.
It has all the proprietary charging pins and
heart rate sensor stuff on the back metal
panel.
It will definitely be fun to get inside this
thing.
It's still pretty crazy to see this much movement
in displays so large.
The Nubia Alpha is definitely a first generation
product, but seeing more displays like this
in wearable technology out in the wild or
on cellphones, is going to be pretty awesome.
Let's see what happens to the flexible OLEDs
when we light them on fire.
My lighter was touching the display for about
10 seconds, with the screen fully functioning
before I heard a pop.
The top plastic layer had melted into a bubble
and exploded, leaving a permanent defect on
the surface of the watch.
Due to this development, I highly recommend
keeping your smartwatch away from open flames.
You're welcome.
The screen still works totally fine under
the blemish.
If you look closely, you can see a little
plastic lip around the edge of the display,
almost like a screen protector.
The same type of plastic lip that was shown
on top of the Samsung Galaxy fold display.
Like the Galaxy fold, this is probably a built-in
component of the screen and not a screen protector,
so I won't be peeling it off at this time.
Learning from other people's mistakes is the
best way to learn.
Thanks Marques.
Maybe I'll remove it during the teardown though,
if the Nubia Alpha survives the rest of my
durability test.
Obviously the watch can be bent along the
curve of your wrist with it's chain mail-like
linkage along the band.
I can get a pretty tight curve out of it,
for say a super small wrist.
It's the same on both sides.
The metal structure has a bit of play to it,
but overall the watch feels solid when bending
it down from inside.
But what happens when the screen gets bent
back the other direction?
Do flexible OLED panels swing both ways?
I was able to get a decent idea.
With the whole panel straightened out, and
even bending back the opposite direction,
as much as the circular metal frame would
allow before locking out, the screen is amazingly
still working, and does indeed actually bend
both directions.
I'm impressed.
Even more impressive is that this is a legit
product for sale right now – not a prototype
or demo unit.
This is retail.
All for about the same price as an Apple watch.
It's definitely a niche product, of course,
for the super techy people who like conversation
starters.
But I'm glad it can still survive some abuse....just
keep the screen away from sharp objects.
I like where Nubia is headed, and I look forward
to seeing where things go from here.

Let me know what other tech you want to see
tested down in the comments.
And come hang out with me on Twitter and Instagram.
Thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
