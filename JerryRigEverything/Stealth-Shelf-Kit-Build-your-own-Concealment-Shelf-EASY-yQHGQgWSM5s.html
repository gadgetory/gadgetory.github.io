looks like a normal shelf from the
outside but when this skull is placed in
just the right position the bottom will
come out revealing whatever you have
hidden on the inside when I first saw
the stealth shelf on the king of randoms
YouTube channel I knew I had to have one
and I knew my subscribers would get a
kick out of it as well so I messaged him
and I asked him if I could show how it
works how it's made the construction and
how to mount it to a wall on my channel
lucky for us he had an extra kit for me
to assemble and he's about to have a
whole lot more kits for everyone to
assemble with his Kickstarter so if you
want a stealth shelf of your very own
finish watching this video to see how
it's made and mounted to a wall and then
check out the link in the video
description to get a stealth shelf of
your very own the kickstarter ends this
week though so don't waste too much time
let's get started so here's my stealth
shelf kit the package of the kick
starter kit might look a bit different
but all the construction will be the
same as what i show you here in this
video first make sure you have all the
parts the kid starts off with the base
of the shelf it has the two circles
drilled into the top and then the three
crown molding pieces that make up the
sides then the middle section with its
two side pieces and the large top
rectangle with its three then trim
pieces a package of screws the hinges
the chains and the magnetic lock which
I'll show you in a bit let's start with
the core of the shelf this is what's
going to hold all of the shelf weight so
it's pretty important I'm going to use
the four large screws that go through
the backboard into each of the little
arms pay attention to how the arms are
oriented the diagonal cut on each arm is
facing down and there is a little bit of
space on that back board under each arm
I'm going to show this whole project
only using hand tools but if you have a
drill it'll speed things up considerably
either way this project doesn't take
very long all the hard work is already
done for you now that my core is done
let's set that off to the side and start
with my top shelf piece this is the
largest wood rectangle in your kit each
of these thin little decorative trim
pieces will go around the edge of the
board to hide the compartment door below
it and to hide the layers of the top
board itself so I use a dab of wood glue
and spread it thin all along where the
trim is going to touch spreading the
wood glue thin helps it get tacky
faster and it won't booze out when you
put the trim in place if you are going
to stain your finished shelf using wood
glue would not look good with stain on
it so be careful not to get glue on any
visible exterior wood I line up my trim
with the top layer of wood just below
the flat surface of the shelf and then I
use a super small finish nail to pin it
in place also included with the kit if
you notice the decorative trim is not
flat so in order to sink the nail into
the surface of the trim you'll need a
nail setter if you don't have one of
those you can use a longer screw or nail
to get that head into the surface of the
wood the side pieces of trim go on the
exact same way just make sure to line up
each of the 45-degree pre-cut angles
with each other to make nice corners set
the top on a soft rag or towel to not
damage the trim as you are working on
the opposite end the nice thing about
this kit is that everything is already
pre-cut alright now that our core and
our top piece is done we're going to
assemble the base lining up these huge
angles can be tricky I'm going to use
the same wood glueing technique as
before before I line up the trim pieces
with the bottom board corners I'm going
to poke a small hole on my nail is going
to sit this will keep the nail from
sliding out of place when I hammer it
down you receive quite a few of the
little finished nails in this kit so
feel free to add a few here and spread
them out along the rest of the project
trim as you need them adding the side
pieces to the bottom crown molding gets
a little trickier the most important
part is that corner or seam where the
two pieces of molding meet I want them
to line up perfectly I add one small
nail to the bottom corner of the board
and then I tack the top corner of the
trim with another nail after they are
perfectly lined up this holds them in
place as I add a third little nail to
the far bottom corner after pulling it
down just a tiny bit so it's parallel
with the bottom of the base let's watch
this other side and it will make a
little more sense I add wood glue to all
sides just like usual and then get that
bottom corner next to the seam nailed
first then I'll nail that top corner of
the moulding to get it to line up
perfectly now this crown molding was
just a tiny bit off with that angle cut
but since I've already lined up that
corner seem perfectly and nailed it into
place it can flex a little bit before I
nail it to the base of the shelf and the
seam will
we'll be perfect because it was named
first inside of your kit there is a
small angle of wood this is part of the
latch I decided that the strongest place
for this latch to be is in the center of
the shelf add a little bit of wood glue
to the bottom and then nailed the little
sliver into the crown molding with the
small finish nails one on the top and
one on the backside making sure that the
nails aren't going to poke through the
shelf into the front before I nail them
in place if you have any extra small
finish nails feel free to spread them
around the rest of the trim so
everything's held securely in place and
before I add any hardware I'm going to
add the color one nice thing about
building your own shelf is that you get
to pick the color you can stain it or
paint it however you want I chose a dark
stain I apply a thin coat of stain with
a rag and then while it's still wet I
wipe off the excess liquid so it leaves
an even coloring across all of the wood
it helped to drip a little bit of extra
stain into the fine details of the crown
molding
since the rag wouldn't reach it directly
and then I can wipe off the excess still
no matter what you decide to use regular
paint or stain make sure that you start
in a non visible area like the inside or
the bottom so that any early mistakes
will be hidden from view
now that the stain or paint is dry we
can add the hardware these are called
mortise pull overlay cup hinges in this
kit all of the hard legwork is already
done the hole in the base is drilled out
and the screw locations on that Center
core piece that we already assembled are
pre marked as well you should expand the
hinge first though just loosen up that
top screw and slide the middle part up
it is a small adjustment but it'll give
you a bit more room to play with tighten
that top screw back down to finalize the
adjustment the bottom screw on this
hinge is used to adjust how close the
bottom drawer sits to the wall I'll show
you that in a second loosely screw the
hinges into the pre marked holes on the
center core but don't tighten them down
all the way just yet we need to get the
screws lined up in the bottom part of
the hinges first then when all the
screws are all lined up tighten each
screw all the way it's time to attach
the top shelf I propped up the center
core with my pliers so that the core is
level then I took the larger nails and
hammered that top board into the center
core making sure to sink a few nails
into the core arms as well for security
and it works the Shelf opens and closes
without the bottom board touching the
table
this is important because if it touches
the table during the opening process it
will also touch and damage your wall
when it's sewn up the nice thing about
these hinges is that you can adjust the
bottom screw so if it touches the table
or you just want a bit more space screw
in that bottom screw a bit and it will
lift that bottom edge of your shelf away
from the wall giving it more room to
move now for the magic this is a little
plastic lip that goes with the locking
mechanism this lip gets installed flush
with that little piece of extra wood
that we nailed in earlier make sure that
the top of this latch the little piece
of wood and the top of the molding are
all flat with each other here is the
magnetic lock when any strong magnet
gets close it unlocks itself even
through the thick top word of this shelf
lining this magnetic lock with that
little plastic lip is pretty easy I use
the toothpaste trick from grants video
apply toothpaste to the top a little
plastic bit and when the shelf is shut a
dab of toothpaste gets left on the top
board letting us know generally where
the lock needs to sit i mark the screw
holes with a lock and then set my two
screws in place it doesn't need to be
super exact at this point because the
lock can be slid up or down along the
screws so if it doesn't connect with the
plastic the first time adjust it again
until the whole latch is making contact
with its little plastic counterpart then
when the magnet is placed on top it will
unlock allowing you full access to your
hidden goodies inside
now this last bag contains the chains I
use my screwdriver to pilot a little
hole into the arms of the core and then
stick the screw into the circular washer
and then through the chain and then
repeated the process on the other end of
the chain making sure that both chains
have the same tension on either side so
mounting a shelf is going to be a new
puzzle all by itself in most North
American homes we have something called
drywall which is the outside of the wall
if you screw a shelf in the drywall the
shelf can't hold much weight this is
what happened when my roommate put these
floating shelves in and this one ripped
out of the wall so with my floating
shelf since it's going to have stuff
inside of it we want to find something
called a stud the studs happen every 16
inches inside of this drywall you can
take a stud finder and place it on the
wall to tell you where the studs are at
or you can just knock on the wall wait
till he has something solid and you
found a stud so if you're going to be
hanging your shelf on concrete or brick
your
I need something like this this is
called a lead anchor you drill a hole in
the concrete or the brick set the lead
anchor and then your screws will go
through the shelf into the anchor
supposedly these anchors hold about 50
pounds so as long as you have one anchor
on either side of the shelf you should
be good to go
so these holes are drilled exactly 16
inches apart and so they should be able
to hit two studs right there on that
wall the holes drilled into the back of
the shelf make it easier to find the
studs I set one screw into place and
then use the level to make sure that the
shelf isn't sitting crooked before
putting in the rest of the screws
remember measure twice cut once
double check all of your measurements
and stud locations before hanging the
Shelf
all right so we have the Shelf installed
I have taken a skull and put in some
magnets on the bottom of them they're
the rare earth magnets they can get on
Amazon for pretty cheap and so when I
line this skull up with the little lock
it will latch and unlatch so we can
close it up it's locked
looks like a normal shelf then I take
the skull unlock it it'll drop back down
now grant the king of random is using
his shelf to hide weapons passports or
even money but my own research has
concluded that this shelf is perfect for
hiding 60 Oreos or 200 strands of
licorice or even 3481 skittles
if you want one of these kits for
yourself I will link the Kickstarter in
the video description of this video if
you enjoyed watching this project and
want to see a bunch of other creative
projects by the king of random head on
over to his YouTube channel thanks for
watching hope to see you around so
there's a shelf just barely finish the
skill seen luckily we didn't get too
many on the carpet my little makeshift
funnel worked out pretty well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
