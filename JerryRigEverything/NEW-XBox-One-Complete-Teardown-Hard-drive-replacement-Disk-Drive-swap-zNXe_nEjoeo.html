Xbox one from Microsoft today we're
going to take it apart and show you how
to fix the hard drive CD drive and
everything else inside of it do start
taking it apart you're going to start
with this grille on the side and you're
going to take a little pry tool and slip
between the grille in the frame and the
grille just pops up and away from the
Xbox and then that leaves us with this
little plastic piece that holds the two
halves together so you're going to slide
that back and out and I'll slide out and
then the sad part we do have to remove
the void sticker from the side of the
xbox and on the side right here if you
press your finger in it releases one of
the major clasps and then you're going
to have to take your pry tool and
release all the rest of the clasps along
the top of the ports and a little grill
that's right there this is my second
time doing it so it's a lot easier your
first time you'll have to sit there and
pry at it for a second now you can take
the top and lift it up but be careful
not to lift it too far because there's
still a ribbon cable on the far side
that's pretty fragile so how to get rid
of this ribbon cable as you lift up the
little blue extra tab on the side and
then you will be able to slide back a
little plastic piece right here which
releases the whole ribbon cable and then
you are free to take the top off the
Xbox here's a little speaker there's a
tab at the top that you press in and the
speaker lifts up and out away from the
Xbox and then the two little cables that
clip onto the motherboard just lift up
and out as well here is a little wire
cable and I'm not 100% sure what this
goes to it could be the Bluetooth could
be Wi-Fi but there's two screws on it
and you undo those screws and lift it
straight up and out and the Lund clasp
now here's some freakishly long screws
that hold everything together these are
the green ones the red ones are shorter
screws around where the Wi-Fi /
Bluetooth / circuit board thing was and
then once all the screws are out the top
metal piece lifts away the little metal
or what hold the wire cable in place so
Bend those back and then the wire cable
will come away from the top metal piece
and this brings us to the good stuff so
you can see the hard drive in the CD
drive right here I'm going to lift it up
and away from the bottom plastic first
since those freakishly long screws are
not holding it together anymore and so
the CD drive to get that out I'm just
taking out the little wires that hold it
together so I'm just going to wiggle
them a little bit and then pull them
straight back and then this releases the
CD drive to remove the plastic bracket
it's just like giant clips so you've
been both sides out a little bit and the
CD drive comes apart and now I'm just
going to clip it back into place as all
the replacement parts you can find in
the video description below
Amazon usually has pretty good deals on
this stuff after a couple months after
the release so I will link those for you
here is the hard drive and I'm going to
release it from the motherboard side of
it mostly because the connection to the
actual hard drive itself is impossible
to take apart until you release some
screws which I'll show you in a second
now that the wires are unconnected from
the motherboard the four screws that
hold the hard drive to the plastic piece
are there and now you can see the two
little circles on the big connector that
was holding the hard drive in that was
keeping it from moving but now that it's
not connected to the big plastic bracket
I can remove the large connector and
there's the hard drive
once again parts from the video
description below I'm not going to take
apart the fan in the heatsink mostly
because I don't want to deal with the
thermal paste holding the heatsink to
the cert to the motherboard but you get
the gist of how the Xbox works once
again all the parts are listed in the
video description below if you have any
questions leave them in the comments
