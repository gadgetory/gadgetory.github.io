the fuel pump and replace it in a 2000
Toyota Solara and this you want to make
sure that the pump is actually broken
first so put your gear to the gas tank
and try to start the car and you'll hear
if the pump is running on the inside or
not I'm also some Toyota's had a fuse to
tell you whether or not the the pump is
broken or if the fuses shot obviously
just replace that and see if it works
anyway so it's underneath the back seat
and you can see me right now I've lifted
up kind of a cap of it I have been
taking off these little bolts I believe
that's an eight millimeter seven or
eight I'm I was out in the middle of
nowhere as I was replacing this bump
then there's two little clips that
connect the pump to the gas line so you
press in two clips and you can pull off
the plastic end and you can lift up the
fuel pump and the whole you know
contraption right out of the gas tank
itself just like so you got to twist it
and move it around a little bit and you
really do want to be wearing gloves when
you're doing this gas is one of those
things you know causes cancer and all
that stuff so you want to avoid that and
here you can see the little the unit
that tells you how much gas is in your
gas tanks when your gas tank is full the
little bobber goes up and when your gas
tank is empty it goes down so that's
your feel gauge then right here at the
bottom you can see that fuel filter or
just make sure there's no gunk and stuff
in the gas as it goes through the pump
take off the bottom plastic a little bit
and then you can see in this shot that I
am taking apart that little latches the
orange plastic pieces that hold the
plastic pump into place so you just undo
each of the little latches and pull the
pump away from the whole unit then I'm
going to pop off the fuel filter just
like a with a little screwdriver just
kind of lift up on it there's a little
metal clasp that will pop off and then
the fuel filter will slide off the old
fuel pump
and there is the pump itself I'm on
connecting the electronics from as well
right now and this is the culprit you do
need the little plastic bit then your
new kit will come with little rubber
washer that goes on the new pump and
then there's another plastic bit on the
bottom below that you're going to
transfer those things over to the new
pump just like so using your new rubber
washer and then the same old plastic
pieces alright one of the crappy things
is that you do have to splice a new a
new head connector onto the old wires so
I just cut the wires and I'm going to
strip them down just a little bit and
then in your new kit you will have the
little wire connectors I think they're
the butt end connectors that you'll just
put on the end and then crimp shut to
make a good connection between the two
wires and I'll show you how to do that
just kind of twist in the ends to keep
all the wires together
then here is the little connector so I'm
going to put that on the old wire and
then grab a pair of pliers end up using
a pair of vise grips that they had a
better clamp and you don't want this
thing come and loose if you have to it
because it comes loose and your palm
starts working you have to do this all
over again
anyway I'm going to list all the parts
and stuff that you'll need in the video
description below
Amazon usually where I get all my stuff
so you can just get it off of there
pretty quick and easy
now I'm sliding the new connector that
will attach to the new pump into the
little wire splicer and I'm pinching it
shut with my vise grip so that it's
super secure and now I'm kind of taking
the wires and pushing them as far up
into the unit as possible so that
they're out of the way and that they
won't be sitting in the gas when I put
it back into the tank and I'm lining the
fuel pump up with a little slot and
pressing it in and this will take some
force just make sure that your wires are
out of the way in the top and that you
cannot get a good grip on it and force
it into place so it will latch into the
orange plastic pieces
perfect they're going to take the fuel
filter and just press it into place get
it as far on there as possible but the
orange plastic piece that goes on the
bottom will hold it into place once you
get it on there you can see right there
in that shot now I have the orange
plastic piece put back down on it anyway
get it in there line it up straight clip
it back in get all those bolts back into
place and you're set you have any
questions make sure you leave in the
comments below I think most Toyota cars
are the same you can also hit me up on
Twitter or Facebook or even Google+ if
you're into that kind of thing
anyway if you have any questions be sure
to let me know thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
