review it from the inside.
Let's find out what the in-screen fingerprint
scanner looks like and see if there was any
extra room for that headphone jack.
Let's get started.
(Intro)
I've already removed the back glass once when
I was creating the transparent version, so
this time around it should be a bit easier.
My clear tape is strong, but not as strong
as the watertight black adhesive.
I'll slice through the remaining tape and
set the glass off to the side, exposing our
little silver screw over the battery plug.
I'll set the screw off to the side along with
the silver bracket and unclip the battery
with my red plastic pry tool.
Normally the battery does have a pull tab,
but I covered it up with my red mod.
Either way, the 3700 milliamp hour battery
still comes out easy enough, which is nice.
Now for the 8 screws holding down the NFC
and black plastics over the motherboard.
The NFC communicates with the square gold
contact pads on the back.
The motherboard itself has a charging port
ribbon connector and 2 more circuit board
extension ribbons down at the bottom, each
unsnapping like little Legos.
The mute slider switch over here on the left
looks pretty interesting from the inside.
It has 3 stages: silent, vibrate, and ring.
I'll unplug the 2 wire cables over on the
right side of the motherboard, and remove
the one silver screw still in the center of
the board.
The dual SIM card tray is over here on the
right underneath the square white water damage
indicator.
There is no expandable memory card slot.
After unplugging the front camera up at the
top, and the front sensor ribbon hidden underneath,
we can finally pull the motherboard away from
the frame.
There is no thermal paste or heat pipe on
the OnePlus 6T.
The front facing camera is a 16 megapixel
little guy with electronic image stabilization.
And the rear facing camera is a dual setup.
The 16 megapixel main sensor does have OIS,
but the secondary depth sensor does not.
I'd still much rather that OnePlus swap the
depth sensor with a telephoto wide angle lens,
since blurry background portrait selfies can
all be done with software and one camera.
But that's just my opinion.
I'll plug both cameras with their metal housing
back into the motherboard and continue onward
to the frame.
We have the earpieces up here, along with
the microphone hole and it's water resistant
screen.
No copper heat pipes, but those are just an
efficiency perk and not necessarily a necessity.
This phone is one of the cheaper priced flagships
out there right now, which means that it doesn't
have every single bell and whistle.
The bottom plastics have 7 screws holding
everything together - normal Phillips screws,
which are nice.
I'll link my tool kit in the video description.
Peeling back the plastic reveals not a lot
of extra room down here.
We have the circular vibrator over on the
left with the circuit board, and the fingerprint
scanner hardware and the USB-C plug is in
the middle.
Then the loud speaker, taking up the bulk
of the space, over on the right side.
So OnePlus is technically utilizing all of
the space inside the 6T, but I also think
removing the headphone jack was a very calculated,
intentional decision so they could sell more
in the wireless OnePlus Bulletproof headphones.
Business is business, even if it doesn't benefit
the rest of us.
There are 2 Phillips head screws holding down
the charging port into the frame.
I'll lift out the small circuit board.
Some of the more sensitive electronics are
coated to prevent corrosion, which is a good
water resistance move.
The charging port ribbon is the last obstacle
on our way to unburying the in-screen fingerprint
scanner.
I'll pull it out of the frame.
This time it has a green rubber ring on the
tip – not quite as aesthetic as the 6's
red rubber, but the only people who ever see
this is you guys.
So we can all just complain quietly in our
heads about OnePlus' lack of red.
Now for the fingerprint scanner.
This thing is pretty sweet.
I'll pull off the shielding tape from the
top, and then there are 2 black screws holding
the sensor in place.
After these are out, I'll pull it very gently
from the phone body.
It's essentially just a camera.
The black portion is a lens and has a sensor
underneath to take a close up picture of your
unique fingerprint, using the green light
animation projected from the display to illuminate
the ridges in your finger.
Looking through the hole the sensor sits in,
we can see the underside of the AMOLED display,
and the shadow of my finger as it passes along
the underside of the glass.
We can also see the light from my flash shining
back through the same circular hole.
Looking from the outside we can see the display
is still totally intact, which means this
time around the fingerprint scanner is a nonessential
part of the display.
I think this fingerprint scanner is a solid
first step to having under-display selfie
cameras – meaning we can get rid of screen
notches altogether.
Thumbs up for that.
Just for kicks and giggles, I want to partially
reassemble this phone and turn on the display
to see what the hole looks like with the screen
turned on.
I'll tuck the motherboard back in with the
front facing camera.
And I'll clip on the charging port ribbon,
but I won't tuck it into the frame just yet.
The bottom circuit board is back where it
belongs.
I won't be able to reattach everything for
this experiment, but hopefully the 6T will
still function.
It obviously needs the battery, and then I'll
turn it on.
Even with the phone mostly disassembled, the
screen still works, but does not shine backwards
into the hole itself.
The LEDs in the screen only shine one direction,
outward, which is good news for the fingerprint
sensor camera.
That was kind of fun.
I'll turn the screen off again and finish
putting it back together.
The fingerprint scanner gets put back into
it's hole and screwed in with the metallic
tape over top.
Then I'll take care of the charging port,
the lower circuit board, and all the bottom
plastics and screws.
The battery and the upper plastics can be
set into place with their screws.
Overall, the OnePlus 6T has the same basic
design we saw with the 6 – just with the
addition of the fingerprint scanner and slightly
larger battery.
I'm a fan of these lower priced flagships.
It's nice to see companies looking out for
their customers.
Surprisingly enough, everything still works...even
the fingerprint scanner.
Not too shabby.
Nice job OnePlus.
I'll link my toolkit in the description.
Let me know if you have any questions in the
comments.
And come hang out with me on Instagram and
Twitter.
Thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
