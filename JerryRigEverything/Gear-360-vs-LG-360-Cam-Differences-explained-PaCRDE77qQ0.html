popular 360 degree cameras on the market
the gear 360 and the LG 360 yesterday I
made a video comparing the footage
between the two cameras today I'm going
to show and explain the physical
differences between the cameras
themselves both cameras shoot pictures
or video out of both lenses
simultaneously and then use an app to
stitch the circles together so they can
be viewed as a flat image once the
footage is transferred to your phone
both of the apps are pretty
straightforward and simple to use but
the one thing I really like about the LG
app is that you can turn on the camera
with your phone remotely I was finishing
up my o cemani Half Dome hike that I
also filmed in 360 and I had the camera
in my backpack turned off the app could
turn it on and start transferring files
without me ever needing to dig through
all my gear to find the camera the gear
360 has to be turned on physically
before it will connect and transfer
files with the app one thing I really
like about transporting the LG 360 was
the hard case that it comes with I have
no problem just tossing it into a back
pack the gear 360 only comes with a
cloth pouch so you got to be a little
more careful with it during
transportation I will link both cameras
down in the video description of this
video so you can compare the current
prices since that will change over time
right now the LG 360 is about half the
price of the gear 360 the LG 360 is the
simpler of the two cameras and there
aren't as many features or options it
has an internal battery a slim design
and a standard camera mount on the
bottom next to the SD card slot so you
can stick it on any tripod it charges
with USB type-c the camera can be
operated without the app just hold down
the main button for video or press the
main button once for a still image in
360 degrees as far as the software
options go a shoots in 2k resolution and
has the basic camera settings that most
current smartphones do this 2k camera
shoots with a bit rate of about 18 in
camera and keeps that same bitrate
during the stitch as it transfers to
your phone the gear 360 is a bit more
complex it has a round water-resistant
design and charges with a standard micro
USB in
the watertight door that also houses the
removable battery and SD card slot it
also has a little screen up top to tell
you how much recording time you have
left and what setting the camera is
currently on as far as software features
go it will shoot in 4k resolution take
still images but it also can do
time-lapse shots and loop video which is
a good feature for something like
Facebook it can even shoot slow-motion
and 60 frames a second if you drop it
down to 2k resolution the same as the LG
cam it also has options to enable
sharpness and stabilization to the
footage as well this camera has a bit
rate of 30 megabits a second but it
doubles that bitrate as it's
transferring the files to your phone for
60 megabits a second it might be
cheating a little bit to add information
after the picture has already been taken
but at least is not losing quality the
glass lenses on the gear 360 are huge
and since they are further away from the
sensor it's easier to notice when dust
falls on the glass so make sure you keep
it clean between shots hopefully you
enjoyed this video and I could help
explain just a little bit more about the
differences between the two cameras give
me a thumbs up and consider scribing if
you haven't already I always both behind
the scenes stuff on Instagram and
Twitter thanks for watching hope to see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
