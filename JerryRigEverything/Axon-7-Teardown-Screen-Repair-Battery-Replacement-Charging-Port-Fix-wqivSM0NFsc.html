some of you might recognize it as the L
nach Civ from my durability test this
thing held up very well during that test
and now it's time to see what this
mid-range Android phone looks like from
the inside it's always considerate to
turn the phone off before initializing
surgery and moving the SIM card tray as
step number two there are no visible
screws on this device which is great for
aesthetics but not so great for
repairing some heat is required to
soften the glue under each of the
plastic speaker grilles at the top and
bottom of the phone this phone does have
dual front firing speakers though which
is kind of cool there are four screws at
the bottom and two screws at the top I
will link all the replacement parts and
tools down in the video description
right below this video
after those screws are out the rear back
metal panel can be separated from the
front and the fingerprint scanner ribbon
cable can be disconnected from the back
of the phone just like a little Lego and
you can see the little golden contact
points for the rear LED flash these just
rest on top of the motherboard pins for
their signal you can tell that the rear
panel is made from aluminum by the
silver color and by the machine mil
marking designs all around the inside
this really does help add strength to
the phone so thumbs up for a solid build
quality now for the electronics we're
going to disconnect the battery first it
is located under the silver bracket that
has one screw holding it down then I can
unclip the little connector with my
plastic pry tool so it won't short out
I'll pop off the extension ribbon cable
next and then the screen ribbon and the
little Lego style connector for the
power buttons on the side this white dot
up top is the liquid damage indicator so
if your phone ever gets wet it will turn
pink and your warranty will be voided
so try to keep your phone dry there are
four screws holding down the motherboard
to the frame and then the motherboard
can lift off after you detach the one
signal wire from that bottom right side
the front facing camera unsnaps like a
little Lego just like the rear facing
camera and the processor or brains of
the phone is the big black square you
see on the back of the board it rests on
top of this pink gummy like substance to
help with the heat dissipation the pink
frosting might look
but it is not don't eat this you can see
that the rear camera has OIS by the way
the lens can physically move around
inside of the camera unit the headphone
jack is soldered into place but hey at
least it has one I'll snap both of the
cameras back into place just lining out
the little connection and clicking it
down just like you would if you were
playing with LEGOs at the bottom of the
phone there is a white loudspeaker cap
there are two screws holding that down
and then it'll lift off it's interesting
that the loudspeaker at the bottom is
the exact same size as the top earpiece
so the sound will be equal coming from
both ends of the phone the charging port
has three more screws holding it in
place I can remove that metal bracket
over the end of the extension ribbon
cable and that will pop off as well it
was nice of ZTE to put the arrow on this
ribbon because it will only work in one
direction so don't stick it on backwards
one more wire cable at the bottom and
then there is a little bit of adhesive
holding the USB C charging port into
place but then it will lift away from
the frame the little hole you see in the
circuit board is for the microphone the
little metal circle is the vibration
motor and now we also get a good look at
the bottom loudspeaker it is the same as
the one at the top of the phone the
battery is very well adhered to the
frame unfortunately it has no magical
pull tabs to help you remove the
adhesive so it is very easy to puncture
as you're prying it up so be careful
heating it up with a blow-dryer or heat
gun will help it come out easier as well
try not to bend it too much and if
you're trying to keep your display
intact and functional make sure to be
careful with that ribbon that's running
up the left-hand side of the phone that
goes to the screen this flat copper
thing is called a heat pipe it's there
to help keep the processor cool
sometimes manufacturers will call it
liquid cooling but it's more of a vapor
chamber and it has no physical liquid
inside I also remove this pipe entirely
on my old galaxy s7 with no ill effects
so I'm sure the pipe is useful but it's
definitely not mandatory now the display
right now this AMOLED panel and the
glass are adhered to the mid frame of
this phone separating the two is pretty
impossible without damaging the display
so only attempt it if you have nothing
to lose and if you have a fully
functional display ready to put in its
place
it really is hard to find parts for ZTE
phones but if I do find any I will link
them in the video description
below this video but if I can't find any
replacement parts you can always buy
another broken axon 7 and Frankenstein
the working parts together to make one
useful phone it's time to put things
back together I'll plop the battery back
in and then get the charging port
situated along with the loudspeaker and
that white speaker cover with its two
screws get the extension ribbon clipped
in and the wire cable snapped down
before putting on the silver bracket and
those three screws for the charging port
board then up here at the top of the
phone the motherboard gets set into
place making sure that all the ribbons
are out of the way and not stuck onto
the board the only wire under the board
is the black wire that plugs in on the
bottom right I'll get the extension
ribbon cable clipped in and then the
power button ribbon and the screen
ribbon and the four screws on the
motherboard that gets screwed in before
I finally connect the battery power
power should always be the last thing
you connect on the board the metal
bracket with its screw will go over the
battery connection and then I can test
the phone making sure everything works
before I put the back panel on now I
know it works so I'll go ahead and turn
off the phone again
and attach the fingerprint scanner
ribbon and slip the phone back in to the
back metal panel you can always add new
adhesive under the plastic speaker
grilles at the top and the bottom make
sure you get all the screws screwed back
in as well there are two at the top and
four at the bottom my adhesive is still
kind of tacky so I'm just going to set
the grilles into place and hope for the
best if you haven't seen the durability
test of this phone yet go check it out
and subscribe if you like seeing tech
reviewed from the inside thanks a ton
for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
