new phone - for sale right now - that has
a full-on projector in the top.
Talk about crazy features.
Today we're going to be durability testing
the Blackview Max 1 to see if it can handle
every day life and see what this projector
is all about.
Spoiler alert - the projector is a bit better
than you think it is.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
So obviously, projectors need to be operated
in kind of a dark environment.
They're not as bright as say a TV.
But with one click, the Max 1 is activated
shooting the projector out the back.
And right now we're about 2 meters away and
this is the equivalent of a 45 inch TV, which
is incredible, especially since it's coming
out the top of a cell phone.
It's a laser projector with the resolution
of 720p, but it's interesting because you
can just take it anywhere.
It's in your pocket and you can use it at
a moment's notice where ever you want.
Every now and then you might catch a line
in the video you're watching flickering down
the projection, but that's only because of
the camera I'm using to film this phone.
In real life it doesn't appear when you're
watching the projection.
It has something to do with the camera shutter
speed or something like that.
Here's another example with a little drone
history video that I made.
This was me filming with the DJI Mavic Pro
2 out in the middle of Idaho with the wrecked
plane in the woods.
Kind of an interesting video...I'll link that
if you want to take a look at it.
It's crazy to me that they fit a laser projector
in the top of this phone, and it's displaying
on the wall behind me.
Some phone companies are like, oh, we don't
have room for a headphone hack, and then Blackview's
over here putting an entire projector.
So whether you want to watch movies or play
video games, what's cool about this is that
it can actually display whatever's on your
cellphone behind you or on the ceiling of
your room as you're using this phone.
And it's super funny that Apple produced the
iPod for, you know, $300, and then there's
this phone for almost the same price that
has a full fledged projector in it.
It just goes to show you that your dollar
goes a much longer way with Android than it
does with Apple.
Blackview does say that while you're using
the projector, it can project for 5 hours
before the battery goes down, which is pretty
impressive.
So we've talked a bit about the features,
but you know we're really here to find out
if it's durable or not.
Let's start with the scratch test.
It's hard to get over how cool this phone
is.
Quite possibly one of the coolest, or at least
the most unique phones of 2019.
On the Blackview website, the Max 1 is being
sold for $400 with the caveat that it only
works in Europe and Asia right now.
That might change in the future, of course.
But either way, it's pretty cheap.
This might come as a surprise to nobody, but
the Blackview Max 1 starts scratching at a
level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7.
The earpiece is made from metal with just
one thin row of circles just to let the sound
through.
There are 2 cameras on the front, both protected
by the front glass, a 16 megapixel front camera
with a secondary depth sensor.
The right side of the phone is pretty standard
- metal construction with a textured metal
power button and a plain metal volume rocker.
The top is where the real party happens.
Still all made from metal up here which is
good.
But then when I go to analyze the rectangular
opening for the laser projector, it's made
from plastic.
Yeah, it is recessed below the frame so it
should be protected from scratches most of
the time.
But since plastic does scratch easier than
glass, special cleaning precautions should
be taken when wiping off the surface.
The left side of the Max 1 is pretty plain,
minus the removable SIM and SD card tray - huge
fan of that.
It's very easy to transfer SD cards full of
movies.
The bottom of the phone has a loudspeaker
grill, USB-C port, and no headphone jack.
But since they stuffed an entire full projector
into the top of the phone, I think we can
make an exception this time around.
The back panel is made from glass with the
Blackview logo printed on the underside, which
won't scratch off.
The camera lens housing is made from metal,
and the circular lens protecting the 16 megapixel
sensor is thankfully made from glass.
The fingerprint scanner is scratchable.
After some heavy abuse it can still read my
finger, but then when I go to unlock the phone,
it does not work every single time.
The phone does get a little warm when the
screen is turned on and it's projecting at
the same time.
Not as warm as when I hold my lighter up to
it of course, but the little device is doing
a whole lot of work when it's projecting.
Luckily the internal 4680 milliamp hour battery
is there to handle the extra workload.
It can supposedly project for 5 hours at a
time.
Even after 40 seconds under the flame from
my lighter, nothing was really happening to
the 6 inch 1080p AMOLED display...just a yellowish
tinge to the pixels, but they eventually recovered
and the yellow tinge went away.
To turn the projector on, it's just one click,
and then whatever's on your screen starts
popping out the top.
Blackview claims their projector can make
a 200 inch screen, but I think it would be
pretty washed out at that point.
In a totally dark room, I think about 40 or
50 inches is plenty good enough.
Good enough, of course, with the stipulation
that the phone is structural and can handle
the abuse of everyday life.
When bent from the back, there is no flex
with the phone.
It's a pretty thick little guy with over 10
millimeters, which is 3 millimeters thicker
than the iPhone 10s, but it definitely doesn't
budge.
It's hard to argue with a super thick brick
phone construction.
I was honestly getting kind of bored with
the smart phones of 2018, but here in 2019
with all of it's motorized cameras, internal
projectors, and time-of-flight cameras, and
super high internal optical zoom cameras,
it's turning out to be a fantastic year for
smart phones.
The Blackview Max 1 passes my durability test.
It'll be super fun to see what that projector
component looks like from the inside.
This phone is just yet another example of
if you want a phone that does cool stuff,
you just have to pay less money for it.
Would you every use a projector if it came
built-in to your phone?
Let me know down in the comments.
Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already.
I will be taking this thing apart.
And come hang out with me on Instagram and
Twitter.
Thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
