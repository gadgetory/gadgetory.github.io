some turn out way better than others and
this is a story of one clear razor phone
that didn't turn out so well let's get
started so usually when I get brand-new
phones like this razor phone too I'm one
of the first people to ever try and take
them apart since manufacturers generally
frown upon dissecting phones or fixing
your phone yourself there is zero
instruction on how it's done initially I
thought that this year's razor phone
would be similar to last year's razor
phone and we would initiate the teardown
from the large earpiece turns out that
earpiece doesn't have any screws behind
it this year and it's completely
unnecessary to remove so let's just plop
that grill back into place and pretend
it didn't happen
perfect let's start over to open up the
razor phone too we start from the back
using a heat gun on this phone the glass
is a totally flat slab glass is still
fragile of course I'm being extra
cautious around the corners using my
razor blade to slice into the razor
phone slightly ironic the razor cuts the
thin band of watertight adhesive around
the inner edges once it's all sliced the
full slab of glass can pull away from
the device revealing the large black
wireless charging coil in the center and
the white LED pad for the razor snake
logo right below those dual cameras at
first glance is not as interesting
inside as some of the other clear phones
I've made but maybe this minimalist
razor vibe will still turn out good I'll
remove the dual camera lens bracket that
has these same black adhesive holding it
to the rear glass panel then the black
material applied to the underside of
this glass appears to be the same
scratch Bowl coating we saw on the pixel
3 meaning that instead of pulling it off
in one satisfying layer the whole thing
needs to be scratched off slice by slice
bit by bit I'm gonna try to leave the
Razer logo intact this time around since
the glow effect of the LEDs on the back
panel is kind of what makes this phone
stand out
it looks like the snakes are stuck on
with these same fragile coding as the
rest of the glass so cutting around them
is gonna be rather tedious but it does
give me plenty of time to think of more
super funny phone jokes like this one
why did the cell phone start wearing
glasses because it lost all of its
contacts the hardest part of this whole
project is the logo in the center trying
to keep that clean and neat while
scratching off all the black chain
around it
the good news is that the surface of the
glass panel is harder than my razor
blade so there is no razor scratch marks
on the surface of the glass my fingers
on the other hand are softer than the
razor blade but who needs all 10 right
in the end though I was relatively
successful and clarifying the back glass
panel it looks pretty slick and no
slices on my fingers thumbs up for that
I just wished the stuff underneath the
glass inside the phone was more
interesting to look at a little bit of
glass cleaner to get rid of any smudges
then I'll set the camera lens into place
directly over the cameras and then rest
the glass panel back into the razor -
it's definitely unique looking I think
this is one of those cases where a pure
transparent glass pack might not be the
best option
it might just need a more
semi-transparent radiant blend of black
and neon green on the glass and of
course a more interesting looking
wireless charging coil the razor phone -
might just be one of the few phones that
doesn't look good naked what do you
think it's pretty hard to follow up the
fantastic looking pixel 3 maybe I'll
just put one of my extra skins on the
back to make it look normal and pretend
it never happened again nailed it
I'll still be tearing down the razor
phone too - check out the inner liquid
cooling vapor chamber and to see if they
upgraded their tiny vibrator this year
hit that subscribe button if you haven't
already come hang out with me on Twitter
and Instagram and thanks a ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
