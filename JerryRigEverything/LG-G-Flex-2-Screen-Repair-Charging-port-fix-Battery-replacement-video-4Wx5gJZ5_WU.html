apart and fix almost everything on the
LG G flex 2 it's a fairly long name but
it's actually a pretty simple phone to
take apart once you remove the back
cover you'll see that there are 13
Phillips head screws I will link all the
tools that you'll need in the video
description below as well as replacement
parts for this particular phone there
are 13 screws that hold the back plastic
panel onto the back of the phone once
you remove those screws you can just
grab the little plastic and lift it up
it's held on by a series of clasps
you'll hear those pop off as you remove
that back cover here are the little
connection points for the power button
and then here is the water sensor you
can see it's white on one side and red
on the other so if it gets wet the red
will bleed through onto the white for
the rest of this project you'll need a
pry tool you don't have to buy the sexy
green one if you don't want you can
always use a plastic knife or your
fingernails if you're super cheap but I
will link these in the video description
below as well here is the speaker it
just rests on top of the charging port
it'll pop right off since you already
took out the screws you can see the gold
contact points there as well that just
rest against the charging port remove
the antenna cables they're just little
wire connectors that has pop off little
gold connection and there's two Phillips
head screws along the charging port as
well you have to remove take your
non-marring pry tool and lift up these
little waffle connectors they're like
little Lego pieces you just unsnap them
from the board and then there's one big
one up here on the motherboard as well
that you can unsnap and then unstick
from the battery it's held on by just a
little bit of adhesive once everything
is disconnected from the charging port
you can go ahead and lift that off from
the frame of the screen the charging
port also has the headphone jack you can
see that attached to the side as well
and the microphones down here as well
I will link these in the video
description so if you ever need to
replace them they are very easy to
replace here is the battery go ahead and
lift up the top connection to the
motherboard and then the battery should
come out there might be a little
adhesive holding it onto the motherboard
as well I will link replacement
batteries in the video description here
are the top parts of the antenna wire
cables and then there's some ribbon
cables up along the top as well the
first one was the front camera here is
the rear-facing camera 13 megapixels and
then we can lift out the motherboard
there are no screws or anything else
holding this down pretty straightforward
you can see the dual SIM
our des D card slot that's soldered onto
the main board so that's not replaceable
unfortunately and on the back you can
see the processor and a few other
components here is the vibrator motor
you can see it's got these two little
gold Springs on there that just rest
against the motherboard and that's how
it gets its signal here's the 13
megapixel rear camera that I'm lifting
up out of the screen frame you can see
that it has the optical image
stabilization there on the side here is
the front facing camera just rest inside
this little slot and then we have the
earpiece as well as the front sensors so
here is the screen itself so if you
break your screen whether it's just the
glass or the LCD this is the part you
want to buy it comes with the frame that
holds all of the cameras and the
motherboard and the battery it's a much
easier repair than trying to replace
just the glass or just the LCD I will
link this part in the video description
as well now I'm just replacing the front
camera putting back in the vibrator
motor and the rear facing camera just
fits down in its slot motherboard gets
tucked back in underneath the ribbon
cables and pull out the wire cables so
that they're not stuck under there as
well and you can see that you just line
up the little gold connector right over
the little circle and then pop it back
into place you hear a satisfying snap as
it gets pressed down on top of its
connection you'll know if it's connected
or not here is the battery just tucking
that back into its little slot on the
frame and plugging into the motherboard
if you want to be super safe you might
want to plug the battery into the
motherboard last but it's not a super
big deal what order you do it in got the
charging port screwed back into the main
frame and getting these antenna cables
tucked back into their grooves if
they're not tucked back in the back
casing won't fit perfectly over the
screen get the charging port plugged in
with the three connections that are on
it one of the motherboard and the other
two that are down below the battery make
sure those are pressed in and then you
can take the rear speaker and then clip
that down into place as well you hear it
snap in it's pretty straightforward
getting the rear plastic housing place
back over the phone as well snap
beginning all the way around and before
I put the screws in I'm going to make
sure that the phone turns on that
everything is working correctly screen
is looking good I'm gonna flip it back
over but all thirteen screws back into
place and then the back cover goes on if
you have any questions leave them down
in the comments I do try to stop in
regularly
answer as many as I can if you liked

for watching and hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
