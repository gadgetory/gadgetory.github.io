the most recent flagship from Nokia
mostly only available outside the USA
Amazon does sell a few stateside and
that's where I got mine Nokia is
pronounced differently all over the
world but here in the USA
saying Nokia is pretty standard this is
the same phone that can record video in
split-screen using both the front and
rear cameras simultaneously pretty sweet
I'll leave the video camera test for a
different video this one's all about
durability let's get started nokia says
this is their most powerful Android
smartphone so far let's keep our fingers
crossed that they stuck all that power
in a durable body this phone is using
6000 series aluminum the same stuff
Apple had to stop using because all
their phones were bending but we'll see
how it holds up with Nokia behind the
construction like always we start
scratching the front glass with my most
picks and with Gorilla Glass 5 in place
over the IPS display we get the flagship
norm of scratching at level 6 and a
deeper scratch with the level 7
this means that keys and coins won't do
any damage but glass isn't invincible so
a screen protector is always a good idea
the home button is down at the bottom of
the phone and holds its own against my
razor blade no damage or scratches are
done to the surface of the button so
it'll last quite a long while sliding up
at the top of the phone we get the 13
megapixel front-facing camera protected
under that same Gorilla Glass 5 of the
front screen so no damage happening here
then we have the earpiece it has a thin
nylon covering underneath that glass
but even after has been damaged and
punctured it won't pull out from the
phone so if for whatever reason to get
it dirty with makeup or dirt just be
gentle to not puncture it while getting
the gunk out now the back of the phone
is using anodized 6000 series aluminum
which isn't as solid as the 7000 series
in recent iPhones but it's not always
about the quality of the metal the
construction and the shape has a lot to
do with how the metal holds up the
scratching Keys initially leave a mark
butter rubs away with my fingers my
razor blade on the other hand
manages some real damage to the metal
this phone comes in four colors polished
blue polished copper tempered blue and
tempered steel and while my particular
phone isn't blue I think I drew the
Twitter bird logo pretty well a
little-known fact is that the bird
actually has a name Larry kind of random
but now with that random fact you'll be
really fun at parties you're welcome
the Nokia 8 has a dual camera setup on
the back but it's one of those
monochrome sensor deals instead of a
zoom lens like on the note 8 or a
wide-angle lens like on the LGV 30 so it
just depends on what kind of pictures
you need in your life either way both
lenses are protected by glass so they
won't be scratched or damaged easily
like a plastic lens would Nokia did use
a plastic lens on their Nokia 3 this
year so I'm glad they avoided that with
this flagship besides the phone are
completely metal up at the top though
next to the essential headphone jack we
get a plastic antenna band and I am
actually a really big fan of this design
because the plastic wraps around past
the corners corners are most likely to
impact the ground first
during a drop and it's nice to have a
forgiving and absorbing material sitting
there the side buttons are made from
metal and then down at the bottom with
the USB C charging port we have another
string of plastic wrapping around each
of the corners on the base taking a
lighter to the phone is as useful as
ever the stock background just so
happens to be an iceberg
setting the appending doom and global
warming jokes aside this phone does
claim to be IP 54 water resistant which
basically means nothing light rain
probably won't do damage to your phone
but any shallow puddle sink or toilet
will kill your phone the 1440p IPS
display lasted 10 seconds under my flame
with an IPS LCD the pixels come back to
life after I remove the heat let's hope
it's an allegory that the ice caps will
do that in real life as we transition to
more environmentally-friendly energy
sources double checking the Nokia logo
on the back the flame from this small
lighter is not near hot enough to affect
the aluminum but the logo is embedded
into the back shell so with time the
reflective bits might fall out just like
we saw with some of the older Nexus
phones it's pretty tightly embedded
though so it's hard to say for sure
I mentioned before nokia used that 6000
series aluminum on this phone and the
ultimate test of durability will show us
if that was a good idea or not flexing
from the front shows hardly any movement
in the body of the phone even flipping
the phone around and pressing from the
back almost had zero effect the shape of
the 6000 series aluminum inside the
Nokia 8 is more than enough to stand the
test of time this is a very solidly
built and durable phone Nokia's legacy
continues with some of the most well
built phones of this year the nokia 6
was pretty impressive as well come
follow me and Larry the Twitter bird
over on my Twitter and subscribe to stay
updated on all the future phones being
released later this year
begs dumb for watching and I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
