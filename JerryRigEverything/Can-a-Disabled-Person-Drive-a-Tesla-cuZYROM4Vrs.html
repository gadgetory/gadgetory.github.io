back when I made the off-road wheelchair
and surprise cambrie with it there was a
lot of questions in that video on how
she can drive a car cambrie can you
drive a car yeah I just use hand
controls would you like to show everyone
how you use these hand controls in a
Tesla yeah let's get started so a lot of
people think that Tesla autopilot is a
way to get from point A to point B but
that's not quite the case yet it still
requires you know a driver and
everything that cambrie needs to drive
this car is in this back there called
hand controls and I'm going to show you
how they work so this is cane breeze
first time actually driving the Tesla
and this particular style of hand
controls every hand control is a bit
different this is more of a temporary
solution once in my car are permanently
bolted in and you operate a little bit
differently than these ones as well but
they have the same basic principle so
right now these temporary hand controls
are set up around there's a strap around
the steering wheel this one goes down to
the gas pedal and this one goes down to
the brake pedal so as she grabs this
lever right here pushes in for the brake
and then she pulls back for the gas
pedal and that's how she can drive are
you ready all right
I really nervous okay this is the first
car I'll Drive of 2019
it's a good car to start with all right
as your seatbelts on safety first
explain to us how this setup is
different than the setup in your Subaru
and my setup if I push forward it's the
brake and down as gas but if I go down
nothing's gonna happen so it's just
there's gonna be a learning curve are
you ready yeah momentous okay I'll
explain how this works
all right so in order to work this whole
thing make sure the brakes on like it is
right now pressed in remember pulling
back towards you as the gas pedal if you
want to put it into park it's this
button right here if you want to go into
Drive you click it down hard all the way
and that gave us the D right there which
means we are in Drive and so if you
release on the brake like you just let
go of the hand controls for a second
yeah nothing's gonna happen
and the reason nothing happened is
because here on the display panel we
don't have creep enabled so the car is
never gonna roll forward by itself now
remember the hand controls are pretty
sensitive so if you pull back slowly
then we'll start inching forward and
there's a chance I might not have to use
the brakes as much as I would my Subaru
exactly because the regenerative braking
but you'll you'll get a feel for that as
we go there you go how does the
regenerative braking fill it's nice I
feel like I'm like I'm not applying
brakes but it just feels like it's
naturally so
like I would it was a break you got the
hang of this
so regenerative braking is actually
pretty awesome hey you never have to use
your brake pads so you hardly ever have
to change out components on the Tesla
because it's a super simple design you
have your internal motors and you have
your batteries there's no oil changes
nothing like that the nice thing about
it is that a it's slowing down for you
but B it's also charging the batteries
in the Tesla so you're actually gaining
mileage as you're going down hills or
you're coming to a stop it's using that
energy and putting it right back into
the batteries again which is pretty cool
you ready for the acceleration I can
just gun it yeah you're right cameras
are going
that is sweet okay Bree has the hand
controls figured out pretty well we're
gonna take it on the freeway and we're
gonna try out something called autopilot
which is kind of a game changer for the
disabled community a lot of people who
like I mentioned before I think
autopilot is a way to get from point A
to point B but that's seriously not
quite the case yet Elon Musk the CEO of
Tesla calls autopilot more of a hands-on
system instead of a self-driving system
we're currently on the freeway and
there's pretty well-defined lines on
either side and right here there's a
little gray indicator saying that the
car is ready for autopilot so we are
gonna have cambrie just tap twice down
on this joystick this notification is
now blue and the car is driving itself
are you feeling anxious she's watching
me do this but she's never been the one
in control this is a hands on
self-driving system Cambridge still has
to stay alert so about every 30 seconds
or so the car will make sure that the
driver is awake and alert by having them
apply light force to the steering wheel
but the nice thing is that cambrie
doesn't have to use her hand controls
when she's in this autopilot mode right
now her hands are completely free
there's a curve in the road and the car
is handling everything for us it is
going around this curve
and keeping us a safe distance from
other cars so you can see all the other
cars in position around us so you can
see that car in front of us just passed
and you can see it on the screen right
there
and then right here it says a plight
light force to the steering wheel and
then it lets you go back into hands-free
mode again nice guess we're still in the
test though we're gonna try out
autopilot again here on this road this
one's a little bit more curvy so we'll
see if cambree likes it alright the
green icon is there double tap down
alright the road is turning
are you feeling the cars doing all the
work for you yeah well I got nervous the
first time so we have three lanes right
now and because I know this road it's
gonna end up in just two it's now oh I'm
gonna do anything I just did the signal
and it moved us over to the link yeah
okay that's awesome we're still a little
I was driving I just signaled and it
found an opportune time to turn it's way
easier than driving a normal car so what
are your thoughts on autopilot it's a
little nerve-wracking right now just
because I'm not used to it
but it's pretty incredible one of the
reasons the model three has such a big
screen in the center is so that they can
actually watch movies while they're
driving down the road autonomous driving
is still you know five or ten years out
there's so many like regulatory
approvals they have to go through right
now if you turn on autopilot we'll still
blow through stop signs and stoplights
so you still have to have a driver
making sure the autopilot is not going
to mess up but it's still you know
pretty fun the cool thing about owning a
Tesla is that it gets constant updates
so right now we're the autonomous
driving is you know pretty much just on
the freeway or on roads that have
well-defined lines it's gonna get
improved over the next five or ten years
and this car already has the hardware to
get those software updates it has the
cameras and the sensors all around the
side so in fully autonomous driving is
finally legal we won't have to go out
and buy a new car this one just receives
a software update and it's ready to go
so one thing people might not think
about is when they're parking obviously
a handicap parking stalls usually have
like a space next to him where the
wheelchair can get in and out cambrie
have you ever had any problems with
parking before yeah when all the
handicapped parking spots are taken I'll
have to go to a normal spot I try and
make as much room between the car and my
car so that I can open the door wide
enough to get out but I can't guarantee
that that car is gonna stay where it is
and when I come back that there's not
gonna be another car close to me true
because her door has to be all the way
open to get from her wheelchair into the
driver's seat now normally we wouldn't
think twice about this situation with
the Tesla right behind us and a car
right next to us but with Cambridge she
can't fit through that tiny little gap
but Tesla's have something called summon
which is pretty cool
Elon has also said that you will be able
to drive your car like a little remote
control from your phone in the future as
of right now though it's just forward
and back when your phones within range
and I'll show you how that works so all
we have to do is just jump down here and
to summon it gets the vehicle ready for
us and then we can go forward and
reverse right now so we're just gonna
bring it forward
car turns on no one is driving right now
totally controlling it from my phone and
it even steered a little bit to avoid me
standing here which is pretty cool and
there is nobody in the car so cambrie
what do you think of the summon feature
in the car opens up doors for more
individuals with disabilities and I also
think it kind of makes the car feel a
little bit more like right so it's fun
it's like a little puppy you think one
interesting thing about Teslas is if you
walk into the Tesla dealership and just
buy one outright you don't get a whole
lot of special perks but if you use
someone's code usually there's a perk
attached with it like currently right
now you get six months of free super
charging it's like getting six months of
free gas for your gas powered car it's
pretty cool
the perks do change with time so if you
are interested in buying a Tesla I will
leave my code right here for you so you
can get that six months of free super
charging and down in the video
description so not only our Tesla some
of the quickest and most powerful cars
on the market but they're also the
closest cars to the fully self-driving
that is the future and I'm excited to
see where things go
if you have any questions leave down in
the comments I'm sure cambrie we'll be
there to answer them for you and thanks
ton for watching we'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
