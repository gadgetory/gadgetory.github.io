bit confusing this video will walk you
through the entire process from shooting
editing and uploading to YouTube all
with the LG 360 the normal footage
coming straight from the SD card cannot
be edited into a 360 video it just
appears as two large circles but it is
very easy to convert into a flat image
that can be edited there are two ways to
convert this image the first is using
your cell phone the camera connects with
Wi-Fi so find the clip you want to edit
Wi-Fi that clip over to your device and
then it will be converted on the device
itself the transferred clips that you
pull from your phone onto your computer
will not appear as two large circles it
will be a flat image that you can edit
the second way is with a free desktop
app from LG's website I will link it in
the video description below this video
download that and then you can see here
what the raw footage looks like directly
from the SD card it's just too huge
circles that don't look 360 ish at all
drag and drop that footage onto the LG
360 desktop app and it will convert into
editable files for you the app will drop
the finished files into the same folder
with the word result in the file name
then you can view the 360-degree footage
in the LG 360 desktop app if you open
the file in a normal video player you
can see that it fills up the entire
screen with footage that you can edit
with any editing software I personally
use Adobe Premiere so I'll pull it up in
that this is a 360 video that I made
previously of me hiking the US Emma T
Half Dome super sketchy hike I suggest
you watch that video after you're
finished with this one you can see that
the LG 360 shoots in 5.1 surround sound
so when you are done cutting and
splicing up your footage and you're
ready to export the final clip make sure
you switch your audio to the 5.1
surround instead of stereo and make sure
that you find the correct bitrate of the
file so that Adobe doesn't compress the
footage for you YouTube does enough of
that on its own because the original
files you can see here in the details
are just shy of 22 megabits a second so
that will maintain the quality and the
integrity of the video as I render
before YouTube's compression comes in
and smashes it all up now YouTube has no
way of knowing that the
is a 360-degree video unless we tell it
so we have to download the free 360
video metadata app from YouTube I'll
link this program in the video
description as well it is a very simple
app you just open the finish file that
you exported from your video editor and
check the satirical box you don't need
to worry about any of the other options
and then hit save as the program will
add the word injected into the file name
and you can save it wherever you want I
like leaving it next to the original
file just drag and drop that file into
the YouTube uploader and boom you are
ready to rock in order to view these 360
degree videos you need to be watching
from the Google Chrome web browser or
from the YouTube app on your phone
iPhone or Android anywhere else will
just display a flat video which isn't as
fun to watch please subscribe if you
learn something new today and hit that
thumbs up if you're in a good mood check
out the Yosemite 360-degree video I made
and another video of me flying teeny
drones with suely brakes key and to me
and Gary Turk thanks dome for watching
hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
