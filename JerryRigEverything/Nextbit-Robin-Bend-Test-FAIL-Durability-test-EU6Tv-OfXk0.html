Robin while this phone is not near as
popular as the iPhone or Samsung it is
definitely unique
the main selling point behind the Robin
is that instead of having a ton of
internal storage on the phone it just
backs up everything to the cloud my
first issue with that is that you'll
most likely need a pretty constant data
connection if you use a lot of apps and
secondly all the cloud really is it's
just someone else's computer but it is
an interesting business model the phone
is very lightweight and surprisingly
bigger than I anticipated it is pretty
much the same size as my galaxy s7 edge
I do durability tests on phones I've
tested over 25 phones now and most of
them survived my tests only three so far
have catastrophic ly failed let's start
the scratch test the next bit Robin has
Gorilla Glass 4 these pics will tell me
where the screen falls on Mohs scale of
hardness no surprise that the screen
starts to scratch at a level 6 this is
definitely the norm for smartphones
these days especially with Gorilla Glass
almost it has a plastic screen like the
droid turbo 2 and the galaxy s7 active
the 5 megapixel front-facing camera sits
flush with the blue top and it is made
of glass along with this black circular
counterpart on the left the flush lens
design can be dangerous for glass but at
least it won't scratch easy like some
plastic lenses we find on the blackberry
Prive the blue top and blue bottom
pieces are made of pure plastic the rear
13 megapixel camera lens is also made of
glass and the dual tone diffuser is made
of plastic
both of these also sit very flush with
the plastic housing but the lens will
still not scratch easy with use and
that's the important part the main
portion of the back panel is also made
of plastic give me a thumbs up if you're
glad this is my phone and not yours if
we move along to the volume buttons we
see that they are plastic as well along
with the power button slash fingerprint
scanner and the SIM card tray this phone
does not have an SD card slot because of
that whole cloud thing they got going on
now for the burn test on this 5.2 inch
IPS LCD display this phone lasted 11
seconds with the flame directly applied
to the screen then the pixels turned off
but as the phone cooled down the pixels
recovered turned back on and were fully
functional again not every phone
recovers the Galaxy s7 edge that you saw
previously in this video has a permanent
burn mark on the screen after the flame
tests the phone screen is cool to the
touch within seconds remember that I
have tested over 25 phones now and only
three have catastrophic ly failed let's
move on to the bin test this Robin did
not make it very far from the nest even
budget phones normally survived this bin
test let's open up the next bit Robin
and analyze this build quality the
problem with the Nexus 6p was that there
was plastic integrated into a metal with
very weak dovetail joints the problem
seems to be with the next bit Robin that
there is no metal at all inside of the
phone the entire thing is pure plastic
even the motherboard is screwed into the
plastic I imagine this cut down on
manufacturing costs by an astronomical
amount but it does leave the phone very
weak plastic is nothing compared to
metal miner bins won't matter very much
plastic is relatively flexible and
resilient but make sure to keep your
phone out of any extreme situations
because this phone is not likely to
survive don't get me wrong this does not
mean it's a bad phone at all there are
many variables to pick from when buying
a phone durability is just one just make
sure you don't put it in your back
pocket especially if you're American I
have ordered the oneplus 3 that will be
here very soon make sure your subscribe
so your first to know if the build
quality of that phone is as good as the
other one plus phones I've tested now if
you'll excuse me I have some glass to
clean up I'll just put the Robin on my
shelf of shame next to my Nexus 6p the
me 5 and the HTC m9 behind the scenes
can always be found on my Twitter and
Instagram thanks ton for watching hope
to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
