iPhone 7 whether you are team Android or
team iPhone anyone can appreciate a
well-built phone and that's what we're
here to find out again this matte black
iPhone 7 survived my durability tests
I've tested over 38 phones so far
including the previous iPhones so let's
see how this newcomer does let's start
with the scratch test I have a set of
mineral pics that tell me where the
hardness of the glass falls on Mohs
scale of hardness sapphire glass would
be around an 8 or a 9 on Moute scale or
plastic screens like the galaxy s7
active would scratch a level-3 normally
the average smartphone will start
scratching at a level 6 and this appears
to be the case with this new iPhone 7 it
is on par with the typical smartphone
screen hardness coins and keys won't
scratch it but you should keep it
protected anyway there are still plenty
of abrasive materials in the environment
hiding in the pockets of your jeans or
purse that can cause scratches to the
screen of your phone let's jump down to
the home button or better said the home
touchpad now since it doesn't click
anymore there have been rumors that the
home button and the camera lens are made
of sapphire which would make them
extremely scratch resistant nearing the
point of diamonds which would be nice
some smart phones like the galaxy phones
use a plastic home button that can
scratch easily but so far this touchpad
can resist the scratching from my razor
blade but is it sapphire or is it just
normal glass the easiest way to find out
is using the hardness picks like I
mentioned before glass will scratch at a
five or six but Sapphire should be
around an eight or nine and since this
button has a deep scratch with the level
six pick we know for sure that is
regular glass and not sapphire the
earpiece is made of metal and very
solidly stuck in place it won't be
sliding around or falling out like the
old iPhone 4s did now with the back
aluminium I will be scratching a jet
black version very soon but so far this
matte black version holds up extremely
well to my keys you can hardly tell that
it's been scratched razor blades on the
other hand will scratch the phone just
fine
and this is why I always keep my razor
blades in a separate purse you should
too unless you want one of these $800
aluminum curlicues now for the camera
lens this glass piece is protecting the
new 12 megapixel camera inside of the
phone and is definitely scratch
resistant which is awesome my razor
blade does nothing to it
but is it's a fire it still scratches
deeply at a level 6 so it doesn't look
like anything on this phone as sapphire
sapphire does have its pros and cons but
I'll save that for another video next to
the camera lens we have what Apple is
calling the quad LED true tone flash
initially I thought that this might be
four different colored LEDs bringing
even more life to pictures than just a
dual colored flash would but while
indeed there are four LEDs it is still
just the same normal to colors that the
older iPhone 6 has the flash is just
brighter now because there are more of
the LEDs which is good checking out the
build quality of the rest of the phone
we find out that the buttons are metal
which is ideal plastic buttons tend to
discolor or pop out more often than
metal buttons do so thumbs up to Apple
for sticking with quality materials the
antenna bands are still plastic but
that's a necessity with apple's design
at this point in time if you remove
these antenna bands no more cellular
connection if we look down here we see
where the headphone jack doesn't exist
now this is a problem on multiple levels
I'll go more in-depth about this in my
next video but looking at it from purely
a durability perspective this is an
extremely bad move just like any piece
of electronics the charging port
component has a finite lifespan nothing
lasts forever it is designed to
withstand a certain amount of physical
wear and tear this means it could stand
5,000 or 10,000 plugs and unplugs nobody
knows the exact number but Apple but
essentially now that Apple is combining
the headphone jack and the charging port
into one we have two accessories using
the same single port doubling the rate
of wear and tear so once this singular
lightning port dies or reaches the end
of its lifespan your phone is toast
there's no backup wireless charging
either so if you are person who's ever
had their charging port stop working on
a previous phone you can sit back and
watch your iPhone 7 port die in half the
time unless you fork over the dough for
some wireless headphones which is what
Apple wants you
anyway I plan on making a video more in
depth about the headphone jack in a few
days it'll be revealing so subscribe and
turn on your notifications for that what
do you think is it good that Apple
killed the headphone jack let me know
down in the comments on to the burn test
the IPS LCD of the iPhone 7 lasted
almost 10 seconds under direct contact
with flame before the pixels got hot and
turned off going completely black it is
interesting to see what screens recover
and which ones don't
Samsung AMOLED screens currently turn
white and do not recover from flame the
iPhone however completely recovered and
functions as normal it is cool to the
touch within seconds now the bin tests
the iPhone 6 had a nifty little trick
that would permanently match the phone
to the curve of your body if you ever
sat on it the iPhone 7 does not appear
to be as flexible it is interesting to
watch the waterproofing adhesive between
the frame of the phone and the screen
you can watch it tear as I heavily flex
the phone so while this phone will not
suffer from bin gate or catastrophic
failure I would still not sit on it just
to keep that water resistance intact
once that adhesive is torn it will not
be as resistant as it once was
overall Apple has made another solid
phone I appreciate the build quality I
still have plenty more to say about that
headphone jack but that'll come in
another video all my behind the scenes
stuff can be found on Instagram and
Twitter and there's a very good chance
I'll start an iPhone 7 giveaway on my
Twitter in the next week or so so follow
me there if you're interested in that
kind of thing and if you aren't
subscribed yet but love technology hit
that subscribe button I review tech from
the inside thanks for watching
help see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
