down their brand-new LG and v30
the camera hardware in this thing could
quite possibly be the best in the world
at the moment before I take a look at
the inside let's see what the footage
looks like from the outside
the coolest thing about this phone in my
opinion is the camera the hardware
underneath the little glass lens is
pretty amazing and I'll explain why but
first we have to get to it this
pre-production version of the LGV 30 is
a super sleek looking phone it has the
metal body bezel is OLED display and the
full curved Gorilla Glass 5 on the front
and the back one cool thing with the
curve though is that the glass is curved
but not so much the display I find when
using my curved the Galaxy s8 without a
case the palm of my hand causes phantom
touches to the screen since it wraps
around the edge of the phone but the LG
v30 screen is all on the front not
wrapping around the edge so hopefully we
won't have that same phantom touch issue
getting inside the phone is pretty
straightforward the LG v 30 is ip68
water-resistant one step above the ip67
water-resistant rating of the iPhone 7 I
always enjoy pointing that out
heat is our best friend during the glass
removal warming up the phone and tells
just barely too hot to touch and then
using a large suction cup to lift up and
decrease the tension on the surface of
the glass so I can slip my thin metal
pry tool between the edge of the glass
and the metal frame of the phone slicing
through the adhesive all the way around
the underside of that glass layer this
adhesive is the type that hardens again
when it's cooled down so about every 30
or 40 seconds I'll warm it back up with
my heat gun and keep on cutting it is
glass so I'm being super careful not to
flex it too much or cut too deep inside
because once the glass gets pulled off
there are fragile ribbon cables
underneath namely the wireless charging
and the cable that goes to the
fingerprint scanner slash power button
which is conveniently located in the
center of the back panel instead of up
right next to the camera lens these
little golden circles next to the power
button just rest up against the
motherboard to do all the communicating
from here we can see the inside of the
exterior camera lens this is actually
made from Gorilla Glass 4 which lowers
is potential for being scratched or
damaged compared to just regular glass
so that's good our goal here though is
to see the guts of the camera unit so
let's go deeper inside the phone there
are seven non-proprietary Phillips head
screws on the top half of the phone Glad
LG doesn't try to complicate things
then there are three more screws that
hold down the loudspeaker to the bottom
of the phone near the charging port I'll
lift off the wireless charging it's got
those same golden contact
as for the power transfer that we saw
with the power button with a lot of
restaurants and vehicles adding more
wireless charging stations lately I'm
glad that LG has included it in their
design bones with useful features are
the best kinds of phones I'll disconnect
the battery and then reach down and pull
up the loudspeaker this little guy has
the same water-resistant screen that we
saw with the recent iPhones and the
water-resistant Samsung phone there are
a few more ribbon cables keeping us from
accessing that camera I'll just start on
snapping those like little Legos the
front-facing selfie cameras up there at
the top and the regular camera wraps
around through the backside of the
motherboard then down here at the bottom
we have the screen ribbon cable and the
charging port ribbon the motherboard
will come away from the phone body at
this point if you remember to remove the
SIM card tray I left mine in place as an
example for what not to do of course now
the SIM and expandable memory tray are
out of the phone I can finally lift away
the motherboard from the aluminum mid
frame and look at all these golden
contact pads this is a repair guys dream
a totally modular phone less plugs and
connections mean a more simple and
modular design to work with I'm
definitely a fan of that we have a
headphone jack up in the top left corner
that deserves a thumbs up all by itself
then the circular vibration motors right
below that with his golden contact pads
and then we have the earpiece and one
small microphone up here at the top one
super cool thing about this phone is
that the earpiece turns into a receiver
or a microphone during loud events like
at a concert I'll explain more about
this after we find the third microphone
in just a second and then here's the
front-facing camera that's also at the
top of the phone right below that we
have the golden contact pads for the
volume buttons also embedded in this
solid slab of milled aluminum is the
copper heat pipe we took a thermal
imaging camera to the heat pipe inside
the LG G 6 and it actually does a pretty
good job of wicking away heat from the
processor and finally we get our first
look at the two rear cameras on the back
of the phone the standard camera is 16
megapixels and the wide-angle camera is
13 megapixels both held in place by
separate ribbon cables the wide-angle
camera is pretty cool all by itself but
the standard camera could very well have
the best cell phone camera hardware on
the market right now I'll show you why
as we tear it down first of all it does
have oh is that optical image
stabilization that not every camera has
it also has electronic image
stabilization to keep photos and videos
extra crisp there is no optical
stabilization on the wide-angle camera
lens but that's a different ballgame
anyway
popping off the metal how
for the camera reveals my favorite part
the ten bit image sensor this means that
the LGV 30 can capture over 1 billion
colors and the special cine video mode
can output videos with up to two hundred
and eleven percent more colors and you
can with the average smartphone these
colors help improve contrast and
definition of the image I'm a camera guy
I use my cell phone camera quite a bit
so I'm pretty excited about this big
step up in extra camera power most
computer screens these days can even
display 10 bits of color yet so this
camera is really leading the futuristic
curve but even if your computer monitor
only displays eight bits of color all
the different shading that 10 bits can
pick up will still enhance the dynamic
range on your 8-bit monitor so it's
still a good thing either way in order
to fully utilize this 10 bit sensor
though we need light and the more light
we have the better the sensor can
capture an image to help facilitate the
light entering onto this sensor there is
an F 1.6 aperture camera lens inside
this plastic housing also a world's
first on a cell phone
due to the shape of the lens there's
more light hitting the sensor on the LG
v 30 than any other cell phone on the
market the hardware is pretty intriguing
and judging by my initial helicopter
ride the software looks like it's
keeping up so far it was around this
point that I realized I was not going to
be able to put this back together in one
piece since I am at LG though I hope
they have a backup replacement around
here somewhere
now that I'm finally through the plastic
look at all these different lenses
inside the housing it's pretty
incredible how much development goes
into such a small component LG has used
glass instead of plastic for the main
lens inside this module using glass
instead of plastic improves image
clarity and starts bridging the gap
between DSLR and smartphone cameras
before coming out to New York to see
this phone I chopped open a real canon
DSLR camera lens so I can see if the
lenses were even remotely similar when
placed side-by-side and while the Canon
lens is significantly larger both camera
lenses have the same basic construction
with all the different glass layers
inside stacked on top of each other
pretty impressive after looking around I
did find a replacement camera lens that
fits inside the LG v 30 hopefully nobody
notices what I did to the first one down
at the bottom of the phone we have
pretty much the cutest little charging
port that I've ever seen there are two
screws holding down the USBC port which
is also connected to the third
microphone inside this phone what
about that earpiece mic again real quick
so let's say that you're one of those
people at a concert with your phone up
in the air instead of your tiny little
microphones recording the loud audio the
LGV 30 earpiece turns into a microphone
with anything above 120 decibels like a
rock concert which means you actually
get decent audio recording because the
diaphragm of the earpiece is so much
larger than those tiny little microphone
it's a pretty sweet little trick plus
the integrated quad deck allows quality
playback of the audio you just recorded
that's pretty cool all by itself the
charging port has a huge thick orange
rubber ring around the tip to help keep
liquid out the non-removable 3300
milliamp hour battery is next on my
removal list there are no magic pull
tabs below this battery but the adhesive
is not destructive like we saw on the
BlackBerry key one with a little bit of
force the battery pops up and out on its
own still no dogs allowed though you
might have noticed the extremely small
bezels on the six inch OLED screen of
the LGV 30 this was mastered in part by
having the display driver IC flip around
under the display and wrap up inside the
phone you can kind of see it from this
angle here removing the display from the
metal mid frame would destroy it and I
can only assume that LG wants their
phone back in one piece
I only attempt screen replacements if
the display is already totaled speaking
of getting the phone back in one piece
cross your fingers that it turns back on
after I reassemble it the cute little
charging port and bottom microphone go
back into the frame making sure that the
rubber ring is still surrounding the
port to help keep the water out every
bit of water resistance helps I'll make
sure the screen ribbon is folded down
and out of the way before dropping the
battery back in place there's still
plenty of sticky adhesive on the frame
so I'm just gonna reuse it the
motherboard gets tucked back into the
phone making sure none of the ribbon
cables are caught underneath it and
after plugging in the screen ribbon and
the charging port ribbon I can set the
loudspeaker back on top of the
motherboard and get those three Phillips
head screws back in place and the last
thing to plug in is the battery the
wireless charging can go on top of the
motherboard it has little black plastic
clasps that fit into the metal frame and
then of course the additional seven
Phillips head screws to hold it all down
tight and finally the aesthetically
pleasing glass back panel gets
reappeared over all the components I'll
definitely be doing my durability test
as soon as I get my hands on a retail
version of this phone and it looks like
a clear back panel is also a real
possibility it'll be engineering my
durability test if it's anything like
the LG G 6 though it'll probably do just
fine I'm pretty impressed with this
phone if the software
is the hardware this might be the first
time LG gets me to switch over from
Samsung
thanks again LG for letting me review
your phone from the inside the camera
hardware is pretty impressive come hang
out with me on Twitter and Instagram and
I'll keep you updated when I get the
retail version of the lg v34 my
durability test thanks for watching and
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
