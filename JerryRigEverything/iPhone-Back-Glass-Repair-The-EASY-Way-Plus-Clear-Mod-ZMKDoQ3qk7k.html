not attempting this project in any way
shape or form Apple has made this repair
impossible on purpose I did find a few
methods that work for removing the back
glass on an iPhone 8 and an A+ but the
risks involved are extraordinary and
your phone might very well end up
looking worse after the repair than it
did before you start it now that we have
that out of the way I am going to
attempt this repair while leaving all
the guts of the phone intact so let's
get started
there are a few videos online of people
using extreme heat to remove the broken
glass on their iPhones the heat is so
extreme I figured it might be safer to
move to the other end of the thermometer
and see how cold we can get the adhesive
before it gets brittle and loses its
effectiveness so it will break off with
the glass putting your phone in a
conventional freezer for a few hours
will not work since a standard freezer
is about zero degrees Fahrenheit or
negative 18 degrees Celsius and the
epoxy holding the glass to the metal
inside of the iPhone is still effective
at that temperature if you are
considering doing this yourself first of
all you're crazy and second make sure
you watch this video all the way through
I explain a lot my first attempt is with
the refrigerant I got off of Amazon it
brings the temperature down to about
negative 60 degrees Fahrenheit
tetrafluoroethylene
is the chemical used inside of this
spray and it can displace oxygen meaning
that if you use it in an area that's not
well ventilated you might suffocate and
die so try to avoid that part the can
was inexpensive and seems to be working
for the most part you can see the frost
start to accumulate over top of the
glass as the temperature drops the lower
the temperature the less holding ability
the adhesive has under the glass
remember right now we're working at
about negative 60 degrees Fahrenheit
safety glasses are pretty mandatory
since glass is basically going
everywhere so that negative 60 is
working but it's still taking longer
than I would like after about 10 minutes
I've only cleared 20% of the glass hit
that subscribe button if you haven't
already and let's take this repair to
the next level with a safely liquid
that's much much colder liquid nitrogen
is involved in our next attempt at
removing the glass in the back of an
iPhone but don't freak out because it's
actually not that hard to get a hold of
luckily I'm pretty good friends with the
king of random over here and he has a
good supply but grant tell us where
people can get liquid nitrogen on their
own if they need some if you guys want
to get some liquid nitrogen it's
actually super easy to get it would be a
lot closer than you think if you get on
Google or yellow pages if everybody uses
that anymore look for a welding and gas
supply company they're probably gonna
have some the only qualifier is you're
gonna need some safe way to transport so
you're gonna need something like a Dewar
it's about dwar
Durer it's basically a glorified
insulated thermos made for liquid
nitrogen so if you have one of those no
permits are required and it costs you
about $5 per litre if you go in there
with something like a thermos you can
pick up one of these for maybe 10 or 20
bucks my first one was $5 at Walmart
depending on the person you talk to they
may let you take some liquid nitrogen
there's no guarantee this is gonna work
but huge thanks the king of random for
attempting this experiment with me let's
see what happens all right so now the
phone is able to sit inside of the
liquid nitrogen and hopefully it gets to
temperature we want that back panel and
the metal to be about the same and I can
hear the 18 heard crafty man even hear
the glass cracking hopefully that's the
epoxy or the adhesive underneath the
glass in the middle alright just getting
it back to temperature again keep in
mind that there is clear adhesive on the
front of the phone holding the front
glass to the LCD which is also affected
by liquid nitrogen I'm making sure to
only allow the back of the phone to dip
into the liquid so the screen doesn't
get destroyed as the liquid nitrogen
evaporates into just regular nitrogen
it's a dielectric gas meaning it won't
affect the electronic internals of the
phone the extreme cold on the other hand
might liquid nitrogen is negative 321
degrees Fahrenheit so keeping the liquid
off of the internal circuits as much as
possible is important there are specific
cryogenic machines that circulate liquid
nitrogen under a metal plate made
specifically for cell phone repair so if
you have a repair shop and are doing
this on a regular basis you might want
to invest in one of those it's a little
more controllable than the pure liquid
it took about seven minutes to remove
all the glass from the iPhone using this
liquid nitrogen much quicker than the
tetrafluoroethylene the camera lens
frame is welded to the metal frame of
the iPhone and it might be possible to
preserve this but since my lens was
already cracked from a previous drop
test I'll just crush out the lens with
my pliers replacement lenses are pretty
inexpensive on Amazon I am removing the
camera lens last because glass dust can
get
inside the optical image stabilization
mechanism and cause the focus to stop
working like I mentioned before if there
is quite a bit that can go wrong during
this operation
luckily the phone still works and turns
on thumbs up for that the lithium
battery does need to get back to room
temperature before will behave like
normal so we were successful in removing
the back glass panel what do you think
about that I think it looks crazy you
know I almost feel like you should just
take some epoxy and make see-through
epoxy just keep the phone that way cuz
that's a pretty intense look I'm
actually really surprised that turn back
on
I mean liquid nitrogen I wasn't sorry
about I was just worried about the
condition of this phone flow in a way
that it's working so what do you think
with the liquid nitrogen inside of the
phone are we more worried about the
contacts like the solder points or the
battery being disrupted by the liquid
nitrogen
what's the weakest point inside with
cold temperatures I honestly think
contraction is probably gonna be the
weakest point because liquid nitrogen
itself isn't gonna damage anything it's
not going to affect chemically anything
inside the phone all its gonna do is
contract it's gonna freeze things to the
point where they can track so if there's
anything in here that's breakable like
maybe solder points if those get too
cold they could snap but it wouldn't be
because of a chemical reaction at all so
I love playing with liquid nitrogen for
that reason it's very non-toxic itself
so very non corrosive it doesn't do any
damage it's it's like using pure alcohol
in this thing once it's gone it's gone
well if you have not seen it grant
Thompson has been able to make liquid
nitrogen in his basement I will link
that video here now let's see what
happens when we take it to the opposite
end of the temperature spectrum and use
heat to try to remove the back glass
panel this time I'll be working on a
cracked iPhone 8 plus Apple's out of
warranty repair for this piece of glass
is currently uninit
as its effectiveness as the temperature
drops past negative 100 now let's see
what temperature the iPhone epoxy starts
to liquefy at the other end of the
temperature spectrum using heat once
again while iPhones might survive the
extreme temperatures during the short
repair there is still plenty that can go
wrong so I don't recommend doing any of
this to your phone it's much safer just
to put your phone in a case or slap a
skin on it to hide the cracks and just
pretend you never dropped it and if
you're mad that I phones aren't
repairable but with
wallet and get something else one thing
I did wrong with this phone as I pulled
off the camera lens too early exposing
the fragile plastic sensors to feed and
glass dust early on if I ever do this
again the camera lens should come off
last I found this sweet spot to liquify
the adhesive around 350 degrees
Fahrenheit just hot enough to melt your
fingers off and start your house on fire
when Steve Jobs and Apple were designing
the first iPhone they specifically
sealed it shut because these jobs didn't
want people fiddling around inside their
phones not even to change the battery so
this new unrepairable glass design is
right on par with what Steve would have
wanted if you were still here I learned
a lot about Steve Jobs from his
biography on audible which I'll link
down in the video description if you're
into that kind of thing the guy might
have been a bit crazy and not so nice to
people who want to fix their expensive
electronics but his life story is very
interesting audible will let you
download his book for free with a 30-day
trial just go to audible.com slash
jerry-rigged or text the word
jerry-rigged to 500 500 even if you
cancel your trial you get to keep the
book it's a win-win I normally listen
while I'm at the gym or running outside
during the summer months
if you remember it took me about seven
minutes to clear the glass off the back
of the iPhone 8 using liquid nitrogen
but as of now it's been about 25 minutes
since I started using the heat gun a
common hair dryer which I don't own
would not be near hot enough for this
project you need a heat gun I do feel
like the liquid nitrogen was a bit
easier it's been hard to keep the phone
heated to that blistering 350 degrees it
takes to liquify the adhesive under that
glass layer as soon as the temperature
drops below 300 the adhesive solidifies
again after getting all the glass off
and letting the funcle' down to room
temperature I turned it on and
everything is still working lucky for us
you can see both phones here side by
side now let's get the replacement
panels back on the phones
fun fact Apple does not sell replacement
parts for their phones to the general
public anyway so every glass piece you
buy is an illegal copy it's not illegal
to sell replacement parts for cell
phones just replacement parts with the
Apple logo on them since that parts
trademark I'll still link some of them
in the video description though Apple
does sue these counterfeit sellers into
oblivion every now
so let me know if the nickels at stock
lucky for us it's kind of like
whack-a-mole
and another counterfeit seller usually
takes their place pretty quickly I would
rather buy replacement parts from Apple
directly but since they don't allow that
here we are I got rid of the white color
on my panel and the Apple logo since
clear phones are kind of what I do and I
can also add on the replacement camera
lens at this point with some flexible
clear B 7000 adhesive then I can read
here the whole thing down to the phone
body with double-sided tape
it's obviously not water-resistant
anymore but that waterproofing was lost
when the back was cracked either way I
think it looks sweet you can't see the
electronics like inside of a Samsung or
LG but it's unique a lot of the
replacement backs will come with their
own adhesive already installed it just
depends on which supplier you're buying
from you can see how difficult it is to
remove the camera lens with all the
little welding points along these inner
rings but I was able to salvage this one
off of the eight plus even if my camera
unit did get melted into oblivion
the camera units are cheap and I'll
replace that from the inside of the
phone on a different day it's my fault
for not leaving the camera lens and
placed longer for protection not too
shabby a few scuffs along the aluminum
side from the aggressive glass removal
but the back glass panel is now crack
free what'd I ever do this again
probably not but at least now we know
that the back glass panel on phones is
replaceable with extreme heat or cold
and plenty of blood sweat and tears one
of the questions you might have is does
the wireless charging still work and yes
it does work on both phones here in my
truck we can see the yellow light come
on when the wireless charger starts
interacting with the phones and the
battery charging indicator pops up as
well if you remember from the beginning
of this video I have one more cracked
iPhone 10 which might be fun to try with
dry eyes it's about half as cold as
liquid nitrogen but a little bit easier
to obtain thanks for making it this far
in the video I hope your phone has a
long crack free life and don't forget to
