on a walk one of the Hawaiian Islands
today I'm going to show you how to make
an awesome little time-lapse rig so you
can show off some epic footage on your
next vacation so here's a little rig
itself all it is is a little egg timer
just twist that thing and as your GoPro
is taking pictures the egg timer is
going to spin it slowly around so you
can get some awesome 360-degree footage
so let's say you just want a 90 degree
time-lapse where it just takes 90
degrees out of your horizon you just
want to let it go for 15 minutes because
that would be those 90 degrees out of
the 360 that the egg timer is capable of
and what's nice with the GoPro app is
that you can actually connect the GoPro
to your phone and just turn it with your
hand generally to see what the finished
footage is going to look like before you
get it started I just took one of my
extra little GoPro mounts with the
sticky stuff on the bottom and then
stuck it right to the egg timer you can
pick those up in pretty much any grocery
store but I'm also going to link them
down in the video description below so
you can get them for cheap on Amazon
also the GoPro mounts themselves are
pretty inexpensive as well so I'm going
to link those and the video description
as well so take a look at those thanks a
ton for watching check out some of this
footage that I recorded for you and
don't forget to like if this video
helped you and don't forget to subscribe
thanks a ton for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
