of installing a light bar on your
empresa WRX I will link this particular
light bar and all the tools you need in
the video description below so check
that out
let's get started so installing the
lights pretty straightforward it comes
with some mounting hardware that just
bolts into the side of the lamp and then
we have a screw going through the
plastic of the bumper and then I also
put a metal plate on the other side of
the bumper that the bolt goes through so
that's not ever going to pull through
the bumper on the backside and the
lights light or not that it's not going
to cause the bumper to sag or anything
which is nice on the other side of this
nut is a nother washer and a locking
washer and then a wing nut on the top
and that's what keeps the light on both
sides attached to this bumper and it's
pretty secure
so the wiring harness is actually pretty
simple we're going to start with this
end right here that connects to the
battery we have the red cable that goes
to the positive terminal of the battery
the black cable that goes to the
negative terminal and this is the relay
this will just bolt next to the battery
on any bolt that you can find and this
is where the fuse is you want to take
out the fuse while you're working and
installing all the lights and stuff so
that the fuse doesn't trip itself on
accident you can just flip up that
little latch and the fuse comes out now
the rest of the wiring harness it kind
of splits off into a Y and goes to
directions we're going to start with the
black side first this particular wiring
harness can be used for two LED lights
so you have a black and a red here which
connects to one LED light and a black
and red there that connect to another
LED light but since we're only
installing one light we're only going to
use one connection and then we'll just
electrical tape the other one to keep it
keep water off of it now the other side
of the wiring harness which is this
white cable goes towards a switch
so it can disconnect here which makes it
easier when we go through the firewall
and I'll show you that in a second and
then we have the switch itself and the
switch is what goes through the firewall
inside of the car and that will turn the
LED light on and off these other cables
that connect to the switch as well this
one is just going to screw on to any old
bolt underneath the hood and this is a
ground and then the red cable does need
to go to the positive terminal of the
battery so I did a test wire really
quick I took the red from the switch and
plugged into the red terminal the
battery and the red from the you know
right next to the relay put the black
from the relay on the negative right
there and then from the switch side just
because we're testing it out and I've
put it through the firewall yet I took
the negative and just grounded it on any
old bolt and I mean the switch right
here you can see that the LEDs light up
was showing us which is getting power
and then I can press it and we got the
LED light that turns on and off so the
light is connected and I'm shining it
over at our neighbor's house and it
lights up the entire building all the
way to the top of the roof it's pretty
intense so I'm going to talk about the
wiring for just a second so remember the
center part of the harness with the
relay and the two connections for the
battery so this is here and then it wise
off and we have the switch wires that
are just wrapped up around the edge of
the car and then there's a hole right
back in here so the metal panel between
your engine compartment and the cab of
your car is called a firewall and
there's always a hole somewhere in your
firewall where wires can go through so
there's a little rubber piece right here
that we just kind of push down and then
fed the wires through it and sometimes
you know they're on the other side by
the driver's side or the steering wheel
in this case is on the passenger side so
we put the switch wires through there
and then we're just going to ground it
off of the one of these same silver
bolts that I did before going back to
the battery the second part of the Y is
over here so we have one connection for
an LED light bar here because this is a
dual harness fed the wires here next the
radiator
and then we're going to take these wires
and drop them down and connect them to
the LED light bar itself and it's wires
are going up there as well through the
grille these are the connections on the
wiring harness that are supposed to clip
into the light bar wires and so I bought
these right here and they attach to them
to the light bar wires so if you can see
them down they're coming up through the
front bumper of the car
they'll just plug into these and the
light bar will be connected to the
wiring harness now the switch right here
since it is coming from the passenger
side of the firewall we just routed it
underneath the dashboard behind it and
then underneath this plastic part right
here and now every time we can just
press the button while sitting in the
driver seat so it's easily accessible so
we're gonna test the bar right now so
this is this the regular headlights that
are on on the car and then this is with
the LED light bar on you can see how it
lights up the trees in the background
and then turn on your brights really
quick and that is what the brights on
and then turn the LED off
and those are the different lights
