8 a smooth looking phone that is quite a
bit bigger than my s7 edge and even
Dwarfs my note 5 by this point you
probably know what I do with brand new
cell phones so let's get started scratch
test first this phone does come with a
pre-installed plastic screen protector
so I'll remove that exposing the Gorilla
Glass 4 I have a set of picks with
different materials on the tips that let
me know where the screen falls on Mohs
scale of hardness most smartphone
screens sit around a level 6 this test
will reveal any outliers like the droid
turbo 2 s shatterproof plastic screen
like anticipated the screen did start to
scratch at level 6 and had a much deeper
groove with the level 7 pick even when
the screen is on the scratches are still
visible it'll be interesting when a
phone comes out that can make it past
level 6 the camera lens is also made of
glass which is great it is not plastic
like the Sony z5 premium or the
BlackBerry Prive the rear button does
scratch but the scratching shouldn't
affect the fingerprint scanner ability
the back of this phone is aluminum so it
does scratch when you take a razor to it
but it is pure metal there is no paint
or primer or any other material covering
the surface your hands are touching good
old clean metal there are plastic tabs
at the top and the bottom these might be
covering screw holes or antennas we'll
have to find out when I do my teardown
video the sides of the phone are much
thicker aluminum as you can see here the
phone feels very solid and very heavy
which is fine with me the more heavy and
solid something feels the more durable
it tends to be the main eight is using
something called an IPS neo LCD screen
the neo part means there is no quality
loss when you are viewing the screen at
an angle so let's see if this actually
does anything so here's the LG g5 which
has a regular non neo IPS display I have
both phones brightness turned up all the
way and I'll tilt them at the same angle
to see when we lose visibility on either
screen the LG g5 screen dims as the
angle changes but the mate 8 does not
the viewing angle is considerably larger
with the mate 8 usually these terms like
neo are just marketing shenanigans but
in this case I think the Neo feature is
actually pretty cool
well let's burn it the may date took
about five seconds for the pixels to
heat up and turn off still better than
the LG g5 s three seconds but the iPhone
se sits on the top of the scale with an
impressive 16 seconds of flame
resistance because I know that's the
first thing people look for when
purchasing a smartphone just for kicks
and giggles I burn the back of the
aluminum as well for about 15 seconds
aluminum does not retain heat well so it
was cool to the touch within a second
onto the bin test I did this test
previously on wallet phone the honor 5x
and the 5x passed just fine with only a
kink near the power button that I had to
bend back into place let's see what
happens with the May date when I push
from the screen side of the phone you
can see the aluminum frame buckle near
the power button just a bit just like
with the honor 5x but the phone does not
break let's flip it around and try it
from the other side pushing from the
rear you can see some impressive flex
but the phone locks out and will not
bend any farther
there is no catastrophic breakage or
dovetail joints like with the Huawei
Nexus 6p and this phone is actually
bigger than the 6p the screen can be
popped back into the back housing and
the housing been straight again good job
on this one Wow way if Jerry had a stamp
of approval this phone would get it my
Twitter followers knew the outcome of
this test before I post the video so if
you want to stay ahead of the curve come
follow me at Zach's jerry-rigged I am
also giving away an iPhone SC to one
lucky retweet er of this tweet so go
find it in my recent tweets thanks a ton
for watching I hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
