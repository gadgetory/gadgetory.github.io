car chargers at the end of this video so
stick around for those details about a
week ago I made a video showing how this
car charger easily breaks windows it's
pretty incredible it's got a
spring-loaded spike inside and when it
gets pressed up against the glass the
spike gets violently projected into the
glass window and it shatters in the
comment section of that video a ton of
you requested that I try this out on a
cell phone
luckily I do have an extra phone here
it's an iPhone 6 plus and it needs to
screen replaced on it anyway you can see
it has some minor dings and scratches on
the edge already so we can use this
device as our test dummy
now this dual USB quick car charger
might look innocent but that metal spike
is seriously vicious I accidentally on
purpose push my thumb up against the
spike about 12 days ago and I still have
the mark from where it hit me so make
sure you don't do that if you buy one of
these for yourself all right so it's
time for the moment of truth I can take
the car charger and press it up against
the glass like this but the spike is not
going to come out of it until the very
end right after it clicks so watch
closely and well that's pretty much what
I expected it is pretty cool to see the
difference between the tempered glass on
this cellphone and the safety glass that
was inside the car window if you were to
get in a wreck and all you had was
tempered glass on the side windows these
jagged bits of glass would be going
everywhere inside of your car but since
most car windows these days have that
safety glass installed it shatters in
little tiny blocks and comes out and one
big laminated chunk technology is pretty
sweet although you might want to check
and make sure that your car has safety
glass on all of its windows so that was
pretty cool and I think this accessory
or this car charger is something that
everyone needs inside of their car
luckily stylist the maker of this car
charger sent me five of these to give
away to you guys my subscribers so
there's a gleam link in the video
description I'm sure most of you
familiar with that by now the last one I
did with the honor eight phone giveaway
went pretty smoothly so I'm going to use
that again for this giveaway I'm going
to be choosing one winner every day for
the next five days over on my Twitter
you can enter by following me on
Twitter or Instagram or YouTube each one
of those will give you another entry
into the contest and I'll have more
written in the gleam link when you click
on that I will be announcing the winners
on Twitter so it is essential that you
are following me there that's very very
important and as always this contest is
100% random so if your goldfish died

chances of winning thanks for watching
