that just might save your life this
could be the most important video that
I've made all year every single year
disasters happen all around the globe
tsunamis wars fires tornadoes anything
could happen
whether you're ready or not there's
always a chance he might be involved in
a natural disaster the first three days
or 72 hours are the most important after
disaster occurs because that's how long
it takes for help to arrive during those
two or three days while you're waiting
for help to arrive it's good to have
something called a 72-hour kit or a
bug-out bag full of necessities and food
and water you can put whatever you want
your 72-hour kit like a first-aid kit
flashlights are pretty important it
might be nice to have a little bit of
rope something to start a fire with
the single most important thing you can
have in your 72-hour kit is three days
worth of pure clean water if you haven't
guessed yet I'm building more than one
72-hour kit and I'll tell you why in
just one second but if you ever find
yourself in a disaster situation with a
little bit of forewarning like you would
at the flood or a hurricane make sure
you fill your bathtub up with water and
put a stopper in it that way you have
enough fresh pure clean water for a
couple days
got to get some of the other necessities
the second most important thing you need
after water is food now these things
don't taste very good but they're small
have a lot of calories and a super long
shelf life you can find these at a lot
of grocery stores and sporting goods
stores but I'll try to link some down in
the video description as well keep in
mind that if you're going to build a
72-hour kit you really don't have to buy
anything you can get food and water and
just stick it in a backpack just make
sure it's enough for three days so to
recap we have fire light first-aid high
genex rope trail mix which is actually
super high calories and doesn't take up
a lot of space I think each one of these
bags has about 3500 calories in it we
have knives we have a rain poncho these
are actually really cheap we have some
more food remember these don't take up a
lot of space but they're super high
calories and most importantly we have
water and last but not least it helps if
you have a waterproof bag to put
everything inside if you don't have a
waterproof bag you can always use a
trash bag something cheap remember you
don't have to spend a lot of money on
this the most important thing is is that
you have one you don't have to put the
same things that I put in my kit in your
own kit you can personalize it by adding
clothes medication you can also put
identification in there the most
important thing is is that you have
enough food and water for three days or
more days if you have enough money and
space to store it more is better that
way whether it's a regular apocalypse or
a zombie apocalypse you're going to be
prepared christmas is coming soon here
in the United States and in the spirit
of Christmas I'll be donating these kits
here locally to people who need them
it's one of the small ways that I can
light the world or make the world a
better place it doesn't matter if you
celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah or any
other holidays or even if you hate
holidays these are something good to
have and it's also something good to
give especially because it might save a
life if you end up making one of these
for yourself or giving it as a gift to a
friend or family member take a picture
and tag me on Instagram or Twitter or
Facebook with the hashtag light the
world so I can see what you made and
together we can make the world a better
place by being prepared thanks ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
