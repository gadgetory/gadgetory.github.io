a few hundred bucks by doing a Galaxy s4
screen replacement yourself remember if
you do this right it'll be a ten dollar
repair if you do this wrong it will end
up being a lot more so proceed at your
own risk
check the links in the video description
below for the current prices on
replacement parts I've already taken
apart this foam that's not causing a
heat damage to the mainboard and
charging port you can go ahead and click
the link in the upper corner to see how
I did that I also taped down the cables
so that they won't be kinked or twisted
in any way because if those cables are
kinked or twisted it'll end up having a
black screen that is unrepairable
that'll be a more expensive repair
anyway you want to gently heat up the
phone it will take about four or five
minutes if you heat up in one place too
long there'll be a burn mark in the
middle of the screen I use this handy
laser heat sensor thing to tell me how
hot the phone is I will put a link in
the video description below for this as
well it's relatively cheap now I'm
taking a razor blade and gently putting
it between the glass screen and the
frame of the phone itself the adhesive
up at the top is a little bit different
than the adhesive that is covering the
LCD so I'm using my knife to separate
the top so I can slip my wire down
inside I'm being really careful because
right here on this corner there are two
ribbon cables that are in charge of the
LCD and digitizer if you rip those
cables you're toast and you have to buy
the more expensive replacement part here
is the wire that I'm going to be using
it's a special wire that's used for
high-temperature applications like this
I'm just going to take it wrap it around
my fingers and then slide it in that top
part where I've already separated the
glass from the phone itself now the goal
here is to work it over the earpiece on
the phone and then slide it down the
rest of the way you can see that it's
getting harder for me to cut that
because in the sixty seconds that I have
not been eating up the phone its cooled
down to the point that the glue is not
liquid anymore so I'm going to go ahead
and heat it up gently the perfect
temperature range is anywhere from one
hundred and eighty-five degrees
Fahrenheit to about two hundred and ten
it's about the same temperature as
boiling water so when you touch the
screen it's going to be too hot for your
fingers I'm going to use my knife to
separate and clear off this corner one
more time and that should give me enough
room to get this wire wedged down on the
screen itself and then I can tuck
downwards on both ends of the wire to
separate the adhesive from the phone
itself and the shattered glass that
we're taking off if your wire does to
catch on one of the glass shards you can
just lift it up with your razor and then
continue going downwards again what's
nice about the galaxy has four screens
is that they are laminated so they don't
come off in shards they're all going to
come off in one big piece you can see up
at the top of the screen my wire has
grabbed this little blue piece of
plastic this is a shield that is over
the LCD ribbon cable I'm just going to
reach in with my tweezers and pull that
out sometimes the wire grabs it
sometimes it doesn't
another method that you can use is
playing cards if you get like poker
cards you can use those to slide down in
the screen instead of wire I actually
prefer the poker card method better than
the wire method so I'm going to make a
video on that here in the next few weeks
so don't forget to subscribe if you want
to see that now I'm going to heat up the
phone again as it's cooled down too much
for me to pull the wire through remember
once the phone gets too hot to touch
you're good to go
if it gets hotter than about 212 degrees
though you're going to start having burn
marks on the screen you can see how
easily the wire slides between the
shattered glass and the digitizer
underneath my wire does catch on a glass
shard right here and rips the wire so
I'm just going to go ahead and pull it
out the rest of the way grab a new piece
of wire use my tweezers to just lift up
the edge of the glass a little bit and
then start over with a new piece of wire
pretty simple the wire is pretty cheap
as well so it's not too big of a deal if
it breaks and then just continue
separating the rest of the way down it's
getting colder down to 137 I'm going to
go ahead and heat it back up to about
190 200 degrees and then continue
separating it the rest of the way down
you have to be careful as you reach the
bottom here because there is a little
ribbon cable that is in charge of the
menu buttons and the home button so you
just want to get the edge of the screen
and then once the screen is off as you
can see right here you can lift up the
glass and pull it away from the device
itself this is the little ribbon cable
that I was talking about and then I
usually take my razor blade and just pry
off the buttons from the glass itself
making sure not to tear the cable at all
even though the cable is only about 4 or
5 bucks it's nice if you can just reuse
the old one and then I'm just going to
separate the last segment of adhesive
from the bottom of the screen and pull
it off pretty straightforward and
honestly if you've gotten this far the
chances are you're going to succeed that
getting the glass off is the hardest
part here you can see the the shattered
glass and how its laminated pretty good
move the galaxy s3s weren't laminated
they would come off in shards anyway so
there is leftover adhesive on the screen
of the phone so I'm going to go ahead
and just kind of roll that off with my
finger it comes off in chunks and it's
also strangely satisfying so you can
just sit here and roll off the rest the
rest of the glue
there also is a chance that you won't
have any adhesive leftover on the screen
it just kind of depends on how the phone
was made and how old it is and the
temperature you used to separate the
glass from the phone and now before I do
anything else I'm going to go ahead and
test to the screen just to make sure I'm
not wasting my time by putting a new one
on remember that the digitizer which is
the layer right underneath the glass is
about as fragile as an egg and so if you
break that then you're toast here's the
little wire right here in the corner is
what normally rips so make sure that
there's no tears or anything in that
cable if there is a tear buy a new one
before you put the new screen on
everything looks good with the phone the
touch works even though the glass is not
on the screen I'm going to go ahead and
grab some denatured alcohol which is an
alcohol specifically made for
electronics to clean off the rest of the
adhesive from the phone itself
just go ahead and remember that the what
we're dealing with here is about as
fragile as an eggshell
so don't press any harder than you would
on the side of an egg now as far as
replacing the glass goes you have two
options the first of which is the
easiest cheapest and most forgiving but
will also leave your phone slightly more
vulnerable to breaking again it's the
double sided tape it's super cheap and
all you have to do is lay down the tape
around the edges of the phone and then
rest the top glass in place over it and
that's it you're done you have a fully
functioning phone and it's ready to go
there are a few places locally to me
that only do this type of repair it is
easier much easier the second option is
using a local glue it is an ultraviolet
light activated optical adhesive it's a
little more complicated so I'll be
making a part 2 video to follow up with
this one and explain how that more
complicated repair is done it's also not
super expensive but you kind of have a
bigger chance of ruining your phone but
it is more durable as well anyway so if
you're going to use the double sided
tape make sure to cover up every part
you know except for the earpiece and the
home button and make sure to get the
sides of the phone as well so that the
screen will be completely adhered and
dust won't be able to get inside the
double sided tape is easy to peel off as
you can see there grab the glass make
sure to peel off both sides of the
plastic lay it down into place so it's
fully adhered to the sticky tape and
you're done I would definitely recommend
getting a case this time around go ahead
and click on the top corner to see how
the local glue is done thanks for
watching if you have any questions make

forget to like if this video helped and
