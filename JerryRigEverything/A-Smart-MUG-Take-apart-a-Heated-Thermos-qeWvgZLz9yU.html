have you ever found yourself browsing
around online and seeing something you
like and think to yourself man I would
love to take that apart and see how it
works that's what happened to me and
this smart mug right here this thing has
an internal battery and a heater that
brings it up to 145 degrees Fahrenheit
that's pretty impressive I can be out
here drinking hot chocolate in the
middle of nowhere and have a drink hot
for hours inside of this electronic
thermos this video is actually sponsored
by YouTube YouTube is launching a new
channel called unboxed where they'll
have a bunch of unboxings from different
creators all the latest and greatest
stuff for the holidays my unboxings are
rather unique so I'm glad YouTube
reached out with the holidays coming up
YouTube's new channel is a great place
to find gifts for those hard to shop for
people gifts like this smart mug that
keeps your drink warm for hours I'll
leave a link for you in the description
of this video for YouTube's new unbox
channel but now let's unbox this mug and
see what makes it tick let's get started
the ember' wireless temperature
controlled mug is here something I never
needed or wanted but now I just need to
own one a normal thermos can keep drinks
warm for quite a long time but this
particular ember mug has a built-in
heater that can actively heat up liquid
on the go
pretty cool inside the first box we get
another box with an orange ember themed
color scheme kind of cute and here's the
mug itself incredibly high-quality cold
thick plastic had me thinking it was
metal at first but the razor blade of
truth showed the exterior was in fact
plastic as a lot of thermoses are it's
not a big deal in this case the lid
unscrews with this watertight rubber
seal during my time using this mug it
never leaked out the top inside the mug
is all metal and has a few more
instructions tucked down inside now one
cool thing about this mug is the way it
charges inside the other half of the box
we have a wireless charging station for
the mug which allows it to keep
beverages hot all day long as long as
the mug is sitting on the pack the two
gold pins match up with the golden
circles on the bottom of the mug so it
doesn't matter what orientation the mug
is when you set it down it'll charge no
matter what way it is facing mug itself
has a two hour battery life to keep
things warm away from the dock it's
pretty cool that it charges so easily
nothing ever needs to be plugged in the
lid has a little circle inside that can
be pressed down to let liquid out and
pressed again to seal it all up and keep
the heat inside the Umbra logo is touch
sensitive and a long press of three
seconds gets the mug to turn on and then
I can adjust the temperature of the mug
with the physical dial at the bottom
since this is a thermos it can keep cold
drinks cold but it doesn't have an
active cooling system in place just heat
and along with everything else nowadays
there's an app that can control this
thing from your phone but it's nice to
see that the mug has its own dials it
also does Celsius if you're into that
kind of thing not calculus just Celsius
even though those are both probably
about the same thing to most Americans
now I'm ninety-three percent sure that
this mug is never supposed to be taken
apart I mean it's a mug but there are
electronics in here somewhere and I want
to see how it works
the expedition four screws yielded eight
underneath the bottom rubber grip it's
the larger four screws took my t8 bit
and the smaller four screws fit my t5
bit
the removal these screws allowed the
metal plate to lift up and the bottom
dial to pull away from the bottom of the
cup and unfortunately this is where the
salvageable disassembly ends there are
no more screws everything is permanently
molded shut but we're gonna continue
anyway sacrifices must be made I'll
start by breaking the seal between the
heavy thick plastic outer layer and the
metal insides of the in Burma with my
razor blade and then it's time to
utilize the old rusty saw-blade trick it
works every time now I don't blame ember
for making their mug difficult to take
apart
it's literally designed to hold liquid
and things that hold liquid need to be
seamless and sealed so they definitely
get a thumbs-up for extremely solid
construction in my opinion the plastic
molding rolls all the way around the
sides of the cup and seamlessly splices
into the bottom of the mug finally I was
able to separate the internal guts from
the outer shell and get to the
interesting stuff this big circular pad
on the side is the thing sitting under
the Ember logo as part of the system
that senses your finger and turns the
mug on and off right below that we have
the LED panel that gives temperature
readouts both in Fahrenheit and calculus
and by pulling up the white insulating
layer I can get a glimpse of the liquid
level indicators running up and down the
side connecting us all the way down to
the blue circuit board at the bottom
I'll disconnect the heater coil ribbon
cable just like a little Lego and the
battery plug with my plastic pry tool
because like you know we don't want to
like damage the mug or anything at this
point the motherboard is held in place
with two black plastic clasps on either
side and the whole thing can pull away
from the mug base revealing the equally
blue battery this little guy as an
eleven hundred and twenty milliamp hour
battery that gives the mug two hours of
heat on the go finally the bottom
plastics can come loose revealing what I
believe is the temperature sensor for
the liquid inside
remember that heater coil like is
connected earlier well that's hidden
under all this black foam wrapped around
the base of the amber mug the location
makes sense heat rises so having the
coils wrapped around the base of the mug
is a pretty efficient design overall
this is a pretty impressive system if
everything else is getting smart these
days
your cup to the design seems solid from
the inside and the outside and that
heater coil was especially interesting
definitely worth the teardown as always
thank you so much for watching I hope
you enjoyed the unboxing of this mug and
the teardown if you have any questions
leave them in the comments below and
don't forget to check out YouTube's new
unbox channel thanks a ton for watching
and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
