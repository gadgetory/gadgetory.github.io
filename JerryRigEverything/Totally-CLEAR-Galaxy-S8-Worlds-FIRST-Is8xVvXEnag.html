test video I've been thinking about
making a clear Galaxy s8 and how cool
that would look now the s8 is a little
bit different than the s6 and the s7
where the coloring isn't so much of a
sticker but it's more of a coating on
that back glass so it scrapes off but
not super easily but I think I have a
solution
all of these are called solvents or
paint thinner and one of these should
work may be fatal
or caused blindness it swallowed it
should work just fine the first step in
making a clear Galaxy s8 is to remove
the back glass panel I talked more about
this in my complete s8 teardown video
but the short version is to go slow and
to use heat and a thin metal price tool
so you don't break the glass now
remember you are avoiding all of the
warranties on your phone if you attempt
this project and it is a little bit
harder than it looks
once that back glass is off on a pop out
the camera frame and the fingerprint
scanner
so I have complete access to the glass
slab itself these are incredibly well
shielded to that glass so I'm doing more
of a slicing motion through the adhesive
instead of prying up against the glass
at this point I did try separating the
color from the glass but it seemed
pretty permanently coated and did not
want to come off my razor blade couldn't
do much more than just scratch the
underside of that glass this paint an
epoxy remover on the other hand is kind
of like acid the solvent worked
incredibly well to soften the paint on
the underside of that glass but there
was still one more slightly cloudy
lamination layer underneath that the
lamination was relatively clear but
still had a murky effect to it so
getting rid of that was the next step
the extra strength
paint remover once again made this part
slightly easier since it had loosened
the laminated bond with the glass now
that the glass is completely clear and
rinsed off we have a few different
options one is to just take that glass
panel and put it directly back on the
phone this leaves the phone with
complete functionality since everything
is still in place and intact and while
it still does look pretty good at this
point
I'm going to strip it down and take it a
step farther there are 14 screws in the
back of this thing and the good news is
that not all of these screws are
mandatory in order to view the pretty
stuff inside the phone we have to remove
the wireless charging the phone will
still function completely fine with this
removed it just won't charge wirelessly
anymore obviously
now the loudspeaker plastics are
covering too much of the circuit board
for my taste this Android has the
headphone jack and I want to show that
off from the inside the loudspeaker is
still pretty important though and
crucial to the normal functionality of
the phone so I'll need at least half of
this piece of plastic the other half not
so much now we can visibly see half of
the charging port while still keeping
our speaker in tact the important screws
that need to stay in place are these
ones I'm pretty sure all the screws are
important on some level but these are
the only ones I'm going to keep I'll put
some clear double-sided tape back on to
the camera lens as well as the
fingerprint scanner and then Reese take
them to the underside of that clear
panel I'll have all this stuff linked in
the video description if you're curious
or if you want to try this yourself and
now we're starting to get somewhere all
of the internal circuits and components
are completely visible at this point
just like back in the good old days with
my favorite Gameboy this thing is
looking pretty sweet to get that back
glass to stick securely to the phone we
have to use more clear adhesive I'll
link that stuff in the description just
make sure that it goes all around the
inside edge to keep that dust out the
phone definitely isn't going to be water
resistant anymore I'll use a little
glass cleaner on the underside of that
panel once you set it down it'll be down
for good so make sure it's clean the
first time around
after removing the top layer of the
double-sided tape I'll clip in that
little tiny fingerprint scanner the
complete disassembly and reassembly
video of this phone we'll have a few
more tips and tricks in it this
particular video is more just
highlighting the clear back panel and
there you have it the world's first
fully functional clear back to Galaxy s8
let me know what you think do you think
Samsung should start mass producing
these things for everyone I think it
looks pretty cool there are a few cons
that go along with this project
obviously the phone is not waterproof
anymore and it doesn't have the wireless
charging in the back and you know the
phone is not meant to be taken apart
there's a good chance that it could just
die completely during this and you have
no more warranty once it's been open
up but as far as aesthetics and how cool
it looks I think it's pretty awesome and
it's pretty much a cost-free project I
had to buy that paint dinner which cost
about eight bucks and it took about an
hour of my time to clear off that back
coloring and reinstall the phone again
but other net if you have any questions
leave them down in the comments below
and maybe if this video gets enough
likes Samsung will start making these
phones in the future it's a long shot
but it could happen thanks for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
