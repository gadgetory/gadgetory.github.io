a GoPro Hero 2 this one has a large
scratch on the lens that makes it pretty
unusable the replacement lenses are
usually less than 10 bucks so it's worth
fixing especially because the GoPro Hero
2 is still pretty relevant so even right
now when I try to clean off the lens
there's a white spot over my face that
makes it blurry and the only way of
getting rid of that scratch on the lens
is by replacing it GoPros hold their
value pretty well so it's a good idea to
repair them if possible take out the SD
card the back panel and the battery and
then there are four screws make sure to
keep all your screws organized they are
different sizes there is a sticker that
is stuck to the metal heatsink of the
motherboard pull that sticker up and the
back plastic will pull away from the
GoPro don't pull it too far though that
is still connected by the microphone
wires and the ribbon cable there are
three more screws to remove before we
have access to the lens two on each of
these corners and then one more on the
other side as well
then the front housing will pull away be
gentle with that LCD when pulling it off
don't put any stress on anything or it
will break now the lens itself is glued
into the housing I'm going to use a
little heat to help soften the glue and
then some pliers you'll hear the seal
break and there are a lot of threads
down there so you'll be twisting for
quite a while but it will finally come
out when the lens is finally off make
sure there is no dust or anything on the
image sensor below it this is important
that sensor is very fragile so if there
is any dust on it like mine use a soft
cotton q-tip and let the Friz from the
tip of the q-tip pick up the dust don't
use any pressure now that the sensor is
clean and there is no dust on my
replacement lens I can screw it into
place remember I will link all of the
replacement lenses and tools down in the
video description below make sure you
screw the lens in correctly and don't
cross thread any of these little threads
the lens is very tight during the
screwin process so I doubt it'll ever
shift on its own but if you are worried
about it you can always put some Loctite
on the threads to help hold it in place
just don't use very much or it might
coop down onto the sensor I'm going to
go ahead and line up the battery under
the GoPro so I can turn it on I am using
the HDMI output on the hero 2 to watch
what I am doing on my monitor so I can
see when the lens is in focus is this
the safest most kosher way of doing this
probably not but
it works as I screw and unscrew the lens
it will go in and out of focus so once
you find that perfect sweet spot where
everything is in focus you are set
reassembling the camera is pretty simple
make sure to line up the LCD correctly
into that front housing and not put any
pressure on it when you set it in place
get those three screws into place and
then you can set the rear housing on top
with its four screws be careful with
those microphone wires and ribbon cable
don't pinch them anywhere all right this
is what it looks like with the finish
lens in place there is no scratch mark
or blur anymore on the lens and this
will work if your lens is cracked or
shattered or anything like that you have
any questions leave down the comments
