this 1700 pound trailer that is not my
model 3 so I'm totally fine doing
whatever so tehsils are some of the
coolest cars on the planet but allowing
a car to accomplish more things is
always a good thing
today we're going to install a hitch on
the Tesla Model 3 that allow it to tow
carry bikes and just be an all-around
more productive vehicle let's get
started so this isn't my model 3
obviously it took me 2 second to find
someone brave enough to let me tear down
their vehicle whoa hey wait a minute
stare down this has been from Tesla
Nomex he has a whole channel dedicated
to the economics of Tesla vehicles why
do you want to hitch on your car well I
think that these cars are beautiful but
they're not as functional as they could
be so adding this hitch is going to give
me a whole new capability of you know
carrying bikes around and little things
like that
and while the tells us aren't rated to
tow anything yet we did see a
performance model that was pulling
something recently so I thought this is
just a great way to basically get that
same functionality without having to buy
a $80,000 car that's true and the thing
that I like about this hitch is that it
does nothing to change the aesthetics of
the vehicle you can't see it's there
when it's installed it's totally hidden
100% let's go around to the back of the
car and we'll show you how to install it
all right so we have to get this hunk of
metal behind the bumper inside of this
Tesla so we're gonna tear off the whole
back end to get it installed but it's
not as hard as it sounds this is called
the Eco hitch I'll have it linked down
the video description this video is not
sponsored but this thing has a towing
capacity of 2,000 pounds and a tongue
weight of 200 pounds
now obviously like we mentioned before
the Tesla is not actually rated to tow
stuff but at the same time Tesla's are
super powerful vehicles with electric
motors and you know large batteries
inside so it's not like it's gonna hurt
the car to throw a couple bikes on the
back or to tow a trailer every now and
then it's probably not the best idea to
put like a mobile-home behind this thing
but you know 2,000 pounds is 2,000
pounds we'll test it out here at the end
you nervous yet alright for this little
plastic piece over top of the light this
little guy is kind of hard to unscrew we
don't want to scratch it up because this
the Tesla is kind of nice so we're gonna
take these pliers put a cloth over it
and then grab it and then twist it like
that because the pliers are stronger
than your hands are and then once it
started I've come off the rest of the
way keep going
alright so there's two little black
plastic pins on the inside that you just
pop off this top and then the whole
thing collapses inside allowing you to
pull the whole contraption out from
underneath allowing this felt piece to
pull away giving us access to the
taillights
and then to pull the taillight out
there's two bolts holding it in and both
of these are eight millimeters all right
after those two nuts are released from
the bolts the whole thing comes away
there's two little pins one here and one
here and with the way that they're
shaped they go inside these little plugs
so there's a little bit of force pops
the whole light out of the housing so
the other the passenger side tail lights
the same way it has those two little
nuts inside and then hopefully yep same
two little clefts right here so now the
taillights are out and that we can work
on the bumper so you've got these two
push pins that hold this side of the
bumper into the wheel well and then just
one Torx screw that holds it all
together
okay so you're underneath the model
three right now and there are these are
all 10 millimeter bolts there's three
over here on this end or removing this
bottom plastic plate and then there's
two more clips right here on the very
end right next to the bumper and these
can be pulled down with just a
screwdriver popping out this plastic
piece and you have full access to the
bolts right there so let's pull off this
plastic chunk
remember throughout this whole process
it's probably a good idea to keep your
shoes organized as with any project
there's two more bolts up here at the
top of the bumper underneath where those
headlights used to be and by headlights
I mean taillights
so the bumper itself is all made of
plastic and it's got these little clasps
right here so I'm gonna unclip all of
these oh this is in my car and all of
the rear sensors on the bumper are
attached to this little guy take this
thing off roading what do you mean we're
even going I've just been jumping it you
know and this is what a Tesla looks like
without the whole bumper or tail lights
how you feeling about having your car
not in one piece anymore VIN I feel
alright I'm a little worried about the
IKEA nature of the assembly but I know
where to go if we lose any of these
parts those plastic pushpins are
impressive rolls while you're there it's
cool okay so all the plastic bumper
stuff is off there's this metal piece
right here called the crash bar and
there's three bolts on either side three
where binner at and then three right
here inside of these little holes and
you to them are 15 millimeters and then
the whole crash bar pulls up and away
from the frame so this is the hitch
right here you see how it has this
sloping plate the car also has a sloping
plate so this piece of metal right here
we actually take off and discard we
don't need it but to access this metal
we have to remove this and these are all
10 millimeter bolts and there's five of
them one here two three four and five
you just got to pull this clip off so
these are the same 15 millimeter bolts
all the way around this and once they're
all off we don't need this piece of
metal anymore because the slope is
included on the actual hitch itself all
right so remember that piece we just
pulled off and discarded there's these
little plastic washers that are included
with the kit and we're gonna put on each
one of these little bolts and that's to
keep the two metals separate from each
other and it could be for vibrations to
minimize them or it also could be
because
dissimilar metals fusing together is a
thing and we don't want that to happen
so the white washers go on these bolts
as well as the three bolts right here on
the mount itself and that's where the
crash bar installs once the hitch is on
the model three so now the hitch is
installed on the back of the model three
this part right here is removable and
I'll show you that in a second and all
of these nuts are tightened down to
fifty pound feet of torque so the thing
with torquing down all of these bolts
the 50 foot-pounds of torque
is with the torque wrench once you hit
the right amount of torque it'll do this
clicking thing right there and that's
when you know when to stop and the nut
is tight enough on the bolt and then the
crash bar attaches right onto the hitch
itself with the white washers between it
and the hitch to prevent that corrosion
so the crash bar is also installed now
and each of the nuts holding it in place
are also torqued down to that same 50
foot-pounds of torque that the base
hitch was torqued down to this part
right here is the hitch and the whole
hitch is hidden except for this part
right here which sticks up inside of the
bumper and attaches to the hitch itself
that we just mounted but in order for
that to happen we do have to cut the
only cut that we're gonna make a hole in
the bottom of that plastic piece
underneath the bumper itself that way
with the hole there this can slip inside
of the hole and then this will protrude
out but only when we actually want to
tow something and when we're not
actually towing something we can take it
out and it's hidden and the Tesla 3e
looks like it has no hitch so probably
the scariest part of this ordeal is
cutting into the bumper itself but it's
actually a lot simpler than it seems we
have the bumper off of the car set right
here and to get the correct measurements
we're measuring from the inside of the
car to the outside where the bumper is
at and right here measuring along this
center line we're looking at 26 and a
half inches which is this line right
here and then in the instructions it
says that if we put a dot right here
which is 3/4 of an inch from this one
center line we can use a 4-inch hole saw
and cut right there and then put another
dot over here two and a quarter inches
from that center line and use that same
four inch hole saw right here we don't
have a four inch hole saw so we use this
paint candle set it right here got the
diameters correct and then we can use a
jig saw to cut that hole out and it
accomplishes the same thing
and there we have it perfectly cut
before the hitch all right so the bumper
is in place it's clipped in in both
wheel wells we have the little plastic
tacks and both Torx screws going up into
the top connecting the bumper in the
wheel wells and bin just finished
installing all the bolts underneath that
plastic skid plate so we should be good
to go after we installed the brake
lights
we'll go test out the trailer all right
so we got the passenger side tail light
installed member has that plastic bit up
top then we got the driver's side tail
light for the model three now it's in
and we'll plug it in and get those two
nuts screwed in on the backside and this
is what it looks like with the hitch
installed let's get that trailer on it
all right so we have the model three
hooked up to this 1700 pound trailer
which is pretty close to maxing out the
towing capacity of the hitch we just
installed but we're going to give it a
try anyway
like
that is not my model 3 so I'm totally
fine doing whatever
so I think the trailer did good I was on
the trailer how did it feel from the
inside
it felt good it didn't have any kind of
hesitation about pulling it it felt
strong I was more worried about the
trailer kind of bouncing around and
stuff but it felt solid obviously we
weren't going superfast is just in a
parking lot testing it out because we
don't have like the lights and stuff on
the back of it depends on what state
you're in you might need a wiring
harness and brake lights and all that
stuff but for a bike rack and stuff I
think it'd be great yeah for anything
any of your a reasonable amount of needs
that you would have for a vehicle like
this it performs well so thumbs up you
might not use that hitch all the time
but sometimes it's useful to have on
there and when you don't need it it's
totally hidden you have any questions or
comments leave them down in the comment
section
check out Ben's channel I will leave a
link right here and thanks stuff for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
