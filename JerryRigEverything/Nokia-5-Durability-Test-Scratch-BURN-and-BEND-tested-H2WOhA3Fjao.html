smartphone market this year releasing
several phones of various powers prices
and materials today on my desk we have
the Nokia 5 which sits comfortably
between Nokia's three and six which were
also released this year if Nokia is not
careful they're gonna run out of digits
to use on their phones next year let's
get started
the Nokia phones are pretty inexpensive
and extremely popular all over the world
but also really hard to find here in the
USA there are a couple on Amazon that
work well with the GSM networks so I'll
link those in the video description and
this beautiful copper Brown is going to
be subject to my rigorous durability
tests just like every other phone and it
has been scratched with Gorilla Glass
though covering the surface there's no
surprise when the scratches don't appear
until level 6 tempered glass is the
standard for smartphones lately and
Nokia is using the good stuff the
front-facing 8 megapixel F 2.0 camera is
tucked under the same glass as the
screen so no damage will be happening
here the earpiece is a vinyl like
material and there's no chance of it
falling out it's glued in pretty tight
the home button is made from glass and
is scratch resistant my razor blade does
nothing normal wear and tear will do no
damage to this home button it's not
invincible ceramic like we saw in the
oneplus 5 but it's still pretty good and
now for the back of the phone this color
is actually really awesome I've never
seen anything quite like it
the Nokia branding is lined up with the
camera lens in the centre of the back
and after a little analysis I find the
branding is solidly inlaid into the back
panel and there won't be any issues with
it falling out in the future the 13
megapixel F 2.0 rear camera is up here
in the center it's a step up from the
Nokia 3 but the fact that they use glass
on this lens is a huge benefit if you
remember from my Nokia 3 video it used a
plastic back along with a plastic camera
lens and that alone is reason enough for
me to spend a bit more money and jump up
to the Nokia 5
to worry about the lens scratching is a
big plus even the flash is covered with
glass over here on the right side of the
phone we have metal volume buttons and a
metal power button along with you know
some more metal down the sides on the
other side of the phone both the dual
sim and SD card trays are metal no
water-resistant
is included but for this price that's
kind of expected the top of the foam
right here next to the headphone jack is
all plastic probably for the cell signal
but at the same time the corners of the
phone are most likely to hit the ground
first during a drop and the plastic
corners are more forgiving and pliable
than metal is Nokia has built their
phones with useful features that won't
break on the first drop unlike some
other extremely fragile devices released
from Apple this year the color of the
phone is super unique the aluminum body
looks and feels pristine and look I drew
a graph of Bitcoin or you know if you
flip it over on the side its Donald
Trump's approval ratings starting at
birth
down here at the bottom phone we have
more strategically placed plastic along
with the microUSB charging port that is
one thing I hope Nokia changes across
the board next year
USB should be a thing the 720p 5.2 inch
IPS LCD display does seem a bit dim it's
currently maxed out on brightness at the
moment but the screen did last for 10
seconds under the heat from my flame
which scientifically means that if you
hold a lighter to your phone that it'll
survive for 10 seconds seems to happen
to me on a regular basis and now for the
bin test slightly more useful than a
burn test we get to see the internal
structure and build quality of the Nokia
phones applicable to drops bins bumps
tight pants and basically everything
else in life and Nokia once again has
built a beast even when bin from the
front and the back nothing flexes and
nothing is disfigured no kinks or bins
Nokia has proven that phones don't need
to be expensive to be solidly built I've
tested the Nokia's three five six and
eight now and all of them have passed
it'll be interesting to see what Nokia
does next year now that they've run out
of numbers to use but either way hit
that subscribe button and let's find out
together
thanks ton for watching and I'll see you
around and if you made it to the end of
the video let me know in the comment
which is better Harry Potter or Star
Wars I'm curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
