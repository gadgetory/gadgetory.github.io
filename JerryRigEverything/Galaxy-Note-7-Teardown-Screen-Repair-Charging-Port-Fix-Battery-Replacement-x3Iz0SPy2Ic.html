apart and fix most everything on your
Galaxy Note 7 I will link all of the
replacement parts and tools that you'll
need down in the video description below
as soon as they become available
hopefully you'll never have to replace
your screen with the new
shatter-resistant Gorilla Glass 5
because taking apart this phone is not
for the faint of heart
it will require courage and bravery and
at least six healthy Pokemon remove the
bottom s pin and the top SIM card tray
and then with a heat gun you'll need to
heat up the back cover universally all
the way around the outside I heat it up
until it's too hot to touch with my
fingers then I can take a thin metal pry
tool and slide it between the metal
frame of the phone and the back glass
being careful not to lift up too tall or
else the glass will crack and break and
I want to reuse my back glass cover
I will reheat the glass about every 30
seconds as I slide my tools around the
edge before going around that back curve
I'll stop with my metal tool and switch
to a playing card or a business card
because the business card is flexible
enough to wrap around that curve without
putting any extra stress on the glass
it's been about 30 seconds so I'm going
to heat up the phone again until it's
too hot to touch and then slide the
second card around that second curve and
slide it up slicing through the adhesive
all the way around the outside I'm not
going inside the phone too deep because
there is the wireless charger and the
NFC pad that we don't want to rip around
the edge as well as a little ribbon
cable next to the power button so watch
out for that I'll slice through the
remaining pieces around the top edge and
the back panel will lift off away from
the phone if you're just replacing your
back panel they do sell replacements
usually at around 20 or 30 bucks I will
link these down in the video description
they will come with their own adhesive
so you can peel off the old adhesive and
you're good to go there are 11 screws
around that back side remove all those
and try to keep them in order even
though they appear to be the same size
it's always good to keep your screws
organized the loudspeaker comes off
easily enough set that off to the side
and then the wireless charging and the
NFC pad lifts off as well you can see
the gold contact points at the upper
corner that just rest against the
motherboard and that's how it charges
the battery through the board here's the
vibrator motor as well now that we can
see the guts of the phone we will unplug
the battery making sure that there is no
electricity coursing through the board
and we can unplug the
ts pin removing the battery is
relatively easy I am using my metal pry
tool just make sure that you do not
puncture the battery at all I did slice
my bottom edge a little bit which
shouldn't be a big deal as there is no
copper exposed but still you want to be
very very careful with the batteries I'm
going to undo the screen ribbon right
here on the left-hand side and then we
have the IR blaster next to the five
megapixel front camera we'll talk about
those more in a second I'm going to
disconnect the earpiece and the front
sensor array and then this other ribbon
cable on the side along with the power
button all of these unsnap like a little
Lego down here we have some new ribbon
cables instead of a wire connection is
now a ribbon we will disconnect the home
button cable and then we have two screws
before we can lift off the motherboard
I'm just going to fold it over because
there is one more Lego light connection
at the bottom where the charging port
connects into the bottom of the
motherboard it's been the same way since
the note 5 and the galaxy s7 and the
galaxy s6 so we'll just take my plastic
non-marring pry tool and unsnap that
from the motherboard here is the rear 12
megapixel camera it does have a little
bit of adhesive holding it onto the
board you can see the oh is stabilizing
feature the camera itself moves around
inside of the housing to stabilize your
image while you're holding your phone
this works for pitchers and for video
we'll set that back in its frame and
line out the Lego so we can connect them
again here's the front array it has an
infrared LED that supposedly helps with
the iris scanner in low-light situations
so it can find your pupils and scan it
into the phone will tak that back into
place here's the iris scanner on the
right and the front 5 megapixel camera
on the left cute little guys the iris
scanner is which you use to unlock your
phone with just your eyes we'll put
those back into place and here is the
charging port there are three screws
holding it down remove all three screws
and then you can disconnect the
headphone jack a phone isn't a phone
without a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
the charging port is oddly shaped so be
careful when you're pulling it out and
make sure you have all the components
and nothing rips especially if you need
to reuse it if you're replacing it now
you probably need to be so careful this
charging port has the USB type-c as well
as these two signal wires up at the top
except they're not wires anymore the
river
which is interesting down here at the
bottom of the charging port we can see
the USB type-c connection as well as the
microphone it has a little hole in the
bottom that rests against the frame I'll
talk about the waterproofing abilities
of this phone in a future video so make
sure you're subscribed so you get the
notification for that now here's the
heat pipe these things are always
interesting to me some manufacturers
call them liquid cooling which i think
is a bit of a stretch since there's not
really any visible liquid inside of them
it's more of a vapor tube or a vapor
chamber it's more fair to call them a
heat pipe instead of liquid cooling the
little fibers you see here help transfer
the heat up and down through the pipe as
it rests up against the processor will
fold the copper back down into place
pinch it down and it's as good as new
we'll put the thermal pad back into
place and move on to the screen
replacement now I was unsuccessful at
removing this screen successfully I
broke mine during the process as I
imagine most everyone else will as well
there is an extraordinary amount of
adhesive holding this screen into place
I imagine that has to do with the
waterproofing that the Galaxy Note 7 has
so far I have heated the screen up till
it's too hot to touch and I've slid a
playing card in through the little
battery hole so it pokes out the side
and this gives me a starting point to
slide another playing card around the
edge to soften the adhesive remember
that there are multiple layers to the
screen like the digitizer and the AMOLED
layer and if you accidentally separate
those two layers your phone will be
broken now I imagine if you're trying to
remove the screen the screens already
broken anyway
Samsung has industrial machines that can
remove this screen really easily with
heat and suction and grabbing it all the
bright points on the frame but local
repair shops like myself without those
machines it's going to be a tough task
luckily there isn't any reason to remove
the screen unless it's broken so you
won't need to be as meticulous as me
just make sure not to damage the home
button and menu buttons as it comes off
during your screen replacement you'll
see where those are at in a second I
wonder if Samsung could develop some
kind of adhesive pull tabs like it's
underneath the iPhone batteries that
helps it release a lot easier one little
pull tab stuck somewhere inside of the
phone and all of the adhesive under the
screen would come off it might add some
slight thickness to the screen but it
would make replacing things a lot easier
as you can see with the screen
replacement is getting pretty ridiculous
at this
point I am heating it up about every 30
seconds and then sliding more playing
cards in along the side making sure to
avoid where the AMOLED screen starts on
each of the corners here's where I made
my first big mistake trying to slide my
card in underneath this ribbon cable and
I slice right through it and I imagine
it probably pretty important there's a
few other points along this screen that
I'll mention in a second you have to
watch out for one is the other ribbon
cable at the top along with the whole
ribbon that goes to the AMOLED screen
and then at the bottom you have the two
menu buttons and the home button itself
so basically all around the edge of the
phone is pretty fragile now that all UT
Civ is cut or loosened I can lift up the
bottom and make sure that I'm not
ripping the menu buttons as I lift off
the screen so I'll tuck those back down
into place and the screen is off so this
is the replacement screen this is what
it will look like if you need to buy one
for yourself except for yours won't be
cut along the top ribbon and nothing
will be sliced off like I managed to do
with mine it will have some adhesive on
it that you can use to reattach to your
old frame to remove the home button and
the menu buttons they are slightly
adhered down to the frame I'm going to
lift those off and pull the ribbon
through the frame hole and you are set
if you ever do need to replace your
fingerprint scanner or menu buttons you
do have to take apart your entire phone
to get to this point remember I will
link all the replacement parts down in
the video description below I am going
to wait until parts become available for
this note seven before I put mine back
together I will be replacing the screen
and the faulty fingerprint scanner
I say faulty because well it's my fault
that it's damaged I want to admire this
frame for just one quick second you can
see how thick the metal is all the way
around the outside there is an
extraordinary amount of metal in this
phone probably enough you could make two
Nexus 6p s from just one no7 frame while
wait should take a page out of Samsung's
book I hope you enjoyed this teardown I
enjoyed making it if you have any
questions leave them down in the
comments and please subscribe so you
don't miss my future teardown videos my
next video will explain how the Galaxy
Note 7 is water-resistant bonus points
if you follow me on Twitter and
Instagram and every now and then I'll
throw a snap story out with behind the
scenes footage as well thanks ton for
watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
