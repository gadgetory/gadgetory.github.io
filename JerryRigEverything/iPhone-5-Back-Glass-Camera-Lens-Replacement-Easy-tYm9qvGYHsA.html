replace the glass pieces on the back of
the iPhone 5 along with the rear camera
lens pretty straightforward all the
parts and tools you'll need for this
project are in the video description
grab a heat gun or your grandmother's
hairdryer and heat up the top of the
phone you want to heat up the glass and
the glue underneath so you spend
probably about thirty Seconds to a
minute
heating up the glass I usually wait
until it's a little bit too hot to touch
that way I know that the glass and the
adhesive underneath are hot enough so
they'll separate I take a razor but you
can also use a pry tool and grab
underneath the edge of the glass mine's
kind of shattered we can also go between
the frame and the glass it's really
important that you don't slide your
razor too far underneath and if you do
take the edge of the razor and press it
up into the glass you don't slice
through any of the important ribbon
cables underneath it's a pretty
straightforward process and as long as
you stay near the edge of the glass
piece you should be fine I'll show you
where the little ribbon cables at here
in a second as I'm lifting up the glass
I'll hold it down so it doesn't rip with
the adhesive as I'm pulling the piece up
now that that little ribbon cables safe
I can pull away the glass piece and
you'll see the camera lens come up and
away with it as well because the
adhesive is attached to the top of the
camera lens if I had to do it again I
would just get a new camera lens this
one I'm going to clean out because I
don't have any laying around and then
once you get your new camera lens or the
one you cleaned just press it back into
place there's these little holes up in
the top corner in the bottom corner and
then you can click it down into place on
top of the phone pretty easy with the
adhesive you want to be really careful
because the adhesive is really thin and
it's easy to tear you can see the clear
part right there as it peels away from
the adhesive itself if you do manage to
tear your adhesive or ruin it at all you
can just kind of cut up the leftover
strips and place it where you need to
you just basically want it all the way
around the outside so that dust can't
get inside on your lens anymore
press it down into place then you can
lift up the backing with a razor blade
and you should be good to go grab that
top glass piece take off the protective
covering
once again these replacement parts you
can find in the video description below
and then press it in and you can see all
the way around the top it is pretty
flush with the phone itself it'd be near
impossible to
this phone is ever fixed by anybody else
it greatly increases the resale value of
your phone especially since the parts
are so cheap if you have any questions
