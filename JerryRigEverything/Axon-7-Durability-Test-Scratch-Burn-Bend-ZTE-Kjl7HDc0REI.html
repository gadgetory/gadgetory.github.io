nach Civ or is it the axon seven so many
phones these days I'm starting to get
confused I've tested around thirty
phones but this is the first phone I
have ever tested from ZTE it'll be fun
to find out what this phone is made of
the axon 7s claim to fame is it's
inexpensive price and the dual
front-facing stereo speakers but what
good is a cell phone if it doesn't hold
together for two years so let's see how
much torture the ZTE axon 7 can handle
we'll start with a scratch test these
pics have different tips on the ends as
I scratch the glass it will give us a
number of how hard or scratch resistant
the screen is normal smartphone scratch
at level 6 but if a company uses cheaper
glass it could scratch at level 4 or if
the screen is plastic it'll scratch at
level 3 like on the galaxy s7 active the
axon 7 scratches at a level 6 so it's
perfectly on par with most of the other
flagships the front-facing 8 megapixel
camera is not covered by the screen
glass so let's test it as well as you
can see from my razor it is made of
glass so we don't have to worry about it
scratching unlike the HTC m9 which has a
plastic from facing camera lens that can
easily be scratched so a thumbs up to
ZTE for spending an extra few pennies on
each unit and getting real glass on
their phone the speaker grilles are made
of plastic though ZTE advertises a metal
unibody on their website but since the
speaker grille technically isn't part of
the unibody I'll let it slide but still
metal speaker grilles would have been
ideal the bottom speaker grille is made
of plastic as well the body of the phone
is metal and the phone has the cool hard
heavy feel of metal as well the sound my
razor blade makes tells us everything we
need to know this camera does have a
dual LED flash but it is not
multicolored like on the Moto Z or the
iPhone so it'll be bright but it won't
have the same color preservation during
flash that some of the other phones do
not a deal-breaker
but still it's the little things the
rear 20 megapixel camera lens is made of
glass thankfully it will be resistant to
scratching as well the camera bump is
not as ginormous as the Moto Z but it
still protrudes a little bit it is also
made of metal the fingerprint scanner
can be scratched
but even after extremely scratching it
with my razor
I was still able to set my fingerprint
and unlock my phone with an almost 100%
success rate so there is no need to
worry too much about accidentally
scratching your sensor the side buttons
are made of metal and I was worried that
ZTE would skimp out and use plastic at
the top and bottom of the phone near the
antenna lines like on some of the Huawei
honor phones but everything around that
USBC charging port is metal and that's
important on to the burn test the
extreme heat from my lighter shows us
that well the phone can be mostly just
like fire so either way the phone lasts
at about 22 seconds before I noticed a
white burn mark but the white burn mark
did fade away as soon as the phone
cooled down not near as resilient as the
Moto Z's 50 seconds but still way longer
than the Galaxy s7 s 15 seconds so let's
bend this thing starting from the back
we can see the screen lift up and out of
the metal housing as I apply pressure
but the metal phone body itself does not
flex very much especially when compared
to the almost rubber like Flex of the
Moto Z when I flip it around and press
from the screen side the phone flexes
even less and still holds up against my
pressure I've had four phones
catastrophically failed this bin test
but the ZTE axon 7 is not one of them or
is it the L knocks off' either way solid
phone subscribe instagram twitter and
snapchat all of the things thanks for
watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
