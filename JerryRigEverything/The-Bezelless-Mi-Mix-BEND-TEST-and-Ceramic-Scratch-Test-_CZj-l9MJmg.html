smartphone from Xiaomi called the me mix
I do durability tests on cell phones and
the past I haven't been too fond of
xiaomi's built quality I've already
tested three other phones made by Xiaomi
two of them have catastrophic Allah
failed the me 5 and the note 3 the redmi
3 Pro survived but only barely
so will the me mix survive my durability
tests or will it end up on my shelf of
shame next to it structurally impaired
family members let's find out the
magnetic door on the cardboard box
already has me impressed the rest of the
packaging pulls out like an accordion
each layer having its own compartment
for different goodies on the Left we
have the charging wall plug and the USB
seat cable as well as the instruction
booklet and the SIM card removal tool in
the center we have a case it has the
texture of leather but feels like
cardboard and plastic had a baby it will
definitely protect the sides and corners
of the phone though against drops and
that's what we are looking for and
finally the phone this thing is big and
heavy as I've mentioned in some of my
previous videos weight is an indicator
of good build quality the more material
of phone uses the less likely it is to
snap in half I'll peel off the
protective covering over the back
ceramic ceramic has the feel and
glossiness of glass along with the cold
heaviness of metal ceramic phones are a
relatively new thing aluminum alloy
phones would usually scratch around a
four or five but ceramic claims to have
a level eight on Mohs scale of hardness
which is incredibly scratch resistant
we'll be finding out today as usual we
will start with a screen scratch test my
most picks will tell me where the screen
falls on Mohs scale of hardness most
phone screens will scratch at level six
a few shatterproof phones will have a
plastic screen which scratches at a
three like the Droid turbo - no one has
come out with a sapphire screen yet but
if they did it would scratch at a level
eight or nine the glass screen of the
mimic scratches at level six with a deep
groove starting at a level seven meaning
that it is on par with the rest the
flagship phones like the Samsung or the
iPhones let's transfer the scale over to
the back and see if this phone really is
ceramic like
jomi claims you can see the back panel
flex with the pressure of my pics as I
move up most scale into the
progressively harder tips no tips leave
a mark until we hit a level 8 though
which is incredibly impressive thumbs up
for that
hardly anything reaches an 8 on my
channel if you remember from my
jet-black
iPhone 7 scratch test video the jet
black was scratched by anything that
touched it
pennies keys of screw and my razor blade
none of those items that scratch the
iPhone would do damage to the ceramic me
mix ceramic is much harder than anodized
aluminum the ceramic me mix is even more
glossy than the glossy jet black that
might be a little awkward for Apple I
think ceramic could very well be the
material of the future
unfortunately the harder an object is
the more brittle it also becomes so
dropping this phone could very well be
catastrophic if you think I should do a
drop test of this phone let me know over
on Twitter let's move on to the rest of
my tests starting next to the camera not
my camera but the camera of the phone
this thing is so reflective I could use
it to do my hair in the mornings
scratching the fingerprint scanner does
absolutely nothing it could very well be
ceramic the same material as the back of
the phone the only way to test that is
with the most pics and since the level 7
does nothing to the material we know it
can't be glass it has to be ceramic
ceramic is definitely on my list of
premium materials right there next to
glass and metal speaking of glass the
camera lens is also glass thankfully
some smart phones have used a plastic
lens in the past which scratches very
easily the flash of this phone is
plastic but that's normal and a
non-issue the side buttons of the device
are unfazed by my razor and after a
quick test with the level seven most
pick it looks like they are ceramic as
well except for the front glass and rear
camera lens every single surface of this
phone is scratch proof ceramic if there
ever was a jerry-rigged proof phone this
one is on the right path to being it I
still have my lighter though and the six
point four inch 1080p IPS LCD is about
to feel the heat it takes about 10
seconds for the pixels to heat up and go
black but the screen still works
perfectly fine around the black spot
until it cools down and the pixels
completely recover this is mostly just
to watch now for the bin test if you
were going to buy a phone would you pick
one that snaps in half or one that
doesn't snap in half structural
integrity is a vital component in any
smartphone and luckily this me mix has a
lot of it the phone hardly budges it all
when I use my hands to press from the
screen side of this huge phone after
flexing the phone from both directions
there is not so much as a kink or defect
anywhere on the body the screen did
freeze and stopped working after the
second heart flex but clicking it off
and clicking it back on again fix that
and it started working as normal it
looks like the back panel is held in by
a series of clasps and a few of those
popped out as well but they were very
easily snapped back into place so this
phone passes the bin test and this is
the first show me phone that I've tested
that royally passes all of my durability
tests I am impressed the only issue that
could possibly arise with this phone is
if it's dropped with a super hard and
brittle ceramic frame and no bezel there
is no cushion for the LCD or front glass
if the phone ever slips out of your hand
I don't normally do drop tests but for
this phone I might make an exception let
me know on Twitter or in the comments
down below if that's something you want
to see hit that subscribe button if you
want to stay up to date on the
durability of every new phone as it is
released and let me know in the comments
if you like this new thin bezel style of
phone I think it looks pretty awesome
thanks for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
