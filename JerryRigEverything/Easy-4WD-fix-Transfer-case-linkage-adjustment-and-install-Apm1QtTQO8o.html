four-wheel drive on jeeps or off-road
vehicles it just starts to go out I'm
sometimes when you shift the lever back
it won't like click into gear
I found it I've bought two jeeps already
that have had that problem and I fix it
with a third dollar part um it's
basically this right here this is the
linkage adjuster I'm going to show you
where it goes right now we're just
looking at a Wrangler so if we get under
here this is the transfer case bracket
and basically it just goes from the
shifter to the transfer case and I'll
show you where that okay so right here
we have you know we have the engine the
oil pan the transfer case sorry the
transfer case is down there where it
connects the transmission part of that
we're looking at it's going to connect
these two bars right either this is from
the shifter up inside the cab and then
that's the lever that puts it into
four-wheel drive on on the transfer case
so once I get that piece into place well
no that's the issue or not all right so
we have the linkage part installed right
now you can adjust the tightness of it
with this bolt right here as the has
already to protect a little bit anyway
as this arm as a shifter arm moves of
this lift just up and down there's
little rubber washers inside of this
that this part clips into might it's
just a pair of channellocks to grab you
know on each side and kind of just press
it into place so now what we got to do
is test it
there you go four-wheel drive works like
a charm so yeah pretty simple things I
have not a couple jeeps like I said
Accord sometimes it's just an adjustment
where you just have to move the linkage
a little bit left to right this case is
just missing the linkage all together
anyway if you have any questions for
them in the comments if this helped you
make sure you like it let me know and
