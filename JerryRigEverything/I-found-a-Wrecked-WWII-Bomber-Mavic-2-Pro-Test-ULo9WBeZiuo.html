of the lake oh no check this out look at
this I see something big
rumor has it about five miles down this
trail is a massive world war two bomber
called it b23 dragon bomber and it was
wrecked here in the mountains of Idaho
about 70 years ago we're gonna be taking
this brand-new DJI Mavic to pro the one
at the massive one-inch sensor in front
and see if we can find it and see what's
left let's get started the medic-2 pro
has all of the same sensors that we saw
on the Maverick zoom that I reviewed a
couple days ago so whether you're flying
forwards backwards left or right you
should be protected while you're flying
making the drone harder to wreck
remember not impossible just harder
especially when you're doing the
pre-program maneuvers inside of the
drone like the asteroid or the
hyperlapse
all the autonomous flying is being
protected with those sensors around the
sides of the drone the cool thing about
the Maverick tube pro is that with that
one-inch sensor it can display 10 bits
worth of color which is more colors than
most computer monitors can even handle
right now
so if you're looking to be on the
bleeding edge of technology the one-inch
sensor with ten bits of color is the way
to go
more colors allow for more detail and
just a better looking image the good
news is I've been out here in nature for
about two hours now with no internet
connection and I haven't had any
withdrawals yet so I should be alright
so the reason I like using drones is
because it brings a whole new dynamic to
storytelling like yeah I could film just
straight ahead and fill in the whole
hike but that wouldn't be interesting
you can't see anything around me you
can't get any perspective shots of what
the area looks like plus a normal hike
is something that everybody's seen
before but a drone shot is usually from
a perspective that no one has seen
before adding a whole new level of
storytelling to your story also I
brought enough water to start a farm but
I left all of my food in my truck
hopefully doesn't take us too long to
find this plane so I've been hiking for
about five miles now and if the rumors
are true the plane should be on the
other side of this massive lake and this
isn't just any airplane this isn't a
small fighter like the one we saw at the
bottom of the ocean in Hawaii this one
is a full-fledged bomber b23 with the
wingspan of about 92 feet
pretty massive it's a little more
nerve-wracking 200 pounds of me on very
dry it out Wiggly locked I've
successfully reached the other side of
the lake but still no sign of the plane
beginning to have doubts Oh nope check
this out look at this I see something
big so why is this massive bomber out
here in the middle of nowhere next to a
lake let me paint a picture for you it's
the middle of winter in January 1943
eight guys are in this plane running a
normal supply mission when they
encounter on a massive winter storm
effectively icing up their wings and not
allowing them to fly which is kind of
important when you're in an airplane
their fuel was running low and their
radio had cut out so they were narrowed
down to a couple options one is jump out
of the plane that's inevitably gonna
crash with a parachute but there's eight
guys and they would have ended up
scattered all over the countryside so I
think they made the correct decision in
hindsight to stay in the plane and try
to land it as best as possible looking
out the window of their plane they saw
what they thought was a massive field
where they could land their plane safely
turns out it was a lake they ended up
overshooting the field the first time
because the flaps on their wings were
iced up effectively not allowing the
plane to stop or slow down
so they banked up hard and turned around
and tried it a second time knowing that
the plane wasn't gonna slow down enough
for them to land safely they ended up
overshooting what they thought was that
field and crashed their plane through
the trees effectively ripping off both
wings but all eight guys survived one
did break his leg though so three or
four days after they had crash-landed
three of the guys ended up hiking 40
miles to the nearest town took him 15
days to go get help after that another
plane was able to come and pick up the
remaining five guys who stayed behind
with the guy who had broke his leg
one thing that is super interesting is
that the Air Force was not super pleased
with their high-tech piece of equipment
getting crashed from a missile 70 years
ago so the Air Force ended up coming out
themselves and taking 1200 pounds of
sensitive equipment and the instrument
panels out of the wreck so people
couldn't steal our technology of course
this wreck has been here for more than
70 years now and a lot of humans have
come up to visit as well taking the
propellers scavenging humans are a
problem when it comes to historical
artifacts but I think it's pretty cool
it's not every day that you get to come
and see a piece of history where it
happened everything in this video was
filmed using the DJI Mavic 2 with this
massive one-inch camera sensor in the
front of the drone just like with the
MAV exhumed this drone does have the
safety sensors in the front the sides
right here and also in the back of the
drone which is pretty cool and on the
bottom we also have some more sensors
the build of the Mavic 2 Pro is
basically the same as the Mavic zoom
except for the gimbal and the camera in
the center so the controller of the
Mavic 2 Pro is effectively the same as
the Mavic zoom that we tested a couple
days ago this circle over here on the
left side controls the camera gimbal
which can also go up and down and point
at the sky which is kind of cool and
then the circle over here on the other
side is actually used for the aperture
aperture means you can kind of decide
what is in focus and how much of the
background is blurred when you're taking
video of something with the drone so I
would say if you're into the super
cinematic shots where the background
needs to be blurred lots of bokeh there
needs to be lots of color the Mavic 2
Pro is probably the drone for you
personally I think I go more for the
features of the drone and having the
capability to zoom in on something while
not losing inequality is super important
especially for the drone history videos
I do like these so for me I'm probably
going to end up using the DJI zoom a
little more often than I will the
Hasselblad 1 inch sensor pro version of
the Mavic 2 if you haven't seen any of
my other drone history videos I will go
ahead and link them here for you and let
me know what drone you think is best
which would you prefer the zoom or the
super colorful one-inch Hasselblad
sensor pro version of the Mavic 2 either
way thanks a ton for watching and for
coming out here with me to see this
beautiful wreck of a plane and the
history behind it and I will see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
