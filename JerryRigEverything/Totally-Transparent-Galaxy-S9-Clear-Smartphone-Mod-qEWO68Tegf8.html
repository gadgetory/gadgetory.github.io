that no one attempt making their own
transparent Galaxy S nine so many things
can go wrong and there's plenty of safe
ways to mod your phone without voiding
the warranty like D brand skins or a
case making a totally transparent phone
is rather dangerous let's go start it
I'm gonna turn the phone off and heat is
our best friend during this project the
heart of the phone is the softer the
adhesive get under that glass a strong
suction cup helps out as well once the
phone is just barely too hot to touch
I'll get my metal pry tool slid between
the glass and the metal frame of the
phone while the suction cup lifts up to
relieve some of the pressure on the
glass after that initial penetration is
made I'll grab some business cards or
cardstock
and slip little bits under the glass so
it'll wrap around the curve without
putting too much pressure on that edge
glass is glass and glass can break the
adhesive gets hard at the point cools
down so I'll bump up the heat and
continue slicing through the adhesive
around the edge of the phone slice too
deep though and I'll risk damaging that
fingerprint scanner ribbon or the
wireless charging pad which you'll
receive revealed as I finally twist that
back glass panel off to the side
exposing the black plastic mid layers
the fingerprint scanner has its own Lego
style connector that popped off when I
was removing the back glass the little
guy can press out from the camera lens
housing and then I'll heat up the camera
lens housing itself so I can separate
that metal frame from the glass the
glass back itself needs to be clear of
adhesive and hardware before we can
actually make it clear so once that
glass camera lens is gone I'll start
pulling off all the extra adhesive left
on the back panel there's kind of a lot
of it but that's what makes the phone
water-resistant so I can't complain too
much
now the adhesive is cleared let's get
rid of the black plastics and see how
much of the phone circuits we can expose
there are 15 Phillips head screws
holding down the protective plastics but
once those screws are out I can lift up
the wireless charging pad and detach the
top black plastic slab we'll come back
to this later the rectangular black
piece of plastic is less than mandatory
so I'll toss that and finally a
loudspeaker over the charging port can
pull away the buffer sticker between the
battery and the wireless charging pad is
not super important so I'll pull that
off and toss it interesting that there
aren't any no dogs allowed warnings on
this battery like we've seen on some of
the Samsung batteries in the past what's
inside will be happy about that one now
I want this phone to be functional when
I put it back together so I'm going to
keep the important components like this
loudspeaker this thin little portion off
to the side though only contains the
water damage indicator and since my
warranty is void at this point anyway
I'll toss that after a teardown phones
aren't water resistant also 92% sure I
don't need this other little plastic
segment so I'll toss that and now I can
press the loudspeaker back into place
with the little silver screws that hold
it snug now let me explain the wireless
charging coil I can turn the phone on at
this point and everything is still
working but if I go to plug in the phone
it tells me that the phone temperature
is too low and the battery won't charge
obviously this is an issue if I want the
phone to be useful
turns out the wireless charging pad also
has a battery temperature sensing niblet
attached to it and that temperature
reading is required before the battery
can charge Samsung is pretty sensitive
about battery safety nowadays for some
reason so I need to keep that wireless
charging pad I snipped away most of the
non-essential plastics around the
wireless charging and temperature niblet
leaving these circular connector pads
and the screw holes next to the pads
which hold the connections tight to the
motherboard I'm going to leave the
wireless charging intact because I want
my ass 9 to be fully functional when I
put it back together I'll screw those
golden pads down if you remember during
my clear galaxy si video I snipped off
the wireless charging leaving just the
contacts to the niblet
so that might very well be an option
here with the s9 if I wanted to expose
more of the motherboard the phone now
still turns on when the USBC cables
plugged in and the whole thing can
charge now that the wireless coils in
place with the battery temperature
sensor not too shabby
now let's clarify some things literally
in the past I've had to use some
powerful paint stripper to remove the
color from the underside of the glass
but this time around it looks to be a
little anemic at least with this black
color barrier there's still a tight
plastic laminate layer between the
metallic color and the glass but the
whole thing can be peeled up
pulled off if I were to drop this phone
now that the laminate layer is removed
and the back glass panel were to crack
it wouldn't be held together anymore and
the large shards of glass would go
everywhere like a glass cup accidentally
dropped on a kitchen floor so removing
the laminate does add a bit of risk
feeling away the color though is rather
satisfying just saying especially when
it comes off in one big chunk now the
back panel is as clear as Russian
collusion I'll make sure the rest of the
screws get screwed kind of like we all
did and then I'll add a piece of
double-sided tape to each of the four
sides taking special care not to overlap
the layers or leave any gap so the tape
will keep all the dust and Pocket lint
from entering under the glass and into
the phone I'll talk the camera lens back
into the slot it came from along with
our little fingerprint scanning friend
with its own little ribbon cable
I'll take special care to plug that in
first before the glass goes down and
I'll make sure everything is clean
before securing it in place the tape is
pretty strong stuff and doesn't like to
let go of things it grabs onto and it's
finished the phone is totally
transparent and still totally functional
with a working charging port which phone
do you think looks best my new s9 or the
note 8 with its wireless charging pad in
tact or the galaxy s 8 with his wireless
charger and removed so you can see the
battery better let me know in the
comments and keep in mind while the
transparent s 9 might look sweet
it does void your warranty and won't be
water-resistant anymore so I highly
recommend simpler mods like this
camouflage D brand skin I'll add a link
in the video description for the entire
D brand selection so show them some love
for supporting my channel and maybe come
back again and watch this video after
your s9 warranty expires that way it
won't be as big of a deal if you mess up
and break the whole thing come hang out
with us on Twitter and Instagram and
thanks a ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
