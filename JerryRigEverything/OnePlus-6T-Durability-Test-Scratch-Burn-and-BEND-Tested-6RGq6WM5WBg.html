again with the one plus 60 every time
this happens one plus brings something
new and innovative to the table unlike
another phone company I can think of
with a few changes to the exterior
design and a new under screen
fingerprint scanner it's time to start
the durability test I still think it's
funny that they added do not diss a
symbol warning right let's get started
one plus back at it again with the
wall-to-wall display looking good with
this little niblet of a notch up top
instead of some of the other monstrosity
as we've seen lately it's got the same
subtle s reflection off the back glass
this time around the back is missing the
fingerprint scanner oneplus has moved
the fingerprint scanner underneath the
front display which is pretty incredible
not many companies have managed to do
that yet and here's the very fairly
price 60 rocking the newest technology
let's see how well it works under
pressure though oneplus does include a
screen protector so it's good to know
the scanner works underneath that
protection it's time to test the glass
itself with my Mohs hardness picks these
quantitatively show what the screen is
made from plastic would be a level three
or four glass is level 6 and sapphire
would be a level 8 or 9 the 1 plus 60 is
using Gorilla Glass 6 and also scratches
at level 6 right on par with other
flagships one thing other major
flagships don't have though is the in
screen fingerprint scanner
this technology is pretty sweet there's
a little sensor underneath the bottom
part of the display panel that can see
my finger it uses the green light from
the display to illuminate my fingerprint
when it's pressed up against the glass
oneplus said they tried using all
different colors of light for this
illumination and interesting ly enough
the color green was the most efficient
color for the sensor earlier versions of
this sensor on other phones could be
seen through the black display when the
screen was off but with the oneplus 60
the fingerprint scanner is indiscernible
from the rest of the screen when it
senses the touch from my finger it'll
activate and if you watch closely it
uses the green light animation to
illuminate my finger and unlocks it
happens pretty fast
since the fingerprint scanner is under
the glass it's pretty well protected my
razor blade won't do any damage keys
don't scratch tempered glass
but hypothetically let's say it did get
scratched I'll take my level six Mohs
tool and scratch the glass it's pretty
safe to say it's unrealistically
scratched right now more so than
whatever happened in real everyday life
and the scanner is still working every
single time
impressive 1 plus cassette thumbs up for
that up here at the top of the screen we
have the little baby notch kind of cute
it's got its one sensor that doubles as
the front 16 megapixel camera face
unlock and proximity sensor above the
notch is the tiniest slit of an earpiece
hopefully call quality isn't sacrificed
because this thing is almost
non-existent it's about the same
thickness as my razor blade oneplus is
again sticking with the same black
anodized aluminum you can see the silver
metal glinting underneath the anodized
layer the power button is made from
metal as well as the Meuse which this
particular mute switch has three
different settings silent vibrate and
ring even with the mute switch this 60
is one upping Apple the top of the phone
is metal along with the volume buttons
and the dual SIM card tray I do see a
water-resistant rubber ring around the
SIM card tray so that's good but no
expandable memory the biggest flaw so
far though is the lack of headphone jack
I can only assume oneplus remove the
jack to sell more of their Wireless
bullitt headphones the bullets are good
don't get me wrong but it's unfortunate
that we can't have both worlds listen to
this though you can hear the difference
in texture over the logo on the midnight
black version of the oneplus 61 plus has
frosted the outer layer of the glass
just like the pixel 3 it's a more subtle
frosting not as prominent but the
cloudiness is abrasive enough to start
sanding down my softer metal tools like
my pry tool and it leaves marks since
the frosting is more gentle though the
marks wipe off but still frosting is a
dangerous game when it comes to a clean
looking device you definitely never want
your keys and phone in the same pocket
you can see my levels 3 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 pics all
weave marks on the glass
the heart of the material the less
likely it is to wipe off as you can see
from this rather expensive gradient of
scratches on the midnight black the
oneplus sixty currently comes in two
colors midnight black as you see here
and a glossy mirror black super creative
shades of black but why stop there
oneplus should also include the carbon
black matte black camel black and matrix
black B bran does a good job of subtly
protecting your phone against scratches
but also has quite a few not so subtle
color options if that's what you're into
I'll let you customize your own phone
with the link in the description and
thanks to D brand for sponsoring this
video
frosted phones got to be keeping them
pretty busy lately oneplus still has
their two cameras on the back the normal
16 megapixel camera and the secondary
depth sensor I still wish they would use
that extra space for a wide-angle or
telephoto but it is what it is the flash
is protected under the glass and neither
the camera lens nor the flash were
damaged by my razor blade
the oneplus 60 is rocking a six point
four inch 1080p AMOLED display super
nice for watching YouTube videos at high
definition something that the new seven
hundred and fifty dollar iPhone 10 R
cannot do I left my lighter in place on
the screen for over thirty seconds and
it had no reaction
pretty impressive the pixels completely
recovered from the heat leaving no marks
the invisible oleophobic coating though
is evaporated now in that spot so don't
attempt this trick on your own phone
will peel off the skin to keep the bin
test fair I'm gonna leave the red decal
though because that looks pretty awesome
not all phones are created equally
structural integrity matters a lot if
you want your phone to last a while t1
plus 60 does have some flex in the upper
half of the phone but I imagine this is
the junction between the board and the
battery where the phone is the weakest
there are no kinks in the metal nor
damage to the frame though the one plus
60 flexes back to its original shape
after the pressure is released
the only thing damaged is my decal the
one +60 costs two hundred dollars less
than apple's new budget phone the iPhone
10 R and is physically better in almost
every single way this is what Apple
should have made with their trillions
good hardware at a fair price yeah the
midnight might scratch a bit and the
headphone jack is missing but the
oneplus sixty passes my durability test
should I try making a clear 60 let me
know in the comments customize your
phone to the D brand link in the
description and thanks a ton for
watching
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
