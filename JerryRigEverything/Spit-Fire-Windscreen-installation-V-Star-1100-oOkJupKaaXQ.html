Spitfire windscreen on a motorcycle
basically it comes with a mounting
hardware and then the windshield itself
made out of plastic so to get this to
screw out of the windshield you have to
take this part right here put it up
through the bottom and then put this
washer on this stick this through the
windshield put this on after that and
then screw this on to the end you can
kind of see over here on this one I have
the plastic piece a washer the
windshield the other washer of the black
black piece and that holds this part in
so once I have it all screwed on then I
could put this through that little hole
and then tighten this and then hold it
all in one spot and this is what clamps
on to the motorcycle handlebars so we
are mounting it on the bike you can see
I have that screen under the shield
right here and then it's got the bar
there going down
I'm normally it's got this little
connector right here that'll sit this
part will clamp onto the the bar right
here then you screw this bolt down to
tighten it on this particular bike
though this these bars are too big so I
had to do some as I ended up getting a
piece of conduit at the conduit hanger
and it clamps on over the bars and this
just clamps around that I'm gonna see
how that works and I put just a little
piece of rubber stripping in there to
kind of protect the chrome on the bike
that's the piece that I bought anyway so
it looks like it's gonna hold on really
well I'm gonna grab another another one
for the other side and we're good to go
so a nice thing about this windshield is
that if you just unscrew these right
here and pop this out these two bars
come up off the top so you can literally
take the windshield off and probably
thirty seconds
there you go scout both those hangers on
it right now
just purse all right take off that red
sticker on the bottom as well anyway if
you have any questions freely them in
