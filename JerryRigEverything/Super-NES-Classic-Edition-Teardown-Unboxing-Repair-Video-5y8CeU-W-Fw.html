here it's pretty awesome that Nintendo
is releasing all of their classic
consoles and games in a small portable
unit with 21 games built directly into
the system it's hard for my wallet to
say no I'm mostly excited for Zelda
Mario Kart and Super Metroid the games I
used to play back in my day I always had
a videogame time limit as a kid before I
was supposed to go play outside or
something else equally stupid but now
that I'm an adult I can play as much as
I want just nobody tell my mom there are
two controllers included in the box's
time around instead of like last year's
original Nintendo classic that just had
one controller multiplayer games are
gonna be a bigger deal this time around
plus the cable for the controller is
longer Nintendo listen this time around
is 56 inches for 1.4 meters for those of
you with a measuring system that makes
sense I'll tear the controller down in
just a second but first let's dig into
the console quick trivia question for
those who know is Zelda a boy or a girl
let me know in the comments this thing
is pretty sleek the Super Nintendo
classic Edition is much smaller than the
regular Super Nintendo there is no
functional cartridge slot since all the
games are now internal it does have both
the power and reset buttons and a
plastic face that mimics the old
controller connectors on the back we
have the HDMI output and a micro USB
power port which also comes included in
the box now to actually plug in the
controllers the front insert pops off
and a slightly annoying and very much
still in the way fashioned to expose the
two plugs I'll show you how to get rid
of this in a second if that's your thing
it's pretty easy on a normal YouTube
channel this is the point where the
unboxing would be finished but on my
channel though it's not completely
unboxed until the circuits are naked
there are four rubber feet at the bottom
of the console that pops off exposing
four Phillips head screws the
construction is incredibly simple now
that it's open it looks almost exactly
like the original classic from last year
the power switches are definitely
different though I'll pop off the two
Phillips head screws holding down that
circuit board and then we have the
standard run-of-the-mill switch for the
power and a little reset trigger on the
other side of the board this whole thing
is pretty incredibly inexpensive to
manufacture let's hope that Nintendo
actually makes enough of these this time
around because this would make an epic
Christmas present I'll leave a link in
the description so you can check the
image
two levels and the current pricing now
that the power switch circuits are back
into place it's time to unplug the
controller cables from the motherboard
these things are tight and I always try
to avoid pulling on wires directly so
getting a metal tool under that little
plastic lip helps out it's a probably
safer to not use a razor blade though
there are four screws holding down the
metal plate over the motherboard this
thing protects the motherboard but also
acts as a heat sink the processor has
some thermal foam that reaches up and
touches the bottom of the metal plate to
dissipate the heat that it accumulates
while producing all the epic graphics
that the Super Nintendo requires one
more screw holding down the motherboard
to the plastic frame and finally we get
to see the pretty simple brains of the
Nintendo all of the included games are
pre-loaded onto this cute little board
I'll reassemble the whole contraption so
we can tear down one of those
controllers the motherboard had its one
screw and then the metal heatsink has
it's for the two controller ribbons are
back in place and we get an inside look
at the little plastic door for the
controller plugs if this thing is in
your way and/or you find it annoying
it's pretty easy to remove and reattach
again later if you want I'm gonna leave
mine attached so I don't lose it but
it's good to know it's removable with
just a gentle pull I'll reattach the
ribbon cable that I pulled off earlier
for those power buttons and the last
thing that I want to point out that's
pretty interesting is the LED from this
motherboard shines down into the smoky
plastic below it which then redirects
the light out the front opening of the
console kind of a cool design I'll toss
the top housing back on over the body
and screw it all back into place with
those four Phillips head screws the
rubber feet go back on top of those
screw holes and it's good to go the
controller is next on a list of things
to open up it's got hard plastic buttons
everywhere except for the Select and
start buttons which are grippy black
rubber on the back of the controller we
find five screw holes with the same
silver Phillips head screws that we've
been working with before pulling off the
back of the controller housing exposes
the backside of the circuit board along
with the corner trigger buttons the back
housing also has extrusions which I
assume is to hold the motherboard firmly
in place as you're pressing buttons from
the other side both trigger buttons also
have a unique design the plastic trigger
can separate from the housing easy
enough and the button has a separate
board held up at a 90 degree angle with
two wires leading down to the
motherboard the cable leading to the
controller is intertwined with these
little plastic pegs all untangled
and flip around the circuit board to
expose the buttons and how they work
each of these buttons has little black
conductive pads and when the rubber
counterparts are pressed into the
contact on the circuit board it
completes the circuit and allows Mario
to move the exterior plastic buttons
have little guiding pins in them just
like we saw on the Nintendo switch the
buttons are all removable including the
rubber start and select buttons and the
arrow Direction pad I'll get all the
rubber pads back in place these allow
the buttons to compress and uncompress
without any complex mechanisms so it
should last quite a long while I'll get
the motherboard back in place over the
rubber and place the corner trigger
buttons back in the grooves that came
from one more cool thing is that the
cable leading out from the controller is
intertwined with those plastic pegs this
allows the controller to be pulled and
tugged a bit without putting any stress
or damage on the connector for the
motherboard it can handle some abuse the
back panel is now in place with its five
screws and it's ready for me to play
it'll be pretty awesome if Nintendo made
a mini n64 next year what's your
favorite Nintendo game old or new let me
know down in the comments I'll have this
classic Super Nintendo system linked in
the video description right below this
video if you want to get one of your own
thanks a ton for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
