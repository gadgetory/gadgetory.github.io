stress tests on the Galaxy Note 5 this
phone is pretty much made out of the
same basic materials as the Galaxy s6
and the galaxy s6 edge so I'm not going
to do the same stress test as I did on
those phones you can watch those videos
if you want to see how it handles flame
or scratches on the front and the back
in this video I'm just going to see how
scratch-resistant the camera lens is
with my razor blade and I'm going to do
a pin test as well so as you can see I'm
taking my razor blade and sliding it
along the glass a bunch of different
angles on the lens and actually held up
pretty darn well the camera lens is
probably made out of that same tempered
glass at the back and the front is made
out of so it's pretty resistant to
scratches which is very nice so I'm
going to do this bin test in a couple
different ways first of which I'm going
to take my hands and kind of distribute
the weight of the bend along the frame
of the phone as well as the screen in
the back so you can see me press on the
screen of the phone here and it actually
survives pretty well it handles the
pressure of my hands pretty well I'm
going to flip it around still keeping
the pressure along the frame of the
screen just to see how much that can
handle still pretty straight screens
just fine everything's still working
really well so now I'm going to take my
hands and press more along the center of
the screen to you know put some pressure
on the guts of the phone looks like the
guts allow for a little bit of flex but
the frame definitely stays rigid along
the side of the phone I'm gonna try
twisting it a little bit in my hands
just to see if the frame can handle that
sort of torque motion and everything
looks good so far you can see that the
phone is slightly warped but there's no
permanent damage so you know I wouldn't
have any problem putting this in my back
pocket and sitting on it all day overall
pretty satisfied with the build quality
is phone it feels solved in my hand you
know honestly the only problems that I
have with this phone is just that it
doesn't have an SD card slot does not
remove a battery you know those are
pretty important to me as a smartphone
user anyway if you have any questions
make sure to leave in the comments don't
forget to like if this video was
interesting and don't forget to
subscribe it does help me out a lot
overall this phone held up way better
than the HTC m9 that phone snapped in
half in my hands go ahead and click on
this video if you want to check that out
and don't forget to check out my
Instagram I promise I do more fun things
than just taking apart cell phones
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
