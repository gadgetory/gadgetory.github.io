testing the Huawei honor 5x this is the
sunset gold color it is an almost
identical shade of gold as the Nexus 6p
just a little less rosy it is
interesting to note that the screen size
for the honor 5x is almost the exact
same size as the Nexus 6p it was a much
bigger phone than I anticipated when I
pulled it out of the box surprisingly it
only costs $199 on Amazon at the moment
the side power buttons and volume
buttons are textured now before I start
it is important to remember that
durability is not the only factor to
consider when buying a new smartphone
but it still is a factor I always have a
screen protector and case on my personal
phone even if it passes all of my tests
it does come with a long-lasting plastic
screen protector I will remove that
before I start with the scratch test
like always I have a set of picks that
let me know where the hardness of the
screen falls on Mohs scale of hardness
the scale goes from talc powder being a
number 1 to 10 being as hard as diamonds
Huawei has not listed anywhere that this
phone has Gorilla Glass but it still
scores the same on the hardness scale a
level 6 pick scratches and a level 7
pick leaves a deeper groove so either it
actually has Gorilla Glass or we've
learned that generic unbranded tempered
glass products hold up just as well as
the name brand Gorilla Glass tough when
specifically talking about hardness
levels and scratching I think it's
probably the second option luckily the
camera glass is also scratch resistant
it is glass unlike the plastic lens on
the blackberry Prive and the Xperia z5
the back is made of aircraft-grade
aluminum so naturally my razor blade can
scratch the soft metal same with car
keys the very top and bottom section of
the phone are plastic it will be
interesting to see what's inside of the
device when I do my teardown repair
video tomorrow onto the burn test it's
always fun for me to see how the screens
react to extreme heat the honor 5x has
an IPS LCD display and like most other
phones once these pixels get hot they go
black and turn off but when the heat is
removed the pixels recover and turn back
on completely unaffected the screen is
cool to the touch within seconds give it
a thumbs up for a perfect LCD recovery
now the bin test now this being a budget
phone and from Huawei
I was not expecting it to survive at all
the initial bin puts a pretty hefty flex
in the device but it locks out and does
not catastrophic ly break like the Nexus
6p did everything is mostly in
when I bend it the other direction the
thin piece of metal near the power
button kinks downward pressing against
the button which turns the phone off
everything can be bent back into place
though and nothing is permanently broken
this phone passes the bin test I believe
this is my 20th durability video and I
plan on doing every flagship phone as
soon as it's released so make sure
you're subscribed so you get notified
every time I release a new video if
there's enough interest I'll do a
durability test on the wall way may 8 as
well behind-the-scenes stuff is usually
posted to my Instagram and Twitter my
followers there sometimes get durability
test results sooner than my YouTube
subscribers thanks dumb for watching
hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
