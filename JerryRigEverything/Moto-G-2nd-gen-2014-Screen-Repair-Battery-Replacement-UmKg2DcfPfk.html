version of the moto G with the camera on
the right side the original version of
the Moto G has the camera on the left
side to start off we're going to take
off the backplate I just start down by
the charging port neither use a pry tool
your fingernails and you can just take
off the backplate sliding your
fingernails around the backside it's
just a piece of plastic no need to worry
too much about it pops off pretty easily
there's a ton of screws around the
backside as well take those off I
believe it's a t5 Torx head that you
need to remove them the tools will be in
the video description below you can see
a bunch of copper pads on the underside
of this as you take it off those are for
the antennas as well as the earpiece
speakers take off the earpiece
connection as well as the front-facing
camera and this piece of tape covers the
LCD connector lift up the black little
flap and that will allow you to remove
the LCD ribbon cable from the
motherboard lift off the SD card and SIM
card ribbon cable it's kind of like a
little Lego connection that holds it to
the motherboard then you can take your
pry tool and slide it underneath the
ribbon cable and make sure not to bend
it or can't get too much or else you
might damage it I will try to link all
the replacement parts in the video
description below it looks to me like
this vibrator motor is attached to the
ribbon cable so to lift that out make
sure you grab it from the bottom and
lift it with the tweezers you can see
there's a little bit of glue attached to
it as well so if you do end up having to
replace that make sure you connect it
securely in the same way that it looks
right now and I take the copper sticker
from the back of the battery and lift it
up
this will allow us access to the battery
so we can swap that out try not to rip
this if you do end up ripping it you can
just kind of piece it back together
making sure copper touches copper to
unconnect the battery lift up on the
little connector similar to a Lego and
pop that out and then remember as you're
prying up the battery it is held on by a
tape underneath remember that you are
prying against the LCD screen so try not
to put too much pressure underneath it
or else you'll end up cracking your LCD
if it's not already broken slid my pry
tool up towards the top and make sure
not to bend the battery or puncture it
at all or else it will start smoking and
melting and will probably damage
something important there's a battery I
will link replacement parts in the video
description below there's three screws
same size the t5 torx get those out and
then you can see underneath this little
tape is the camera held in place by the
same little Lego connectors even
removing this whole time from the rest
of the phone pop that off and you can
see it right here I believe it's an 8
megapixel camera pretty straightforward
to reconnect it just pop it into place
and press it down with your hand and
then put over that little tape shield
when you're done with it as well if
you're going to replace the charging
port the only way to do it is with a
solder gun and specialized tools so good
luck with that
and then the earpiece and the front
camera will just lift out from the frame
of the device as well here is the front
speaker the bottom speaker is the exact
same just lift up from the bottom and
it's held in place with some clear tape
pretty straightforward I'm going to put
that in back inside the frame
now here's the screen itself this is the
screen and the frame combination
combined and this is the part that you
would want to buy if you do end up
buying just the screen without the frame
it is a little bit harder of a
replacement you have to heat up the
screen and the frame and then separate
the two and then use sticky tape to
place the new screen down inside of the
frame the parts that I've seen listed
that are sold with the frame itself are
only about ten dollars more so I think
it's way worth your time to just go with
the frame screen combination instead of
just trying to go with the screen is so
it's very worth your time anyway set the
motherboard down in place after putting
the camera and earpiece back into the
frame one little trick I learned is if
you take your screwdriver and hold it up
against the speaker it's actually a
little magnet and it'll magnetize your
screwdriver so you don't have to lose
your little screws as you're putting
them back in get through those screws
around the motherboard back into place
and you can grab the battery clip it
down onto the motherboard and then set
the battery into place after that making
sure that it lines up with the little
slots in the frame that we don't have
any issues when you're trying to put
that back plastic plate back on your
device lock down the ribbon cable
connectors for the front earpiece in the
front camera and then you can take a
little copper shield and set that back
over the motherboard and the battery
this kind of just shields your SD card
and SIM card from interference with the
device itself as well as provides a
little grounding plate
I put the vibrator motor in first and
then clip the top next to that little SD
card reader and then I set the rest of
plate down after that to get the LCD
ribbon cable I just grab with metal
tweezers and line it up with the slot
and then lock it down into place as I'm
holding it to make sure that's secure
and then take little tape and put it in
over the top of that as well these
little back plastic plate will help hold
that down into place grab your little
buttons they have a little black tab on
top that rest against the motherboard
these probably fell out at the beginning
of the repair so make sure you keep
track of those if your camera lens ever
breaks that little silver part just pops
off I will try to link replacement parts
down in the description below and you
can just read here it with the adhesive
that comes with the new lens put all
those little screws back into place pop
that back cover back on and you are set
if you have any questions make sure
leave them down in the comments below
also read the comments before you do the
repair a lot of people have suggestions
maybe things I forgot that will help you
out and don't forget to like the video
if it helped you and don't forget to
subscribe thanks for watching hope see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
