now there's snow that's probably about
two two-and-a-half feet deep we have to
use this thing called snowshoes which
kind of disperse our weight across the
snow and make a little bit easier to
walk right now we're heading up to the
grandpa Gerry's cabin which is my
grandpa this is Jerry's daughter right
here who just so happens to be my mom
and we're going to go check on the cabin
because remember about six months ago
back when it was warmer and not snowing
outside
I came here and we mouthed roosted
because the mice had been taking over
for the last 20 years and we kind of
wanted our cabin back let's go check it
out
anything
the last summer we took four days and
completely sealed up the cabin from any
mice entry possible and so now we're
going to go in because it's winter and
mice like warm things just like anybody
else and we're going to see if they've
reclaimed any territory
so one thing that they done since I was
here last they put a new flooring so
this is some kind of vinyl flooring that
they laid down remember when I was here
in that last video we just had the
cement we ripped up all the carpet and
then put the carpet outside and I think
the final stuff is working out pretty
well it looks really good with cabinets
so this is that bathroom this is where I
had the cutout of the drywall so they
painted over that and it looks like they
added some texturing - we got the
baseboard I don't think I touched the
base border at all when I pulled that
piece of drywall out to check for the
mine and then over here inside of the
bathroom this is where we had the
biggest problem and we didn't actually
seal this up yet because we put the
concrete we filled up that hole that led
to the outside and then we pulled out
some of the ceiling we pulled out the
shower we left that out because this was
like the worst spot we were going to
sealed up until we were sure all the
mice were gone we have some of our
leftover construction supplies and I
don't see any sign of mice droppings yet
mouse droppings whatever you call them
and here's a mousetrap we left inside of
the house to see if there's any more
mice coming in with peanut butter my
specially like peanut butter side note
and there is ZERO
mice in the track so this mouse trap
works by the mice going inside of that
little hole right there and they can
walk up that ramp but then as soon as
they're inside they can squeeze
themselves out this side of the hole
where the RAM kind of goes down like
that they squeeze themselves through get
the bait and they just can't get back
out again and so if you remember in the
last mousetrap this thing was just full
of dead mice which means I think we were
successful that four days of renovation
got rid of all the mice were victorious
reclaimed our territory and they're not
coming back they repainted all this over
here we had to pull out some of the wall
because we found a hole from the outside
coming in and so right here looks like
we've got to touch up that plug a little
bit but this is all been
repainted inside of the closet looks
good and we have the fireplace here and
this is where we had a bunch of leaks
coming out of the ceiling there is kind
of like a running down the back and you
have to watch that other video to kind
of understand some of what I'm talking
about but we took down all the drywall
up here and all the way down the
backside of it all the way down around
the base and it looks like there's no
more leaks at the top of there which is
good I'll have to fly my drone around
the roof of the cabin and see if that
black stuff is still solid I can get my
drone pretty close to a 10 it's in 4k so
we can zoom in pretty far I'll put that
footage here and we can check the actual
black waterproofing stuff around that
base so this is that ladder I watched my
grandpa build back when I was a little
kid it's got little hand holds here that
you can climb up this is the attic with
that carpet I showed you outside on the
fence in the last video the attic area
we're probably going to throw away these
mattresses they were back in here when
the mice were over running the cabin so
one fun little trick if you have
chocolate covered cookies these are
actually called 10/10 and you bite off
either side at the end use it as a straw
and then the whole cookie is soggy so
good
I think the flooring option is actually
a really good choice is we got a little
bit of carpet here it is just like the
carpet squares and then the vinyl
flooring is more of like a plastic
instead of an actual piece of wood so
it's going to last a lot longer we can
sweep it and plus the snow gets on it
it's not going to be damaged very easily
like normal wood wood wood wood remember
one of the main entry points for the
mice was underneath this wood pile like
they're getting in under that shower and
you can still see at the base of the
house here we have that wire grate and
we have the sealant that we have
sticking it to the concrete and one of
the other big entry points is right here
on this corner and it looks like we're
still solid no holes
it looks like my fan mail to get in
anywhere I think we're successful so if
you're wondering why the heck we were
using snowshoes that whole time because
when you're walking in the snow without
them you go up to your knees and that's
not very easy to walk in just you can
make it so much easier so I think
operation saves the cabin was a complete
success super stoked about it to go back
and watch another video
we were finding mice in the walls and
the ceiling mice dropping everywhere it
was insane so I'm super glad that we
were able to take back the cabin and now
it's safe and sanitary for everyone to
use and by everyone I mean my family so
thanks for watching this follow-up video
it's definitely good to know that all
our hard work paid off
I think Jerry would be pleased with the
jerry-rigging that we've done with this
cabin hit that thumbs up if you enjoyed
this and if you want to see more
projects like this in the future thanks
ton for watching and I'll see you around
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
