from the black housing onto the angled
part of a cube to lens you can see
that's how Google got is cute logo from
the angle that that lens makes shining a
camera into the lens doesn't do us a
whole lot of good I ended up using a
screencast to my Samsung Note 3 and a
few extra cameras in order to make this
simulation work my name is Zack and I
run the YouTube channel jerry-rigged
everything I will be your unofficial
glass host on this adventure this video
is rendered in 1080 so feel free to bump
up the quality to get the full effect my
first thought when I saw that Google was
going to be making the glass was
instantly about how the navigation would
look and work while riding on a
motorcycle I've thrown together a few
clips from my travels to give you the
most realistic experience possible
without actually having to buy the glass
yourself this is almost exactly how the
glass would look without the sunglass
lens in place I tried to make the
opacity of the navigation window as
realistic as possible you can see that
it does take up a rather large chunk of
your vision but it is see-through when
you are focusing beyond the window it
doesn't come across as that much of a
legitimate obstacle is it distracting
yes even though it is see-through having
a list screen over your shoulder every
time you check your blind spot gets a
little too exciting for my taste I've
been riding bikes for about 10 years and
even I found myself having major lapses
and awareness when switching my focus
from that navigation window to real life
when you're on a motorcycle those lapses
can be dangerous I'm going to switch
screens now so you can see exactly
what's on the navigation window you can
see how many feet it is till you turn
what the street name is that you're
going to turn on to as well as the
amount of time it will take until you
reach your destination it also shows you
a basic map of the streets in your
immediate area just like with the Google
navigation app on your smartphone
there is a woman voice getting
turn-by-turn directions on a boned
conductive speaker the bone conduction
speaker basically transmits sound
we threw your temple through vibrations
but with the noise that my motorcycle
makes it was still a bit difficult to
make out exactly what she was saying
the little dings that the glass makes
come through loud and clear though it's
like a sound is playing from inside your
head instead of through your ears it
gets a little weird does take a second
to get used to the glass does come with
an earbud that you can plug in I'm sure
that would help out a little with the
audio thing I just haven't tried it yet
would I recommend one of these
specifically for motorcycle riding
probably not at least until the price
drops I put a link in the video
description below for current Amazon
pricing for those who are interested
right now the Explorer additions are
upward of 1500 bucks
hopefully that price will drop
drastically when they are officially
released overall this was a fun little
project I enjoyed making this video if
there's enough interest I can do a night
version and show you what it looks like
driving around at night with the Google
glasses on if you have any questions
just leave them in the comments below if
there's anything else you would like to
see me do with Google glass just ask and
I'll see if I can make it happen
and don't forget to share this video
with a motorcyclist in your life
everyone's got their own two-wheeled
fanatic somewhere and thank you for
watching and thank you for subscribing
to my future videos I put up new videos
about every week or so
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
