part the HTC 8x T for Sprint it's a
moderately difficult phone take apart
there's lots of wires and ribbons and
stuff inside you got to watch out for
and we're gonna start off by taking
apart 13 screws here along the outside
edge and then there's also one
underneath the camera and I will put all
of the you know any parts that become
available in the video description below
as well as all the tools that you'll
need so just check right below the video
inside the video description for all
links to all of those there's a void
sticker right there in the top corner as
well so doing this does void your
warranty but it is it pretty
straightforward thing once you get this
casing off to get the casing start on
the top side there's these two little
latches that you just pull back just a
tiny bit with your pry tool and then
once those are up or unhooked from the
actual frame of the phone the rest of it
just kind of unclips
from the outside edge so if you unclip
it from both sides and then along the
bottom it's kind of got a firmer grip
around the base of the phone and so does
have to bend that back with your finger
and then the back casing pops away from
the screen housing and motherboard
all right so now we're going to take
apart these two screws at the very
bottom of the motherboard and it's very
important that you keep the screws
grouped together so you can put them
back in later because they are different
sizes the back housing had Ford had
three different size screws and then
these screws are all different sizes as
well so keep them separated in all right
so we're gonna take apart the the
digitizer ribbon cable from the
motherboard right here so lift up the
tape and then there's a little latch
right here that you flip up and once the
latch is flipped up you can take the
ribbon cable and pull it out of the
connection these little connectors are
more like Legos they just kind of clip
into place so there's one here on the
side of the camera then there's one
right here on the other side of the
camera so lift both of those up and away
and this one's a wire cable so it has
like a little circular head on it that
just clips on also similar to a Lego and
be very careful when putting these back
together though it's easy to bend the
edges of it so take the tape off of this
other wire cable as well this one goes
down towards the base of the phone and
it will unclip right here so just kind
of wedge it up and it pops off the
little nub that it's attached to then
underneath this tape right here be very
careful when you're lifting it up
because there is a little ribbon cable
underneath and if you pull away too hard
it'll rip the cable underneath and
you'll be out your phone so I'll just be
very careful and kind of pull it away
parallel to the phone body that way it
won't put as much pressure on the cable
itself
so here's another one of those Lego
ribbon connectors so pop that out then
here's a regular ribbon connector where
you have to release the latch so pull
off the sticky tape flip up the latch
and then the little ribbon just slides
out
this is the battery connection right
here that does have two little screws on
it so undo each of the screws and then
the the connection pops up just like the
Lego ribbon connectors
just like that
one more wire connector right here you
just have to wedge up the windows phone
has a lot of these alright and then the
last connection is the speaker wire
right here you just lift it up and out
and there you go there's the motherboard
alright so now we're gonna work on the
top section top circuit board so there's
the little ribbon cable right there for
the audio jack just you know lift up the
little ledge pull out the cable and
you're good to go this one is more like
a plug like a wall outlet plug you have
to pull it out this is for the vibrator
and so once that is out you're good and
then there's another cable on the top is
for the power button so you have to just
very gently wedge it up it's stuck along
the top with tape and then also just a
little bit on the back of the phone as
well so it's kind of peel it back once
again if you rip that you're kind of
screwed so don't be very be very very
careful with that
and then the last connector on this top
circuit board is one of those little
Lego ribbon connectors on the very back
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
fold the part over and then you have
access to it and you just pop it off
just like you did with the other ones
just like that
okay so here's the camera so both of the
cameras are replaceable it's just a
little ribbon Knable ribbon connectors
that you latch up and then pull out I'll
put the parts in the video description
below as soon as I can find them Amazon
is the best place for parts I think so
here's the battery it's 1800 milliamp
battery so we're gonna pull it away from
the housing it is glued on so that you
might rip the little black or covering
on the battery it's not a big deal it's
not a actual part of the battery is just
a covering I'll show you I'm going to
get it pulled away from the phone
so very gently I pulled it out and you
can kind of see here on the backside
it's just a rift a little bit then
here's the bottom speaker housing so
this is where the the loudspeakers are
so I'm going to pull this away there's
four screws around the outside and
they're just kind of wedge it up with
your pry tool and you're good to go
and here is the charging port charging
for is fairly easy to replace as well
it's most of its just glued down you
just peel it up and then place the new
one in the same spot and you're all set
and this is the screen here so this
whole piece is the screen this is what
you're gonna replay seing the actual
glass is glued on to the LCD so it's
almost impossible to separate the two
okay so now we're just gonna reassemble
the phone
toss the speaker back into place screw
it on with those four screws again and
yeah any of these parts video
description below is where you find them
amazon is a pretty cheap place to buy
phones as well so I'll throw a link in
the video description for where to buy
the phones usually get it for a penny
it's a pretty sweet deal anyway so pop
the battery back into place the glue
should still be sticky on the back of
this so it should be very secure once
you get it back into place
anyway grabbed that little Lego ribbon
connector and place it in and it'll just
click back into the slot where it was
before and then make sure all the little
wires and ribbons like this little
vibrate wire right here
um are pulled up through the slots and
not just peg below the the circuit board
otherwise you'll have problems when you
try to get your phone running again
so now I'm pulling out this little
ribbon cable for the audio jack in place
to get on top of the circuit board as
well
okay this is for the power button so
just glue it back into place there's two
little circle rods that pop up and those
are like little guiding slots for the
power button so you can just put it
around those and then start plugging
things back into place this one is just
like wall outlet plug just kind of
wiggle it into place plug it in and
press it in and that's how your vibrate
works
and then the ribbon cable for the audio
jack just make sure the latches lift it
up and then slide the ribbon cable into
place and then latch it back down to
lock it so here we have the main
motherboard coming back into place just
making sure all the little ribbon
connectors and stuff are on the top side
of the motherboard pressing these back
into place just like the little Lego
connectors
and then the little wire connectors if
you very very sure that you're pressing
down when it's directly on top of the
little nipple where it's on the
motherboard because if you're pressing
down at an angle or wrongly it'll Bend
the little lip on the ribbon came on the
sorry on the wire cable and if you've
been that then it's never gonna connect
right again so make sure it's directly
above as you press it into place it's
like I said it's kind of a little you
know it's a it's a pretty complicated
phone so only attempt this if you're you
know fairly certain that you can't do it
same with this ribbon cable make sure
the latch is up slip it back into place
latch it down again and then make sure
that the tape is back on top of it the
tape just kind of makes sure that it
doesn't jiggle around and come loose on
accident in your pocket
and then this cable right here make sure
it's attached right a little connector
and then you see what I'm doing right
here and I'm pressing it down on the
edge of the battery yeah don't do that
leave it on top of the battery because
the little plastic things that you're
putting it in between that needs to
latch on to the back housing so if you
have the cable wedged in there where I
have it it's not gonna fit quite right
luckily I fixed it later anyway so all
these connectors down here at the bottom
you know pretty self-explanatory
you know where they all go just make
sure the ribbon cables in the right spot
and then just be gentle with it you
never want to apply too much pressure
and break anything getting the wire
cable back into place I latched the
speaker cable down just press it into
the the right spot and then I took the
leftover black tape after I screwed in
the battery connector and just placed it
over the top so that none of the wires
will move around as easily
and this is where it really helps that
you have all the screws in the right
spot so when I take the phone apart I'm
just testing to make sure it turns on
right now before I put the back housing
on and when I took the phone apart I
made sure to put the screws in spot
where I can you know remember where they
go so it's kind of like any outline of
the phone or in groups together it helps
out a lot anyway so the back housing
just clips back into place just like it
came off your little snaps all the way
around the edges and then comes time to
put the screws in the four larger screws
go on the very top the four medium
screws go around the edge and the four
smaller screws go around the base and I
believe the screw right below the camera
is a medium sized screw I can't quite
remember so if you can leave a comment
in the video description when you figure
out if that's a medium or a large size
screw anyway if you have any questions
make sure to leave them in the comments
below I usually respond every day or so
to the comments that are made and yeah
if you have any questions let me know
and I don't forget to like if this video
