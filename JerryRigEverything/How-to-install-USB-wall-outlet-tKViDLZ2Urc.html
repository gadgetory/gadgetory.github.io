change from a normal boring outlet to a
more high-tech dual USB outlet now death
is an option during this project so make
sure you flip the electrical breaker
that corresponds with the circuit of the
outlet that you're working on so you
don't die kind of important so it's
important to find the right breaker that
goes with the outlet you're working on
my particular one is in the basement so
I'm going to follow this across and turn
off number twelve and that will kill the
power to the outlets in the basement so
when you flip the breaker and I also
plug in my heat gun to see if there's
any power going to this outlet and
econ's not turning on so I think we're
good
remember it is very important that you
kill the power to this outlet because
there is a possibility of death if you
do not so there's one screw right here
we're going to remove and that takes off
the faceplate of the outlet then there
are two more screws that hold it into
the frame we have a couple different
wires here we have white colored wires
which are neutral wires we have a copper
wire which is the ground wire and we
have black wires over here which are hot
wires now since there's no power going
to this I can cut whatever wires I want
so there is a way to get these out of
the back but I don't really feel like
dealing with that at the moment so I'm
just going to cut them all except for
this bottom green one which will still
be convenient to having a loop
okay so like I mentioned before the
black wires are hot the white wires are
neutral and then the copper is just
ground so I'm going to go ahead and
strip us off some more of these tips
let's see the part where you die is when
these wires are live and you touch both
of them but since there's no power we
should be just fine
so this outlet has the two USB ports and
the normal plugs on either side and for
the back of it we have the hot wires and
the neutral wires and then we have a
grounding screw on the bottom so we're
going to take the two white neutral
wires and plug them into either these
two holes on the backside of this that's
a neutral and then we can screw this
screw that'll make them tight so the
copper wire is the same way we're going
to take that loop and stick the screw
through it and then stick it down into
the bottom this is the ground wire very
important now we're going to take the
two hot wires it's still labeled on the
back and we're going to stick those
through the two holes in the side of the
outlet then we can use the screwdriver
to clamp down on the wires and keep them
permanently there take the outlet and
line it up with the top and the bottom
screws of this little plastic hole that
it sits inside
all wall outlets are pretty Universal
all right and so before I put this
faceplate on I'm going to go flip the
breaker din and make sure that it works
and then this face plate will just clip
in with these little tabs around the
outside alright so the lights are back
on and the deep gun and the heat gun is
working so when I plug in my galaxy s7
edge it starts charging at the bottom
but it does not say fast charging so
this outlet is not capable of fast
charging I will link it down in the
video description below I will try to
find one that comes with fast charging
but I don't think that comes standard on
a wall outlet level that's probably just
in the adapter itself but either way you
can still charge four phones with this
outlet instead of two phones with this
outlet which is kind of nice great for
parties or when you have friends over
and people need to charge their phone at
night even though me getting
electrocuted might have made for a more
viral video I'm glad that didn't happen
hit that thumbs up button if you enjoyed
this you learn something or you want USB
plugs at your house thanks ton for
watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
