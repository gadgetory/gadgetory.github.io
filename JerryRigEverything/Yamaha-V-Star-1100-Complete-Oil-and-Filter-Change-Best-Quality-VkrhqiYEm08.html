Navi star 1100 it's a Yamaha there's a
few things you gotta know if where you
started this particular motorcycle has
internal filter the oil filters inside
of this cap right here as far as it
holds a little bit more than three
quarts of oil the fill plug is right
here the drain plug and here on the
bottom that's our drain plug right there
and we also have a window right here
that shows the the level of the oil it's
a it does have to be the bike has to be
straight up and down in a kind of a
riding position to make sure you get the
the right reading on it anyway so to get
started the bike currently is warm I
just got back from the auto parts store
where I got the oil from that just helps
the oil drain out a little bit better
than um when it's hot it's more liquid
so you don't you're not leaving a gunk
and stuff inside when you're draining it
out so yeah we'll start with that all
right we're going to start with the
drain plug it's a 17 millimeter just
kind of screw it out and make sure you
have something underneath it to catch
all the oil in and then if your engine
is free out make sure you don't touch
the oil because it will burn you got the
oil coming out of there the reason I'm
changing around this bike right now is
because I just barely I bought it and
the owner didn't know when it was
previously changed so I'm just going to
change it so I know when all the
maintenance was done anyway similar to
drip out just like that and then I'm
going to let it keep drip and until it's
completely stopped usually I let it sit
for probably three or four minutes maybe
five just to make sure all the bad oils
out of it
alright I got the plug back in and now
the fuel filters inside of this right
here and due to the very annoying
placement of this bottom exhaust
it's impossible to get to those bottom
two bolts in there this one and there's
one more down below this so you have to
take this bottom exhaust off before you
get to the field filter so you get the
exhaust off there's two bolts up inside
here that reach 12 millimeter there was
two bolts in here
those were 13 millimeters that just kind
of screwed into the exhaust right here
on the back and then my floorboards are
keeping the exhaust from coming out as
well so I'm loosening those up this is a
14 millimeter down at the bottom so once
I get the floorboard off the exhaust
should come right out okay so we got
that cap off see right here so the top
two screws on it for the short ones
this middle screw right here is the kind
of medium-sized one and then the bottom
two screws of the larger ones
let me put those back on right later
anyway this part right here is where the
oil filter is basically I'm going to pop
this thing on I might get the filter on
the inside so I did broke it loose a
little bit back up slides out you can
see where the o-rings are and here's the
filter itself okay anyway see em to kind
of clean up around the edges pop the new
filter in and then seal it all up just
we took it off so also a little black
washer that goes down there on that
bottom screw and then the same you know
when you replace those are on the edge
as well sure everything's there we go
put everything put back together put the
oil inside that fill plug right there
yeah everything else should be good to
go
anyway any questions make sure to leave
them in the comments make sure to LIKE
if this helped you I do like to know you
know help anybody out and off and then
