wrangler we are currently taking out the
transfer case underneath the bottom it
was making out a rattling noise first
step take off the skid plate there's six
bolts three on either side
it was pretty rusted on there I'd use a
cheater bar to take off the bolts after
that
you get underneath here take apart the
driveshaft is connecting it to the very
to the end differential
and then you loosen up here on this
there's four bolts one on either side
take those apart so you can pull this
apart later and there's going to be six
Poltz that are inside between the
transmission in the transfer case I was
literally on either side make sure you
take those off before you do any of that
though make sure all of your connections
all your wires are taken apart because
if you drop the transfer case with those
still connected you're going to be a lot
more expensive problem than when you
started
also make sure you drain it there's a
little drain plug here you go the liquid
out it'll be a little bit lighter for
when you actually do need to drop it the
whole thing weighs like price 70 or 80
pounds the noise it was making when I
was driving this
so anytime that I was coasting you know
along the road if I just take my foot
off the gas pedal to coast he would make
that noise I'm hoping it's just the
chain inside a pretty easy fix
should the chain itself should only cost
around 80 bucks or so anyways once we
get it off I'll let you know what
happens
all right so two more things the way to
tell what type of transfer case you have
um is right here on this as you can tell
mine is a two three one J J's for Jeep
also when you're doing it make sure you
support your your transfer case like so
I take them down the bowls it doesn't
bend anything I'm as you can see we're
using a pretty high-tech contraption I'm
of a cinderblock in a nice little bowl
we got from some girls all right so I
finally got all the pieces in it was
seriously a nightmare trying to get that
chain back on basically you have to take
every part out just a little bit like
those main segments like the bottom gear
that was attached to this guard in this
guard just take them out a little bit
and then just kind of like angle it all
landed itch like plop it in on one go it
seriously took like 15 minutes to get in
lining everything up all right I'm
guessing it'd be a whole lot easier if
you do as the manual says and take out
this section right here if you get this
bolt out on the bottom I just we tried
for probably 20 minutes to get that bolt
unstuck and it wouldn't go so anyway
that's it with the chain back on and
we'll take it from there alright so we
had we pulled it off this thing gave us
a little bit of trouble um it plugs
right into this little hole right here
so we just pulled that out and then here
we got the hole transfer case you can
see those six bolts that were stuck
inside of that very straightforward took
two of us to get it out it's a pretty
heavy little beast and that is how you
remove a transfer case from a Jeep
alright so here we have the transfer
case of a Jeep it's a 93 YJ on the
transfer case is the 231 J just going to
walk through how to take it apart really
quick so once you get this
this part right here it's a little guard
unscrew the three bolts that are holding
onto it and then you got to snap it off
in a clockwise direction we were having
some difficulty getting it to go
clockwise so just a sharp tap right here
with a rubber mallet broke the whole
thing off just make sure you don't scuff
up any of those the ceiling or seals to
the main part of it then you have this
little ring right here it actually goes
in this little groove this is a bee to
get out we put two screwdrivers in that
little section right there and kind of
pried it apart and then just wrap a
screwdriver around the inside worked out
well enough now we're taking out these
bolts right here that connected this
part to the base of the transfer case
and then we'll be able to pull that off
and see what else is inside all right so
then we have after we got off the top
guard we have the base of this we took
out all the different screws you only
need to take out the sensor and sensors
fine then we ended up taking a wrench
and putting it underneath here popping
that up popping this section up right
there took some doing about three guys
and we finally got it go ahead mess it
off and then this is what we're left
with you can pull this off as well make
sure to disconnect that little tube
right there we know that does it
shouldn't be connected on there that's
where we're at so far take off all right
so there's two little grooves where's
the other dominant one right here one on
the other side and there's also this
right here which was always used to to
pry off this side of it and that
releases this half of the transfer case
so we're going to pull it off all right
so we finally got the top half of the
transfer case apart
we also found what the problem was the
chain goes right here around the gears
we ended up just taking it off though
I'm you're supposed to manual said you
have to take this part off first and
release that before you can get it done
but we just jiggled
surround telex game came off itself as
far as what's wrong with the whole
device pull this out
tip it over so we got a better view on
it
so these impart here this whole
mechanism comes apart as well so we got
the main Schaffer got that gear and what
the part that screws on that goes in
between this little groove right here
that's the part on my machine I was
messed up so you can tell right here
that it's kind of ground down along the
edges and then if you look closely in
here as well you can see like these
silver bits of metal that have been
ground off and that's what our problem
was the whole rattle that was coming
from it so I got a new piece for I got
this and all the little protectors on it
for about 60 bucks from I believe Morris
4x4 you can just do a google search for
them and have some pretty good 4x4 parts
anyway so I'm going to replace that and
then put the whole thing back together
and I'll walk you through that as well
all right I just want to show just want
to show really quick that it doesn't
make that same noise anymore that was
making before the clicking noise is now
gone so that was the part that was
replaced that was the problem just this
right here you can see where it's kind
of ground away when the gears inside so
is this part that was making the making
the noise
alright so we're putting some gasket on
right now I'm just so that we sealed up
again it'll be tight and won't leak at
all the particular gas is that we're
using get that wrapper this is this high
temp red silicone so it'll work out well
for the transfer case you can just kind
of see how thick we're putting it on
there
I'm just make sure it goes up and around
each of the little bolt holes as well
all right so one super important thing
is to make sure that it is in four-wheel
drive so you got your two pins your top
one and your bottom one mount it as high
as possible otherwise when you go to put
in this little ring at the top
it won't sit high enough and you won't
be able to get it off trust me I've done
this four times okay
all right so when you're mounting now
that the first half melted on the second
half make sure you clean this off as a
clean as you can get and make sure
there's no red like epoxy stuff
underneath this because it needs to sit
flush put the pump cable inside of that
and then put this down as flush as you
can get it
make sure you align the gears and
everything and then be pretty generous
with the the high temperature silicone
you just want to make sure that it's not
going to leak at all and then go ahead
and and put the two on aligning the all
the necessary parts all right so I've
done this part on if you did decide to
take out the sensor it's pretty simple
to put back in as well you can either
put it on as I did as a whole unit or
you can put the metal part on first in
the sensor on later I've seen it done
both ways now as far as this o-ring goes
I did finally break down and buy a pair
of these to help spread the o-ring apart
and move it
I've actually we had a huge problem
trying to get enough space with the
o-ring there first it turns out this
bearing right here comes out it was
pulled out about a millimeter too far so
I am I seriously spent probably five
hours taking apart and reassembling the
whole unit trying to figure out where
that extra millimeter went so hopefully
that'll save you some times just make
sure that bearing is pounded all the way
in it's pretty solid I have a rubber
mallet here that I used anyway so when I
get that this ring on and we'll take it
from there all right and that is it
looks like with the o-ring in place Wow
all right once again copious amounts of
the red stuff go ahead and slide it on
top
set it down
make sure the the holes line up there is
a right pattern for that then you got to
make sure the bolts from the right spot
and I will show you where the funky
bolts are in a second all right so when
you're putting the whole thing back
together there's a few off bolts that
aren't it the same as the rest of them
this one up here at the top and as one
of the different bolts you need a
different socket head for that I'm add
to buy an extra one anyway I'm in the
second layer I'm here on the corner of
the transfer case and it's this one and
then on the bottom layer there's two
that need washers and it's the same ones
that have the little guiding rails when
you put it when you put them both
together so it's this one and at the
other side is that so both of those will
all of those will be the different bolts
when you're putting it all together
anyway it's all done now so you got to
put it back in the Jeep and hopefully it
all works all right so here we got er
Neath the Jeep again we do have the
transfer case mounted um back underneath
the Jeep let me explain how we did it we
put the little seal back onto the
transfer case and mounted it up on top
up onto this you know bolting it in
normally it's a 14 millimeter ratchet
that you need I put the drivetrain back
in on this
you can see here I need to do is just
put it in place we put the transfer case
in first and then just lift it up enough
to slide this into place and put on
little screws that you can see you're
required right here as well on this back
driveshaft this one was easier I mean
just have to make sure to line the
direction that this is first before you
put this end into the transfer case so
yeah that's where right now the transfer
case is in I'm going to make another
video to show how to do the the transfer
case fluid basically you fill it through
this one and you drain it through this
other hole debt here so all I'm going to
do is I'm just going to take this off
and then pump the fluid into it and then
close it up and it should be good now
this is the next morning after I put all
this red stuff on that was very liberal
in putting on um so it's that time to
dry and everything like that so it's
good now to put fluid in um we should be
good alright I filled it up just enough
so that the oil would start coming out
of this little plug right here and then
I got to do is tighten it and you're
good to go
that's how to change the transfer case
fluid in your transfer case alright here
I am underneath the Jeep again I have
this big plate the support that holds up
the transfer case and transmission
basically I did is I propped it up with
uh with my Jack from my Tacoma and I put
these two bolts in right there to hold
it together and then once it's up then
you can put the bolts in on the side so
I got this one in it's pretty just
straightforward from there I've done it
all myself so it doesn't need to be a
big multi person job I'm pretty
straightforward alright the Jeep is back
up and running on this with the Wrangler
we were working on
underneath here I got the support and
straight thing back bolted on it was
pretty rusted on there so I sprayed a
little bit of lubricant in each of the
bolts and it worked fine make sure you
tighten up those two things as well I
kind of forgot to do that but I did turn
turn the rig on and everything works
great I'm super I've never worked on a
project like that before I mean it was
fairly simple and straightforward as
long as you get everything that you took
off back in the right spot and you're
good to go anyway if you have any
questions feel free to ask</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
