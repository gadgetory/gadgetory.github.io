pretty inexpensive budget phone from
blackberry besides the plastic earpieces
it did pretty darn well in my durability
test video so let's see what it looks
like on the inside the back of the phone
thankfully is very easy to remove a
gentle nudge from my thin metal pry tool
allows the hold back to just pull off if
you want one of these thin metal pry
tools I'll link them in the video
description the back is held down by
some simple adhesive and some clasps
it's lightweight enough that will never
come off on its own though on the back
of the back cover you also have the NFC
pad NFC stands for near field
communication just like the name States
it allows for your phone to communicate
with other devices that are very close
to it because of this communication the
pad needs to have protection from other
electronic noise or interference from
the internal circuits of the phone and
that's what this huge black rectangle of
metallic tape is for it's not to hold
the battery in place it's there to
shield the NFC pad it does tear pretty
easy though so when you try to remove it
keep it intact as much as possible now
for the internals there are five screws
down at the bottom of the phone and then
the plastic shield comes up and away
attached best shield we get the
loudspeaker and the two little golden
contact pads that you see let it receive
the signal from the motherboard there
are three screws holding down the metal
plate over the battery which technically
I should have removed and unplugged
first the phone is probably still fine
it's just a safety thing always unplug
or remove the battery from electronics
before diving in I'll set that silver
cover off on the side and then unsnap
the battery and the charging port
ribbons they are connected just like
little Legos the charging port ribbon is
pretty much too small charging port in
the history of charging ports I have
never seen one this small on any other
phone I would even classify it as a cute
little charging port it is micro USB
which is currently being phased out on
all of the newer cellphones now in favor
of USB C and the little metal circular
thing you see on the side is the
vibration motor for the phone
thumbs up for how cute and easy that was
to remove the two thousand six hundred
and ten milliamp hour battery is held
down by some of those same magical pull
tabs we found on the iPhone just gently
pull those little pull tabs out from
underneath the battery and they will
stretch and release
there is one pull tab on the bottom of
the battery and two pull tabs at the
top of the battery three total both of
my top pull tabs broke halfway through
so I did have to initiate the pry of
shame he does help with this prize you
don't want to bend the battery too much
since you know explosions and fire and
all that stuff there is one more metal
plate held down by two screws this one
pulls away and then we can unplug the
little snap on the side and the screen
ribbon cable connector there are two
more little Lego snaps along the side of
the motherboard as well at the top in
the bottom and then we have four more
screws holding down the top black
plastic piece at the top of the phone
once that is off we can see the earpiece
with its two little golden contact
points on the underside these just rest
up against the motherboard to receive
the signal to remove the motherboard I'm
going to unclip the big ribbon cable and
then the black signal wire as well and
then the motherboard will just lift up
and away from the phone if you are smart
enough to remove the SIM card tray I
swear I don't forget these things on
purpose I just don't remember that it
exists with like every single tear down
that I do I'll remember on the next one
hopefully one cool thing about the
motherboard is the LED flash is built-in
that's kind of fun the small 8 megapixel
camera is still attached to the
motherboard as well and now that the
motherboard is out of the frame we can
see with these little side ribbons to
the bottom one is for the front
capacitive buttons the middle one is for
that programmable convenience button on
the side of the phone and the top ribbon
is for the volume rocker the 13
megapixel camera is still sitting inside
of the phone frame this plugs into the
back of the motherboard which I'll show
you in just a second all of the other
components like the front sensors ND
all-important headphone jack are
attached to this ribbon cable here now
if you want to replace the screen it is
very much attached to the frame kind of
similar to how the recent Samsung Galaxy
phones are so only attempt removing your
screen if it is already broken because
it will not survive the removal process
it will require a lot of heat from a
blow-dryer or hair gun to soften the
adhesive as you remove it replacement
parts of this phone are actually pretty
hard to find BlackBerry doesn't sell a
whole lot but I'll link the parts that I
do find down in the video description as
soon as they become available if you
find any that I don't have link to let
me know in the comments and I'll add
them as soon as I can remember that rear
camera this time I'll be plugging it
into the motherboard before setting it
down into place just line up the little
plug with its counterpart on the
motherboard and it'll snap in like a
little Lego make sure everything is out
from underneath the motherboard before
setting it down into place and then clip
in all of the ribbon cable
there are those three tiny ones along
that left side the screen ribbon in the
center and the top sensors need to be
plugged in as well before that top black
plastic shield goes down over the top of
them and there's always that black
signal wire that gets clipped in as well
the built-in flash is actually dual
colored which does help with the image
quality when taking pictures while using
the flash the cute little charging pork
is tucked into the little slot at the
bottom of the phone along with the
circular vibrating motor and remember
that the battery gets tucked underneath
the charging port ribbon cable you don't
want to be pinching things that
shouldn't be pinched the bottom plastic
is pushed down over the charging port
and the two metal plates protecting
their ribbon connectors get set back
into place as well the metal plates are
important these are so that the
connections don't pop loose if you ever
drop your phone which does tend to
happen with almost everybody and we can
screw back in all of the screws it is
important to keep these organized during
the repair process since there are so
many of them quick note on the camera
lens we did discover it is made out of
glass in my last durability video and it
just rests inside of the black plastic
back if I find any replacement lenses I
will link them in a video description so
if yours breaks you can replace it and
that is it
everything should snap into place
relatively easily if you have to apply
too much force something isn't where it
needs to be and you should recheck all
of your connections let me know if you
have any questions in the comments let
me know a phone you want to see torn
down next I do read all of the comments
and the phones I see suggested most
often will definitely get the
jerry-rigged treatment thanks for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
