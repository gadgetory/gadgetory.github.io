this year the iPhone 10s and 10's max
which have already tested on my channel
and then six different flavors of this
guy the iPhone X are basically Apple's
budget phone with the price of a
flagship I asked on Twitter which color
of the iPhone 10 are I should test today
and it was a close call but the peachy
coral version was chosen as tribute
which is kind of good because our brand
new blue friend isn't even turning on
this morning he's got a little bit of
performance anxiety I'll plug him in and
we'll start with peachy let's get
started
inside the box we have the standard slow
charger along with the lightning
headphones that you can't use anywhere
else and the proprietary Lightning cord
with no dongle for the missing headphone
jack let's start with the scratch test
the one feature that gets used more than
anything else on a smart phone by far is
the screen the biggest downside of the
iPhone 10 are besides being a flagship
price budget phone is the screen there's
been a 1080p resolution standard across
computer screens TVs and cell phones for
the past three years staying healthy
even the iPhone 6 plus released four
years ago had a super defined 1080p
display but Apple here sneakily dropped
the iPhone 10 are from a high definition
1080p screen down to just 828 you can
always say iPhone users just don't
really care about specs but there's a
line that got crossed when Apple takes
advantage of that and keeps the high
price of $800 after tax while handing
out hardware from five years ago glass
is still glass though and scratches at
level six with deeper grooves at level
seven Apple's never been a leader in
screen resolution but going backwards in
technology is a slap in the face to
unsuspecting customers there's one seven
megapixel front facing camera hidden up
in the knotch
along with a metal earpiece grille very
solidly attached and will never be
coming out on its own another difference
between the 10 s and 10 arm is the build
material while the more expensive 10 s
is made from stainless steel the regular
expensive 10 R is made from softer
aluminum anodized aluminum anodizing is
a pretty amazing process where the metal
is dipped and electrically coated in a
super hard protective layer of oxide and
could literally be any color we want so
it makes the color matching look pretty
sweet even the SIM card tray with no
expandable memory slot got dipped in the
same anodizing bath the buttons are made
for metal along with the top of the
phone
and the new switch slider over here on
the side
I still think every phone should have
one of these switches the volume buttons
are made from metal and the bottom of
the phone right next to that missing
headphone jack is also metal the only
thing down here is the Lightning port
and the little metal grills for the loud
speaker and microphone the back of the
iPhone 10 R is made from glass still has
that wireless charging
I think the coloring is a great idea and
definitely adds a nice splash of
uniqueness to the smartphone world if
the Apple logo gently glowed from
notifications like it does on the razor
phone it would look even cooler the
flash is under the back glass and
protected along with the little wire
microphone grille which now brings us up
to the camera
Apple's cameras are incredibly good just
remember though that the screen on this
iPhone 10 R can't show all the pixels
your camera captures when you use it
kind of blows my mind let's say you take
a picture and post it to Instagram
Instagram publishes images and 1080
pixel blocks the iPhone XR is 252 pixels
short of that and literally can't show
Instagram pictures at full quality this
is an $800 phone that can't even social
media right not to mention Apple is
still advertising a sapphire lens cover
protecting the camera which should
scratch at level 8 or 9 on most scale of
hardness yet we are still seeing heavy
marks at level 6 7 &amp;amp; 8 other sapphire
manufacturers like this t so watch face
manage pure sapphire just fine the
Tissot sapphire has no scratches below a
level 8 it's kind of messed up that with
Apple you aren't getting what you pay
for on so many levels the phones are
very pretty though no doubt about that
but if all you want is just beautiful
surface level aesthetics or just want to
cover up the Apple logo just spend a few
dollars and slap a deep brand skin on
your current phone then use the rest of
the money you had saved to literally
book a round-trip ticket to Hawaii you
can get to Hawaii and back from
basically anywhere in the USA for the
price of this phone the inexpensive
skins are linked in the description
huge thanks to D brand for sponsoring
this video and inspiring colorful phones
everywhere not to mention if you
purchased basically any other phone in
the past three years you'll be able to
Instagram at full quality on your trip
you might be like but Jared what about
YouTube is the
YouTube apps still gonna work okay with
this lower resolution screen yeah it
works 720p is just fine it'll even
pretend to let you select 1080p and of
course the XR will use your data to
stream that 1080 into your phone but you
won't get the high definition displayed
on your screen the pixels just aren't
physically there to do it of course if
you see someone who has or loves this
phone there's no need to make fun of
them remember they are just 252 pixel
rows short of the full picture and not
quite all the way there hardware wise if
you catch my drift the iPhone 10 R is a
6.1 inch 8 28 by 1792 IPS LCD and lasted
10 seconds under the heat from my flame
going completely black and turning off
it's kind of a risk to burn pixels on
the 10 R when it doesn't have any
despair in the first place but they all
did make it back to life with the full
recovery now it's time for the bin test
Apple is using these stronger 7000
series aluminum on the iPhone 10 R so it
should be solid but the only way to find
out for sure is with a structural flex
bending from the front yielded no
movement in the phone no kinks in the
frame or bending in the body bending
from the back got the slightest of
flexes but nothing to get excited about
our little orange friend is built like a
solid and low resolution brick if Apple
charged 500 or maybe even 600 dollars
for this hardware I'd be pretty pumped
but charging 800 dollars after tax for
this is like robbing an old folks home
yeah it's easy and your targets won't
notice but it's just wrong
Apple didn't get to be a trillion dollar
company by selling stuff at a fair price
though so it is what it is the dinar is
structurally sound even if the Sapphire
isn't pure and the screen automatically
downgrades Instagram and YouTube it does
pass my durability test I'll probably
give away this unharmed blue iPhone 10
are over on my Twitter or Instagram so
come hang out over there for the
giveaway you can always sell it and buy
yourself a real phone customize your
current phone with a D brand link in the
description and thanks a ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
