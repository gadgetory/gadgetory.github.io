your life the title is not clickbait is
actually one of the coolest things I saw
CES is here from a company called stylus
not exactly sure where the Z comes from
but it is called stylus driving is
always dangerous accidents happen your
car could slip off the road and go into
water a river or a lake or there could
be a flood and the only problem with
that besides the fact that your car is
not a boat is that when your car is
underwater electronics and water don't
mix well together so your electronic
windows and doors will stop working this
car charger breaks windows automatically
and I'll show you how it works in
addition to the dual 2.4 amp USB quick
charge ports this car charger has a
built in seatbelt cutter and a
spring-loaded window breaker the razor
part is pretty self-explanatory
seatbelts can get damaged during car
accidents and stuck pinning you inside
of the vehicle which may or may not be
on fire the window breaker is actually
hidden pretty well inside of the car
charger most people never realize what
it is when it's plugged into your car
when the tip of the car charger is
pressed against the glass it will
compress a little bit loading an
internal spring and then firing this
metal spike violently through the tip
into the glass window with a very
concentrated force and since glass is
very brittle the whole thing will
shatter this is the internal spring and
the metal spike inside of the car
charger it's pretty magical and you
don't have to be strong to use it just
press down and it does all the work
itself so we've seen this little car
charger works on small little squares of
glass but does it actually work on a
real car window let's find out I haven't
had a spare car door here like everybody
does and we're going to set this out on
this window all right we have the car
door right here with a glass window on
this side and we have the car charger
right here we're going to come in and
we're going to press this up against the
glass on the inside of the window and
see what happens ready 3 2 1
crazy and at that point you can just
press it on the way out
lesson thing so that was your driver
side or passenger side window you would
be totally able to get out of your car
in an emergency now if you are
underwater in your car if you break your
window water's going to start rushing in
so there's no way to get out equaling
until the water has filled up the inside
of your car it will be like fighting a
waterfall so I'd sit there and be
patient while your car fills up with
water and then exit after that let's say
that you're in your car and you're in an
accident and the seat belt is jammed
you can't get out of your seat belt so
we have a little razor cutter on the tip
of that that I showed you earlier where
it's going to take it put the seat belt
in there we'll see if it cuts well oh
well that's actually easier than I
thought as long as there's tension on
the seat belt you can cut for usually
life-saving technology is my favorite
kind of technology and that's why I like
this so much at CES I'm going to put a
link for it down in the video
description right below this video so if
you want one of these in case you're
ever an emergency you can give thanks
dumb for watching up you around
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
