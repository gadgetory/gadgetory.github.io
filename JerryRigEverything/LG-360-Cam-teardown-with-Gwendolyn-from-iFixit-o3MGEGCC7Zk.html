and today I'm here to tear down the new
360 camera from LG creatively called the
LG 360 cam after removing the protective
plastic sheath you can see both 180
degree cameras on each side of the
device you'll need a t5 screwdriver to
remove the bottom two screws make sure
you've turned off the camera and remove
the SD card before pulling anything
apart once the screws are removed there
are two plastic shields leading up to
the two curved fisheye lenses each
shield is only held down with thin foam
adhesive so a little gentle prying along
the entire circular edge is all you need
to remove them now comes the fun part
removing the plastic housing only the
side of the camera without the shutter
button can be easily opened the shutter
button side of the camera is permanently
glued down after popping up the series
of clasp along the sides of the camera
housing the top plastic lifts off
exposing the internal components a
little removal of the protective tape
shows us where both of the individual
camera sensors are plugged in removing
the connectors is easy enough
they both unsnap just like a little Lego
after the sensor ribbons we can unsnap
the shutter and power button ribbon then
drop down to the USB type-c ribbon
connector and then the battery connector
on the opposite side each like their own
individual Lego there are three screws
holding down the main board to the frame
one at the bottom and two more at the
top of the board next to the dual
microphone holes once the mainboard is
out we can see the processor and the SD
card tray which is not replaceable now
let's see what the dual camera lenses
look like on the inside there's one
Phillips head screw on either side of
the first lens once those screws are out
both lenses can be removed
simultaneously each ribbon cable leads
up to its own sensor which sits under
the individual glass camera lens very
similar to how the GoPro 4 is built but
instead of one lens there are two and
instead of a 170 degree lens they are
both wider 180 degree lenses each lens
is softly adhered to the aluminum
bracket which is a secure mounting point
but also will help dissipate any heat
accumulated by the sensor the battery is
held in place by a plastic mid frame
after pulling out the mid frame
we can see the shutter button and the
power button on the rear housing we also
have the notification LEDs on the side
that let you know when the camera is on
and if you're using just one lens or
both lenses during recording the USB
type-c charging port itself is
replaceable we'll set this cute little
guy off to the side the 1200 milliamp
hour battery is adhered gently to the
mid frame but luckily it can easily be
separated the nice thing about this
camera is that almost every single
component is modular and can be replaced
while replacement parts will probably be
hard to find since the camera is not
extraordinarily popular you'll always
have the option of taking two broken
cameras with different issues and
frankensteining them together to make
one working unit thanks AK for letting
us see inside the LG 360 cam if you like
