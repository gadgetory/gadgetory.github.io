broken I'm as far as getting that bolt
off it's pretty rusted on there as you
can kind of see there's a lot of rust
underneath this vehicle so basically I
have is I have the two arms the two
wrenches are on either side of the bowl
21 millimeters and I have this one
connected to that bullet right there
where it's just kind of just leaning up
against the top and so as I spin this
one that one holds the other bolt steady
like as you can I like this one you can
see they both move to get them both
started I attached a wrench to the other
end of this one to kind of give me more
leverage on the whole thing see if I can
get a good shot of that if you take two
wrenches and put them like this it gives
you one extra freakin long wrench so I
got like probably little more than
almost three feet of wrench there that I
can put a whole lot of torque on the end
of that bolt
who needs power tools around all right
much same concept the other side just
get one bolt on one wrench on one side
one runs on the other and just kind of
twist them off using the same techniques
and get two wrenches attached to each
other one wrench propped up against like
the axle or something like that what I'm
doing right now is I got it pretty much
loosened up so I'm just holding both
wrenches and then twisting them opposite
directions to kind of get the bolt off
the rest of the way all right so now our
take on the upper control arm this one
it's just as broken as the other one
just killer rusted clear through so I
got my one 15 millimeter wrench attach
that in
same little you know contraption to make
the wrench longer you can see as I pull
on the bottom and very the getting some
pull it in there there we go there we go
ingenuity at its finest
okay so right now working off the upper
control arm it's a relatively simple
same concept just a metal rod with the
bushing in it I'm is the one I'm taking
apart right now the one that's been
snapped off so you can see right there
there's a star bolt on the side it's
using one of these fits to get off this
one right here is 80/50 I believe if
it's a 250 and then the nut on the other
side is a 15 so just you know put the
wrench on one end and the other end I'm
being careful with the t-50 bolt so I'm
not really ratcheting from that end I'm
just kind of holding it tight with the
river with a wrench
that's about it with this one for the
top control arm on the passenger side
inside the wheel well there's a hole
right there with a bolt in it and that
bolt is a 15 millimeter and it is
connected to the top control arm where
is that guy it's up in there so it's a
15 on both sides it looks like okay
really pretty cool stuff shot here these
anyway I'm trying to install the new arm
here underneath the deep on the back
axle what I've done is the arm itself is
because the old arm was completely
broken in half the Jeep isn't completely
in alignment
I can't line up that hole it was a
little bit worse before but I rigged
this contraption up or I took a one of
these ties and wrapped it around the
axle and put the other end on the frame
here
probably not the smartest I did have it
next to my jacks down but I feel like
it's pretty solid anyway every time I
click this I'll show ya two might click
it that lines up there we go so now I'm
able to put the bolt in this end and the
other bolts already and the other end so
that's how to realign it and get the
holes all together simplest way okay so
we doing this um I would I would suggest
keeping one side of the arms on the
vehicle that way you can always have a
reference point on when you're putting
the arm in on the bushing there's two
sides to it there's the one side with a
little lip right here and then the other
side without a lip over here on this
side the lip always goes towards the
inside of the vehicle when you're doing
the upper arm has a bracket on it and
the bracket always goes to the inside of
the vehicle so keep that in mind as far
as the bolt goes a little bit of
wiggling around and prying we can get
that thing all the way in there so okay
so the bolts in just make sure that the
nut is on the outside of the vehicle and
the actual bolt head on the inside what
I'm doing is I'm just barely putting the
nut on the other side of these bolts so
I have a little bit of playroom if I
need to adjust anything for the top bar
so right now I'm going to go ahead and
do the other bottom bracket and then do
the top two after the bottom ones are
done
cashing these is a sunset
anyway with the back bar I still had to
use the same tie down contraption to get
the axial twist in the right way the
back pole I'm the nut is still facing
the outside of the vehicle at the top
hold the nut goes on the inside because
the exhaust here gets in the way of the
bowl sliding in anyway it was pretty
simple they're not getting the axle in
the right spot to get that bolt through
otherwise it's pretty easy so the top
bar on the passenger side was giving me
a whole lot of issues it was kinked so I
couldn't get this bolt out at the star
bolt on that side I started to strip so
I'm just kind of kind of frustrating but
and I couldn't get the top end out to
straighten it out because of the sway
bar was in the way sorry these camera
angles are not very good anyway so I'm
going to town on it with a hacksaw and
cut it in half so hopefully now I'll be
able to make some progress on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
