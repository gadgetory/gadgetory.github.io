from last year's model – and not all of
them for the better.
I got my hands on the Kinda Blue color, and
included in the box we have the USB-C adapter
and a dongle for those of you who like to
complicate your music listening experience.
I'll talk more about this in a second, but
first, it's time to see how Google's new flagship
and the theoretical king of all Android phones
handles a durability test.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
I've tested over 70 different phones now on
my channel, and most phones survive my tests.
It's kind of fun to see how the different
brands stack up next to each other and see
how each phone will hold up over the years
as you own it.
The scratch test is first.
I have a set of mineral picks that show us
what the screen is made out of.
A plastic display, like the Galaxy Active
series would scratch at a level 3.
This display is Gorilla Glass 5, so we should
see scratching start at a level 6 with a deeper
groove at a level 7.
A pure sapphire screen like the HTC U Ultra
sapphire edition would scratch at a level
8.
The Pixel 2 scores the exact same as the iPhone
8 and the Galaxy S8 on the display scratch
test – scratching at a level 6.
Down at the bottom of the screen, embedded
in the bezel, is a large speaker grill for
the front firing speakers.
This grill is made from metal, which is a
step up from the white cloth grill of the
original Pixel last year.
The earpiece up at the top is built the exact
same way.
The grill sits pretty flush with the glass,
so keeping it clean will be fairly easy.
Remember that speakers have magnets in them
which attract metal shavings which can destroy
speaker cones.
So if you work around metal, keep your phone
clear of those shavings.
The front 8 megapixel camera is embedded under
the same slab of Gorilla Glass 5, so it's
protected against scratching.
Something that is not impervious to scratching
though is the back of the phone.
It's kind of interesting to note that the
word “Pixel” is actually derived from
the words “Picture Element.”
Each individual pixel is just a small piece
of the puzzle.
You might have noticed that there's no metal
on metal scratching sound that we've all come
to love and enjoy during our Class with Jerry,
and that's because it's not metal that your
skin is touching while holding the phone.
On their website, Google has it worded as
a “water-resistant metal unibody,” giving
the vibe that you'll be touching metal.
Most people probably missed it during the
keynote as well where they clarified it a
little bit more: “The all aluminum body
with a premium hybrid coating gives it a sleek
and clean profile.”
Their all aluminum body has a premium hybrid
coating, which is what you see scraping off
here.
There is metal, that you can see under the
coating, but that's not what your hand is
touching.
To me, the Pixel does not have the cold hard
feel of metal, which is fine, I'm not opposed
to plastic phones, it's just interesting that
Google can't decide what to call it either.
They've said “metal,” “hybrid coating,”
and then here deep in the text specs on their
website they call it paint, and that it may
chip if the phone is dropped.
And also that leather or denim may transfer
color onto the phone body.
So it will be interesting to see if you can
actually carry this phone in your pocket or
not; a case or skin might be mandatory.
The volume rocker is made from metal, but
the colored button you see on this Kinda Blue
version is made from plastic.
We haven't seen plastic buttons on a phone
for a while now.
Once again, plastic isn't bad, it's just nice
to know where it's at.
Plastic does tend to warp more than metal
does over time though.
If you remember as I mentioned earlier, plastic
scratches at a level 3 on Mohs Scale of Hardness,
and that's exactly what we're seeing here
on the Pixel 2.
It's pretty much the exact same situation
as the LG G5 a few years ago.
And my thoughts are that if it feels like
plastic, why not just own it and make the
phone plastic.
Solid plastic wouldn't chip off or absorb
colors like paint will.
And it could also include wireless charging,
which this phone does not have.
The fingerprint is the same color as the back
panel, but it has the same problem as the
LG V30 durability test where scratching the
sensor renders is inoperable.
The Pixel 2 tells me the sensor is dirty and
that I need to clean it.
Most phones still function with a scratched
sensor, but this phone does not.
Up here at the top of the phone we have our
single color LED flash covered in plastic.
The plastic over the flash is normal.
The camera lens is made from glass which is
great.
I also like how the lens itself is not attached
to the back glass panel.
So if the phone is dropped, which does happen,
the back glass housing might crack, but the
camera lens itself is more likely to remain
intact and undamaged, protected inside it's
metal housing.
Thumbs up for that design change.
I was able to switch out the back glass on
the original Pixel to allow for other color
combinations, and I'll attempt that again
with the Pixel 2.
The easiest way to get the color you want
and protect your phone is with a skin.
The Pixel XL white and black Panda edition
is sold out for weeks – currently you have
to sit on a waiting list.
This Reverse Panda from dbrand looks pretty
sweet, but the color options are pretty much
limitless.
I'll toss a link in the description so you
can go create your own combo.
And thanks to dbrand for sponsoring this video.
One of my biggest pet peeves with the Google
Pixel 2 is that the whole premise behind Android
is that it can accomplish more than other
operating systems.
Remember that iconic commercial from 8 years
ago...
“Droid Does.”
But yet here we have a phone directly from
Google with Google's operating system, and
it's plugging along with the bare minimum
features of last year's iPhone 7...which isn't
terrible, because iPhones are normally 2 or
3 years behind Androids as it is...no wireless
charging, no second camera, no headphone jack,
bare minimum ip67 water-resistance compared
to LG and Samsung's 68 level, and no expandable
memory – seriously might as well just buy
an iPhone at this point.
Droid does, but this phone does not.
Google just built a phone that goes against
everything Android used to stand for.
I did draw a pumpkin though, so that's kind
of cool.
Here's the SIM card tray with no SD card slot.
And all the sides of the phone are coated
in that same hybrid paint.
It does feel good, don't get me wrong, but
if you want metal, this isn't it.
It might feel as though I'm roasting the Google
Pixel a little during this video, and you're
right, they are getting a little burned at
the moment.
I feel like the king of Android phones should
be leading the pack.
And even if we are reaching the end of the
headphone jack era, that's still no reason
to not include the plethora of other features
that this phone lacks.
It took about 15 seconds for the OLED display
of the Pixel 2 to turn white and turn off
and never recover.
That's 5 seconds longer than the LG V30 yesterday,
but the V30 slaughters the Pixel in every
other aspect spec-wise.
And finally, adding injury to insult, we have
the bend test.
The very first flex splits the back housing
of the phone completely down the side.
Looking closely we can see that Google put
an antenna line at the historically weakest
point on every cell phone.
This is where the iPhone 6 bent.
This is also where the Nexus 6P snapped in
half.
And Google decided to make the weak spot even
weaker with a plastic antenna line, right
in the middle of the metal frame – I'm not
sure why.
This phone is definitely not skinny jean approved.
And we also just lost all the water-resistance
of the phone, not that ip67 was much to brag
about in the first place.
Bending from the other side of the phone is
quite a bit more sturdy, and the phone does
still function.
It's not catastrophically damaged so it won't
end up on my Shelf of Shame, but still, not
impressive.
Not only might it absorb the color from your
denim jeans, it could crack if you sit on
the frame.
I'd say a case or skin is mandatory this time
around, especially if you want the phone to
last a few years.
Remember, I'm a hardware guy.
I'll leave the software to other reviewers,
but as for me and myself, I'll be sticking
with a feature-rich Android phone that can
do more.
I'll be voting with my wallet, and this phone
is not for me.
Do you care about the features that Google
left out?
