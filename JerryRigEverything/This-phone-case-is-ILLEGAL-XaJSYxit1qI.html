the product I'm reviewing today is
illegal in Hawaii Massachusetts New
Jersey New York and Rhode Island but
it's still pretty interesting let's get
started
on my channel I've talked a lot about
protection for phones today we're gonna
talk about personal protection using a
stun gun case for your iPhone this
particular case can protect your phone
obviously it's also a power bank and it
has seven million volts of stun gun
protection which is pretty crazy so this
particular case is the teal case and
just out of the box it is super super
thick and check out this warning this
product can cause severe injury or
potentially death read user manual for
use never leave unattended around minors
it's probably pretty important only use
if you are in serious danger I like that
they mentioned check your local laws
before carrying a stun gun because these
are illegal in several states like I
mentioned earlier but like always on my
channel we test a lot of different
things and so we're gonna test out the
features of this stun gun and then take
it apart and see how it works
comes with a screen protector and the
case is detachable which is kind of cool
I'll go ahead and slide my pristine
condition iPhone 8 inside of this case
and slip it into the housing and it
should start charging so I press this
button on the back twice and these LEDs
lit up and now the phone itself is
charging up here in the top corner so
that part of this case actually works oh
yeah and there is the stun gun that is
pretty scared okay so in order to
activate the stun gun part of it there's
actually two safeguards so it first of
all I have to flip this switch right
here up and then I also have to slide
these metal prongs out the top of the
phone which then releases the 7 million
volts of electricity through those two
points one thing that I should mention
is that when you do switch into taser
mode it does stop charging your phone so
you can't defend yourself physically
Walter
your phone at the same time no
multitasking going on either zapping
people or charging your phone you got to
pick one or the other so even though
that there is seven million volts
pulsing through these two needle-like
connections at the tip it's not the
voltage that kills you there's not a
whole lot of amperage flowing through
with those volts so technically I should
be fine zapping myself but remember this
is illegal in quite a few states so
let's see what happens I don't want to
do this boy oh boy okay
so I am in okay I'm gonna do this time
so right now we are locked into taser
mode with the safeguard the metal prongs
are stuck up oh I could feel it like oh
the way through my fingertips like it
made my fingertips curl at the very end
and I could feel it probably on getting
goosebumps over my whole arm I could
feel it all throughout this range right
here that was so crazy okay let's not do
that again no I vote we opened this
thing up see what the external batteries
like inside and see how these prongs of
doom extrude from the case each time
batteries and electric cars have been on
my mind a lot lately after listening to
a book on Elon Musk by Ashley Vance
audible is kind of my way of
productively filling my time while
driving or traveling one of alongs
quotes that stood out to me the most is
if other people are putting in 40-hour
work weeks and you're putting in 100
hour weeks then even if you are doing
the same thing you will achieve in four
months what it takes them a year to
achieve it's pretty motivating stuff
audible is one of my ways of motivating
myself to become a better person audible
is giving out a free audiobook with 30
day trial membership so if you don't
know who Ilan is now would be a good
time to check him out just go to
audible.com slash jerry-rigged or even
text the word jerry-rigged to five
hundred five hundred to get that free
book je r ry r IG and thanks to audible
for supporting my content and sponsoring
this video so like I mentioned earlier
this does have an external battery
charger as well like it charges your
phone while you're using it and is
charged with a micro USB port that
charges this battery right here which is
a 3,800 milliamp hour and then
there that goes into the proprietary
lightning port that Apple uses with all
their phones so I'm going to disconnect
that proprietary lightning port so
obviously a normal battery can't produce
seven million volts so there has to be a
couple other components inside of here
that do that so a transformer can step
up the voltage to that seven million we
were talking about and all of that
circuitry is probably inside of this box
right here there also could be an
oscillator that fluctuates the current
and produces that buzzing noise you hear
on the back and a capacitor which
actually stores the electricity and
releases it in that pulse pattern all of
that happens inside of this box here
while sending it out of the electrodes
up at the top and the electrodes can
slide in and out just like that it's a
pretty sweet setup at risk of getting
shocked again I vote we take apart this
component because this is the part that
most cell phone cases don't have but it
looks like we can't get inside because
it is a solid block of plastic I imagine
this is where we stick the transformers
the oscillator and the capacitors that
allow the electrodes to zap someone so
there is no taking this apart because it
is a solid block of plastic overall this
is a pretty interesting device I've
never seen something quite like this
that me know protects you physically as
well as your electronics now as far as
the damage it can inflict it was more of
a I would say like a distraction for me
getting zapped was a surreal experience
and like you know I definitely don't
want it to happen again but it wasn't
like an immobilization thing like I was
able to use my hand right afterward to
be honest it was the sound that was
mostly the deterrent that sound coming
from the voltage off of these electrodes
made me not want to come anywhere near
those two points so that's what it would
be the biggest deterrent if I was a
thief and I was gonna go rob somebody
just saying I'll leave a link for all
this stuff down in the video description
and make sure you check out audible for
your free book it is a service that I
use regularly audible.com slash
jerry-rigged let me know if you want to
get zapped by seven million volts down
in the comments and thanks a ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
