between the huawei p9 and the Galaxy s7
edge this has been one of my most
requested phones for a while now
so I figured I'd give it a shot so what
sets this phone apart from most of the
other smartphones well the first fact is
that it has dual camera lenses so let me
talk about that for just a second so the
lens on the left is a monochrome lens
that only takes black-and-white pictures
and the lens on the right is a color
lens that takes color pictures and
hypothetically speaking when you take a
picture that combines the images from
both lens into one picture or one image
so that you get more detail in it the
phone also has Leica printed on it
Leica is known for being a very
expensive but quality camera company so
always always been a little creative
with the wording on their advertising in
the past they said that the Nexus 6p had
a solid metal body which turned out not
to be true they've also inferred that an
image taken with a four thousand dollar
DSLR camera was from this phone they
posted that to their Google+ page I'll
put a link down in the video description
for that fiasco once there was proof
that the image was taken from a DSLR
camera they retracted their statement
took down the image and issued an
apology but you know the proof is there
they are creative with their advertising
so let's do a camera test between the
Galaxy s7 edge and the Huawei p9 we'll
put them side-by-side and test and see
if the images are really coming from
both lenses at the same time there's
only one way to find out so both these
cameras are mounted in the same rig so
hold them equally as I'm walking around
and both phones are fully updated so the
p9 was released a couple months ago so
always had plenty of chances to update
their cameras to get them optimized and
functioning at the top quality so we're
going to start off by recording in 4k
the Huawei p9 does not do 4k it only
shoots in 1080p so the video size is
actually four times smaller than what
can be produced with the galaxy s7 so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
upscale the image on the wall way p9 to
4k so that the images will be the same
size I'm not going to lower the quality
on the galaxy s7 to 1080p because I
don't want to cripple the test and use
less power than what the phone is
capable of doing because this video is
going to be rendered in 4k so now that
both
images are the same size I'm going to do
a walking test the galaxy s7 does have
oh is optical image stabilization the
Huawei p9 does not have oh is which
means that there is no camera gimbal
inside of the phone compensating
physically for the image both phones do
have a is and I'll show you that in a
minute
so the Huawei p9 is supposed to be
really good with close-up shots so I now
have this both cameras focused in on
this white ball right here you can see
how well the macro shots do so I just
draw both phones down to 1080p right now
the electronic image stabilization is
not enabled so it's just using the OIS
stabilization I'm going to shake the
cameras a little bit and now I'm going
to enable the EIS on top of the oh is
now the E is the electronic image
stabilization is turned on on both
phones so I'm going to try walking again
remember now both phones are filming in
1080p I drop the Galaxy s7 edge down to
1080p from 4k will do a slow pan in
1080p bring up the sky do a little Sun
flare you can also check the white
balance with the clouds see how the
colors contrast with each other so one
thing that I really like about filming
in 4k is the ability to zoom in on
things I'm going to do a little
freeze-frame and zoom in on that sign
remember that the p9 is filming in 1080p
which is the max resolution and the
galaxy s7 edge is filming in 4k which is
the max resolution that it has and it
has four times as many pixels as 1080p
so you can zoom in quite a bit farther
so right now I want to do a little test
with the camera lenses themselves so
like I mentioned before there's two
lenses one with a black sensor and one
with a color sensor so if I put my
finger over one lens right now is over
the color sensor the black and white
image should still be showing if it's
using both lenses at the same time now
I'm going to take my finger and put it
over the black and
my twins and while I'm just watching the
footage on the phone my finger is
completely covering up the black and
white lens right now the image is not
changing now it is uncovered and covered
uncovered and covered so it looks like
that black and white lens isn't doing
anything at all while the phone is
recording in 1080p
that's unfortunate I'm going to take
some still images as well this picture
is with both lenses uncovered and this
picture is with the black and white
sensor covered let me know down in the
comments below what you think is that
black and white sensor doing anything to
this image quality now the phone can
also take monochrome pictures which are
black and white pictures using just one
lens but that's an independent setting
on the camera that I had to go into and
enable and that turns off the color lens
altogether before we go any farther what
the heck is this it's pretty gutsy of a
smartphone manufacturer to watermark
every single picture you take luckily
there is an option to disable this
wonderful feature but seriously this is
the equivalent of this Huawei has had
some real crappy ideas so right now
we're filming in slow motion the Huawei
p9 can shoot in 120 frames per second
and 720p the galaxy s7 shoots and 240
frames per second at 720p we'll also
check the bitrate as well
so let's try out the front-facing
cameras for a second galaxy s7 shoots in
quad HD which is quite a bit bigger than
the 1080p that the Huawei p9 is shooting
it so there's a lot more pixels to work
with when you're shooting so check out
the depth of the image like see how far
back the quality goes behind me as well
as the color balance the white balance
all the quality that cameras can have so
which camera do you think is better the
Huawei p9 or the galaxy s7 edge do you
think both lenses are being used at the
same time or is the Leica name and the
dual camera just a bunch of marketing
shenanigans let me know down in the
comments below I have a ton of other
camera comparisons you can watch I will
leave that playlist down in the video
description as well hit that thumbs up
button if you enjoyed this test and
