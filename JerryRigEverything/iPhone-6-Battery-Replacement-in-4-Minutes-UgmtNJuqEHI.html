to replace the battery in your iPhone 6. If
you want to watch any of these other repair
videos, go ahead and click the links in that
menu. Here's the iPhone 6. We're going to
go ahead and turn it off and then we're going
to take out the bottom screws. They're a Pentalobe
screw, and if you don't have a Pentalobe screwdriver
go ahead and check the video description,
I'll link some tools and replacement parts
there for you. Take a suction cup and lift
up on the screen just a little bit, and then
you can take a pry tool, metal or plastic,
and lift up on the metal frame of the screen
itself, so you don't bend it too much. Because
if you bend the screen, it's going to crack,
and then you have a much more expensive repair.
Lift the screen up, and then you are going
to want to remove the screen for this. So
there's five screws on this metal plate. Remove
the metal plate. Because you get a little
aggressive when you're trying to pull the
battery out of the phone. Because of the way
it's glued down. Anyway, there's four little
ribbing cables, just kind of like little LEGOs,
that you unsnap from the main board. So lift
those off and then the screen comes loose
from the phone. Once again, replacement parts
are in the video description. You can check
those out. Now the battery is held down by
one little ribbing cable. It's underneath
this metal plate, so take off those two screws
and remove the metal plate. And then unclip
the little battery connector right here. Now
this is the part where it gets a little bit
harder. The battery is glued inside of the
phone so you want to warm up the phone a little
bit from the back. Do it long enough that
the heat seeps through and gets through the
glue, so do it for probably, you know, a minute
or two. But don't let the phone get too hot
so you can't touch it anymore because at that
point you'll start damaging components. So
just warm up the phone long enough to melt
the glue in the back. Anyway, I'm not going
to edit any part of this out, I'm just going
to speed it up a little bit so you can see
how hard it is to get the battery out. You
want to pry up but just make sure you don't
pry it against anything important or slip
too far underneath the battery or you might
slice some of the ribbing cables that go to
the volume buttons or the power buttons. So
just kind of wedge it under there and then
pry up a little bit. But be super careful.
Still just lifting the battery up, there's
an incredible amount of glue under here. It
gets kind of ridiculous at this point. Try
to leave as much glue inside of the phone
as possible. That way, you don't have to reuse
any sticky tape, you can just reuse the same
glue again. Anyway, now that the glue is unstuck
from the battery you can check out this identity
crisis. It says 6.91 and 7.01 on the batteries.
I guess Apple couldn't make up their mind
on how big the battery itself was. Anyway
if your glue is still in there you can reuse
it, otherwise grab some double sided sticky
tape and just stick it back down. Make it
enough that the battery doesn't shift around
while you're using your phone or while it's
in your pocket. Go ahead and rip off the back
of the sticky tape. And then plug the battery
back in, and then set the battery back into
its little slot. I plug it in first just so
it's lined up with the connection points.
Now I'm going to put the metal bracket back
on along with the two little screws. And then
I can plug in the screen again. Each of these
little connectors are going to snap in just
like a little LEGO piece. Just work your way
down and then get this last one right here
for the front camera. And then screw in that
metal plate with the five screws again. Anyway,
pretty straightforward, fold the screen down.
You're going to want to line up the top of
the screen with the phone first, making sure
it's flush, and then you can kind of just
pinch your way down the sides of the phone
snapping it back into place. But if the top
isn't lined up, the connections aren't going
to be lined up either. Get the two screens
in the bottom there, and there you go. If
you have any questions, make sure to leave
them in the comments, don't forget to like
if this video helped you, and don't forget
to subscribe. It does mean a lot. Hope to
see you around.
