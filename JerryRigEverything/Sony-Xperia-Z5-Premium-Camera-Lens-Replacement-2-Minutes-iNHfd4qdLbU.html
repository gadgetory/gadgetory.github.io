replace the camera lens in the sony
xperia z5 premium the nice thing about
having a plastic camera lens is that
it's probably not going to shatter or
crack like a glass lens would but it
does get scratched up and once it starts
affecting your pictures it's time for a
replacement the hardest part about this
whole project is going to be replacing
the back it is made of glass in order to
remove it we have to soften the glue
underneath the back glass cover I use a
heat gun you can also use your sister's
hair dryer and that warms up the glue
and softens it enough to remove the back
panel I'm using a thin metal pry tool to
cut the adhesive around the edge there
are these pull tabs underneath the back
cover and it's actually a lot easier to
use the pull tabs lift up the top of the
back panel and then you can grab the
edge of the pull tab and pull it out
along the side of the device releasing
the back panel easier than prying it out
all along the edge hindsight is
twenty-twenty here's the camera lens
itself on the back panel make sure you
don't touch the actual lens of the
camera that's attached to the
motherboard or your pictures will be
blurry later on I'm going to use a
bonafide hardware camera lens because
these lenses are plastic bonafide
hardware also ships with plastic lens
they are the original parts now to
remove the lens you can take a razor
blade and slide it around the adhesive
it is held on pretty tight but if you
add a little heat it'll fall apart
faster than Hillary Clinton's deceitful
presidential campaign so here's the new
lens it does come with some adhesive
along the front side of it I'm going to
remove the protection on the front side
and then drop it down into the back
panel the more glue residue that you
remove the more flush it will sit with
the back panel once it's installed I'm
going to press it down into place making
sure the adhesive has a firm grasp along
the back and then remove the protection
along the back make sure you don't get
any fingerprints on the inside of the
lens it's really hard to clean off once
you have it installed on the foam and
there you have it installed on the back
panel you can follow Hillary's example
and just wipe it with a cloth to clean
off any fingerprints I am going to add a
little bit of adhesive on the inside of
the back panel to secure it if you're
going to be using your phone for a while
after this lens replacement I would
recommend buying some professional
adhesive it only costs a dollar or two
and I will link that down in the video
description below along with the
replacement parts time to test out the
camera everything works perfect you have
any questions leave them down in the
comments I do respond fairly regularly
