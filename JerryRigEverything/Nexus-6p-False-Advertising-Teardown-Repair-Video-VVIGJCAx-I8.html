matte gold Nexus 6p s from Huawei I'll
give you a little color comparison
between the aluminum matte gold and
graphite which color do you think looks
best let me know down in the comments I
think we can all agree this is a pretty
darn good looking phone this particular
teardown video is going to be focusing
purely from a hardware perspective
we're going to start by turning the
phone off removing the SIM card and
heating up the back glass now to remove
the back glass I'd say you have a 50/50
shot of getting it off in one piece i
heated it up until it was too hot to
touch with just my fingers and then
tried to slide a brand new sharp razor
blade between the bottom edge of the
lens in the glass itself turns out the
glue held onto the lens pretty darn
tight and it ended up coming off in
chunks instead of one piece I tried it
again successfully with my graphite
Nexus 6p and it worked perfect I've seen
some other guys come at it from the far
right side but either way if you fail
and the lens cracks the replacement part
is only twenty dollars right now and I
foresee it dropping as low as five or
ten dollars in the near future I will
link the replacement camera lenses in
the video description for those of you
who need them same thing goes for the
bottom panel heat it up and pull it away
from the phone for the next step you
will need a screwdriver I will link
replacement tools down in the video
description along with the parts there
are four screws at the bottom and two
screws hidden underneath that glass
panel at the top to pull the screen out
from the body of the phone you can slide
your metal pry tool between the edge of
the aluminum and the plastic frame of
the screen and just lift it out as we
pull the front panel away from the phone
we are left with the machined aluminum
back now the center of the phone here is
aluminum and the edges but a large chunk
of the phone at the top and the bottom
of the back is pure plastic all the way
through normally I would not care if
manufacturer did this the aluminum
plastic hybrid is still relatively
sturdy but here on Google's website it
says all housed in a contoured aluminum
body but wait there's more an all-metal
design there is not a single screw in
this phone that goes from metal to metal
as a matter of fact the six most
important exterior screws of this phone
go directly from plastic to plastic it
says the phone is crafted with
aeronautical grade aluminum and indeed
the aluminum is there but it's
definitely not structurally benefitting
the phone in any way I feel like this is
classic corporate bait-and-switch
advertising from Huawei but let's
continue with the teardown there's one
screw next to this metal plate we're
going to lift that off and unsnap this
extension ribbon cable from the bottom
this is what leads down to the charging
port there's one signal wire here as
well we're going to lift off and one
screw holding the charging port down
here's a charging port itself it does
have one microphone on the back here is
the battery ribbon cable now to get the
battery you have to be pretty darn
careful with it you don't want to slice
the battery at all if you slice the
battery it ends up smelling like burnt
skittles and will damage the phone make
sure you do not damage the screen ribbon
cable underneath the battery either here
is the loudspeaker be gentle with those
two contact points on the side there if
those rip off your loudspeaker will not
work anymore here are a few of the
dovetail joints that I've mentioned in a
couple of my previous videos you can see
here how thick the aluminium is and how
small of a contact point that the
plastic screw connections have with the
aluminum mid frame there's two screws
here the metal plate that hold down the
headphone jack and the front camera
here's the front camera it's an 8
megapixel here's the headphone jack
interesting little guy it has a funky
rubber hat on it for some reason go
ahead and put his hat back on there's
two screws here that hold down the
ribbon cable for the screen going to pop
off that connector and then lift up the
screen ribbon cable just like a little
Lego unsnap the other side of the signal
wire one more screw holding down the
motherboard then we can snap the
motherboard out from the frame here's a
few more of those dovetail joints that
hold the aluminum part of the phone to
the plastic part of the phone we are
facing cameras here has a relatively
interesting design twelve point three
megapixels and it has that little
plastic bit right there on the ribbon
cable the camera self sits right in
between the motherboard so that little
clear plastic piece is to help support
the ribbon cable of the camera so it
doesn't get or bend the fingerprint
scanner is also replaceable now here is
the screen this particular component has
the glass the AMOLED and the frame of
the screen all attached as one and this
would be the ideal part to buy if you
can find it I will link these down the
video description below if they're
available usually manufacturers sell the
glass and the AMOLED as one component
and then you have to use a bunch of heat
to separate the screen from the frame of
the screen usually the display in this
case the amulet will not survive the
replacement process so your new screen
has to work when you re adhere it on to
the frame of the screen and then install
it back into the phone so try to buy it
with the frame and intact with the
screen go ahead and set the motherboard
back into place get the headphone jack
with as little hat slip that down in
with the front camera there's two screws
holding that metal plate down
snap the AMOLED screen ribbon cable into
the motherboard same thing with this
little wire connector and then tuck it
down to the side so it doesn't get
pinched anywhere there's one screw
holding the loudspeaker in place set
that down charging port goes in one
screw at the top of that as well
same little signal wire cable pinch that
down and tuck it into the plastic frame
the extension ribbon cable goes from the
charging port to the motherboard two
screws holding down that metal bracket
and then tuck the other side of this
bracket in next to the fingerprint
scanner and then get that screw into the
side and then there's one more screw at
the left side of the motherboard get
that in and then test the screen before
you put it back inside the back housing
to make sure everything works don't want
to do more work than we have to then you
can set the whole screen contraption and
motherboard down into the aluminum
plastic hybrid back and then snap it
down into place two screws up along the
top and you can use the adhesive that
comes with the piece of glass mine still
has adhesive on it so I'm just going to
press it down into place worked out
pretty well have any questions leave
them down in the comments don't forget
to like if this video helped you there's
four screws down along the bottom as
well
and don't forget to subscribe speaking
from a purely structural hardware
perspective this phone is not all that
it's cracked up to be
and I'm pretty disappointed in the
overall design let me know what you
think in the comments like always
subscribe and follow me on Twitter and
Instagram for behind the scenes pictures
and plenty more tech tear downs thanks
for watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
