translucent back to HTC u12 plus its had
a rough day its buttons have come off
and it's bent out of shape but I found a
nifty little trick using my metal
tweezers I apply pressure to both sides
of the missing power button hole and it
allows me to turn the phone off which is
important for a teardown then the back
panel lifts up and away from the phone
body normally unless you want to
drastically flex your phone in half you
should use heat and a thin metal pry
tool to remove the back I'll use a
plastic pry tool to unplug the
fingerprint scanner ribbon cable and the
translucent blue glass is released
entirely from the phone it has that
gradient effect going on where it's more
clear in the center than it is on the
outside this gives us a pretty good look
underneath the glass into the phone and
it seriously looks awesome HTC has added
a decorative loincloth over the battery
with a nice printed circular design this
is just a decoration and has no
functional value the NFC is functional
though and that wraps around the upper
half of the phone above the plastic
there are eight normal Phillips head
screws holding that top plastic in place
I'll remove those screws and pull it
away from the phone it has the gold
contact pads on the back that allowed
the NSC to communicate with the
motherboard the next thing is to remove
the decently sized 3500 milliamp hour
battery unclipping the lego-like battery
connector from the motherboard along
with both of the charging port extension
ribbons thankfully the whole battery can
pull out and away from the phone body
not a whole lot of effort is needed no
magic pull tabs which is totally fine
as long as that adhesive doesn't have a
death grip another thing that's
removable is the SIM card tray which
conveniently has an expandable memory SD
card slot bonus points for that
the little ribbons at the corner of the
motherboard are for the super annoying
pressure sensors along each side of the
phone I'll show you more of these in a
second the middle orange ribbon is for
the display and then we have the other
pressure-sensitive ribbon that includes
the power and volume buttons over here
before we get a good look at those
strips though we have to remove the
motherboard
I'll pull off these little black wire
cables all of this might seem kind of
complicated but this is nothing compared
to how an organized HTC used to be HTC's
older phones were more unorganized than
Picasso and a paper shredder
and clipped the dual front-facing
cameras and pulled the motherboard out
from the frame little guy is built
simple enough it does have dual rear
cameras plugged into the back each with
their own Lego style connector the
normal 12 megapixel camera comes with oh
is but the two times zoom lens does not
have any Hardware stabilization
electronic maybe but nothing that's
visible from the outside
HTC does always have to stick some weird
stuff in their design like this dual LED
flash on its own removable ribbon cable
it's probably built this way so that it
would line up dead center on the back
panel between the camera lenses but it
still kind of feels like HTC forgot
about it and had to add it back in last
minute i reattached both rear cameras
into the motherboard like little Legos
and HTC is actually one of the first
companies to put four cameras into a
smart phone huge thumbs up for
innovation but my favorite was two years
ago back with the HTC ten when they
added optical Hardware stabilization to
the front-facing camera which was also a
first this year that front stabilization
is no more but we have two identical
eight megapixel cameras now win some
lose some down at the bottom of the
phone we have these six Phillips head
screws holding the loudspeaker and
charging port I'll remove the top
plastics and would you look at that
instead of a circular coin vibrator like
we've seen in the past on HTC phones
they're using a rectangular taptic
engine like we saw inside of the pixel -
and basically all of the iPhones some
people really care about their
vibrations and taptic motors are top of
the line for vibrator fanatics
loudspeaker comes out next this is one
of the two stereo speakers HTC counts
the earpiece as the second one it has
the same gold contact pads on the back
for communicating with the phone
and finally the charging port super tiny
little guy with a blue rubber ring
around the tip to help with that ip68
water resistance rating inside the phone
it's fun that HTC has accessorized their
internal coloring with the blueness of
the back glass panel now let's talk
about one of the biggest flaws in HTC's
design the pressure-sensitive buttons
and squeezable sides if you remember the
buttons aren't actually buttons they are
little unmoving protrusions in the phone
frame that can come off if persuaded and
once that button is off the buttons
function is unusable on the phone unless
you know you carry around a spare pair
of tweezers like I showed at the
beginning of this video who doesn't have
one of those the pressure-sensitive
ribbons are the electronic components
that capture each short and long
of your hand through that soft aluminum
they run along each side of the phone
each side is essentially the same I'll
pull off this long plastic protector and
then start working on removing the
ribbon the problem here is that it looks
like HTC has permanently adhered the
ribbon to the frame of the phone making
button replacements or squeezed motion
replacements impossible without
replacing the whole frame anyway even
while attempting to be gentle my ribbon
was torn and portions of the contact
pads were left attached to the frame
rendering my phone unusable you never
realize how often you use a power button
until it's gone here's a close-up look
at the contact points remaining on the
inner side of that metal frame normally
in a teardown video I would assemble the
phone so let us working after I'm done
it's pretty annoying that something so
inexpensive and common as a button is
rendering my $800 phone useless to make
matters worse the screen of the HTC u 12
is permanently glued to the frame of the
phone and would be very difficult to
harvest for parts so reclaiming any
value out of this phone is going to be
difficult since those buttons are gone
the HTC u12 plus is currently in the
lead for the least repairable phone of
2018 but at least the charging port
rubber matches the back speaking of
which since my phone is now dead if you
own a translucent blue u12 plus and end
up accidentally breaking the back glass
because you know a case interfered with
your squeezy bits tweet me a picture of
the carnage and I'll trade you my back
glass that's still in one piece I won't
be needing it the HTC ten was one of my
favorite phones of 2016 back in the day
I thought that HTC start heading back
that direction and ditch the squeezies
but that's just my opinion let me know
what you think down in the comments and
thanks a ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
