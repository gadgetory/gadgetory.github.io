LastPass huge thanks to them for making
it possible to visit a phone I might not
have got to test otherwise switching
phones can be a pain that's one of the
reasons I've stuck with my own Galaxy s8
plus as a daily driver for so long now
one app that can make switching phones
easier is LastPass already used by
millions of people
LastPass has the ability to generate
long secure and encrypted passwords so
you don't have to remember yourself it
stores all of your passwords for you so
don't need to write them down or use
that same unsecure password for
everything it's worth a shot
if you spend any amount of time on the
internet whether on your computer or
your cell phone the app itself is free
but if you want some extra perks like a
gig of encrypted storage it's only two
bucks a month I'll leave a link for you
down in the video description huge
thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this
video
no let's jump into the durability test
let's get started it's time to test the
xiaomi note 5 pro show me has not always
done well on my channel in the past demi
v had a pretty rough day during my
durability test let's hope this note 5
pro released this year fares better
because this blue is beautiful seriously
though this blue is one of the coolest
colors that i've seen on a smartphone in
a while it would be a shame if someone
accidentally scratched it let's start
with the screen my systemic durability
test always included my most pics to see
what the screen is made from plastic
would scratch at level 3 which we've
seen on some other budget phones this
show me note 5 with its oddly measured
5.9 9 inch screen has advertised Gorilla
Glass so we should start seeing
scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves
at level 7 pretty standard so far
especially for 2018 normal Keys coins
and razor blades won't scratch the front
glass show me is advertising a 20
megapixel selfie camera on this thing
with something unique a front-facing
flash the far circle on the right is
actually an LED which is nifty the
earpiece is made from a hard metal mesh
and is very securely adhered to the
phone not bad so far for a budget phone
the volume rocker is made from metal
along with the super-small tower button
the bottom section of the phone however
is made from plastic and even though it
does include our favorite headphone jack
it's located next to a very much
outdated microUSB slot this phone was
released in 2018 where it's beyond time
to move on to USB C ports while the
bottom might be plastic besides are
definitely made from metal along with
the SD card tray which can conveniently
hold two SIM cards or ass MNS d-- card
combo the only thing that would make me
more impressed is if this phone could
change the channels on my TV but wait it
can built into this budget from from
Xiaomi is an IR blaster that allows you
to control speakers TVs projectors and
DVD players all with that little black
remote control LED on the top androids
can do some pretty cool things this
budget note 5 Pro does have dual cameras
on the back but no telephoto or
wide-angle lens which basically means
that the second camera is more of a
glorified decoration than anything else
the plastic flash is separate from the
protective glass over the cameras
probably to keep the reflections of the
flash to a minimum these slightly
recessed fingerprint scanner is scratch
Abul my razor blade does its normal
damage it's interesting to note that a
lot of fingerprint scanners can survive
this exact same abuse and still function
like normal but this time around with
the xiaomi note 5 pro it won't
acknowledge my finger and keep saying
that the sensor is dirty so the
fingerprint scanner does fail this time
around of course this is a bit more
abused than a WellCare ford phone would
normally sustain during a 2 or 3 year
lifespan
but that's the point of this video my
phone gets tested so you don't have to
find out the hard way with your own
phone plus I draw one fantastic-looking
Bluebird the endcaps of this phone it
might be plastic but the center section
is definitely metal this 5.9 9 inch
screen is an IPS LCD display so we
should see the pixels go black and turn
off but hopefully recover and switch
back on again the no.5 pro lasts at
about nine seconds before recovering
completely let's see if this note 5 pro
is structurally durable or if Tweety
gets his head popped off the first Bend
had me nervous for our buddy Tweety
there is a very visible and very
permanent kink in between the power and
volume buttons bending from the opposite
direction yields a lock out but no
catastrophic damage there are permanent
gaps between the frame and the glass and
the screen is unclasp along the middle
but everything is still alive and
functioning this beautifully colored
Lake Blue Note 5 pro with it's pretty
darn durable bird on the back has
survived my durability test pretty
impressive and it gets a thumbs-up for
me if you enjoy blue birds come hang out

see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
