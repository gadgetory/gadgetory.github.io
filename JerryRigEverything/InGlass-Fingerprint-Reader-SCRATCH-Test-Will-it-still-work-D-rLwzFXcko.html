You might have heard about this phone.
It has the first in-screen fingerprint scanner
on a smartphone.
Yeah.
A fingerprint scanner under the front glass.
Let's, uh, do what we do.
[Intro]
Right out of the box this phone is big, solid,
but still very thin.
And it's time for a durability test.
It's basically a right of passage for any
new smartphone these days.
Starting with the scratch test which is going
to be pretty important during this video.
Plastic scratches at a level 3, tempered glass
at a level 6, and diamonds are a level 10.
It's nice to see Vivo holding up so far against
other flagships like LG and Samsung and the
iPhone, scratching at a level 6 with a deeper
groove at a level 7.
Now let's take a look at that fingerprint
scanner.
If it's under the glass it's probably visible
to the naked eye, and if you look closely
you can see the rectangular shape of the fingerprint
scanner at the bottom of the phone.
It's pretty invisible with the screen off,
and when the screen's on, it pretty much disappears.
MKBHD made a video explaining a bit more about
the software side of the sensor saying it
only works in OLED displays, and has the potential
on future phones to be any size it wants,
which is pretty cool.
I'll link his video for you in the description.
I'm here for the hardware.
And it'll be extremely interesting to see
what the scanner looks like inside the phone
if, you know, it survives my durability test.
Setting up the in-screen fingerprint scanner
is pretty straightforward, asking for a pass
code and some backup questions in case the
sensor stops working or your fingers get chopped
off.
You can still access your phone.
A lit circle fingerprint icon pops up on the
display and everything gets programmed in
like normal.
It's surprisingly quick at recognizing my
finger and unlocking the phone, so we're off
to a good start.
But let's say you've owned your phone for
about a year now, and naturally the glass
is a little scratched up from normal wear
and tear.
Will the fingerprint scanner still work underneath
that scratched glass?
My level 7 pick is going to help us find out.
I think that's sufficiently damaged, and luckily
we still have unlocking success every time
I touch the phone, even with the scratches.
The in-screen fingerprint scanner will still
function under heavily scuffed glass.
If this Vivo X20 survives the bend test, I'll
shatter the screen at the end of this video,
just to see if the scanner works on a fully
cracked display as well.
There are no physical buttons at the bottom
of the screen, and up here at the top of the
phone, we have a 12 megapixel front facing
camera underneath the screen glass.
The earpiece slot is a tiny little guy, slightly
recessed below the glass of the phone.
It's made out of metal and it's permanent.
So no falling out with time.
The sides of the phone are made from metal,
with a pretty slick looking gold accents.
And there's even a plastic layer between the
glass and the metal frame, softening the pinch
point between the two surfaces of the phone
if it ever does drop or get bent.
It's a good design move from a durability
perspective.
The bottom of the phone has some useful features
like a headphone jack, but then Vivo slams
us with a blast from the past and slips a
micro USB charging port in there.
As well all know, thinness doesn't matter
when it comes to cellphones, but I do want
to point out that this Vivo X20 is .3 millimeters
thinner than the iPhone 8 Plus, yet still
has room for a headphone jack and a larger
battery than the iPhone has.
The power button is made from metal, along
with the volume rocker.
On the back of the phone, the flash is made
from plastic, and then we get glass covering
the dual camera lenses.
Both of these are 12 megapixel and have the
same focal length.
It's doing that monochrome thing with the
secondary lens if you're into that.
Pretty similar camera bump to the newer iPhones,
but that gold accent is still pretty sweet.
The Vivo logo on the back is heavily embedded
in the metal panel, and even with some aggressive
persuasion from my razor blade, it would not
come out.
Thumbs up to Vivo for that level of commitment.
So far this phone is solid.
[Scratching sounds] There are two basic type
of fingerprint scanners: optical and capacitive.
The optical fingerprint scanner basically
captures a picture of your fingerprint and
turns it into a math equation based on the
ridges of your fingers.
Just like the ridges you see here on the finger
I'm drawing.
And then the sensor sees if your fingerprint
matches the one stored inside of the phone.
capacitive fingerprint scanners are more common
in Samsung and LG phones.
Instead of taking a picture, it reads the
conductivity of the ridges on your fingertip,
turns it into a math equation, and then unlocks
your phone if the equation matches the one
you set.
Both sensors work equally great.
The sensor inside of this phone is under the
glass which makes it an optical sensor, taking
a little picture of your fingerprint every
time you set it on the scanner.
Apple is probably going to invent this technology
in a few years...just watch.
The Vivo X20 has a 6 inch 1080p AMOLED display.
Remember that AMOLED displays are self lit
by each individual pixel, making the in-screen
fingerprint scanner possible.
A back-lit IPS LCD display would not function
because that back light would need to shine
through each pixel, and adding an in-screen
fingerprint scanner would just end up being
a dead spot right in the middle of the display.
The AMOLED screen survived almost 30 seconds
before the pixels went white and never completely
recovered.
And now the bend test.
The ultimate indicator of structural build
quality.
With how large and thin this phone is, I was
nervous for a second, especially with the
first flex.
There is definitely more give to the phone
when pressing from the back than there is
when I press from the screen side, which I
why I wanted to wait to shatter the screen
until after the bend test.
The screen is sometimes structural.
After flexing the phone a few times, I can
safely say this phone passes the bend test,
remaining intact and structurally sound.
Now, to see if the fingerprint scanner still
works after a crack.
A level 9 pick is overkill when it comes to
scratching.
It actually scores the glass, making cracks
appear along the fracture because it's so
hard and causing so much damage.
The problem is if you watch closely as I connect
the lines over the sensor and the fractures
in the glass start to appear, the whole display
dies.
You can see a vertical green line appear and
then the screen goes off, never to come back
on again.
I'm going to assume this was my fault since
we can see the first display line start at
the point of crackage, but that's also right
over the fingerprint scanner.
And that fingerprint scanner could be a weak
point in the display when it comes to cracks.
Maybe we'll learn more when we see it from
the inside during my teardown I'll do this
week.
But it's hard to say with 100% certainty with
a sample size of one.
Maybe if we ask nice enough, MKBHD will crack
his Vivo X20 for, you know, science.
Either way, Vivo does include a free case
and screen protector in the box to help keep
things damage free.
Even though the phone cracked and died at
the end, it does pass my normal durability
test.
We'll have to see if the in-screen fingerprint
scanner compromises the display structure
in future screens that it gets implemented
on.
Thanks a ton for watching and I'll see you
around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
