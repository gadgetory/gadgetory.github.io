everywhere electronics tablets laptops
cars and pretty much every single cell
phone and most of the time these with
the embattled as the lithium fail-safes
are in place fail-safes that work
Samsung just voluntarily recalled an
estimated two million Galaxy Note sevens
as a safety precaution since some of the
batteries are exploding inside of the
phone obviously random explosions are
not a feature that most people look for
when purchasing a cell phone so let's
take a look at the note 7 and assess why
it might spontaneously combust during
charging the phone is protected by
multiple fail safes first of all you
have the part that plugs into the wall
the charger and the cable if the charger
is faulty or not designed specifically
for your phone it can affect the safety
of the battery it can destroy the
battery's protection circuit which I'll
show you in a second the charging port
is also a fail-safe it tries to do its
best to protect the phone and the
battery from faulty chargers and
incorrect electrical flow but as a last
resort the battery also has its own
failsafe built in here is where the
battery plugs into the motherboard to
receive its juice and supply the phone
power then we have this circuit board
also called the protection circuit at
the top of the battery this controls the
flow of electricity and the temperature
of the lithium all at the embattled is
board it makes sure that the battery
does not overcharge and as a thermal
fuse of sorts that will blow if the
temperature gets too hot thus protecting
the lithium inside from rapid unplanned
catastrophic disassembly the body of the
battery is typically two layers the
anode and the cathode which are
separated by an electrically conducting
fluid this is oily and smells
surprisingly of burnt skittles the
combination of these elements allow your
phone to charge and function as long as
the battery protection circuitry is
working correctly and the electricity
and the temperature of the lithium are
regulated if it is not regulated
correctly during charging the lithium
will react violently so if you look at
one of the exploded phones we can see
which of the fail-safes is failing at
being safe the charging port sits here
inside of the phone and there are no
burn marks near the port or where the
port connects the motherboard
but we do see some scorching where the
battery sits not where it plugs into the
mainboard which would be about here but
it explodes in the center of the battery
around the battery hole in the thick
aluminum mid frame so on this particular
exploded note seven all of the
connections are good just the battery
itself isn't behaving Tesla cars are
also powered by lithium batteries the
Model S had a small issue at the
beginning of production where the
batteries on the undercarriage could get
punctured by de breeze on the road which
could cause the lithium battery under
the car to explode
Tesla corrected this problem by adding a
titanium puncture proof under plate to
the Model S but the note seven batteries
are definitely not being punctured
internally since there is nothing to
poke them on the inside as you can see
from my teardown video it's it's on
smooth aluminum so since the note seven
battery isn't being punctured that
narrows it down to overcharging shorting
or impurities in the battery itself a
small metal impurity in the lithium
could short it out personally I think
the problem has to do with the little
circuit board failing at the top of the
battery from what I have read about the
people who have complained publicly
about their note 7 exploding is that the
phone was charging when it happened the
phone starts charging and the tiny
regulator doesn't do his job and the
battery enters into a thermal runaway
and the voltage regulator can't stop the
chain reaction since this particular
note 7 battery isn't plugged into the
phone right now my tweezers are acting
as the other possible failure point a
metal impurity in the manufacturing of
the battery that could possibly short
out the battery all of this smoke and
fire would be under extreme pressure
locked inside of your watertight note 7
the more pressure there is the bigger
the explosion remember that this only
happens in a very small number of
devices so far it's only happened on 35
phones out of 2 million so yeah
definitely take advantage of the recall
but also feel free to use your phone as
normal in the mean time just don't set
it on your lap while it's plugged into
the wall and maybe take a fire
extinguisher with you to bed just in
case my Instagram followers saw the
results of this combustion before the
video was posted to youtube so follow me
there if you want to stay updated on my
future projects subscribing to my
youtube channel is always free I review
technology from the inside thanks ton
for watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
