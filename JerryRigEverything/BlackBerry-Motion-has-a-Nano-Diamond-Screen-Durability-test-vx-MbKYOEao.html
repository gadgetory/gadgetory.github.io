is here on my desk BlackBerry hasn't
always passed my durability test with
plastic camera lenses on the BlackBerry
Prive and a screen that falls off on the
BlackBerry key one it'll be interesting
to see what happens this time around
let's get started
blackberry claims to be a secure
smartphone software wise and that's fine
but I'm here to test the hardware the
motion is a much lighter phone than I
anticipated the first thing I noticed
was the large extra button on the side I
thought was the power button but it's
actually customizable it could be a mute
switch open the camera or any other app
it's almost like blackberry heard the
complaints about Samsung's bixby and
then fix the problem the part I'm most
interested in though is the screen on
BlackBerry's website they claim to have
a proprietary nano diamond anti scratch
coating which is a pretty bold claim my
most pics do a pretty good job of
differentiating between diamonds and
just regular glass and looking at the
scratch marks I still see damage done at
a level six which means it's normal
glass it might be my imagination that
there's a little less damage than normal
but still damage happens at a6
blackberry could be talking about the
little micro abrasion resistance that
happens in your pocket though if you
look at my unprotected Galaxy s8 that's
been in my pocket for about a year it's
got abrasions all over it maybe
BlackBerry's proprietary nano diamond
coating will protect against those micro
operations one of you guys will have to
come back in a year and leave a comment
about that scratch resistance only time
will tell
or just add a screen protector sometimes
it's better be safe than sorry
the menu and back buttons are both
embedded under the glass and therefore
protected along with that eight
megapixel front camera the white
earpiece grille is made from metal and
solidly attachment frame perfect for
curing metal and dirt out of the
earpiece and now for the home button
which turned out to be surprisingly
resilient the mark you see here from my
razor blade is actually just a smudge my
razor left no physical damage on the
home button I tried out the fingerprint
scanner just for kicks and giggles and
it registered and unlock the phone every
single time with my thumb so thumbs up
for that blackberries on a roll so far
blackberry comes in all your favorite
colors if you like black and the sides
of the phone are made from aluminum
flipping it over to the other side and
checking the buttons we get more metal
on the volume rocker the power button
and the button that Bixby wishes it was
the top of the phone is made from
plastics but covered in a shiny metallic
paint that kind of flakes off a bit when
damaged down at the bottom of the phone
we have more metal next that USBC slot
and thankfully a headphone jack it's
almost like someone over at blackberry
was like listening to customers or
something when they made this foam the
material next to the camera lens is
still that same plastic wrapped around
from the top not a big deal plastic is
totally fine as long as it doesn't
compromise the build structure the lens
itself is made from glass protecting
that 12 megapixel camera underneath the
camera protrusion is minimal as well not
too bad
blackberry was basically the number one
in a smartphone world before the iPhone
was released 10 years ago after that
they kind of basically declined to
nothing and then started their comeback
a few years ago with the Android
operating system integration there have
been a few bumps in the road but it's
nice to see them competing again this
smooth rubber back doesn't add a whole
lot of extra grip but it does keep the
phone from sliding off a smooth table
keys and coins don't do any damage to
the surface the little droops we see on
the back panel are inlaid and can pop
off I imagine after a year or two in
your pocket you might be missing one or
two of these but only time will tell one
feature I thought was unique was this
privacy shade thing which basically dims
down the entire screen except for one
little circle or rectangle that you can
drag around with your finger to unveil
whatever sensitive information or
sensitive individuals might be on your
screen then lifting up your finger it
makes it all disappear again until the
privacy shade is turned off and the
screen goes back to normal
and now for the burn test the BlackBerry
motion has a 5.5 inch 1080p IPS display
and just if by chance your phone comes
in contact with direct flame it'll last
about 6 seconds before the pixels start
going black remember try to avoid the
temptation of doing this to your own
phone intentionally damaging expensive
electronics would be dumb and now for
the bin test the ultimate refueler of
structural flaws this phone is ip67
water-resistant and
survive the first flex but somehow
managed to pinch my finger between the
glass and the frame I've never had a
blackberry try to eat me before but
other than that there is no permanent
damage or kinks along the frame and it
even looks like someone remembered to
glue the screen on this time impressive
with the programmable side button for a
thousand milliamp hour battery life
metal frame and headphone jack
blackberry has done a fantastic job with
this one I'll be entering to see what
makes this thing water-resistant when I
do the teardown video come hang out with
me on Twitter to stay updated and thanks
a ton for watching I'll see you around
and if you made it this far in the video
what is your favorite berry
you know the edible kind I'm curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
