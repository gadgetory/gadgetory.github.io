between the Samsung gear 360 and the LG
360 as I walk around the cameras I'm
going to explain a little bit about them
if you're on a phone you can just tilt
your phone and look around and you can
explore the environment in 360 degrees
if you're on a computer you can use your
mouse to just scroll along the window it
really does help if you turn your video
quality up as high as it'll go because
then you can see farther off into the
distance so as I'm walking around I'm
going to switch the audio between the
two cameras right now I'm in front of
the LG 360 and the audio coming from
this is actually 5.1 surround sound
which is perfect for VR or virtual
reality because then you can hear the
sound coming in the direction it's
actually coming from but as I walk
around over here to the gear 360 this
audio is actually stereo so it's only
coming from two directions which isn't
as good but if we jump into the
resolution the gear 360 comes out on top
instead of the LG 360 let's do that so
when it comes to camera quality the
Samsung gear 360 that you're looking at
right now is pretty much a 4k camera the
LG 360 on this side is pretty much a 2k
camera so it has half the pixels that
the 360 does from Samsung now they're
the same size right now because in my
video editing software I've up scaled
the LG 360 so it's going to be missing
some pixels but it'll be the same size
overall but you can still test the
quality between the two pretty easily
now as far as bitrate goes which is the
actual quality of the image inside the
resolution that's playing the gear 360
has a bit rate of about 60 megabits a
second while the LG 360 is like 18 or 19
megabits a second so the quality is
almost a third of what the gear 360 is
pretty big difference but there's also a
big difference in price as well right
now the LG 360 is around $200 and the
gear 360 is pretty much double that if
not officially released in the United
States yet so the price is going to
change
I'll leave both links down in the video
description for LG and Samsung so you
can compare the price between the two of
them
you know as time goes on so the gear 360
has a couple more features than the LG
360 I think that comes with the added
increase in price but the camera itself
is water-resistant it's got a cool
little rubber seal around the battery
compartment it also stabilizes the image
so if you're walking around holding the
camera the image is going to be way more
stable than with the LG 360 also with
the gear 360 it has slow motion so if
you drop the resolution of the 360 cam
from Samsung down to the resolution to K
of this LG 360 it'll go 60 frames a
second instead of 30 frames a second
which isn't a whole lot of slow motion
but it's something so make sure you look
around tell me which camera you think is
best down in the description of the
video I will leave both cameras link so
you can check the prices on them as well
if you haven't subscribed to my channel
yet make sure you do that
I do camera comparisons like this fairly
often usually with cell phones but it's
nice to do something a little bit
different like this 360 video thanks a
thump for watching hope you enjoyed it
and I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
