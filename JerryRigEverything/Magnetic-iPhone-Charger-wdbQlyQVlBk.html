a few days ago was this magnetic iPhone
6 and 6s charging cable adapter for 15
bucks being my curious self I bought it
turns out it's actually pretty
interesting you plug one end into your
phone and the other end into your normal
charging cable then it connects via
magnets just like you would with your
MacBook or Apple laptop definitely a
little gimmicky but the magnet inside is
actually surprisingly strong it can even
hold the weight of the iPhone
technically you could also assume that
since you're not putting any wear and
tear on your actual internal charging
port by plugging and unplugging your
lightning cable every night the phone
component should last longer but you'll
also have to bring the adapter with you
if you want to charge on the go or pull
it out and remove it I check the charge
times with the adapter installed start
it off at 13% when I came back an hour
later it was up to 46% so it might be
slightly slower than usual but still not
a deal-breaker as far as iPhones go it
does stick out a little bit from the
bottom of the phone and might interfere
with some cases but overall it's not a
bad little toy and would definitely
start some conversations I'll link the
little guy in the video description
below if you want to try it out for
yourself and if you're wondering why my
black iphone is all scratched up head
over to my Dimond vs. iphone video to
see what happened thanks a ton for
watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
