survived my tests in front of me I have
the moto Z the world's thinnest premium
smartphone from Motorola I've tested
close to 30 phones now it's important to
understand how durable your device is
when you buy it is the screen plastic
like the galaxy s7 active or would it
catastrophic Lee crumble under pressure
like the Nexus 6p after watching my
tests you'll know what to look out for
when using your own phone this phone is
so thin there is hardly even room for
the USB C charging port on the bottom
for comparison my galaxy s7 edge is on
the top at 7.9 millimeters then the Moto
Z in the middle at 5.2 and the iPhone 6
on the bottom with 6.9 we'll start with
a scratch test these pics tell us where
the screen falls on Mohs scale of
hardness most phones reach a level six
before scratching some phones have a
plastic screen like the droid turbo 2 or
the galaxy s7 active the Moto Z has
Gorilla Glass 4 on it so it's no
surprise that it lasts until level 6
before scratching you won't have to
worry about keys or coins scuffing up
the glass of this phone the front 5
megapixel camera lens is integrated into
the Gorilla Glass 4 so it won't be
scratching either but we do have a
front-facing flash on this phone which
is awesome for the weirdos who like
taking selfies in the dark it is made of
plastic but that's normal and nothing to
worry about the earpiece seems to be
made of metal the only problem is that
it's a wide open gaping hole shaped like
a cheese grater just waiting to fill up
with Pocket lint and makeup or little
rocks from the beach so watch out for
that the fingerprint scanner is not made
of glass or sapphire like the iPhones or
the HTC 10 so it does scratch but even
after being heavily scratched by my
razor blade it would still function
about 75% of the time so as long as you
keep the scratching to a minimum it will
continue to function just fine the size
of this phone are made of metal no
primer or plastic to be found even the
side buttons are made of metal so so far
we've seen some pretty quality materials
there is a glass panel on the top and
bottom of the Moto Z I imagine that this
is where the screws are hidden and we'll
find out during my teardown video I'll
review this tech from the inside if the
phone survives my durability test the
camera lens is made of glass so it will
not be scratching easy
the plastic lens of the BlackBerry Prive
do you see how the dual flash at the
bottom is different colors having a
multicolored flash allows for more
realistic less washed out pictures in
the dark the iPhones have a dual colored
flash as well as the HTC 10 but the
galaxy s7 does not so if you are a
photography person who uses the flash
now you know thumbs up for the premium
features nobody usually talks about it's
the little things that make a smartphone
good the camera hump on this phone is
pretty huge it makes the hump on the
galaxy s7 edge you look non-existent if
you're the type of person to use the
Moto mods like the projector the battery
pack or the speakers they'll cover up
that hump with the added thickness of
the backpack the ring is made of metal
and won't flake or discolor if you don't
end up using the mods here is where the
mods connect the gold points themselves
seem solid there is a little rubber ring
around each one to keep them clean and
dust free so I don't see any immediate
issues with this particular component
the back panel is made of a very thin
piece of metal so the construction of
the phone does have that premium feel to
it onto the flame test it's always
interesting to me to see how long the
display holds up to the extreme heat I
left the flame in place for over 50
seconds almost one full minute before
the screen started reacting to the heat
from my lighter
pretty impressive considering that my
galaxy s7 only lasted 15 seconds before
the pixels turned permanently white the
phones are cool to the touch within
seconds of the flame being removed onto
the bin test I was extremely nervous
about the world's thinnest phone
breaking but instead of snapping like
chocolate it just flexed like the
world's most expensive banana and sprung
back to its original position like it
was no big deal
not even a kink near the power button
which would be normal for a metal
smartphone like the iPhone 6 even
bending from the opposite direction
yielded no carnage unfortunately there
was a small leftover Bend but that could
be easily corrected I'm impressed that
Motorola can manufacture the thinnest
smartphone in existence and still have
it be durable while I do not endorse
sitting on your cell phone at least now
we know that it will not catastrophic ly
fail taking all of your data with it
like the Nexus 6p or the next bit Robin
if you're not subscribed yet make sure
you do it it is free and you will be
notified every time I test a new phone
you'll be upgrading your own device
someday and it's better to know
beforehand what you are
getting into thanks for watching hope
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
