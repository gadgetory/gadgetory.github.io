is the shatterproof phone from Motorola
it's a pretty large phone about the same
size as my note 5
I do durability tests and all the major
smartphones scratch tests been deaths
extreme heat tests all of which can
relate to everyday life let's start with
a scratch test I have a set of picks
that let me know where the screen falls
on Mohs scale of hardness
now the screen on the droid turbo 2 is
actually made up of five different
layers and I'll cover these more in
depth in just a second a level to pick
did nothing because it is basically
plastic against plastic but a level 3
pick left some very noticeable marks on
the phone for reference most phones like
the Samsung or even the rest of the
Motorola lineup have gorilla glass
screens and they end up being a 5 or a 6
on Mohs scale this phone is about a two
and a half obviously a razor blade will
cause some major damage to this screen
even keys and coins will scuff it up so
by having a shatterproof screen it
definitely compromises quite a bit when
it comes to scratch proof nests it
scratches fairly easily
luckily the rear camera is scratch
resistant though I can take my razor
blade which is about a 5 or a 6 on Mohs
scale and it'll leave no mark on the
lens that's good news for the
photography people out there hit that
thumbs up for the camera lens durability
the back panel feels like tough braided
nylon you see the razor blade can slice
through the fibers but keys and coins
won't do much to mark up the back layer
it feels quality and solid so there
isn't much to worry about there plus the
back panels are replaceable onto the
burn test we get to see how the screen
handles when extreme heat is applied to
the surface most screens do survive this
test but this particular phone did not I
imagine that has something to do with
the plastic flexible AMOLED panel inside
the heat melts the pixels in such a way
that they do not recover like they do on
a regular AMOLED panel you can see that
even when the screen is turned off the
white melted mark from the flame is
still visible let's jump into the bin
test before I talk about the screen
layers if I can snap this thing in half
it'll be much easier to show all the
layers at once unfortunately though this
phone is much stronger than I am
it does flex quite a bit more than your
normal phone and I was nervous about it
snapping for a second but it locks out
and does not break or snap very solid
device now let's talk about the 5 layers
of the screen on the bottom we have the
aluminum chassis right
of that we have the flexible plastic
AMOLED display the third layer the
digitizer layer is also made of flexible
plastic the fourth layer is the internal
clear polycarbonate lens and the fifth
layer the one we've been dealing with is
the exterior acrylic polycarbonate lens
that they claim is actually scratch
resistant it's interesting to me that
they would even attempt to call it
scratch resistant at all what you see me
removing here is the fifth outermost
layer it is basically just a glorified
thick plastic screen protector which is
easily replaceable and can be ordered
from Motorola's website for about 30
bucks I'll link that in the video
description you can see that the plastic
edges of the phone are raised up just a
little to accommodate the thick top
layer so the good news is is that if you
ever need to replace your scratch or
dented top layer you can relatively
easily so is this the phone they'll put
screen repair shops out of business
I don't think so I imagine that this
phone will fit a niche market of devoted
dedicated diehard users but I think that
most people including myself will choose
a premium feeling scratch resistant
glass screen over a shatterproof very
scratch Bowl plastic lens also even
though the plastic lens at the Droid
turbo is shatterproof the LCD itself
under the shatterproof lens can still be
damaged from drops or hard hits watch
techrax is turbo to video to see what
I'm talking about
thanks ton for watching check out my
other smartphone durability videos have
quite a few and follow me on Instagram
