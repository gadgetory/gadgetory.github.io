PN watch tell Ian to get a 75% discount
and a free month the me mix 3 is the
unique slider phone with the physically
hidden from facing cameras one thing I
did notice while charging the phone up
for this video was that the cable in the
box is specifically designed and formed
for this phone allowing the screen to
slide while charging but when using a
third-party cable the screen is stuck in
the closed position kind of interesting
it's time to take apart the mean x3 and
see what kind of magic is holding the
whole contraption together let's get
started since the me mix 3 isn't
water-resistant we can always hope it
won't be glued shut quite as tight as
some of the other watertight phones a
little bit of heat gets the phone hot
enough to soften the adhesive between
the glass and the frame of the phone I
can use my suction cup to pull up on the
glass slap and slide my razor or metal
pry tool underneath to slice away the
adhesive holding the two portions
together kind of makes you miss the good
old days when all you needed was a
screwdriver but it is what it is
the back glass panel does pull away easy
enough I'm taking special care not to
put any stress on the fragile ribbon
cable connecting the fingerprint scanner
to the board I'll reach my plastic pry
tool in there and unsnap it like a
little Lego then the back glass can fold
away from the phone it kind of looks
cool inside with the black plastic and
gold antennas the wireless charging coil
is still connected to the rear glass and
covered with black plastic on both sides
so it's not quite as aesthetic as
Google's copper colored coils on the
pixel 3 and we also have what's probably
the NFC pad up here at the top attach
the back glass
Shammi does have not one but two
warranty void stickers which means we
better stop the teardown just kidding
with nine normal Phillips head screws
holding down the top protective plastics
we can finally unplug the battery and
make our way down to the magical pull
tabs poking up from the bottom I'll get
to show you how exactly the magic
happens with these pull tabs because one
did end up breaking there are
unfortunately silent but do their job
for the most part hypothetically
allowing the battery to release without
putting any stress on the pouch itself
if the fragile pull tab doesn't break
during the pull of course
now that the battery is out you can see
how the adhesive reacts when tension is
applied to the white strip it loses its
stickiness and pulls out from underneath
the battery easily while leaving no
residue behind the longer the battery
has been installed though the more
brittle T's become and the easier they
break but still pull tabs are better
than the permanent adhesive alternative
inside the mean mix three is eight
thirty two hundred milli amp hour
battery after the batteries removed we
get our first glimpse of how the sliding
mechanism works two rather large
rectangular magnets you can see how it
pulls the metal screw into the center
with its magnetism ik force I don't
really know how magnets work the screen
ribbon flexes with the motion of the
slide kind of like we saw with the Aviv
on excess motorized camera from last
year we got to go deeper though so the
seven Phillips screws surrounding the
bottom plastic plate are next the
plastics that pulled away include the
include the loudspeaker with the two
square golden contact pads these are
allow for communication with the
motherboard I still think the black and
gold accents are kind of fun I'll remove
the one silver screw from the charging
port board and unplug the white wire
cable then unclip the bottom extension
ribbon this allows the small board to
fall out of the phone frame it's got the
standard USB C port along with the
microphone but no headphone jack those
are getting more and more rare these
days
all that's left in the bottom part is
the cute little coin style vibrator
motor but we'll leave that in place for
now the motherboard up top is where some
cool stuff is happening basically all
the connectors have this copper
grounding tape over the top
I imagine that with the sliding motion
of the phone the internals are
constantly feeling sharp jewels as the
screen jerks up and down so the tape
probably help keeps the ribbon intact
and plugged in each of the four camera
connections are unclipped and there are
three little silver Phillips head screws
holding down the motherboard the two
front facing cameras come away next a 24
megapixel and a 2 megapixel sensor that
allow for the blurry background portrait
mode thing both housed in the same metal
housing the dual SIM card tray comes out
next this would also probably make a
good step number one if you like doing
things in order finally I'll unclip the
screen ribbon surrounded by red rubber
which I assume helps support the cable
as it constantly flexes and moves with
the sliding motion of the phone Xiaomi
has said that they've tested the sliding
motion over
thousand times with no ill effects on
the hardware and it does look like they
have taken extra precautions from the
inside which is nice
great dollops a thermal paste on the
back of the motherboard transfer heat to
the metal frame of the phone there is
also a white hexagon shaped water damage
indicator sticker next to the SIM card
tray this will turn pink if the phone
ever gets wet and now the rear-facing
camera both with different functions the
normal 12 megapixel sensor does have
optical image stabilization but the 12
megapixel telephoto camera does not both
are mounted in the same metal housing we
didn't come all this way to stop here
though that sliding motion still needs
to be explained
underneath the long black extension
ribbon we reveal a third set of yellow
tape covered screws which I'm pretty
sure I'll attach the screen into the
body I'll peel away each of the three
yellow tape strips and unscrew the eight
super flat Phillips head screws similar
to the same sidewall screws we saw back
in the iPhone 4 the me mix 3 has 28
screws inside so I'm definitely keeping
them all organized off to the side so I
can hopefully put the phone all back
together again when I'm done after the
last two top screws are removed I can
very gently slide the screen ribbon out
through the hole in the phone housing
and we've successfully removed both
halves of the phone the design of this
thing is so simple it's brilliant little
trick I saw on m√°rquez's channel was
this Magnum a pur that shows us where
magnets are hidden inside of electronics
two large rectangular magnets in the
main body of the phone and down here we
can see it's also picking up the little
tiny magnet inside of the vibrator motor
then over here on the screen half of the
slider we have another two main magnets
the silver sliding rack itself on the
screen side is completely free-floating
no Springs or resistance it slides up
hitting the large rectangle and then
slides back down and locks out with
their little silver tabs bent up hitting
the ends of the plastic rails these
blocks keep it from extending too high
up and too far down
obviously the thin AMOLED screen is
glued into the other side of this thin
piece of plastic and it is replaceable
with enough heat the little gold screen
ribbon just pokes through the hole in
the back of the plastic now you might be
thinking to yourself hey Jerry don't
magnets spend all their time attracting
each other how does the slider stay open
if the magnets are the only thing inside
of there well I'm glad you asked as you
can see when the slider is in the closed
position the Magnus lineup directly over
top of each other
with a large amount of attracting force
but when I slide up the magnets moved
from the initial attracting magnetic
field into a position where the magnets
are actually repelling each other and
pushing away from each other holding the
screen in the upward extended position
this is pretty brilliant because there
are no motors Springs or crazy
complicated hardware to get jammed or
misaligned just simple magnetic fields
let me show you I have two super-strong
magnets here strong enough that they
want to attract through my finger I'll
put them on either side of my metal pry
tool the north end of one magnet is
currently very strongly attracted to the
south end of the other magnet but let's
say I move the two magnets so that
they're next to each other they start to
repel pushing away just like the
position of the magnets in the phone
when this slider is open but when the
slider is closed
the magnets line back up again and
attract each other into the down
position keeping the slider tightly
closed the fun sliding effect you feel
with the me mix three is that feeling of
magnets passing from one attracting
magnetic field into the repelling
magnetic field it's pretty smart of show
me I mean so far this is the only phone
I've taken apart in 2019 but with this
kind of ingenuity we're off to a good
start I'm definitely gonna need y'all to
collectively cross your fingers now in
hopes I can put all 28 screws back into
place with everything still working I'll
make sure the yellow tape is back on top
so the screws won't jiggle loose with
the jarring motions of the slide the
motherboard can set back into place with
its red rubber protecting the screen
ribbon cable and all four of the camera
units get plugged back in with the three
silver motherboard screws holding
everything down then I'll set the
charging port board down into the frame
next to the small vibrator the rest of
the install is super straightforward
with the super long extension ribbon
cable running under the battery which
also then gets set into place and then
the camera lenses and all the plastics
get screwed down with all those screws I
kept organized earlier the last step is
the fingerprint scanner ribbon and the
back glass panel getting set back onto
the phone and lucky for us the whole
thing does still turn on and slides up
and down just like it did out of the box
this is partially due to the pure
simplicity of the design and also
because you had your fingers crossed the
whole time
thank you I agree with Xiaomi that the
sliding mechanism is indeed secure and
with no moving mechanical parts there's
probably gonna last for very long time
speaking of secure things huge thanks to
Nord VPN for sponsor

discount off a three-year plan use the
discount code jerry-rigged it ends up
costing just a few cents a day Nord VPN
comm slash jerry-rigged I'll put the
link in the description would you ever
use a slider phone or would you rather
everything be in one solid piece let me
know in the comments come hang out over
on Twitter and Instagram and thanks a
ton for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
