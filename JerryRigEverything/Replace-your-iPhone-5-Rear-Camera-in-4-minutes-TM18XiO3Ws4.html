going to learn everything there is to
know about replacing the rear camera on
your iPhone 5 there's two screws down at
the bottom they're called a pentalobe
screw you can look in the video
description for parts and tools that
you'll need to complete this project
normally you can take a suction cup and
pull up on the screen once those screws
are out and the screen should pop loose
but this suction cup is far too small to
do the job so I'm going to show you how
to do another way take a metal pry tool
or a razor blade and kind of slip it
between the metal frame and the glass
screen and then pry up on the plastic
part of the screen to pull it away from
the frame don't pull up on the glass
you're going to end up breaking
something and the screens are pretty
expensive so be careful once the screen
is unclamp from the sides don't bend it
past the 90 degree mark or else you'll
rip the ribbon cables take out those
three screws and then remove the metal
plate pop up each of these three ribbon
cables they're kind of like Legos just
lift them up and unclasped them and the
screen pulls away from the phone and
there's two screws holding the battery
cable in place undo those and the best
piece of advice I can give you is to
make sure to stay organized keep the
screws next to the holes on the brackets
you can also take a piece of paper and
draw out or make a list of where all the
parts go as it gets pretty complicated
once we get these all this arrest those
screws out anyway the batteries are in
there pretty tight the glue tends to get
harder with age the sticky tape that
they're taped down with so the longer
your battery has been in there the
harder is going to be to get out I just
took my pry tool and kind of slid it
between the back frame and the rest of
the phone and it popped the battery out
undo this little ribbon cable up here at
the top this is for the power button and
volume buttons and then this right here
is a bracket that holds the charging
port in place so undo that screw and
then put the bracket next to it unclasp
the ribbon cable for the charging port
kind of like the Legos that we were
talking about before and then for the
cellular antenna just unclasp that and
lift it up then get those out of your
way
and then there's two little ribbon
cables that are still in our way for one
of the screws that we have to undo so
lift this up put it somewhere where
you're going to remember where it goes
and then there are five screws on the
motherboard that you have to unscrew and
then there's two screws up here by the
camera that we're going to be replacing
grab that little bracket once you get
the screws out and put that next to the
screws that you just undid and you can
take out the SIM card you can also make
this one of your first steps which I
would recommend just put your little
tool in there or you can use a paperclip
and then these screws are super super
important don't forget to undo those
they're kind of grounding screws for the
motherboard once you get those two
screws undone the motherboard comes
loose from the frame and then you can
grab the Wi-Fi antenna wire cable and
unclasp that from the back and that
frees up the motherboard for us to work
on to get to the camera now here's the
camera there's two screws holding a
bracket in place that keep the camera
plugged into the motherboard once you
get the screws out lift up that little
bracket and put it somewhere special
and then just unclip the camera from the
motherboard and that's pretty much it
grab your new camera and then you can
just slide that into place you can see
what little connection looks like back
there all the parts and tools will be in
the video description below you can see
me just kind of clip it into place back
on the motherboard again if you need any
tools or parts go ahead and click in the
About section below in the video
description and I'll have links for
those anyway if you have any questions
make sure leave in the comments don't
forget to like this video if I helped
you and don't forget to subscribe if I
helped you in any way the best thing you
can do for me is subscribe to my channel
