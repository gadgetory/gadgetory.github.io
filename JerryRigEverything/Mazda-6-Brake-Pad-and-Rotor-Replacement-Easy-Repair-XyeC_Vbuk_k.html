pads and rotors on a 2007 Mazda 6
so these are the rotors right here this
is the caliper and inside the calipers
where the brake pads are and you can see
on the rotor where the brake pads are
kind of rubbing it down that's how we
know we need new rotors on there so what
I'm doing right now is while the tires
on the ground I've loosened up all of
these lug nuts just to break them loose
and now I'm going to raise the car up
off the ground loosen up the rest of lug
nuts and take the tire off sometimes
with these cars the tires get stuck on
the rotors themselves so all the nuts
are off and it's still not going to come
loose you can take some of the PD
blaster and then get it in between the
rotor and the tire itself as well and
let it sit for a couple minutes we're
getting rid of odors anyway so it
doesn't matter if the spray gets on
and that's how you do it also I have the
jack stand as well as the Jack
supporting the car just kind of make
sure that there's two things underneath
it that we don't damage anything if
something accidentally breaks so your
brake pads are inside the caliper right
here and you have to remove the caliper
by taking off this bolt right here and
another bolt that's down there at the
bottom and they're both fourteen
millimeters
now that the caliper is off of the car
you can just press the brake pads out of
it there's going to be two of them and
then there's the caliper itself with the
piston now we're going to take off the
rotor and you have two options one is
you can take your screwdriver and
unscrew both of these screws but the
chances are they're going to be stuck
and there's going to be no way to move
them what we've done is we've taken a
half inch drill bit and you're just
going to drill out the screw on on both
of them and I'll show you how that's
done
so if you look at the brake pads you can
see that the old ones are a lot thinner
than the new ones because all the pads
are worn down so we have to do in order
to make room for the new pads inside of
the caliper we have to compress this
little piston right here so how that's
done is first of all we're going to go
in here underneath the hood and pop the
top off of this brake fluid container
because as we compress the piston the
brake fluid is going to rise up in the
vehicle if your brake fluid is high
already you're going to want to put some
paper towels around it to catch the
overflow so to compress this piston
sometimes with other cars you'd use a
c-clamp to just kind of press it in on
both sides and just manhandle it this
one you actually have to twist clockwise
so what I found is best is just taking a
pair of needlenose pliers put it in
there on the little grooves and then
just twist it like that and just go all
the way down until it's flush with the
other end of the caliper I'm just going
to keep on doing that
if you go counterclockwise you're
actually going to unscrew the piston and
that's actually a pretty big issue
because then you'll have to bleed the
brake system and everything so make sure
you don't go counterclockwise just go
clockwise
so this bottom notch right there needs
to be straight at the bottom because
that's where this little circle pin goes
and it'll just fit right inside there as
we put the brake pads in okay so the new
brake pads are in the caliper and one
other thing is don't ever let the
caliper just hang by itself because
these brake lines if they ever snap off
it's a pretty expensive repair to get
those replaced so make sure that it's
always supported either by a bungee
cable or just resting on the frame of
the vehicle we're going to go ahead and
take the rotor stick it on it's a good
idea to wipe that wipe it down before
you install anything and then we're just
going to slip the caliper on over the
rotor itself now the caliper is on and
those two 14 millimeter bolts are
screwed in on the back of it rotors on
and as soon as we get the tire in place
these five lug nuts are going to hold
the rotor into the car so you don't need
to worry about those two little screws
that we drilled out anyway I'm going to
put the tire on gently screw on the lug
nuts set the car down tighten the lug
nuts all the way and then in the front
of the car banette screw on that brake
fluid cap again so one more thing these
little pins right here when you take the
brake pads out it's kind of kind of
spread itself open when you put the new
brake pads in you want to close it down
so it's flat like you see right there
and then the brake pads going to sit on
top of it and the spring is just kind of
kind of keep it in place so make sure
you do that otherwise it's going to be
spread open and you're going to try to
push the brake pad in and it's not going
to go in all the way and that is it make
sure that before you start driving
you're going to get in and you're going
to tap the brake pedal a couple times
that way it'll press the brake pads
against the caliper because right now
they're still uncompressed
and so you want to make sure that the
brakes are going to be responsive so
pressing your brake pedal a couple times
before you go anywhere anyway if any
