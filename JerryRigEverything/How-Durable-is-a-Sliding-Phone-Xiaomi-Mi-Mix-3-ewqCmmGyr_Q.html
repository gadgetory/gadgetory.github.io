flagship playing field played last year
so I hope you don't mind me sliding it
into your sub box right now I'll slide
my razor blade through the top plastic
to convince the unboxing and then slide
the top half of the box off revealing
the xiaomi me makes three a non
motorized sliding phone with hidden
cameras between the two sliding halves
can a sliding phone be durable let's get
started this is one of the more
interesting phones have come across
lately
last year was full of surprising new
ways to hide the front-facing cameras
and get rid of notches my favorite being
d motorized pop-up cameras like on the
vivo NEX s this non motorized magnetic
sliding foam is another pretty valid
solution sliding leaves us with a wide
open no notch display I'm a fan
xiaomi has tested this slider over three
hundred thousand times with no damage
done to the mechanism being a Xiaomi
professional phone slider has got to be
a fun job the mean x3 is one of the
cheaper flagships these days and
interesting Li enough in the Box Xiaomi
has still included a full on wireless
charging pad which is super nice of them
an awesome example of a smart phone
manufacturer making it easy to
transition into a wireless ecosystem
Apple on the other hand announced their
version of wireless charging almost two
years ago and we still haven't seen it
yet maybe someday they'll catch up let's
start with the scratch test you know how
it works I have a set of Mohs mineral
hardness picks with different tips on
the ends these tell us what the screen
is made from plastic scratches at level
three while glass doesn't start
scratching till level six and we should
see ceramic and sapphires start
scratching at level eight or nine
getting a close-up look at the screen we
can see scratches appearing at level six
with deeper grooves at level seven this
puts us on par with most of the other
tempered glass screen flagships let's
check out the front cameras on the
sliding portion covered with glass there
should be no scratch marks from the
constant sliding motions there are two
cameras a 24 megapixel and a 2 megapixel
capable of doing that blurry portrait
mode background thing even while
shooting video which is interesting
there's a flash tucked in here on the
right as well the speaker grille is made
for metal
the grill on the top display portion of
the slider just allows the sound to pass
through from the actual speaker below in
the body of the phone the lower grille
is also very secure and won't be falling
out on its own if we shine some light
through the two halves of the phone we
can see there is some distance between
the screen and the body this is good so
that there's no direct rubbing on the
camera lenses but it does leave the gap
more vulnerable to something like a
grain of sand or dirt getting caught
inside and jamming things up it'll be
interesting to see how this slider phone
holds up over time and in everyday life
with Pocket lint and dirt there are
obviously two halves to a sliding phone
the top half containing the display is
surrounded by plastic the bottom half of
the phone is made from aluminum leaving
us with a shiny metal scratch mark
underneath the black paint this button
up here on the left side is a metal
customisable button it can launch Google
assistant turn on the camera or start
the flashlight thumbs up to show me for
customizability it also has a dual SIM
card tray but zero water resistance a
phone with this many openings and
surfaces makes it basically impossible
to keep water out the top of the phone
is made from metal along with the right
side power button and volume rocker the
bottom of the phone has no headphone
jack but does have a USB C and one last
figure the Xiaomi me mix series has
always had pretty solid build quality
and materials the original me mix having
an impressive full ceramic body the stem
around the fingerprint scanner is
invincible so we're off to a good start
and it looks like this rib texture on
the other side is going to give the may
20 pro some competition for the most
musical phone award so ceramic and glass
might feel the same but they're actually
totally different materials ceramic
being a much harder and more scratch
resistant even with my level 6 7 &amp;amp; 8
picks we don't see any major damage
until level 8 with the faint marks at
level 7
much better than a slap of glass
six hardness for how inexpensive this
phone is the materials accessories and
functionality are impressive the camera
lens is made from glass with dual 12
megapixel sensors one normal and one
telephoto so far this phone is checking
all the right boxes let's see what the
screen is made from I always could just
look it up on Xiaomi website to see what
they say
but lighters are just so much more fun
after about 20 seconds of flame on the
six point four inch naturalist display
the results are in a white non
recovering burn mark right in the center
means AMOLED which makes sense LED
displays are much thinner than LCD
displays and thinness as a factor with
the two sliding halves
speaking of thinness discovering how
well these two halves hold up under
pressure is an integral part of my
durability test it's time for the bend
I was nervous about this one since there
are more moving parts than a normal
smartphone would have I thought this
might be weak and while it does have
some flex it's still surprisingly sturdy
no creeks or cracks and more importantly
no damaged parts the Xiaomi me mix is a
well-constructed
solid device with premium materials and
a wireless charger included in the box
Xiaomi is definitely looking out for
their customers with this one and it
passes my durability test the Xiaomi me
mix is a win it'll be interesting to
take it apart and see how that magnetic
slider contraption looks on the inside
it subscribe if you haven't already it's
free and coming out with me on Instagram
and Twitter let me know what phones
you're excited to see tested this year
down in the comments thanks time for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
