old-school brick style cellphone but
you're wrong
it's a full-fledged texting machine with
a massive expandable full-size keyboard
released in 2004 the Nokia 6800 was the
first cell phone I ever owned and I
loved it I think we should open it up
and see what it looks like from the
inside let's get started back when I was
in high school
cell phones were just starting to get
popular even at 16 most of my friends
didn't have one yet since they were
pretty expensive one of my first
purchases after getting a job delivering
pizzas was buying this cell phone and a
monthly cell phone plan text messages
weren't unlimited back then like they
are now I had 300 text messages to send
throughout the month and I would keep
track of them to make sure I wasn't
sending more than 30 a day those things
were special with the keyboard like this
though how could you not constantly be
texting it's even backlit this phone was
ahead of its time for sure the Nokia
6800 had all the latest and greatest
features the messaging a 10 number call
history a note-taking app it even had
games two of them bounced was a good one
the 1.7 inch si s TN display was a
passive LCD matrix instead of a more
modern active LCD matrix so there was
considerable ghosting and a slow
response time not quite as good as the
ROG or razor phone - it does have a
calculator though the full-size keyboard
is the main selling point flipping the
phone in half allowed me to bypass the
normal t9 texting of my inferior peers
and get both thumbs rocking at full
speed while I enjoyed each of my 300
text messages every month definitely got
all the ladies with this one most scale
of hardness wasn't one of my main
concerns at the time although a little
scratch on my 2004 flagship probably
would have bothered me quite a bit I did
get over that fear eventually the screen
is made from plastic meaning that it can
get scratched by basically anything in
your pocket in fact the whole thing is
made from plastic just like every other
phone back then it never crossed my mind
to take my phone apart back in 2004
YouTube wasn't a thing back then but it
is now so here we are the information
under the battery acts like a warranty
void sticker yeah it doesn't hide
the Nokia 6800 has just to t6 cruise
down at the bottom and then the two
halves can unclasp using my plastic pry
tool along the sides then the whole
phone can come apart revealing some
pretty sweet stuff the keypad is pretty
typical of Ultra phones just a plastic
sheet resting on top of each individual
button this phone just has a full keypad
worth of those buttons the frame itself
is pretty interesting the flip portion
is connected with a springy hinge which
I'll show more of in just a second the
flat portion has little gold contact
pads that transfer information from
whatever position the keyboard flap is
in the gold just rests right up against
the motherboard inside the phone just
like we see loudspeakers doing in modern
phone nowadays thumbs up for that there
are five additional screws holding the
motherboard into the frame of the phone
then the whole thing including the
screen can pull out exposing the
old-school heat shield Faraday cage
looking things on the back of the
motherboard the same kind of thing we
found inside the indestructible Nokia
3310 the phone does still work when the
battery's held in place
look at these LED lights on the keypad
it's not actually a backlit keypad
justwell play singular LED lights that
are supposed to light up the whole thing
might be why I was a bit dimmer than
we're used to nowadays down here at the
bottom below the clear plastic LED
keypad light redirector we get the
proprietary headphone jack yep this long
golden contact pad lookin thing was that
phone jack the circular 3.5 hole was
actually for the phone charger times
were different the micro USB standard
wasn't introduced until 2007 and the USB
see standard we use nowadays was more
2014 a universal charging method is a
very good thing the vibrator motor is
also down here supported in the white
rubber sheath it spins the eccentric
rotating mass around really fast to
produce the vibrating effect I use this
phone for about two years before
switching over to my first camera phone
the sony ericsson case 608 i and then
finally getting my first smart phone a
blackberry pearl in 2009 I'll slap the
two halves of the phone back together
making sure I didn't install the
keyboard flap completely backwards
because that would be super embarrassing
while I'm back in here again though
check out the spring hinge as the
keyboard flips up to rest against the
top of the phone the springs allow the
hinge to flex up and
then pulls the whole flap tight again
back against the foam body with the four
springs and you should these little
squares pretty smart anyway the phone is
back together again pretty easy teardown
it was nice back when things weren't
always glued shut and everything had
removable batteries with easy access
screws and could be taken apart in
minutes instead of hours what was your
first phone and how old were you when
you got it
I'm curious hit that subscribe button if
you haven't already and come hang out
with me on Instagram
thanks stuff for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
