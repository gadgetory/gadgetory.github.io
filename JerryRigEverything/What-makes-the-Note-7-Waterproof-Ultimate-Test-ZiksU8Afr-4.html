waterproof I have a fully stripped down
no seven in front of me so let's see how
its sealed the note seven has an IP
rating of 68 which means that it is
totally protected against dust and
continuous immersion in water samsung
says as long as it is less than five
feet deep and in the water for less than
thirty minutes you should be golden
remember that Samsung has never said
that the phone is waterproof
just water resistant the terminology and
distinction between the two terms is
very important if your phone gets wet
and breaks the standard warranty will
not get you a new phone in the
itty-bitty print of your warranty
booklet included with your phone that no
one ever reads is this little tidbit
your warranty does not extend to defects
or damages to your device this includes
exposure to liquid crack screens or
physically broken charging ports so if
your phone gets wet dropped or plugged
in wrong you are out of luck unless you
purchased additional insurance on top of
your standard warranty so now that we
know the basics let's see how this phone
is water-resistant and how Samsung will
be able to tell that your phone has ever
been wet or not let's start at the
bottom of the phone there are a few
entry points for water down here
including the headphone jack the
charging port and the loudspeaker and a
new one the s-pen slot the charging port
and headphone jack sit down here at the
bottom of the phone held tightly in
place against the frame by three little
screws if these little screws are
removed and we looked at the headphone
jack itself we can see that the opening
is surrounded by a little rubber lip the
pressure from the screw holding it in
place will keep water out as long as the
phone is in less than five feet deep of
water any deeper and the water pressure
will be too great and liquid might seep
inside of the phone the back of the
headphone jack is sealed as well water
will be able to get inside of the jack
but it won't be able to transfer inside
of the rest of the phone the USB C
charging port is the same way it has two
little screws holding it tightly in
place and then a thick rubber ring
around the port itself so as long as you
aren't in water over five feet deep
water shouldn't be able to push itself
inside but the deeper you are in water
the more pressure there is and the more
risk the microphone is off to the side
of the charging port
and rests up against a little rubber
seal and a little water resistant screen
this has plenty of adhesive holding it
against the microphone hole in the frame
let's take a look at the bigger screen
next to it that is used to keep water
out of the loudspeaker as we know
speakers need air to function but there
can't be an airtight watertight
compartment for the speaker or else you
wouldn't be able to hear it so this
screen allows for air to pass through
but will not let water through the water
would rather stick to itself through
cohesion than to be cheese graded
through the screen and into your speaker
but you guessed it this only works at a
low water pressure if there is a jet of
water or you're in deeper than five feet
of water the liquid can still get inside
of your phone looking at the loudspeaker
itself here is the little hole that
rests up against the screen and the
metal compartment here is where the
speaker itself sits now how in the world
would Samsung be able to tell if your
phone has ever been wet you would be
surprised at the amount of people who
try to dry off their dead water damage
phone and say that it died of natural
causes but this little sticker doesn't
allow lies the stickers are placed at
the weakest points on the phone I'll
show you where the second sticker is in
a second but this one sits right between
the charging port and the speaker mesh
so if this sticker gets wet the little
red X is bleed out notifying anyone who
opens up the phone that you sit on a
throne of wet lies so what about the
s-pen compartment this has a huge hole
at the bottom of the phone that water
can enter it looks like samsung took
that compartment and sealed it up
entirely so water can surround your
s-pen but will not actually get inside
of the important part of your phone the
same adhesive holding the screen into
place holds the plastic lid on the s-pen
compartment so what about the other side
of the phone if we follow this extremely
thick and sturdy aluminum frame up the
side we can find the volume buttons
another access point for water that
needs protection if we pop out the guts
of the button mechanism we can see that
it comes in three basic parts the first
of which is the actual button itself
that comes in from the outside of the
phone the second component is the rubber
bit that the button presses into and the
curved little hook at the end of the
metal keeps the rubber pressed up
against the frame for the watertight
seal then the third and last part of the
button contraption is the electronic
part that plugs into the motherboard
this is the part that needs to stay dry
so the exterior button presses into the
rubber seal which presses into the
electronic switch maintaining the water
resistance thumbs up for this clever
piece of Samsung ingenuity now let's
check out the top of the phone the two
biggest holes we immediately see are the
SIM card tray and the
microphone the top microphone is using
the same type of screen that we saw at
the bottom microphone to protect against
the water now the SIM card tray has a
thick rubber seal surrounding the top
edge to keep water out even the SIM card
extraction pin has the same rubber ring
now remember how I said the Samsung put
those water damage indicators at the
weakest ingress points on the frame
here's another one right below the SIM
card tray and this one is actually
visible from the outside of the phone so
the representative who looks at your
phone won't even need to take it apart
to see that the indicator is tripped
this one does the exact same thing as
the bottom indicator if it gets wet the
x's will bleed out and go red indicating
that it is touched liquid sweats team
soda bodily fluids showers toilets
oceans legs bowls of cereal or anywhere
else that the phone tends to end up now
if we look at the screen itself we can
see two holes the earpiece and the home
button let's start with the earpiece the
little metal grille offers little to no
protection for the speaker itself just
the fact that it has little holes so the
water isn't super inclined to penetrate
but if we look at the earpiece speaker
we can see that there is a whole lot of
adhesive holding it in place and it also
has the same type of water-resistant
mesh that covers the front and the back
of the speaker so as long as the water
pressure isn't greater than 5 feet it
should keep liquids on the exterior
instead of the interior which is where
we want them the home button is pretty
simple the plastic under and around it
is pretty sealed so just a little bit of
extra adhesive around the button and
around the edge of the glass is
sufficient to keep the water out the
front glass and the back glass have a
ton of adhesive around the edges which
also helps keep the water out if you
watch my note seven tear down video you
know how hard it is get inside of this
thing it is very well sealed by the
screen and the back panel now that we've
checked all the ingress points on the
frame let's check out the most important
part of the phone the main board the
brain of your device now if you want a
truly waterproof electronics you can
coat the PCB or circuit board with a
hydrophobic spray the problem with this
hydrophobic spray is that it is very
time consuming to apply and it is pretty
expensive and would be very difficult
for Samsung to do on a large scale with
the massive volume of phones they
produce as we can see from this water
droplet on the motherboard it is
clinging to the circuits which means
that it is not coated with any kind of
hydrophobic spray so if water somehow
gets inside of the phone
there is a very real chance of
electronic failure electronics don't
like water and there is no internal
protections if any one of the entry
points along the edge of the frame is
compromised or fails due to a drop or a
crack in the glass or a dent in the
frame water will be able to enter and
potentially destroy your phone I
reviewed some waterproof headphones a
few days ago and this is what a
hydrophobic PCB looks like the water
droplets literally roll off and don't
cause any damage because they can't
cling and corrode or short anything out
in summary I definitely approve of water
resistant devices the added layer of
protection like water resistance helped
make the phone more durable and last
longer water accidents do happen and are
fairly common but you should only think
of it as a layer of protection and not
an invincible failsafe so swim and
shower with your phone at your own risk
the normal warranty will not protect you
I review the inside of every major cell
phone so if you have not yet subscribed
it is completely free and you can stay
updated on all the latest devices what
do you think about the no7 does the
water-resistant features validate the
price behind the scenes and extra
tidbits of information can always be
