and quality in your favorite 4K video
and then quadruple it.
It really is a different experience.
(upbeat music)
Every time I see a super big TV
like Samsung's new QLED
8K I'm always impressed
with the size and picture quality
but I'm always thinkin' how does it work?
And, more importantly,
how do you mount something
this big and massive to the wall?
Especially when it's so
thin and there's no gap
between the TV and the wall.
Today we're gonna find out.
Huge thanks to Samsung
for sponsoring this video.
- Let's get started.
- Over the past five to ten years,
TVs have hit quite a few
different resolution milestones.
You know, 720p, 1080p, 4K, and now finally
the latest and greatest 8K.
These super big TVs are
perfect for large spaces
or anywhere where
entertainment is the focus.
This 82 inch QLED 8K
isn't even the biggest TV
that Samsung makes.
They range anywhere from 75 inches
all the way up to the new 98 inch
that was announced at CES last year.
- [Zack] Think it's big enough Cambry?
- Pretty massive.
- It is possible to have the TV mounted
on like a cabinet or
an entertainment center
and the legs for the TV
are conveniently hidden
right here on the back panel.
Which is a pretty smart design.
The legs just lift up and out.
But we're not here to
set the TV on stands.
We're here to mount it to the wall.
Let me show you how to do that.
All right, so Cambry and
I, we've measured the TV
and we've kind of set tape up
in the general area of
where the TV might be
and now we just need the
professional's opinion
on if it should be raised up or not.
Do you want it higher or lower?
- I think it just needs to
be up a little bit higher.
- [Zack] So the way the no
gap mounting system works
on a TV this large is that
underneath these plastic panels
on the back of the TV
is a mounting location.
The TVs that are 82 inches and
up have two mounting points
and the no gap mount can fit
right in that little slot,
screw in with its screw and washer
and then it sits almost completely flush
with the back panel.
So this'll all start
comin' together in a second
but this paper we just stuck up
is a perfect template
for where the wall mount
is gonna to go.
So what we need to do right now
is drill holes into the studs
behind this wall so it'll support the TV
with the two mounts.
One little trick that I have learned
over the years is that if
you take a sticky note,
a little piece of paper,
and put it underneath where
you're drilling like this
it'll catch all of the dust
that is coming out of the wall
and make it so that there's less clean up.
There is a bunch of dust
and nothin' on the floor.
Now that we have all the holes drilled,
we put the brackets in place.
So before we can lift
the TV up onto the wall
there's two very important
things to keep in mind.
One is the connector cable
for the back of the TV
is fiber optic, meaning
that it's made of glass.
So any kink in the cable or
bend sharper than four inches
might break the glass
and that's the only form
of communication between
the TV and the console.
So don't bend that cable
'cause glass is glass and glass can break.
We can pull down each of these mounts
so they're ready to be
hung on the wall mounts.
And the second thing is
when we're lifting the TV
we don't want to put any
pressure on the surface
of the QLED 8K.
Especially since the bezels are so small.
It has this little protector
here along the side
that can come off.
But we're gonna remove it
after it's up on the wall.
Since hopefully we just
put this TV up one time,
we're gonna have a little
bit of fun with the wall
and leave little notes for
whoever comes after us.
- Nelsons, established 2019.
- [Zach] Nice.
100%?
- [Man] Yup.
- And the TV is on the wall.
- I did most of the heavy lifting.
- Now the TV's up on the wall,
let's see what it can do
with some of my own footage.
Now this massive waterfall right here
I shot with a 1080p drone
while I was in Africa.
Victoria Falls is the largest
waterfall in the world.
You can see the detail of the waterfall
and the little people
walking along the edge
because the Samsung TV is
taking my 1080p footage
and upscaling it to 8K
with its internal quantum AI processor.
This pod of dolphins was shot in 4K
using a handheld camera,
along with this turtle
also shot in 4K, currently
being upscaled to 8K.
This plane wreck was also
shot with a 4K drone,
currently being upscaled to 8K.
You can see each individual tree
and the plane wreck right in
the middle of all of them.
So even though there
might not be a whole lot
of 8K content available right now,
it's not a big deal
'cause the TV generates its own 8K content
with whatever is displaying
and it's doing a pretty good
job with my own footage.
So you might be wondering,
what's the difference
between OLED and QLED displays.
Some people might say that a TV is a TV
but there's actually a
difference in the technologies.
OLED displays are made
up of little, tiny pixels
that light up on their own
which kind of limits
how bright they can get
without losing their color.
QLED is made up of little quantum dots
that are backlit by LEDs.
Meaning that QLED can get much brighter
than a typical OLED.
Pretty interesting stuff.
So there used to be a
projector on this wall
since the wall is so large
but this 82 inch super
big TV is more than enough
to take up the space of where
the projector used to be.
And it's even better because the TV
can operate in light or dark environments
where a projector just
has to be in the dark.
Let's talk about resolution for a second.
Most smart phones these
days, iPhones and Androids,
are in this realm, 720p and 1080.
Most computer monitors and
TV screens are in this realm,
1080p and 4K.
But Samsung QLED 8K is in this realm.
Literally on the bleeding
edge of technology.
Each jump in resolution is associated
with more definition and
better picture quality.
8K is the closest thing we have right now
to real life, which is why
it's more of an experience
instead of just watching.
There are a lot of pixels in this TV.
It would take four 4K displays to make up
the pixel density of this one 8K panel.
So what happens if you don't want
a massive, black rectangle hanging
in the middle of your wall?
Samsung has added a stealth mode
or something they call ambient mode,
which makes the TV
mimic the wall behind it
or display pictures or photos
or even personal albums
as kind of like a screen saver of sorts.
But it more allows your
TV to kind of be a window
to the outside world instead of just,
you know, a black TV.
And, more importantly,
QLED does not have the same
burn in problems that OLED has.
Along with being a smart TV
with access to the internet,
the QLED 8K has the Apple TV app
and Air Play built directly in.
No external hardware is needed.
The new app brings over
100,000 movies and TV shows
and you can subscribe to premium channels
like HBO and Showtime.
You can also use any
smart phone as a remote
with the QLED 8K and all
your favorite content
from the Apple TV app is
available on Samsung QLED TVs.
So, Cambry, now that we have
the whole thing up on the wall
what do you think of it?
- I think it's pretty amazing.
It's huge and brilliant and I'm excited
to play some video games.
- Going back to the gaming
we talked about earlier,
this TV has Radeon FreeSync installed
which means it has variable refresh rates.
So, not only is it good for gaming,
but it also upscales
whatever game you're playing
whether it's 1080p, 4K, it
upscales it all the way to 8K.
Rumor has it that the next
gen video game consoles
are gonna be in 8K.
Cambry and I played for like
eight hours one Saturday
so if I'm ever slacking on
videos you know where I'm at.
- You can't blame me for that.
- Groundbreaking, leading
edge technology like this
is always fluctuating in price
so I'll leave a link in the description
so you can check out the current pricing
of the QLED 8K whether
you just want to check out
the current pricing or
actually get one for yourself
you don't have to mount
it yourself, though.
There's lots of professional options
for mounting a TV this large.
Huge thanks to Samsung
for sponsoring this video
and, Cambry, do you remember
how we finish things off?
- And we'll see you around.
- Thanks still for watching
and we'll see you around.
- Aw, man.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
