how to take a part in xbox 360 to pop
off the faceplate just kind of grip
around the edges and just pry up and
away there's a series of clasps
underneath that are holding it down the
side face plates have two little notches
that you're going to slip some tools
inside of could be a screwdriver it
could be a pry tool and it just lifts
the edge of the faceplate up so you can
grab it once you have a little bit of it
up there are there six clasp around the
outside three on each side and what you
want to look for is the two white holes
that are filled in and press in between
those two holes and that will release
the clasp I'm using a pair of tweezers
but you can use a toothpick or a needle
and then you can see little grooves that
are popping up and away on this side you
can see it just a little bit better
between the filled in holes that's where
the little clasp resides I've gotten
those three up now this other three on
this side pressing the clasp in and then
up pops the faceplate now the front of
the Xbox has these little clasps they
have to lift up just using my little pry
tool to wedge them up and half of the
plastic pops off flip it over and then
there's a series of latches along the
back of the xbox so you have to worry
about so take your little tool that
you've been using the whole time and
press it into the little groove and that
presses down a little tab which releases
the plastic and you'll get a better view
here in a second all you're pressing on
is that little niblet on the end of the
tab but you can see how the whole entire
tab works as long as you're pressing it
down it will release and now the bottom
of the xbox will become loose and you'll
see two giant X's how creative is that
there are six screws holding down the
bottom and they're super long so if you
take out a screw and it's not super long
put it back in or else your Xbox will
fall apart now here is the eject button
just pulls up and away from the Xbox
and now we're pulling off the top
plastic bit it was being held down by
those six long screws and the front
faceplate if the drive comes up and off
and then the drive itself is held in by
two cables if you're replacing your
drive make sure you get the correct
model number of it I believe there's
five different manufacturers and if you
buy the wrong drive then it will not
work with your Xbox so make sure you get
the right model number when you're
purchasing that amazon has tries for
pretty cheap I will link those in the
video description below as the heatsink
it is being held together by these eight
screws along the bottom as well as the
metal plate held down by the rest the
screws I'm not going to take apart that
you seen today just because you have to
repay Stahn there to help the
transmission of heat but I will show you
how to remove the plastic shroud between
the fan and the heatsink and then the
fans themselves are just held in by two
little clasps along the top and then
they'll slide out the two little pen
slots down at the bottom and then
there's a wire connector powering them
from the mainboard
I'm going to wedge my tool down in on
the little latch and then lift up the
little plug with my other hand there's
some pretty cool modded fans on Amazon
that I'm going to link in the video
description below you can check out they
just shine with blue lights I believe
there's any color green red so check
those out if you're interested and
that's it if you have any questions make
sure to leave them in the comments below
don't forget to like if this video
helped in don't forget to subscribe I
put a videos fairly often I'd love to
see you around thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
