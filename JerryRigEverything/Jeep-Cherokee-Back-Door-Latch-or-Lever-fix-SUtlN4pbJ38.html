Cherokee the back latch has been
malfunctioning it hasn't been able to
open up from the outside so what I did
is on the inside I took out this panel
and that goes around the outside of the
window um it was pretty hard to get out
just because it's not made to come out
when the doors closed
I'm is supposed to come off when the
door is open
anyway it's with little the little
pulling and I think I might have snapped
something but it came out anyway as far
as the lock mechanism goes what the
problem is is that this part right here
isn't stationed far enough far enough
down on it so it'll pull up and let go
out a latch and open the door so now
once I'm inside with this latch
mechanism I can open the door just fine
so I'd figure out in some way with this
to position it higher up about there and
make sure that it stays there so that it
doesn't come off when when you try to
open the door without much pressure
anyway so I'll try to jerry-rig
something up here alright so I took two
zip ties some and tightened them pretty
tight over the whole thing in the back
and the front and the sides to keep it
pinched in on the on this metal bar so
hopefully that fixed it we'll give it a
shot
so before hand every time I were to open
up the spec lever
um it would just it would go up far
enough it wouldn't just it wouldn't
unlatch like you'd almost hear it
unlatching but just wouldn't get far
enough so that's why when I scooted that
bar up it gave it enough leverage to
actually open up the entire the entire
back door mm-hmm go see the latch pull
up then watch the screen if I try it
like 20 times now I'm and everything's
working out pretty well so put the back
panel on and call good okay so now you
can see what I broke or what screws I
broke on the inside so here this one
snapped off this one snapped off I'm I
couldn't reach that either those two
were never there so those would have
broken as well though at
you need to release your door this one
broke and those two are fine they asked
those are all the screws you have to
worry about them on the back door panel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
