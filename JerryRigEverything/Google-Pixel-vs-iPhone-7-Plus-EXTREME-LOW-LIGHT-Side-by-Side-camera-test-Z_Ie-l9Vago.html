of the Google pixel up against the 4k
video camera on the iPhone 7 plus both
of these flagships have top-of-the-line
cameras so no matter what phone you buy
it's going to look pretty darn good but
there are strengths and weaknesses with
each one I'll be highlighting those
throughout the video at the end of this
video it's your job to tell me which
camera you like best in the comments
since the best camera really boils down
to personal preference this extreme
low-light shot is taken from the World
Trade Center Memorial each image looks
pretty identical until I finish panning
up to the top of the building and the
pixel decides to up the sensor
sensitivity brightening the sky while
the iPhone keeps the sky completely
black so the sky looks better on the
iPhone but the darkness also gives the
building a little less detail looking at
the same shot during daylight I feel
like the colors are true-to-life and
nearly identical on both phones in each
corner of this video you'll see that I
have the resolution and the bit rate of
each camera the higher the bitrate
number is the more detail and
information the camera image will have
the display so it's important to know
I'll do a front camera test really quick
on both phones are filming in 1080p
right now
the bitrate is also still listed in the
corner with the front camera the pixels
doing a much better job of keeping the
sky black and maintaining detail in the
building I'm really glad that Apple
finally decided to upgrade their front
camera resolution from 720 to 1080p it
really was a joke that we had to wait
this long to finally get some real
resolution with that front camera
neither phone appears to have any
stabilization on the front camera but
that's mostly typical across all smart
phones the pixel does appear to do a
slightly better job of maintaining
detail in the shadows but like I said
before for the most part the cameras are
pretty identical during daylight the
low-light shots where we start to see
some major differentiation between the
cameras the iPhone has that true black
sky which I really like
but the pixel does have a bit more
detail even if there is a little extra
noise in the image the water and the
Brooklyn Bridge stand out really well
this particular daylight shot looks a
little more colorful on the iPhone side
of things the color of the bridge stands
out just a bit more the pixel image is a
little more flat
remember that this is the dead of night
the dancing green dot you see on both
cameras as either aliens or just a light
reflection off the inner lenses of the
camera the next big differentiation
between the cameras is the rear image
stabilization during video the pixel has
electronic image stabilization or EIS
the iPhone has Hardware stabilization or
oh is in this shot the pixel is trying
to use software to stabilize all the
little lights you see in the buildings
while I walk and it's not working out
too well the EIS is enabled at 4k but
the lights are still pretty jittery for
this segment I changed both of my camera
settings to 1080p to see if the
stabilization would get any better on
the pixel and I still prefer the image
coming from the iPhone 7 plus as far as
stabilization goes at night anyway
Hardware stabilization will usually
always win over electronic stabilization
it is incredibly difficult for the pixel
to stabilize all of those little lights
at night but when I switch to this
four-story tall little ripped alien Hulk
baby the pixel image appears to be even
more stabilized than the iPhone so EIS
has its strengths and weaknesses but I
still prefer the hardware stabilization
that is OIS but luckily everyone gets to
decide for themselves what their
personal preference is one feature that
the iPhone 7 plus has is an extra camera
on the back for zooming in on stuff I'll
be testing this out on the Statue of
Liberty that you can see from lower
Manhattan
zooming in all the way on both
cellphones it takes a minute to focus
during the night but you can see that
the iPhone can get a lot closer than the
pixel does with that extra lens during
the day you can see a little better how
well the image detail is preserved
during the zoom look at the water
clarity and that little sailboat next to
the statue and then the people on jet
skis that zoom is a really cool feature
just a reference I'll zoom back out
again so you can get a perspective of
what the phones are really capable of 4k
footage with that kind of zoom is
incredible here is the last day and
night comparison in Times Square before
I jump into the close-up shots and slow
motion like before the camera image is
almost identical on both phones until I
start panning up the iPhone can't decide
what to do with the bright sky so it
darkens the whole image it does this
twice on me it's not just a one-time
fluke
the pixel completely washes out the sky
as I pan up this is a difficult
situation for any camera so it's
interesting to see how they both behave
the nighttime shot does equally well on
both phones there is enough light here
so both phones are able to preserve the
blackness of the sky the pixel does
glitch a bit during the pan down and
this is probably due to the software
stabilization trying to figure out what
I'm doing with the phone
here's a quick close-up shot of the
metal grate on the Brooklyn Bridge the
wires are in focus and the street below
is pretty well blurred on both phones
after you watch the slow-motion footage
I'll be leaving a poll question in the
upper corner of the video that you can
answer and tell me which phone you think
is best then you can tell me why you
thought the phone is best in the
comments below this video so here's the
slow-motion footage each phone can do
240 frames per second at 720p you can
see that the pixel does have a slightly
higher bitrate than the iPhone 7 which
is a good thing but let's see if that
actually matters in this case the detail
is pretty similar between both the
images but if we pause the video and
zoom in on this random person in blue we
can see that the pixel is capturing
sharper frames than the iPhone look at
the face and the reflection of the bars
inside this window so now tell me what
you think which cameras best let me know
in the comments I post more camera image
comparisons on my Twitter and Instagram
and I have a whole playlist of videos
like this comparing every other major
smartphone that's come out in the past
year thanks ton for watching I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
