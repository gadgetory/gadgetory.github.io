and take a look inside of that crazy
variable aperture camera unit my phone
has been through a lot lately and it's
not quite over yet let's get started
you've already seen me open up glass
backbones a million times so you know
the drill
heat is your best friend glass is glass
and luckily replacement panels are
pretty cheap if you accidentally break
one or if you managed to scuff up the
paint on the underside of the glass ad
brand skin is equally inexpensive I'll
link all that stuff down in the video
description let's get to the good stuff
there are 15 screws holding down those
black plastics and the wireless charging
coil I'll pop off that coil the center
plastic and the bottom loudspeaker and
then I'll unplug the battery there's
some very strong adhesive holding this
battery to the frame of the phone you
can see how it bent my pry tool trying
to get this thing out I'll soften up the
adhesive a bit with my heat gun and give
it another shot prying out that 3000
milliamp hour battery it's the same size
of the previous Galaxy s8 samsung claims
95% battery capacity retention after two
years meanwhile Apple says plan for a
20% drop in capacity about every year if
they don't manually throttle you first
anyway you know you sign up for the
screen ribbon unclips like a little Lego
and then I'll make my way up to the
front-facing camera it's an 8 megapixel
HD are capable unit and pretty much the
exact same thing we saw in last year's
phone we'll get to the new stuff here in
a second but first I'll unclip the
volume buttons and these little signal
wires down at the bottom along with the
white and blue wire cables and then of
course the SIM card tray comes out with
its 400 gigabyte capacity SD card slot
it also has the water resistant rubber
ring around the opening the whole
motherboard can fold up and out of the
phone at this point allowing us to
access the final Lego style connector
attached to the bottom of the
motherboard for the charging port I'll
set the motherboard off to the side so
we can tear open that camera unit in a
second the interior of this phone is
solid metal samsung must anodized the
entire frame at the same time because
it's all painted the same color inside
and out but you can see the metal
shining through the scratch marks
underneath it's a very very solidly
built phone there is a long copper heat
pipe to help keep the processor cool and
then another copper sticker over some of
the front-facing sensors
and lastly a water damage indicator
right up here by the SIM card tray this
is how Samsung knows if your phone has
gotten wet or not
remember the galaxy s 9 is ip68
water-resistant definitely not the same
thing as waterproof I would just plan on
keeping your phone dry it's got a little
circular coin vibration motor inside
with its little gold contact pads I
still need to make that vibrator
explanation video since there are
several types used in cell phones these
days so watch out for that one our
little buddy jack is tied in with one
screw and a Lego style connector here at
the bottom of the phone I'll release
those and pop him out then there are
four more screws holding down the
charging port into the phone frame
there's a little bit of adhesive under
there but the whole thing pulls up and
away pretty smoothly it's got a little
rubber ring around the USBC port to help
keep water out and the microphone holes
down here on this board as well now if I
was going to do a screen replacement I
would use a ton of heat and basically
break the screen off of the phone frame
there are massive machines that can do
this safely and salvage the display if
it's not already damaged but without
those machines just plan on the screen
breaking completely during the removal
process and then installing your new one
let's jump into one of the major
improvements on this Galaxy S 9 the
camera I don't tear down cameras very
often but I'll make an exception for
this one after popping it out from its
slot in the motherboard we can see a
couple things first we still have that
optical image stabilization that oh is
that help keeps video footage looking
super smooth but that's pretty common
now I'm interested in this variable
aperture you know the little gizmo that
physically changes how much light can
hit the sensor at a given point popping
off the metal protective housing we can
see that this aperture variation happens
on the exterior of the lens since I can
touch it here with my tweezers and the
control mechanism for that aperture
happens over here on the left hand side
of the lens where I can manually open
and close the little circle by sliding
my tweezers up and down on the internal
switch of course all of this happens
electronically automatically inside the
camera it would automatically switch
from one point five to two point four
depending on the lighting situation on
hand but it's cool to see the hardware
side of things during a teardown thumbs
up to Samsung for doing something new
visit the same hardware you would find
in a professional DSLR camera Apple is
usually about two years behind so you'll
see this in an iPhone around 20
funny we aren't done with the teardown
though I'll pop out the lenses from the
housing to reveal the camera sensor
underneath this multicolored 12
megapixel rectangle is what receives the
light through the lens and turns it into
an image for your phone one last look at
the switch on the side of the lenses for
the aperture movement that switch
including the optical stabilization our
most likely accomplished through magnets
as you can see each side of the lens has
a little magnet attached that attracts
this screw and each magnet lines up with
the copper coils inside of the housing
pretty cool they help keep things
balanced and stabilized
I'll start reassembling the phone the
camera won't ever be the same since
there are some tiny little stabilizing
rubber balls inside that escaped when I
took it apart
luckily replacement cameras are pretty
inexpensive so I'll just buy another
when replacements become available the
charging port is in place and screwed
down and if we look up here on the Left
we see Bixby's little home it's got the
one button and a little ribbon with some
gold contact pads it looks pretty easy
to remove if someone wants to be
adventurous they can just pop the button
out or leave the button in place and
just rip off the contact pads so he
never works again I'm not suggesting
murder I'm just saying it's possible the
motherboard gets clipped in at the
bottom first with the charging port and
then set down into the aluminum frame of
the Galaxy S nine if you noticed I'm
leaving the camera unattached right now
but the phone should still work without
it front facing camera is plugged in and
then the screen ribbon is clipped into
the motherboard like a little Lego along
with the three little signal wires at
the bottom now one more subtle
difference between the s9 and the s8
that you probably won't hear anywhere
else is about the camera flash it's
still a single colored LED flash but the
s9 has a diffuser in it while the s8
does not light diffusers are usually
preferred among photographers sense is a
little less harsh on the image and the
Galaxy S nine now has one in place not a
reason to go out and buy a whole new
phone of course but it is still
something new and I guess if I have to
be nice Apple has been diffusing their
flashes on their iPhones for quite a
while now anyway the battery is back in
place and plugged in along with the
headphone jack and this little screw and
this is the part where you would
normally get to plastics back on and the
15 screws screwed back into place but
since my phone has been torn down and
clarified a bit this portion of the
video is going to be a little different
I'll get some double-sided tape to hold
that glass back panel in place and after
clipping in the fingerprint scanner I
can see if the whole phone
works or not it turns on even without
the camera unit in place and the whole
thing appears to be working it finds
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and the front camera
works but as soon as I flip it to the
rear camera the camera app dies with the
camera failed warning probably because
it just doesn't exist anymore but yeah
if you're bored of a normal looking
phone make sure you check out the D
brand link in the description show them
some love for supporting my channel and
build your own phone by clicking that
link
I think this camel skin is pretty sweet
thanks for joining me on the teardown of
the galaxy s 9 and if I've earned it hit
