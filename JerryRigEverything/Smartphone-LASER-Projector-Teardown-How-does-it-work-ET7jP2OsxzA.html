Max 1 – the $400 Android smartphone with
a builtin 720p laser projector.
The smartphone can broadcast whatever is on
your phone screen onto a wall or ceiling.
Phones are getting pretty cool.
Turns out Samsung had an Android projector
phone that came out about 7 years ago called
the Galaxy Beam, so the technology isn't entirely
new, but it is improving.
Today we're going to see what it looks like
from the inside.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
Taking apart the Blackview Max 1 is pretty
straightforward.
Glass backed smartphones are kind of all built
the same.
Heat softens the adhesive surrounding the
back glass, and then my handy dandy razor
blade can slip it's way between the glass
and the metal frame.
It's a tight fit.
Is there a safer way to do this?
Probably.
Once the adhesive is cut all the way around
the outside, I can lift the back glass up
and away from the frame, exposing what very
well could be the most boring looking clear
phone of all time.
I'll lift up the NCF pad and then pull away
the black tape over the black plastics, revealing
17 normal Phillips head screws surrounding
the singular black plastic chunk.
Before the large plastic panel can be removed,
strangely enough, we have to take off the
camera lens.
This singular camera protector is made from
glass and machined aluminum and is also covering
up the fingerprint scanner and dual tone LED
flash ribbons – both of which need to be
peeled off the back panel before it can be
lifted up and pulled away from the phone.
Which then gets us our first look inside.
We can see the large silver laser projector
box up at the top.
I'll take that out in a second.
The main rear camera is a 16 megapixel with
no optical image stabilization.
I'll unplug the battery and the rear NFC pad
and lucky for us, even without any magic pull
tabs, the whole battery can come out of the
frame pretty easily.
Nice of Blackview to make it removable.
It is a 4680milliamp hour and can supposedly
run that top projector for about 5 hours.
I'll unclip the bottom extension ribbon and
two more ribbons up at the top, each unsnapping
like little Legos.
And then I'll pull out three more screws.
The top motherboard can pull away after that,
revealing two motherboards.
We've seen a lot of manufacturers do this
sandwich motherboard thing lately.
Apple and Asus are also using this stacked
motherboard design to save space.
Now we can get a closer look at the internal
projector module for the Max 1.
This little guy contains 3 different colored
lasers, all working in tandem to project pictures
and video at the top of the phone.
Personally, I think it looks best in the 45
to 50 inch range in a completely dark room
of course.
Projectors will never quite be as bright as
a TV.
Blackview has said it can project up to a
200 inch screen size, but as we saw in my
durability test, it gets kind of faded after
50.
The metal housing is completely sealed shut.
I'll still take it apart at the end of the
video, so sit tight.
The bottom of the board has a few more screws,
and the side button ribbons that communicate
with a latch style connector, and I'll also
take out the dual SIM and SD card tray.
After removing one more ribbon cable down
at the base of the motherboard, the second
motherboard can be lifted up and out of the
frame.
It has a few ribbon connectors on the back
side which makes the teardown and reassembly
much more complicated, but I doubt many people
will be attempting this particular repair
since the Max 1 isn't a mainstream phone,
and probably won't have any replacement parts
available.
The dual front cameras are back here: a 16
megapixel with its .3 megapixel sidekick used
for depth sensing.
The earpiece, strangely enough, is soldered
to the main board.
Usually it is detachable and the circular
vibrator is also soldered on.
The rear camera has it's own latch style connector.
The bottom charging port board is very securely
glued into place.
It's got the normal USB-C connector and instead
of gold contact pads for the loudspeaker to
rest on, it has two massive gold contact pins.
Those pins rest up against the contact points
on the back plastic housing for the loudspeaker.
It's kind of an interesting design.
You know that usually when I take apart phones,
I like to keep the phones in working condition
when I put them back together.
Lately I haven't succeeded very often, but
that's mostly because the internal components
of recent flagships are so unique and so cool.
I have to completely destroy the phone to
get a good look at them.
I was torn with this projector phone...should
I take apart the laser?
Should I not take apart the laser?
Well the phone kind of decided my course of
action all by itself.
See when I put the phone back together expecting
it to turn on, all I got was a super dim logo
on the screen and nothing else.
Just a sleepy Blackview Max 1 that wouldn't
wake up entirely.
And so since he wouldn't wake up, I'll take
the slightly darker approach and just put
it to sleep entirely.
I do not recommend applying this motivational
approach to small children or grandparents.
I pulled the projector module from the internal
phone guts, and since it very specifically
said “do not remove the cover” on the
top, we're gonna remove the cover on the top.
Peeling back the thin metal covering reveals
some super interesting stuff.
Blackview says this laser projector is combined
with micro-electromechanical technology which
uses 3 different colored loser beams shining
together to form images.
We can see the three different colored lasers
over here on the side – each one shining
directly forward.
The beam then gets redirected into a glass
prism and then angled outward out the top
of the phone.
I imagine this black box over here in the
side is the brains of the operation.
This controls the auto focus, the angle of
the screen, and the location and brightness
of the individual laser beams.
It takes some seriously intelligent people
to think this stuff up.
The fine-tuned engineering sitting in this
very small machined aluminum box is some next
level stuff.
The technology has been around for a few years
already, but it's improving, and I'm excited
to see it again in a smartphone.
The more things a smartphone can do, the more
useful it becomes as a tool.
And I'm a fan of features.
If you had to pick between a projector inside
your phone or a fold-able smartphone, which
would you choose?

I have some cool videos on the way.
And come hang out with me on Instagram and
Twitter.
Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you
around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
