game are back its 2017 and one of
Nokia's newest phones is a blast from
the past it's time to open it up and
review it from the inside and see what
makes it so durable let's get started
it's quite refreshing to pop off the
back of the phone and see a removable
battery and some exposed screws after
taking apart so many water-resistant
glued shut phones lately this is a
welcome sight the exterior back panel is
very securely clasp around the plastic
frame and then there are six t5 screws
holding the mid frame to the front panel
after those screws are out there's
another series of six clasp holding the
mid frame in place all of these little
secure contact points help keep the
phone structurally solid on the back of
that white mid frame we have the flash
with these two golden contact points for
the motherboard and the loudspeaker for
those luscious snake game sounds we were
listening to earlier the motherboard is
pretty simple all by itself the microUSB
charging port is soldered on to the
frame up at the top all on snap the
screen ribbon cable like a little Lego
and then the whole motherboard is free
from the frame the 2 megapixel cameras
next this cute little guy has another
Lego light connector and it's also
clamped in place by a little metal
bracket but it's still totally
replaceable it does not have oh is but
at this price point I don't think any of
us expected it to I'm just happy that
the 3310 has a camera now the cameras
all clip back into place the headphone
jack is down there at the bottom
soldered on along with the battery
contact points flipping the board around
shows us the brain to the keypad with
its own little ribbon connector these
also have the backlit LEDs that light up
the front buttons the phone is pretty
modular the sim n SD card trays are not
removable though above them we find the
notification vibrator for the Nokia 3310
it's rather small compared to the older
version of the phone
the older Nokia 3310 had a vibrator at
least three times this size these little
spinny bits are called an eccentric
rotating mass vibrator and while bigger
rotating masses will cause a stronger
vibration the smaller vibrator will
still get the job done I'll talk more
about vibrators in a different video
since there are quite a few different
kinds out there the keypad falls away
from the front of the phone easy enough
definitely know what
resistance anywhere but the screen
itself is very heavily glued in place on
that front panel surprise surprise it
can't be removed without a hot plate or
a high temperature heat gun which is
pretty standard and how most durable
foams are constructed these days
adhesive on the screen is a pretty
important and essential part of the
construction process I'll set the
motherboard back into place and clip
that mid frame back on to secure it and
finally get to 65 screws back in place
Gilder nokia 3310 used 86 bit so nokia
did drop down to screw size so while the
whole phone is entirely made of plastic
it's small form-factor
thick layers all sandwich screwed and
clasp together make for quite a solid
little brick I would not be surprised to
see this phone lasts until the next
remake of the phone in another 17 years
from now do you wish more phones had
removable batteries or do you prefer the
water-resistant trim that we have going
on right now let me know down in the
comments and come hang out with me on
Twitter and Instagram thanks for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
