the moment but it's only fair to
physically test the most powerful
Windows tablet the surface pro 6
Microsoft's flagship tablet was just
recently released running a full version
of the Windows operating system just
like a PC but in tablet form it's even
got a little guilt in kickstand let's
get started
this 2018 surface pro six is currently
$800 at best buy the exact same price as
the 11 inch 2018 iPad pro the base
surface does come with double the
internal storage though the surface is
also a tad larger with a twelve point
three inch screen instead of the eleven
and a bit thicker at 8.5 millimetres
first the 5.9 on the iPad pro the two
millimeter difference doesn't mean a
whole lot to the naked eye though
they're both very thin tablets but when
two pieces of Technology compete it's
only natural to compare them some of the
surface pro thickness stems from its
massive kickstand
we'll see what that's made out of in a
second but it's definitely no flimsy
Nintendo switch peg it holds the surface
pro and basically any viewing angle you
want let's start with that durability
test oh wait sorry the full file
management system just opened up let me
uh minimize that before anyone gets
jealous let's start with a scratch test
screens can be made out of a number of
materials plastic wood scratched level-3
glass would start scratching at a 5 or 6
and sapphire would scratched level-8
glass can have different compositions
tempered glass has the same hardness as
regular glass but is less prone to
fracturing looking at the imprints from
my Mohs hardness picks the glass does
appear to be a tad thicker than the
iPads but we can still see the pressure
transferring through the glass onto the
LCD below as I was finishing up the
level 7 scratches there was a tiny pop
and the entire length of the tablet was
hit with hairline fractures not a good
start
each fracture from the level 7 scratches
basically spidered out to the four
corners so a screen protector is
probably a good idea with this one the
surface pro 6 does not handle scratches
or damage very well the side of the
tablet has a proprietary magnetic
charging port it would be nice to see a
USB see over here but it does have a
full size normal USB port
along with the mini displayport for
external monitors and stuff all tucked
into the metal frame the bottom of the
surface pro six has its little docking
pins little gold circles that connect to
a keyboard the surface does allow you to
plug a mouse into the USB port just like
you would on a real computer the iPad
pro does not support amounts the frame
of the surface pro six is made from
metal but it's not anodized it's painted
making it slightly more vulnerable to
scratches I do prefer Apple's layer of
anodizing over this paint stuff the
power button is made from plastic along
with the volume rocker also plastic and
strangely enough the whole upper side of
the tablet is made from plastic one
place the iPad definitely wins is with
the camera and this surface pro only has
a five megapixel front facing camera
tucked under the glass with an eight
megapixel rear camera on the back also
protected with this little circle of
glass not overly impressive it does come
with an expandable microSD card memory
slot though which is a perk I feel like
a computer or tablet should adapt itself
to the user and not the other way around
the front facing speaker grills are
right next to our little headphone jack
buddy thankfully he's still around this
tablet has little useful perks all over
the place
each of the two front firing speakers
rills have a little bit of mesh over the
top but they're definitely secure these
two speakers are probably no match for
apple's four speakers but of course
we're still talking about tablet
speakers tiny speakers are always going
to be tiny speakers the back of the
surface pro 6 has quite a bit of real
estate Microsoft has been pitching this
tablet as a computer mostly because it
is and not so much of a drawing easel
but it looks like art can still happen I
turn the Microsoft logo into a cute
little turtle let me know what we should
name him down in the comments the
kickstand is made from metal you can see
the shiny silver glistening through the
paint layer there are two halves to the
back panel though
so a double session of our passage areas
now in order we have the same shiny
metal cover obtained here for the upper
portion so the build quality and
material is consistent on both halves
what should we name the shark I went
ahead and changed the background to a
more suitable aquatic environment for
the buddies we just created the surface
pro six is using a twelve point three
inch 1824 by twenty seven thirty six
resolution LCD display which has a few
more pixels than Apple's 16 68 by twenty
three eighty eight but who's keeping
track it lasted twelve seconds under the
heat for my lighter and then fully
recovered tablets are definitely in a
whole different construction class than
cell phones cell phones are by far the
most abused pieces of technology on the
planet but tablets are still mobile and
still should be durable the bin test is
next
remember the screen has already been
cracked from our scratch test when I
commenced the bend the surface pro has
some massive flex but does lock out and
incredibly still works trying from the
other side we get a very twisted tablet
but with no catastrophic damage bending
around to from the back pops the LCD
loose from the side adhesive you can see
the literal gap as the screen pops away
from the tablet but the whole thing is
still functioning it's pretty safe to
say that the surface pro six can handle
quite a bit more abuse than the iPad pro
it could very well just be a weight
issue the surface weighs 40% more than
the iPad and that weight definitely adds
to the structure it's still incredibly
light of course there's just more
structural material inside plus the
surface doesn't have any flaws built
into its weakest points like on the iPad
with its massive bend near the plastic
cutout and B crack exactly on top of the
middle microphone hole intentionally
adding structural flaws and a mobile
product is a bad idea
pretty basic stuff the surface pro 6
passes the bin test the thing that
probably helps keep things solid the
most though was the kickstand
extra massive metal plates securely
built into the tablet itself like a
structural brace you can't go wrong with
that let's do a quick jump inside
there's no question left over about the
build quality
I'll keep it all consolidated into one
video
neither of these tablets were designed
to be opened or repaired successfully
and that's a story for another day
warming up the adhesive does make it
easier to remove the display even though
it still gets sacrificed in the removal
process either way the interesting thing
to me though is that the surface pro six
and still holding on to life with it's
cracked lid up display while the iPad
gave up the ghost in the very first
second of the bin test finally pulling
the screen away from the surface pro we
get our first glimpse inside with its
massive snaking copper heat pipes and
big blocky batteries it's easy to tell
that there's more Hardware and structure
inside the surface pro then there is
inside the very flat elongated guts of
the Apple iPad Apple went for a thin
lightweight design and sacrifice
structure in the process while Microsoft
packed their tablet with guts and metal
not all tablets are created equal and
there we have it a full computer in
tablet form verse a smartphone in tablet
form to me the iPad pro is just an
overpowered hyped up flexible Netflix
machine it sure does make artwork look
good though hit that subscribe button if
you haven't already and come hang out
with me on Twitter thanks ton for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
