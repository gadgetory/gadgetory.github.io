charging port on your iPhone 5s it's a
relatively simple process there are two
pentalobe screws down here at the bottom
of the phone there will be tools and
parts listed down in the video
description below so go ahead and check
there if you need to buy a new charging
port or if you need to toolkit for it
lift up on your screen with a suction
cup and then I use a razor blade to
slide between the screen and the frame
of the phone and I also pry up just on
the frame of the screen to make sure not
to bend it and damage the LCD at all the
screen is really fragile so make sure
you only bend up around those metal
clasps around the outside of the screen
there's a little metal piece attached to
a ribbon cable down here so lift that
off and then unattach the ribbon cable
from that little clip down there at the
bottom it's similar to a Lego so just
unsnap that and then the screen will
lift up make sure not to fold it past 90
degrees otherwise you'll damage those
ribbon cables take out the four screws
that's holding down the metal plate lift
off the plate and then there's three
ribbon cables here attached to the
mainboard so just lift off each of those
three little cables similar to Legos
just unsnap them once again tools and
parts will be down in the video
description below so check those out
down here there is a bracket holding
down the battery connector take out
those two screws lift off the bracket on
and connect the battery I'm going to
connect this little wire cable down here
and then unconnect the cable that goes
to the charging port
there's also a little bit of glue that's
holding it down as well so just fold
that back
make sure not it can't get too much
there are seven screws holding down the
charging port so just take off every
single screw you see down there lift off
the loudspeaker you can see right here
on the corner it allowed speaker there's
a little metal circle thing that'll get
lost really easily so make sure you keep
track of that and keep it where it's at
and then here you can see where the
loudspeaker connects to the charging
port cable right now I'm disconnecting
the headphone jack and the microphone
from the frame of the phone you can just
kind of slide those away from the frame
of the phone that way they won't get
caught as you try to peel up the
charging port from the phone and I'll
show you how to do that here in just a
second you can see I'm using a pry tool
to kind of scrape away the glue down at
the bottom
try not to kink the cable too much and
also be careful where you pull on it as
well because it can rip so just make
sure you just pull it you know away from
the phone gently just keep working at it
if you need to slide your plastic tool
down in there some more you can just
make sure not to use a metal tool and
you should be fine
lifting it up and away from the phone
there are a few little metal parts
attached to the ribbon cable as well you
can see this one kind of came looses I
was lifting it off just set it back in
place blending up with the screws you're
ready to put it back on when the time
comes
here's the charging port itself if there
are any parts that are on your old
charging port that aren't on your new
one you need to move them over like
metal brackets or even the little rubber
boot down there by the microphone most
charging ports will not come with that
so just disconnect it from your old one
and then your new charging port should
have some adhesive that'll hold it in
place and allow you to snap it into the
phone right here on that little plastic
bracket pretty straightforward so now
that I have the new charging port in
place I'm going to go ahead and pinch
the earpiece and the microphone back
into place kind of like where they were
before I'm going to screw that part in
and then that'll leave me enough room
and enough places where I can maneuver
the charging port to get the loudspeaker
in place I'm going to screw that in as
well just to hold it in place and then I
only have four screws left for the
actual charging port
self wire cable clicks in battery cable
clicks in charging port cable clicks in
pretty straightforward
similar to Legos like I mentioned before
and then you can take that metal bracket
and just screw that down into place as
well like I said pretty simple repair
not a whole lot to it and then just
getting that screen back into place
there's those three ribbon cable
connectors right there as well and
remember any tools or parts that you
need are always going to be in the video
description so check that out get the
metal bracket back into place with those
four screws and now this you're gonna
hate this is the worst part trying to
get this guy to snap back in that little
hole again as long as you get it to line
up you can click it down like a little
Lego and then the metal bracket it just
wants to fly all over the place so if
you line up the back of it first and the
little grooves then you can pinch down
the front it's kind of like a little
door like a little latch that you can
snap down into place then line up the
top of the screen with the frame of the
phone and make sure it's snug make sure
it's all the way in the top where else
the rest of the phone won't snap down
into place so just run your fingers down
along the sides of the phone snap it all
in and make sure it gets in at the
bottom as well phone turns on and
everything looks good and make sure you
get those bottom two pentalobe screws in
place
and test out the charging port it looks
great if you had any questions make sure
to leave in the comments also read the
