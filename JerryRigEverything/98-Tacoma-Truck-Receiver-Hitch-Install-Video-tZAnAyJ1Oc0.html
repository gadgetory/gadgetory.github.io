Tacoma this is the extended cab with a
long bed anyway so basically what's
telling us right now is we have to take
off the rear bumper before we can put on
the receiver hitch these four guys we
need to 7/8 the 3/4 the 18 and the 19
millimeter there's two 18 millimeter
bolts down this end there's one here
than one on the inside and there's a 2
here already took this one out and
there's one eye here
and this just pops down
all right now the bumpers off got the
two license plate lights there all right
instructions say they have to take off
these bumper brackets right here there's
two bolts on either side there's one
right here and there's one inside of
there get a better view right there
anyway so take both of those off on
either side and then it says we can
mount the hitch right up underneath
there through these holes
all right here's all the hardware for
the the mount and it's very easy to tell
which ones you need because there's only
two of the brackets that go through the
holes this is for the next step and then
you use two of these there's six of the
same one because who's two of these and
then the two larger bolts and they will
end up going through this little hole
right down at the bottom all right you
can see the bolt this square washer the
round washer and then the nut and I'm
going to tighten all that down later
once I get all these holes lined up into
place and I lifted this up
I align because this is the lowest point
and the other narrowest point in the
whole back into the frame so I lined you
to the edges up with that just kind of
like pushed into place and because it
was so tight it just held it up held it
up by itself so I didn't even need
another set of hands so we're gonna
stick the rubber bracket back in that
bolt is already in place so I'm just
gonna slide this into there just like
that and this little guy I had to bend
just a little bit so that it would fit
between the thickness of the metal here
and here I'm so I had to bend that out
just a tiny bit and then much into place
leaving that whole open inside the
groove so I made a little mistake make
sure you put the new hardware in there
you see the bolt locking nut and then
the washer and then inside this other
hole I have the same bolt locking that
in washer this guy on this side
luckily I'm keeping everything loose
right now right position everything and
then once everything is positioned then
I'll tighten it down all the way okay so
we're just finishing up mounting the
bumper I have one of the little spacers
right here in between just because the
receiver itself pushes the bumper
brackets out the thickness of the metal
and so having this right here
compensates unless the bumper bracket
screw back into the bumper again anyway
so now everything is still loose like
none of this stuff is tightened down
none of the bolts at all and now that I
have everything back into place all the
bolts in now I can go in and tighten
them individually now that everything's
matched up together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
