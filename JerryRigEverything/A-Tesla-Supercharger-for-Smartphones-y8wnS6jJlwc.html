Tesla, the electric car company, has a fairly
unique lineup of branding accessories.
Yeah, they have the normal hats, shirts, and
mugs, but also this desktop supercharger for
cell phones.
Costing $45, I had to buy it so we could take
a closer look.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
A supercharger is a place where electric cars
can go to charge up really fast.
Tesla says this is an exact miniature replica
of the life sized versions.
They use the same 3D CAD data file from the
life sized superchargers to make the desktop
cellphone version, precisely replicating every
detail, curve and surface.
Unfortunately there are no instructions or
diagrams in the box, so we're just going to
have to wing this one.
Initially I thought that this $45 accessory
had some tech inside of it, but judging by
the lightweight and lack of documentation,
I'm starting to think I was mistaken.
The white and red surface are both made from
plastic.
The red lettering is not inlay-ed over the
surface like the Tesla key card.
The plastic is actually built deep into the
charger, like we saw on the Nintendo Switch
buttons.
Each of the red lettering is it's own solid
chunk of plastic â€“ pretty quality stuff.
The silver side rails are made from metal.
[Scratching metal sounds.]
It's the same on both sides.
Down at the bottom of the supercharger we
have a strip of double sided tape, probably
for mounting on a desk since this is a desktop
charger.
But there's still no sign of technology.
The bottom gray plastic pops off after a brief
struggle.
And then the top white slab of plastic is
also able to come loose, revealing a whole
lot of nothing inside.
It turns out this whole thing is essentially
just a model of a supercharger, and interestingly
enough, even at that $45 price point, it still
makes you supply your own charging cable.
I have an extra braided cable lying around,
so I'll wrap this inside the contraption.
It has a little indention up at the top where
the tip of the cable can rest inside and keep
it from falling out.
In hindsight, a thinner non-braided cable
would be easier to work with and probably
fit better inside the housing.
You can see how thick the red letters are
that poke through the top outer white shell.
And the same thing goes for the other side
with the red plastic resting inside for the
back lettering.
It's cool that Tesla went the extra mile for
this plastic molding, and didn't just slap
some red vinyl stickers on top.
Thumbs up for the quality.
But that's also probably why this thing costs
so much.
I'll wrap the cable around this plastic knob
like we saw on the Nintendo Classic controllers,
and then run it through the metal side rails
down to the bottom of the supercharger.
The metal rails have slits cut into the bottom
that orient and hold it tight when the plastic
halves are in place.
The top of the white plastic slides in and
clips down.
And the gray bottom piece of plastic has to
slide over the whole charging cable and clips
on to the end, holding things tight...kind
of like the cap on a stick of Old Spice.
They look almost the same.
It works though, as long as the other end
of the charging cable is plugged into the
wall, it'll charge my phone.
It's a rather interesting decoration.
It's supercharging powers are homeopathic,
maybe that's why it didn't come with any documentation.
But hey, it looks sweet and I'm down to support
a company that I think is pretty cool, even
if it's only supercharging my quick charge
with the placebo effect.
If you want one of these overpriced plastic
models of your own, I'll leave a link for
them in the video description.
And also, Tesla just brought back their referral
program, so if you end up buying an actual
Tesla with my link in the description, we
both get 1,000 miles of free supercharging,
so thanks for that.
I'm probably going to take my charging cord
out and just put this thing on a shelf for
decoration somewhere.
Come hang out with me on Twitter and Instagram.
And thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
