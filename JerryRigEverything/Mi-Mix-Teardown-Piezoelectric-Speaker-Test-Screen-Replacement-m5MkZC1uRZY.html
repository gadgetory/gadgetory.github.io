new bezel a smartphone from show me as
you can see this phone has no earpiece
I'll explain how and even let you hear
the audio quality of a phone call later
in this video as well let's see what
this thing is made of remember that this
whole phone is made out of ceramic a
super hard and brittle material that
scratches at an 8 on Mohs scale of
hardness because of this the back is
actually pretty hard to remove even
though there is no adhesive it is held
in place by a series of snaps and since
the frame and back don't flex my then
pry tool struggles to get inside I was
eventually successful though and the
back panel pops right off it's nice not
having to use a heat gun for a change
the fingerprint scanner has an accordion
style ribbon cable attaching it to the
motherboard so be careful not to rip
that there are 10 regular Phillips head
screws holding down the plastic shield
over the mainboard keep your screws
organized and I'll be linking a tool kit
and replacement parts in the video
description of this video once that
protective plastic is off the main board
we can unclip the fingerprint scanner
just like a little Lego then the rear
flash and camera lens on the back panel
are also replaceable at this point it is
important to disconnect the battery
first then we have the screen ribbon on
the left and the front camera and the
power button ribbons and the extension
ribbon for the charging port all
unsnapping like little Legos this clear
plastic is actually the earpiece right
here along the edge and I'll get to that
in just a second to remove the 4300
milliamp hour battery it has some of the
magical pull tabs at the bottom that
easily slide out the adhesive from
underneath the battery unfortunately
these are also very easy to break and if
they do break you must commence the pry
of shame taking immense care not to
puncture or bend the battery during this
pry because the batteries do catch fire
when punctured also watch out for these
extension ribbons under the battery if
you're wanting your phone to still
function after the battery removal
here's the rear 16 megapixel camera for
the me mix and judging by the fact the
lens does not move around inside of its
housing like on the Galaxy or newer
iPhones I'm going to say that it does
not have oh is which is unfortunate
xiaomi has used OIS on some of their
other phones though one more wire cable
to remove and then there is
little screw holding in the vibrating
piece of electric earpiece I should have
taken out the SIM card tray before I
started this teardown but sometimes I
get a little too excited the motherboard
is held down by a little latch on the
top left corner so unclip that and the
motherboard pops out now you can see
where the processor sits and some of
this thermal rubber stuff to help the
heat dissipation let's look at this
piece of electric speaker this is the
thing that makes noise by vibrating the
actual frame of the phone so during a
phone call no matter where your ear is
along the frame on either side front or
back of the phone you can hear sound
emanating from the device it's rather
weird I knew the most-asked comment in
the comment section would be hey Jerry
how does this vibrating earpiece sound
so don't worry I'm going to let you hear
for yourself so this is what the
earpiece sounds like from the iPhone 7
this is the standard earpiece that has
little tiny speaker inside and this is
what most every Android and iPhone have
inside of them and this is what the
piezo or believes electric speaker
sounds like inside of the remix
the speaker is making sounds by just
vibrating a little bit doesn't actually
have a speaker inside of it like most
other phones do so now you can tell the
sound difference between the two phones
while both speakers are clear and
understandable to me the me mix sounds a
little bit like the other person is on
speakerphone when they actually aren't
but it's still a pretty cool invention
and it's fun to see innovation in the
cell phone world the charging port
shroud is held down by five more screws
I'll remove that the shroud has the
loudspeaker attached to it as well
unclip two more ribbon cables and the
signal wire and we get to look at the
bottom microphone and the USBC charging
port it's nice that the charging port is
replaceable the five megapixel front
facing camera is also down here at the
bottom of the phone strangely enough and
it has the longest ribbon cable that I
have ever seen attached to a camera it
wraps all the way up the side of the
phone to the main board above the
battery pretty crazy one of the things I
mentioned during my drop test video was
that the ceramic frame of the phone
would be damaged easily during drops the
good news is the frame is absolutely
replaceable with 12 silver screws
holding it in place it can
pop off from the frame of the screen
replacement parts of this phone are
going to be hard to find since this
phone is limited production but it's
good to know that Xiaomi is planning for
the future if they mass-produce ceramic
phones the frame is replaceable very
smart they really need to include a
rubber barrier between the frame and the
screen though to minimize damage
transfer to the front glass Turing drops
speaking of the screen this is it it is
adhered to the mid frame and hopefully
Xiaomi will sell replacement screens
already attached to the mid frame but if
they don't you'll have to remove the old
display from the mid frame and attach
the mid frame to the new screen I'll
link any replacement parts that I find
in the video description but like I said
before they are going to be difficult to
find
I'll get those twelve screws around the
ceramic frame in place and then the
charging port can go back in its slot
down here at the bottom microphone holes
most of them are for decoration the mic
only fills one hole so make sure that
particular hole is never plugged up get
that wire cable plugged in along with
the two ribbons next to it and the
front-facing camera the plastic
loudspeaker and his five screws go down
on top of that then the piezoelectric
speaker gets set down before the
motherboard does there is a little pin
and a screw hole that guide it in place
the motherboard can be set down after
that clipping in the wire cable the
extension ribbon down to the charging
port the screen ribbon and the power
button ribbon and the front camera
ribbon then the rear camera can also get
snapped in and finally the battery
before putting the protective plastic
layer in place make sure that the
fingerprint scanner is also clipped in
just like a little Lego tin screws later
and you can take the ceramic back and
snap that into place make sure that the
phone is working first because getting
the back panel off if you forgot
something is a real chore overall the
show-me me mix has a solid build the
earpiece is very interesting and I'm
super glad that the ceramic frame can be
replaced
I wish the camera had OIS but at least
the phone is good looking my channel is
full of teardown reviews like this one
bonus points are following me on
Instagram and Twitter I post most my
behind the scenes stuff over there
thanks ton for watching I'll see you
around
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
