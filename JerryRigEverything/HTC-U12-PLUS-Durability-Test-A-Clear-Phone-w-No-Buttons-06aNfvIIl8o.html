it's pretty mandatory that I take a look
at HTC recently popped out their
translucent HTC u12 plus it's not
totally clear but it's definitely a step
in the right direction it kind of
reminds me of my gameboy color back in
the day getting a close-up look at the
internals we can see a bit of the
fingerprint scanner cable and maybe a
bit of the NFC we'll have to wait for
the teardown to know for sure but I
think it looks pretty sweet if you
remember last year's HTC u 11 it ended
up on my shelf of shame after shattering
during my durability test it was awarded
the least durable smartphone of 2017 it
died because there was no buffer between
the curved glass and the middle frame it
looks like HTC has corrected that design
flaw this year by flattening out the
glass and adding an intermediary layer
buffering the screen from the frame but
the only way to know for sure is to test
it let's get started
HTC has some very unique differences in
designs when compared with other
manufacturers but I'll get to those in a
second first we have the scratch test
HTC is also one of the only
manufacturers who's ever used a level
aid
sapphire screen on one of their phones
which is a very massive and impressive
accomplishment this particular u12 is
using Gorilla Glass 5 on the display so
it'll scratch at the very normal level 6
and the deeper groove at level 7 it's
pretty much what all flagships are
scratching at these days the u12 has
dual front facing cameras which is
interesting they are both the same type
of lens there's no wide angle just dual
eight megapixel cameras that do the
whole background blurring thing Marquez
does a good job of showing off the
cameras if you haven't watched his video
yet the earpiece is made of cloth and
while most manufacturers make it so the
cover will never fall out this earpiece
has just held in place with some simple
adhesive with time this might end up
falling out on its own there is no
buttons down at the bottom of the screen
but if we flip the phone over we find
dual cameras protected with glass a 12
megapixel main camera with OIS and a 16
megapixel telephoto lens which I'm a fan
of the more things a phone can
accomplish the better this one also
films in 4k at 60 frames per second the
plastic dual LED single color flash is
pretty flush with a back glass panel
you'll also see several microphone holes
which HTC uses to do some pretty cool 3d
audio while video recording is pretty
interesting stuff HTC also claims in
ip68 rating on the U 12 but with all of
these extra microphone holes and some
stuff I'll show you in a second I have
my doubts it'll work as advertised the
fingerprint scanner is invincible though
thumbs up for that now the sides of the
phone are where things start to get
interesting they are made from metal but
the buttons along the side are not
actually buttons they don't click they
are made for metal but surprisingly can
pop off the foam body kind of strange
now granted I understand that not
everyone takes a razor blade to their
phone but it is good to identify weak
points a normal button wouldn't do this
and once the capacitive button has
fallen off it doesn't work anymore
I really doubt this will happen to
anyone with normal use in real life but
a hard drop in the right spot might be a
problem I'm
a fan of this system and I'd rather just
have a real button now my phone won't
turn off and I can only listen to things
at full volume
HTC left their squeeze functionality in
place and even upgraded it to edge sense
- every time you short squeeze or long
squeeze the sides something will happen
personally I set my short squeeze to
open up my audible app because that's
just the easiest segue into the sponsor
of this video the book I'm currently in
the middle of is the Martian I actually
use audible quite a bit yeah there's a
movie but the book goes into way more
detail about how the guy stranded on
Mars
Jerry Riggs his way to survival and the
book is free with a 30-day trial by
going to audible.com slash jerry-rigged
or texting the word jerry-rigged to five
hundred five hundred if you're into
science and survival is pretty
interesting plus you get to keep the
book even if you don't end up using
audible after your 30-day trial it's
seriously a win-win text jerry-rigged -
500 500 or click the link in the
description audible.com slash
jerry-rigged the top of the phone as far
as I know does not have any touch
sensitivity but it is made from metal
the SDN SIM card tray is also made from
metal at the bottom of the phone we get
one of the two stereo speakers and a USB
C port but no headphone jack HTC has
chosen to continue in Apple's footsteps
some people like losing options but
personally it's not my favorite the HTC
u12 plus is rocking a 6-inch no notch
1440p super LCD display and lasted 10
seconds under the burn test the screen
did go black which is normal for LCD
displays and then the whole thing
recovers - the oleophobic layer of
course that just evaporates let's take a
closer look at this new buffer layer HTC
added between the glass screen and the
metal frame since my video last year
it's not made from plastic and it
doesn't feel like aluminium it might be
stainless but since the glass has flat
this time around it might just work and
keep the phone in one piece the initial
bin flexes the phone quite a bit which I
imagine is necessary because HTC needs
soft metal for their squeezes to work
flipping the phone over and bending
again we still get that same massive
flex and we see that the back adhesive
comes completely detached from the phone
the back glass is not structural since
it just rests on top of the frame but it
is important
the waterproofing and now the ip68 is an
IP nothing there is no shattering of the
screen though which is ideal
last year's phone was pretty much
obliterated at this point non-functional
HTC has done a good job of fixing that
particular issue the thing that makes me
doubt the ip68 water resistance is that
the back panel is able to be removed
super easily it'll probably never come
off by itself of course but it shouldn't
be able to be removed by hand this is
the weakest adhesive on a glass back
phone that I've ever seen but we'll save
the teardown video for another day even
though the side buttons can fall off and
the earpiece might fall out and the
weaksauce adhesive on the back panel
might not be water-resistant if you ever
sit on it
the HTC u12 plus probably has a great
personality just plop a case on there
and it should last a while if capacitive
buttons even work with a case I just
know I won't be using this phone if you
want to find out if the astronaut
escapes from Mars or not go grab your
free book from audible link is in the
description and come hang out with me on
Twitter and Instagram thanks ton for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
