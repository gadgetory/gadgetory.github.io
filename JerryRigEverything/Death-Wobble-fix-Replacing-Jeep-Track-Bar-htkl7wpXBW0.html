Cherokee the track bar on it has been
giving some play let me show it the
track so this is the track bar right
here
starts with this mount comes up curves
up around here and ends up right here
I'm attached to the frame so when I'm
turning this bearing right here has
about probably like a millimeter by two
millimeters of play in it so when I hit
a bump um it doesn't quite catch like it
doesn't it doesn't not doesn't stabilize
the car so it just starts like what you
call the death wobble so I'm replacing
the track bar and hopefully that'll fix
it well there's a few other things that
it might be but usually you know with
the death wobble I've heard they like 85
90 percent of the times the track bar
that's done that's doing it so I took it
to Les Schwab and they quoted me
probably about 300 bucks to fix it then
I went to a Riley Auto Parts and got my
own track bar for about 70 80 bucks and
what comes with it is just a track bar
itself this is the part that connects
the frame over there and that goes up
into the mounting block that we're just
looking at them so it'll be tighter
there on that little inner hole and then
you have these little connectors as well
which just basically makes it so you can
fill it up with grease or run so you
know smoothly and stuff anyway so that's
what we'll be doing today get the lower
point off pretty simple 2d attached it's
just a 15 millimeter bolt as I've been
there it's unscrewed it dropped it out
it's kind of nice because it has this
little gizmo in here that holds the
other nut steady so it makes a lot
easier now this other end is long it's
gonna be more difficult up inside of
there there's a bolt with a cotter pin
inside I'm gonna show you a picture
you
going to be a lot harder to get out
space cooler I'm out right now that
cotter pin you can kind of see the very
end of it sticking out through that a
little bracket right there I'm just
trying to get that out sprayed some
wd-40 in there
trying to straighten the cotter pin to
just pull it out I'm still working on it
alright out that little guy yeah
you got to use a one of these guys I
think it's called like a pickle bar or
something like that anyway um basically
all you do is you just tack it up in
there it's kind of like a pry bar of
sorts and you just pop that whole thing
down hit this in with the hammer a few
times and it will release that joint and
drop the track bar off finally go what I
found worked best is a coming at it from
like F well I had to level it out so I
put that in back in just barely tacked
it and then on this end I came at it
from a level side like almost from the
driver's side wheel and popped it out
that way that was easiest way I'm kind
of hard to get a good swing out with a
hammer but okay now whatever works right
okay so it's important when you're
installing the thing to make sure to
start with this side over here by the
passenger end the reason is because this
end is solid not the other end on it has
a pivot head so even if you're not
completely lined up with the hole you
can move the head around to fit inside
of it so start with the other end and
end up with this end with the pivot head
on it um once you're tightening it down
I believe is supposed to go to 25 to 35
foot-pounds of torque and then the other
one end up at 45 to 50 people were
saying online they start to break off at
55 pounds of torque and you know that's
not where you want to be so I think
that's about it you know once you
tighten them down you're good to go I
was remembering I do add videos pretty
often usually
one or two a week so I don't forget to
subscribe and like if this helped you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
