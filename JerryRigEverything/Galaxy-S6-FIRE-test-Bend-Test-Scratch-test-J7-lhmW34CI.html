of do yourself phone repair videos to my
youtube channel jerry-rigged everything
hundreds including this phone the
Samsung Galaxy s6 go ahead and click
that link if you're interested in seeing
what's inside of this phone every time I
get a new phone I'm curious to how
durable it's going to be how easy does
it scratch how far can it bend before
the screen cracks I'm sure I'm probably
not the only person who has wondered
these things so today I'm going to
sacrifice my phone for science the
screen on the galaxy s6 is made of
Gorilla Glass 4 I will link a pretty
sweet spreadsheet of the specs of the
Gorilla Glass 4 in the comments below
but right now I'll assess some real
world applications first of which is
rubbing my keys up against the screen
nearly every phone will have the
opportunity to brush up against metal
during its life whether in purse or a
pocket I know my purse is always full of
metal objects the keys pretty much did
nothing to the screen neither did a
Phillips head screwdriver now I'm going
to take a razor blade and my knife you
can see the screen flex from the
pressure that I'm applying with this
razor blade it's pretty impressive that
there's absolutely no damage done to the
screen so far I am NOT holding back at
all with the razor blade just making
sure I don't crack the LCD with the
pressure and besides that dust spec you
can see that there's literally no damage
done to the screen which is incredibly
impressive considering that I just
hacked away at it with a razor blade now
even though this test isn't completely a
real-world situation it's more just to
satisfy my curiosity what the metal
frame of the phone looks like under
flame the plastic frame of a phone would
probably melt a little bit or discolor
but with the metal frame once you wipe
off the smoke marks it's literally just
like it was when it was brand new let's
see how the screen fares underneath the
flame test so far so good
no discoloration or anything
the flame right up against the screen
everything is still working just fine
now what are we a like 20 or 30 seconds
with straight flame you can start to see
a little bit of discoloration in the
AMOLED screen here as the lighter is
pressed right up against there you can
see that little speck but if you wait 10
seconds or so the speck goes away
entirely so pretty impressive for the
AMOLED screen as well holds up to heat
pretty well I'm impressed you can see
that the speck is completely gone now
and everything on the phone is still
working so we're going to go and try the
bin test this was a huge problem when
the iPhone 6 first came out as well as
the iPhone 5 and 5s personally it seems
like the frame of the galaxy s6 is much
more rigid than the iPhone but we'll see
it'll be interesting to see what bricks
first the back of the phone or the
screen of the phone
everything is still working I'm going to
go ahead and try round two here I really
impressing as hard as I can to try to
get the phone to Bend you can see that
both edges of the phone are curving
backwards but yet the screen is still
functioning just fine
go ahead and try again pressing as hard
as I can into the back of the phone and
still nothing the phone doesn't bend or
I can't get all so far one more try
still nothing go ahead and try to push
it back the other direction see if I get
the back glass to crack or pop still
nothing one more try with the back I am
NOT a small person so it is impressive
that this phone can withstand this much
force in either the front or the back of
the phone is cracking even when I get
both hands into it you can see it flex
out just a little bit though on both the
front on the back as I'm pressing it
through now the only time that I did get
the phone to react as when I twisted it
and bent it at the same time putting
more pressure on one side than the other
that's when I got a little bit of a kink
out of the phone but everything is still
working it mostly looks like an LG G
flex which isn't exactly the look we're
going for but it's impressive that
everything is still working even now
that there's a kink in the screen it
still won't break all the way through
well I think this phone is survived
enough abuse for one day if there's any
interest I will do a drop test video
with what's left of the phone I'm going
to bend it back you can see that right
next to the SIM card slot it's a little
bit kinked anyway let me know down in
the comments below what kind of tests
you would like to see done on a phone
what kind of durability tests would you
like to see tested if you liked this
video go ahead and hit that subscribe
button it does help me out hope see you
around thanks for watching
