on my youtube-channel but I have a
friend who's exceptional at it today
he's going to show us how to fix a
MacBook that doesn't turn on and has
been water damaged let's go we're going
to be checking out a MacBook Air that
doesn't turn on it has a little bit of
liquid damage on it we're going to see
if we can make a work we just got to
take the board out of here before we can
get started under the microscope but if
we don't it'll burn the black plastic
over there so this I see over here is
the SMC resection so the SMC is powered
off at three point four volts however if
you try to power before 3.42 volts is
stabilized so this little 3.42 volt
supply over here it takes a second to
get to 3.42
but the SMC tries to turn on before then
it'll crash and not work and that's
what's most likely causing this to not
turn on so once we replace this and the
corrosion partitions around it hopefully
it'll work again so I'm going to remove
the old IC I'm putting some flux on
which is going to help the solder flow
we're going to take off this capacitor
that looks pretty nasty
and then this chip that doesn't look
very nice
right
and it's going to wick away some of the
old solder here
we're going to add some fresh solder to
the pads
hopefully you guys viewing at home if
steady your hands than I do but if
somebody tells you that you can't solder
because you don't have steady hands now
you know not to believe them we're going
to take the chip off of one of my trusty
donor boards see it's a beautiful donor
board right here so we can remove the
chip from this board
okay so this is going to go like this
now the way I know is that pin one is
over here and there's a little dot on
the chip right over here that gives away
that that's pin one
and that ship got destroyed that ship
actually burned on completely as I was
putting it on like just went up in smoke
yeah that's a good one let's try this
again yeah on live stream I can't edit
so people just watching laugh
okay I'm going to try to situate that
right where it's supposed to sit and
there's a little bit of a solder blob
there sorry put too much on the center
pad which is a mistake I know that
nobody watching is going to make because
you just watch me make it mm-hmm
and now the capacitor that I almost
forgot about we're going to put that on
there
mmm just to make sure that flows into
place add a little bit of flux and the
capacitor will find its own space
naturally
there we go all right so now we can
clean it up with a little bit of alcohol
and the disgusting chip works fine
whereas the clean chip killed almost
killed my board it's gonna spend on and
off on and off three times before it
finally finishes and turns off but yeah
that's it so that was really fun for me
to watch I don't plan on doing very many
board level repairs on my channel but
luckily we have guys like Luis here who
have a ton of videos how many videos you
have on you down 250 on board repair
that's incredible when you do mostly
laptops or cell phones a lot mostly
MacBooks um I found data recoveries from
you know the ocean the toilet nice so
I'm gonna leave the board little repairs
to him and I'll stick with the component
level repairs on my channel and if
something is not fixable you'll always
get to see what BIA do to finish it off
thank you to Kyle that I fix it for
sending us this lovely souvenir and
before we go there's one more thing I
want to show you Louis
what the heck is down here what is that
ah spare parts that is the graveyard the
motherboard graveyard that's all for you
that's your turn no no way house fire
maybe wow that looks terrible
yeah it's spare parts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
