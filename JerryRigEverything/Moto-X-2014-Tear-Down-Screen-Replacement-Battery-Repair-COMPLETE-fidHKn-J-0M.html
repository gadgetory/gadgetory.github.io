X - this is the second generation Moto X
that came out in 2014
go ahead and turn off the phone and then
use your little tool to remove the SIM
card and you can use that same tool or
any metal little stick to poke through a
little slot in the back of that hole to
pry away the back from the phone I used
it to create a little slot and it's
little late a razor down inside instead
to give me a little bit more leverage
once I had one corner up I was able to
pull it off and away from the back of
the phone you want to make sure to avoid
those ribbon cables along that left side
if you damage any of those you'll have
problems later on here's the back of the
phone and be careful when you're taking
off these little rubber protectors the
first one is on its way to Mars and I
still have not found it yet the second
one protects the battery connection you
don't need to take off these screws for
this repair but if you do the bottom one
has the little bracket for the volume
and power buttons and then the other
ones just removed this little logo piece
pretty straightforward and then all of
these screws are what hold the backplate
onto the phone itself so make sure you
remove every single one of those and
then pop this connector off the
motherboard it's similar to a Lego piece
just lift it up and away and then it
will unsnap and then take the little
tape off the connector you'll have to do
this a couple times and set it on the
piece of plastic right next to it so you
don't lose it lift up the little lever
and then slide out the ribbon cable from
the connector itself the little ribbon
cable goes to the volume and power
buttons then you can unsnap the battery
cable from the motherboard and a lot of
times if your phone is acting up or
power cycling or just won't turn on
disconnecting and reconnecting the
battery will fix your phone so you can
always give that a shot and you won't
need to take your phone apart for that
you can see little contact pads for the
earpiece and this part is really cool I
think to remove the battery you can just
grab these little pull tabs and pull the
adhesive straight from the back side of
the phone it pulls it out so the battery
releases from the back side the phone a
lot easier than it normally would have
you can just kind of poke it with your
finger and the battery will pop out and
there's still a little bit of adhesive
in there but as you can see the battery
pretty much just falls into your hands
once
you pull that adhesive tabs out from the
bottom of the phone
here's battery I'll try to link
replacement parts in the video
description below the lens also comes
out fairly easily just lift up on that
little tab if you need to replace that
I'll try to find replacement parts in
the video description below as well
motorola replacement parts are usually
harder to find than most phones but I'll
do my best
removing the tape for the LCD ribbon
connector there's a little tab along the
top of that connector you can kind of
use to leverage out of the connector
itself and you can lift up this little
locking flap and pull that cable out and
those are the two cables that are
connected to the screen I'm going to
wiggle the motherboard away from the
frame of the screen and your says so
here's the screen it is the glass the
LCD and the frame of the phone all kind
of glued together into one piece these
ribbon cables are attached to that as
well it will make you repair a hundred
times easier if you buy the replacement
piece that has all of those parts
combined the glass LCD and frame if you
don't buy them together you will have to
use a heat gun to separate the glue and
mesh them all together later on you
might still need to move over the rubber
piece and the metal frame but that's
still easier than using a heat gun to
try to separate all of that stuff anyway
before we try to put it back together
again I'm going to show you some stuff
on the motherboard it's got little
rubber protectors on the microphones so
if you ever have problems hearing people
or they have problems hearing you I
guess you can take those off and clean
them and then here's the rear facing
camera has the same little latch
connectors even working on this whole
time slip the connector up and then the
camera will pop right out
once again I'll try to put all
replacement parts and tools in the video
description below also if you found this
interesting so far go ahead at that
subscribe button it does help me out a
lot
helps me keep making videos like this in
the future here's the front-facing
camera pretty straightforward has the
same Lego type connector that you've
been dealing with on that side of the
phone this whole time you can see the
little vibrator motors right next to
that and the proximity sensor and my
sensor on the back of the phone
I guess the front of the phone depending
on which way you're looking at it
putting the phone back together again
you want to grab the motherboard and
slip it up into the top of the frame
first making sure to line up those
ribbon cables and then there's a little
latch down at the bottom that kind of
pins the motherboard into the frame as
well reconnecting the ribbon cables just
push them in as far as you can and then
latch that down and then use the same
tape that you took off to make sure that
latch doesn't come up again same thing
with that LCD connector and make sure
you put the tape over that camera as
well pretty straightforward now to get
the battery back in there you can add
extra double-sided tape in there to help
keep the battery secure it was a little
bit sticky still so I just pop the
battery in there and I'm not going to
worry about the extra tape getting the
buttons back in they have little holes
in the middle of the buttons so when you
take that little metal bracket and stick
it on the top again it'll stick through
those buttons to help keep them in place
and that's why you don't really need to
take that apart unless you're going to
work on the buttons themselves I would
recommend just leaving that screw in if
you ever need to replace the screen or
the battery to get the screen position
back in I started with the top and then
just kind of pressed it gently into
place around the backside remember it's
not going to close completely but you
want it to be pretty darn close
otherwise the screws aren't going to
reach and pin it down the rest away
getting those power button flex cables
press down along with the battery and
then the volume and power push into that
little circuit board right there and
lock down I'm testing it really quick
before I put in those bajillion screws
in the back just to make sure
everything's connected right and if you
did take off the logo and the volume
buttons make sure those screws are back
in as well they're all the same size I
believe it's 84 make sure that little
rubber connectors back and if this one
ever comes back from Mars I'll be sure
to find it and plop it back in place
make sure that the logo is positioned
correctly because that'll keep the back
from lining up with the edge of the
phone if it's not directly centered so
you might need to adjust that a couple
times if you took it off the Abeka phone
actually went on a lot easier and I
thought it would and it actually looks
like it was never taken apart which I
was worried about because of how it was
adhere to the phone in the first place
as you can see there is almost no
that the phone was taken apart any
questions leave them down in the

this video helped it and don't forget to
