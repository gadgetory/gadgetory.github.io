not have the smoothest relationship with
his future in-laws
so invader randomly invited the young
Karelian to the jewelry store before his
daughter's wedding Han had a bad feeling
it would be a trap a devious torture was
devised by lord Vader
as usual Han shot first but was not yet
a match for Vader superior skill with
the force the torture began large wax
sprues were added to Hans back and feet
it was around this time that Han
realized that he was reliving his Jabba
the Hutt Carbonite days all over again
after being affixed to the wax pedestal
a circular chamber was placed around
Hans body and high-grade ceramic plaster
was poured all around the pedestal han
never did stop smiling everything was
awesome the plaster dried and Han
circular Carbonite like sarcophagus was
inserted into the red-hot burnout
furnace which radiated more heat than
both Suns on Tatooine with time the
2,000 degree heat vaporized Hans former
plastic Lego shell leaving his ghost
trapped in the void of the plaster but
Vader's plan was not yet finished as the
mold was removed from the furnace the
Sith Lord watched as 14 karat gold was
brought to a 19 hundred degree liquid
mess ignoring his Mustafar flashbacks
he had solos cavity filled with the
precious metal after quenching Hans
Carbonite enclosure was beaten from the
outside it felt a lot like flying the
Falcon through the asteroid fields
after being released from the high-grade
ceramic plaster the golden sprues were
cut from Hans new solid metal body and
the remaining plaster was removed from
his crevices with a flex shaft drill a
brutal round of polishing was in order
Vader had Han thrown into the tumbler
while reminiscent of a Sarlacc pit
instead of being digested over a
thousand years this tumbler only
requires a few hours to reach a perfect
shine a mini pneumatic hammer brings
back Hans vest and holster one last
round of polishing and buffering doesn't
look too bad for a scoundrel and finally
Han gets dunked into the ultrasonic
cleaning bath a bhakta tank of sorts for
golden Star Wars Legos it was around
this time when Vader realized his
torture was not going to have the
outcome he was looking for instead of
weakening Captain solo it seemed to have
the opposite effect
