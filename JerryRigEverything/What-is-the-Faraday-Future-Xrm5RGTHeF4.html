has some major competition with the
Faraday ff9 one this is an all-electric
SUV competing with the Model X we took
the Model X on a road trip from Salt
Lake down here to CES and now I'm gonna
take the Faraday ff9 one out for a spin
I think it's super interesting that
Tesla's named after an inventor that
lived you know 150 years ago who worked
on like the a alternating current that
we see in the power lines and Faraday
was yet another scientist with about 150
200 years ago and was the one of the
pioneers in electromagnetic induction so
we have two famous scientists whose
names are now being used in competing
electric car companies pretty awesome so
one of the extremely unique features of
the Faraday future are these dual
antennas on the back these little shark
looking fin things which actually give
it a really strong internet connection
with 350 megabits down which is faster
than most broadband connections in the
United States you could live stream from
it you can download videos from it and a
lot of that data connection will be used
for the self-driving section you know
giving updates on the road other cars
around you things like that the logo
right here when looked at sideways it's
actually an F F for Faraday future so
you've seen the Model X and the Falcon
wing doors the doors on the Faraday
future a little bit different there's a
button right here
the button right here
and hold them are automatic that is
opened the opposite directions huge
things a fair day for sponsoring this
video and give me a chance to take their
car out for a spin remember this is a
pre-production model so we're checking
out the exterior and the performance of
the car and not so much the interior
that will come later when the car is
actually released so now we're inside
the Faraday the ff9 one this is kind of
the pre-production model is mostly just
to show off the performance you know
it's not built for comfort we're in
these like bucket seats with harnesses
it's definitely not gonna be what the
finished car is gonna look like inside
but I can already feel the power from
the two motors we can see out the front
windshield right here and then over here
on the side for the rearview mirrors
they're just like this little stick with
a camera in it so it's gonna be
interesting with the final version where
they're gonna put that right now it's up
here for like the rear view mirror you
can see each of these sides right here
and over here and then the rear here is
the back camera what happens when you
honk the horn what are the cool things
about this car is that you know you've
seen the Tesla battery pack there's been
Tesla's dismantle and you can see like
the huge rectangular battery packs what
Faraday has been using though is like
these little modules that connect like
little Legos all underneath the car so
like if something goes wrong with the
battery pack they can just pop one out
and replace it and they're not limited
to one solid battery pack you know they
can increase the capacity and decrease
the capacity whenever they want to with
these modules I imagine you know if you
damaged some of the modules talk about
the little Lego components and replace
the modules that are damaged into the
whole battery pack itself which i think
is pretty awesome
so the zero-to-sixty of this thing is
2.3 nine seconds we have reached a stop
sign and we are gonna floor this thing
and see how fast we can really go
wait.you the tires feelin
so I'm holding the camera with my hand
and the cheese from that just like bends
the legs of my tripod backwards towards
me that was sweet that was so sweet
not everything's on the table right here
boys one of the coolest things about
electric cars for me and the reason that
I think they're the future is because
they're electric motors don't need like
a transmission to shift you know I just
bought my Toyota Tacoma and for me to
get to zero to sixty I have to shift the
gear shifter five times you know let off
the gas shift the gear let off the gas
shift the gear but with these electric
cars they're instantly zero to 60 just
straight up no shifting at all required
and that's why they're so fast two point
three nine seconds is ridiculous two
point five seconds is ridiculous
my Toyota Tacoma can reach zero to 60 in
seven point seven seconds that's still
pretty good some of the safety features
going on inside of the Faraday is that
this thing is going to pop up with lidar
and then we have some radar up top which
is pretty similar to what we saw inside
of the Model X there's also some of
these same proximity sensors and stuff
so we'll have some cameras right here on
the side as well as this is the rear
camera that we saw earlier that was
showing up in the display off the
dashboard so as the Faraday is driving
the tires move a little bit as it turns
I think it has a turn of like three
degrees or something like that and that
helps give a tighter turn radius then
you would normally see and like a Tesla
Model X so because this car is named
after Faraday one of the scientists from
the past I think it would be cool to
toss a wireless charger on the bottom of
this thing so you just roll into your
garage and start charging I think that'd
be a pretty sweet thumbs up to Faraday
and his work with the electromagnetic
induction and that wireless charging
stuff electric cars are the future gas
powered cars are going the way of the
dinosaur let me know what you think of
this car would you ever buy an electric
car and what do you think of the Faraday
ff9 one I'm super stoked I love the
competition that's happening right now
thanks a ton for watching and I'll see
you guys around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
