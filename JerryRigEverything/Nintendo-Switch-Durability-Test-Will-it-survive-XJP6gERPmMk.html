recent full-fledged gaming console from
Nintendo and this all-gray unit is the
one lucky enough to end up on my desk
with me it's time to see what this thing
is made of let's see if this system will
be able to last the next five or six
years until the next Nintendo system
comes along and takes its place let's
get started now normally I test cell
phones but this device is meant to be
portable which means it's fair game for
my durability test I think it's better
that I test the durability of a device
on purpose so you won't have to find out
on accident I'll tell you what to avoid
and what to watch out for I always start
my durability test with a scratch test
on the screen I use a set of Mohs
hardness ticks that tell me what the
screen is made of if it's plastic it'll
scratch it a little three if it's glass
like most cell phones it'll scratch it a
five or six but if it's sapphire like we
see on some watches it'll scratch at
level eight or nine and if Nintendo made
their screen out of diamonds
well it'll scratch it a level ten
unfortunately for us though the switch
isn't made out of diamonds it's actually
plastic and it scratches at level three
most smartphones have a glass screen
because cell phones are designed to be
constantly rubbing around in your pocket
all the time I assume Nintendo decided
to choose a plastic screen because a
it's cheaper be it's not in your pocket
all the time and see this is a family
console played mostly by kids and kids
at heart and a plastic screen definitely
will never get cracked if it's
accidentally dropped glass would so it's
a valid cost effective trade-offs and in
this case I'm okay with plastic but as
you can see from my key marks it will
get scratched up if you just toss it in
your backpack or purse so a screen
protector or case is definitely a good
idea I'll link some good screen
protectors in the video description on
either side of the device we have what
Nintendo is calling the joy con
controller and we can tell by the sound
of my razor blade that these are made
out of plastic
the joy Conn joystick has a super thick
rubber coating around the top with how
thick and strong it is I can tell it
will take years of playing for it to
actually wear out with normal use even
with me deliberately trying to pull off
the slice portion it was staying
attached pretty well so far so good here
is something I thought was really cool
the top buttons are made of plastic as
well but if you look close you can see
that the letters on these buttons are
not printed or screened into place they
are literally injected all the way
through the button so for you diehard
gamers out there that have had letters
rub off on your keyboard or joysticks
with time that will literally never
happen on this Nintendo switch because
the letters are the button thumbs up for
that along the top of the switch near
the headphone jack we still have a solid
plastic exterior layer and even along
the back of the device there is no
ear-splitting sound of metal on metal
when I carve into the switch body if
you're one of the few who recognize this
symbol leave a comment and tell me where
it's from it has to do with the force
and I'm not talking to Star Wars there
are a pair of symmetrical vents at the
bottom of the device which are probably
for the stereo speakers for heat
dissipation we'll find out for sure when
I do my full teardown the holes are
covered by a thin vinyl layer which is
actually surprisingly easy to tear so if
you ever need to clean these out be very
careful the kickstand is also made from
plastic its attachment dimension dose
which is a pretty weak saw my first time
opening it up and it popped right off
the good news though is that it pops
right back into place very easy over and
over again I did this several times to
make sure that it was still solid and it
didn't get any weaker with each removal
so it's probably designed this way but
that also makes it easy to lose as well
and well it covers the SD card slot so
try to keep track of it it is important
I know a few of you have already thought
well I'll just cover up all that plastic
with a skin well be brand a company that
makes protective skin said that this
particular plastic that it's being used
on the switch is not compatible with
skin the plastic gets physically
destroyed by the skin which is pretty
odd so you should probably avoid putting
a skin on it for now and just use a case
or a sheet instead now normally I made
to tell what kind of display a device
has by applying a little bit of heat an
IPS display turns off em'ly LED burns
white but the thick plastic layer over
the 720p Nintendo switch display is
super thick and it never let the heat
reach the actual display the exterior
plastic did reach its melting point
after about 15 seconds though blink
wasn't too happy with me but everything
still functions 100% so far even if the
screen were to break it should still be
able to output to a TV like any normal
console would with this docking station
the dock allows the squish to play on
your TV at 1080p which is a bit higher
resolution than the built-in screen that
screen at 7:20 just slide it in and the
USBC allows it to dock immediately there
is one large flaw with this dock though
and that's the large plastic runners
inside the docking station that press
right up against the screen so every
single time you dock your console the
dock will rub up against the sides of
your display plastic on plastic can
still cause damage or scrapes to the
screen and there already have been
reports of scratched screens luckily
it's not on the visible part of the
display just that thick black bezel
between the display and the side
controllers so it's not that big of a
deal if it does get scratched
but once again a thin screen protector
would solve this issue 100% I would say
a screen protector is pretty mandatory
on this console remember I'll have some
linked in the video description as you
know the switch is pretty modular you
can play with little joystick niblets
attached to the screen like you've seen
me doing or you can pull them off and
play with them detached the third way
you can use them is to attach them to
this little grip that turns both niblets
into one large handheld controller the
new symbol I just drew is a bit more
difficult so let me know in the comments
if you know where this one's from
muggles probably won't understand after
joining the joy con controllers into the
joy con grip I can give it the initial
stress task a basic flex in all
directions reveals that it's pretty darn
sturdy for being a bunch of plastic
parts stuck together with little thin
rails I don't see any immediate failure
points on this controller unless you are
intentionally trying to break it
everything is still totally functional
so far one interesting thing about the
controllers is the little LED light
built on the inside when you slide the
controller into the grip that transfers
light upwards shining out of the grip
itself this is done with little tiny
mirrors inside of the controller handle
you can see what I mean when I shine the
LED flash from my phone into the mirrors
it still transfers the light straight up
and out of the grip interesting stuff we
saw the same feature in the GoPro five
lag tore that down now the rail on this
joy con controller is made out of
plastic which at first I thought was a
bad design but it turns out the plastic
joique on rail isn't the failure point
the connecting rail on the console
itself is made out of metal which is
rather refreshing when dealing with the
console entirely made out of plastic I
do love how securely and satisfyingly
these controllers click into place now
it's time to find the failure point
trying to bend the body of the console
was futile
there was no breakage no matter which
way I was bending from the center body
and the screen are very strong even the
side joique on controllers are pretty
strong by themselves it would be very
difficult to break one of these off on
accident but with enough deliberate
force I was able to snap off one side
the interesting part though was that the
failure point wasn't the plastic rail or
the metal rail I'll show you it broke in
a second the important thing is is that
the console is still working completely
which is good obviously the part that
broke were the four screws holding the
metal rail into the switch body the rail
itself is fine the screws are fine but
the inferior metal holding the screws to
the body to switch ripped right out
definitely not what I was expecting to
happen I'm pretty sure that the wire at
the bottom of this rail is what charges
the Joye con so the side rails
definitely is important
luckily mine is still connected and that
wire didn't rip for the most part I
would classify this portable console as
durable even though I was able to
deliberately break mine you shouldn't
have any issues with yours unless you're
dropping it off your house
or someone extremely heavy sits on it
but as long as you get a screen
protector for that screen the rest of
the console should survive just fine I
can say the Nintendo switch is
definitely a successful successor to the
Wii U my Twitter followers knew this
video is coming before anyone else so
make sure you follow me on Twitter and
Instagram to stay up to date on my
future projects thanks for watching I'll
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
