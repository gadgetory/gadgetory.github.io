the original NES Nintendo console
remember this little square right here
I'm going to come back and talk about it
in a second it's actually pretty
interesting there are six screws along
the bottom and then the plastic top just
comes up and away from the rest of the
console and then there's four screws
along this top shield you can lift that
up and away from the console as well and
that exposes the little cartridge slot
that presses up and down in order to
connect the cartridge itself with the
system there's two screws holding that
in place and then there's one screw
holding the rest of the motherboard in
place that you have to undo in order to
lift the motherboard out and give you
enough room to take off the little
cartridge holder and now that that's off
you can kind of see the little mechanism
that it has in there to go up and down
and hold it in place then right here at
the bottom of the system there's two
more screws holding on the black piece
of plastic that holds the controller
connectors in place once that's off the
controller connectors can just pull away
from the system once they're unplugged
from the main board themselves I'm going
to show you how to unplug them these are
kind of interesting connectors you can't
just pull them straight out you have to
actually lift up on the little white
tabs first and then wedge the green
connector out and I'll show you a little
closer right here
just lifting it up and kind of prying it
out at the same time and then it pulls
it away from the system and then the
same thing with the blue connector
they're in there pretty tight especially
after 20 years or so just kind of pull
them out and then there's one more
shield that just comes away from the
main board and then you can see this
little expansion slot right here is what
we were talking about earlier Minnesota
actually came up with a lottery system
that connected to a modem and never
actually took off but it's pretty
interesting that someone actually did
make an accessory for the NES console
and then here's the rest the main board
and you can see right there the 72 pin
connector where the cartridges came in
it was actually the worst part of this
system it was the most likely to fail
luckily it's pretty easy to swap out and
only takes probably about two minutes
you just take it and then press right
here and slide it away from the main
board and then you can take your new
part and slide it into place pretty
simple they're only about five or six
bucks on Amazon I'll put that in the
video description below if you need one
and there's the power buttons if you
have any questions be sure to leave them
in the comments and don't forget to like
this video and subscribe it does mean a
lot to me hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
