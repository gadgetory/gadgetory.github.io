flagship device from HTC with a premium
price tag to match its premium look but
is it durable the HTC 10 was my choice
for the most well built phone of last
year let's see if this flamboyant
sibling follows in the same footsteps
the scratch test is first i pre-ordered
the normal HTC U with Gorilla Glass 5
covering the screen
HTC did promise the USA a sapphire
variant of this phone with real sapphire
covering the screen later this year it
will be interesting to see if this
actually happens or if it was just some
kind of marketing to help promote the
phone at launch sapphire crystal is very
difficult to manufacture so I won't be
surprised - the sapphire version never
shows up you can see that this Gorilla
Glass 5 scratches at a level 6 real
sapphire would resist scratching until a
level 8 or 9
if HTC does release a sapphire screened
variant of this phone in the United
States
I'll be here to check the scratch
resistance of that as well the
fingerprint scanner pad is covered in a
slick rubberish plastic layer that will
not scratch easy during normal use but
my razor blade does leave a mark iPhones
in the nokia 6 I tested a few days ago
do have scratch proof fingerprint
scanners so they do exist luckily for
the ultra though it still functions even
with the extra damage the front-facing
16 megapixel camera is protected by that
same front screen glass so no worries
about scratching here
HTC was one of the few companies to use
plastic on their camera lenses back with
the HTC m9 so I'm glad they stopped
doing that the abnormally small earpiece
lot feels like it's made out of that
same lightweight fabric that's a Nokia 6
head in it but unlike the Nokia 6 the
fabric does not come out when told it
would have been nice if they toss some
larger speakers in there though it does
seem like they have the room now on to
the back of the phone this thing is
definitely a fingerprint magnet I'll
just clean it off a little bit much
better it's time to see what this phone
is made of the glossy jet-black iPhone 6
was made from aluminum and while this
phone mimics that same reflective
mirror-like finish this ultra is made
from glass so my razor blade doesn't
leave any marks on the back
channel nor does my razor affect the
logos so those won't be wearing off at
all either the rear 12 megapixel camera
is scratch proof as well and yes there
are less megapixels on the back camera
than there are on the front weird I know
but HTC has always done weird things
with their camera megapixels the camera
bump is made from metal the flash is
plastic and try not to scratch the black
plastic portion or it could mess up your
autofocus I always have a few comments
on every video wondering what happens if
I take a level 9 pic to the glass of a
phone remember a level 9 pic is one step
below 8 diamond so let me tell you a
story about a little guy that lives in a
blue world and all day and all night and
everything he sees is just blue like him
inside and outside blue his house with a
blue little window and a blue Corvette
and everything is blue for him and
himself and you want to know why this
little guy is blue because there's no
headphone jack on this song on this
supermassive thick device HTC did not
want the scrounge together the extra
opinions it takes to add a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack to the
exterior and that decision alone helps
plop this device in the list of phones
that I will not be using as a daily
driver
someday the time will come for no
headphone jacks but today is not that
day let me know in the comments
would you buy a phone with no headphone
jack maybe I'm alone in my decision if
we move to the frame of the phone the
top is definitely made for metal and we
can follow the metal sides all the way
down to the base default near the USBC
charging port they stick with the metal
theme down here as well so at least all
the materials are premium all the way
around the device even the volume and
power buttons are metal the 5.7 inch
1440p IPS LCD lasted about 10 seconds
under the heat from my lighter
I'm positive to this test someday we'll
be relevant at some point but until then
we can just appreciate that the IPS
pixels recover
completely from the flame and now the
bin test remember the HTC 10 with the
winner of my smartphone durability
Awards last year I can tell right away
though that the ultra is not going to
follow that same rigid path the ultra
has more relation to the soft iPhone 6s
it's important to note that the back
glass would not be cracking right now
the only reason it is cracking is
because I directly introduced the flaws
by scoring the glass my level 9 pick but
it's also important to notice that the
glass on the HTC U does not contribute
anything to the structural integrity of
the device the glass is resting on top
of the frame unlike the galaxy s7 where
the back Samsung glass is inside the
metal frame helping make the phone more
rigid so while this phone survives the
bin test overall it still flexes like a
soggy Twinkie and will not be in the
running for the 2017 durability Awards
it's a pretty good looking device I do
like the color but as for me and myself
it is not the daily driver material that
I'm looking for
I hope you enjoyed this durability test
I'll just be listening to music while I
pulled bits of glass out of my fingers
for the next ever thanks for watching
I'll see you around yo listen up here's
the story about a little guy the limit
