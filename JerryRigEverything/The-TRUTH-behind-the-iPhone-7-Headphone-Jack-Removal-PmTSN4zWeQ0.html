really gone let's find out there are
several reasons why Apple remove the
headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and
surprisingly courage is not one of them
one of the main reasons why the
headphone jack is gone is that the
Lightning port is proprietary to Apple
Apple owns that Jack so any company
making third-party accessories for that
Lightning port have to pay Apple in
order to use it it's a direct revenue
stream for Apple so let's say as a
third-party manufacturer I want to
design a new car charger or docking
station or charging cable for the iPhone
7 using that lightning port I get to pay
Apple royalties for each cable that I
make even though Apple is not producing
or manufacturing that cable just because
it's using their port so how much does
Apple make for each third-party
accessories sold it's hard to say for
sure
Wikipedia estimates that at about 10%
but since Apple has NDA forms all over
the place once you're in the program and
have signed all their forms you're not
allowed to talk about it or you'll get
sued some websites speculate that Apple
has recently switched to a four dollar
flat fee per cable because it's easier
to keep track of lucky for you guys I am
NOT in Apple's MFI certification program
and I have not signed any of their forms
but I have talked to several companies
in China that manufacture MFI certified
cables and they say that in order to get
certified it's 550 dollars per product
so let's say I have three different
color of lightning cables and each of
those cables come in three different
lengths now we have nine cables total
and I'm paying Apple almost $5,000 to
certify my cables for the public use
remember that these numbers are not from
Apple directly they're just from the
manufacturer in China so take that how
you will and remember I am NOT opposed
to these fees business is business Apple
designed their own port Apple should get
paid for anyone who decides to use their
port that's how business works and I'm
okay with that
but just for reference HDMI ports are
also proprietary and they're royalty fee
per cable can be as low as five cents
you can really tell what manufacturer
wants you to use their product and which
manufacturer doesn't so Apple did not
design the 3.5 millimeter head
phone jack so any accessory used with
the iPhone using that Jack Apple didn't
make any money on now that they have
effectively eliminated that headphone
jack in the iPhone 7 each and every
accessory that gets plugged into the
iPhone 7 Apple gets paid for even if
Apple doesn't design manufacture or
produce that accessory
it's an incredibly intelligent business
decision Apple does legally enforce
their patents as they should I know
someone who is selling non MFI certified
cables they got sued by Apple and ended
up paying over five figures as
restitution so apples money is rolling
in from all directions now remember I
don't care that Apple is protecting
their design and their products and
their investment in their information
that's totally within their legal right
and I approve it's important to business
to protect your assets but it's
unfortunate that they had to remove a
feature as useful as the headphone jack
just because they weren't making money
on it
Apple saw a piece of the financial pie
and they took it the second reason Apple
got rid of the headphone jack is because
of waterproofing sealing off a 3.5
millimeter hole in the bottom of your
phone is extremely expensive especially
when you're manufacturing millions of
them sealing the headphone jack
internally would cost Apple a lot of
money and why would they spend extra
money on something that they aren't
making any money with in the first place
Apple's claim that they are dedicated to
the wireless future is not valid if they
were truly dedicated to the wireless
future they would have put wireless
charging in their cell phones wireless
charging has been built into cell phones
for years now the thing is Apple
wouldn't make money from that wireless
charging yet that's why they haven't
integrated it into their phones they
would be paying someone else
royalties for that technology and
they're not about that life the argument
that the headphone jack doesn't fit
inside of the phone isn't valid either
the nice thing about designing your own
phone Apple is that you get to decide
what fits and what doesn't so now that
we know why the headphone jack is gone
let's talk about how it affects us as
customers let's say you're on a road
trip with your friends anyone who owns
an iPhone 7 won't be able to contribute
to the aux cable music selection in the
car unless you're carrying around your
little dongle extender if you've ever
been to a state fair or no
many entrepreneurs they won't be able to
use the credit card reader like square
or PayPal for credit card transactions
if you've ever left your headphones at
home while you're at the gym or while
you're traveling there's no more buying
a cheap five dollar pair of headphones
with a headphone jack
you'll need to buy a way more expensive
proprietary royalty fee included pair of
lightning headphones that Apple gets
paid for even if they weren't made by
Apple but that's just what I think I'm
curious as to what you think would you
buy a phone without a headphone jack let
