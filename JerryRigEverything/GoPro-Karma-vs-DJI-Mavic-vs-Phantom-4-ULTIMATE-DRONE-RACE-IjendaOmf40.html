popular consumer drones we have the
GoPro Karma the DJI Mavic and the
Phantom 4 we're going to see which one
is fastest Jared what do you think um I
honestly think this one will be the
slowest I think it'll be a toss-up
between the Mavic Pro and the Phantom
alright so we're going to race these
three drones going across the sidewalk
and then coming back and whoever reaches
back here first wins
and then this drone is going to be
getting an aerial shot of the whole race
let's get started
right a big feather on the way back
down three one two three
oh my gosh I went in this
I definitely crowd everybody phone
I don't know oh that's a perfect turn if
I've ever seen one myself
where are we going oh my gosh I'm gonna
win no no I'm uh I think you gave me
everything boys that was cool
it's gonna be put that egg but so now
we're switching into sport mode which
means the drones are way faster and
there's no safety features as far as
like obstacle avoidance so we have to
make sure not to hit each other or the
building behind us one two three Oh oh
my gosh mine's not going any further
don't even go oh did I Ramon Liu aye sir
you beat me by at least 30 feet on that
I took a really really good turn up I'm
not gonna lie I'm not controlling this I
don't know what's going on
look
one two three
for all
I was I was way all over the place Oh
found the trees guys I have no idea
where I'm at Oh oh my gosh dude I'm
gonna beat you guys dude you're way over
there I didn't get away I thought that
group dude that is the tortoise in the
hare I thought that is just what
happened oh no my drone is the way to
beat the Phantom 4 and the magic for us
to have inexperienced racers whoa all
right let's try that again that was the
only time to go for a 1 right all right
so we just finished racing and it turns
out it doesn't really matter as much if
the drone is fast it's more of the pilot
that is a huge factor I mean I said it
abroad because each of the drones won at
least once
yeah right uh-huh and I think the only
time the GoPro one was when both me and
Joe got lost somewhere in the field
right even without sport mode though the
GoPro did hold that pretty well
yeah it did so during this whole process
both of the DJI drones were fine but we
actually had some problems with the
karma drone what do you think was going
on
well the Karma just disconnected one
time and then landed all by itself at
the probably the second or third race
and we had to restart reconnect it and
get up off the ground again it wouldn't
take off for a little bit so I think
some software updates are definitely
needed to make sure that this is as
reliable as the DJI but that's kind of a
fail-safe to me I think because now at
any point if you do lose connection it's
going to take care of itself a land that
is hopefully it's got a good place to
land
yeah I like that I Spencer this was your
first time ever flying a drone as our
camera guy what do you think about the
Phantom really easy to pilot
regard to crash luckily so Jared and I
did a camera comparison between the DJI
Mavic and the GoPro Karma and that's on
my channel and we also unbox both of
these drones on Jared's channel so I'll
link both of those down in the video
description below and at the end of this
video so you can check out those videos
if you had to pick one drone to buy for
yourself which one would it be would it
be the DJI Mavic the GoPro Karma or the
Phantom 4 let me know down in the
comments thanks ton for watching I'll
see you around hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
