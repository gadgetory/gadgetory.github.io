king of random and probably one of the
coolest shop I've ever seen what's up
guys welcome to my laboratory hi for
real that's exactly what it is the death
of phenomenal it's got so many power
tools but there's one special thing that
I want to show you and it blew my mind
when I saw for the first time nobody
knows about this yet this is kind of
like behind-the-scenes top-secret pre
video video okay so liquid nitrogen why
do you need it what do you need liquid
nitrogen well why do I need liquid
nitrogen or why does the world need
liquid nitrogen you particularly in
particular I like the liquid nitrogen
just for playing around it's fun to play
with because it can make things explode
it can make things freeze it's one of
those substances where it has properties
that you don't typically find in normal
everyday living because it's so cold and
the the amount of energy that it takes
to make it that cold it's not readily
accessible not very many people know
where to find liquid nitrogen and so
it's just one of those cool things it's
also very dangerous because freeze your
hands up again it can kill you so I'm
very much intrigued by things that could
possibly kill you which is weird because
it can kill you it could freeze your
hands off but here we are in the
basement of the king of randa's house so
show us how nobody needs to know that
show us how you make liquid nitrogen
okay I'm going to run you very very
briefly through the process of how I'm
making liquid nitrogen right now
and if you listen very very carefully
you can hear a tinking noise in the
background clunk clunk clunk clunk let
me show what that noise is and over here
this is what we were done today means
that you're going to see this popping up
in my town but we had been playing with
brain dummy brains coming through this
is a spare room that I set up it used to
be a guest bedroom now I use it for my
radiator
which is right down here now this is
basically just a giant glorified
radiator that I built with a friend of
mine named Chris yep radiator here we
have water pumping and through it it's
being cooled by a diet first fan it's
pumping air on the back the air getting
stuck in here cools the water down and
blows out here and I put a little extra
garden like this carries in the top
defenders off we have a window open
because this thing is really hot and it
circulates all the air flow Virginia's
been bringing in the hot water cooling
it down
pumping that hot air off and then
sending back cold water what I'm not
doing that
and here's what we have making that
thinking noise this is a cryocooler
powered by helium I'll tell you about
our second do this little thing bumping
up and down that's very important now
this is a really good setup at that
moment right now it is what we have to
work with this is my nitrogen generator
my name is Hank and this thing here is
called the helium compressor that was
pumping helium for the cryo head in fact
this is the stuff because it's really
really odd this is the stuff first
nitrogen in liquid nitrogen
so our atmosphere we're living it is
about 79% nitrogen the nitrogen is all
around us when this little machine here
does take the nitrogen out of the air
it holds the oxygen out of it and then
Queensland's is a nice dry gas right eye
to that point we pump it into this tank
where I can pressurize it hold the tank
full of nitrogen now I have a little
regulator on here when this regulator
just allows me to pump that gas out at
about 1 psi to travel to this poly tube
which runs over to the Dewar and just
killing this together I'm very very
close
that's a few GC right here
now the second system is this where the
water in the radiator come in
I have a helium compressor here they
compresses helium and you as a gas
compressor keeps up will that cool down
we run that helium over to the trial
head and the whole purpose of the cryo
head is to pump the gas in there and
then rapidly expand it and as it expands
it gets very very cold and some heat out
of the Dewar the hot helium gas run out
of the human compressor whereas liquid
cools with water pumping out water back
up to the radiator to cool it back down
so you can come back down repeat the
process so this thing right here is just
a glorified conditioner to get so cold
when you put nitrogen gas on doing it
condenses and starts dripping down in
the sewers and so with all the system in
place how long would it take for this
system to fill up with liquid nitrogen
so you got to think we're just putting
it in one drop at a time so this is a 35
litre Dewar it's going to take about 2
to 3 weeks per cell completely but we've
already got about this means bond how
much do we have I think they were half
full right now it's probably somewhere
around 20 liters and a building up
completely would cost me about 170
dollars so making it a home I don't know
it really saves a whole lot of money but
who else is making liquid nitrogen at
home I think it's cool
lava so you pretty much have an endless
supply of liquid nitrogen right yeah
because we live in in nitrogen we're
just cooling it down and turning into a
liquid updog yeah there's nitrogen in
the air that we breathe that's right in
fact if I just let it running if I let
this thing just keep running without the
nitrogen generator I would basically
just be making a liquid liquid
atmosphere which would be a nitrogen and
oxygen and I can use this liquid
nitrogen to make liquid oxygen
basically make any kind of variety of
gases or liquids that we want just
really effective and it's great for
cooling things down quickly that's
interesting you also mention that
there's helium inside of that machine so
is the helium ever used up like you have
to replenish that or is the system
completely like self-sustained good
question now the helium compressor is a
closed system so all it's doing is it's
taking that helium it's compressing it
and then it's going through a heat
exchanger to cool that gas down then
it's running out for the cryo head where
it expends and heats up again and then
runs back in
just repeats that process it's just
exchanging cute let just like your
air-conditioning unit does in your house
this is just on a much higher level and
a lot more expensive so as long as it
has an electricity it can keep making
liquid nitrogen forever yep as long as
there are no leaks in the helium
compressor that healing will stay in
there in a closed-loop system
indefinitely
that's impressive it's also impressive
that he jerry-rigged that whole system
right here in his basement that all came
from three years of trying to find parts
and piece them together from university
surplus eBay Amazon all over the place
so we finally got working this is my
second back batch of liquid nitrogen the
first bath I used to freeze a heart in
one channel and we smashed it and we
kind of dissected a heart with liquid
nitrogen so another abnormal use for it
that's how I roll
and I will actually have a full tutorial
on this liquid nitrogen generator going
into a little bit more depth of how it
works on my channel in the near future
so going to come check me out came
around on one with you nice cool contest
for you thanks for giving us a
behind-the-scenes look I was very very
impressed
but you guys channel leave a link in the
video description below and right up
here in this section I'll show you what
we've been working on here on his
counter thanks step for watching I'll
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
