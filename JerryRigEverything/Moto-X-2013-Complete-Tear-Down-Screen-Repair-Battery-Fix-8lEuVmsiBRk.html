Moto X from Motorola Google's new phone
first things first want to apologize for
my dirty hands I was working on my car
and that stuff grease does not come off
anyway to open up the back of the phone
take your prying tool and kind of go
around the edge the seam between the
back plate and the screen just kind of
popping up the little latches little
clasps all around the backside you'll
hear a little click each time that you
pop one out the back is glued on pretty
tight to the the phone itself so it's
not going to come off easily but once
you're done I'm clipping the sides you
can peel it back just a little bit and
slide your prime tool underneath you
gotta be really careful while you're
doing this because there is a ribbon
cable next to the volume buttons that
you don't want to break if you break it
you won't have all eight buttons anyway
let's go ahead and slide it in you can
see the ribbon cable right here it's
also attached to the LED on the back of
the phone as you can see to unlatch it
just lift up the little black clasp talk
a little bit on the ribbon cable and
it'll slide right out and that will
release the back of the phone from the
phone itself you can see the blue sticky
stuff that was holding it all down
anyway now we're going to take off the
bottom there are four screws on the
bottom plastic section here is where
they are
and once you get the screws out you can
just kind of lift up a little bit and
the black section will come off right
here you can see the charging forward it
is soldered on to the board so it's not
easily replaceable
anyway lift up these two latches they're
kind of like Legos just put your little
pry tool underneath and lift up and
it'll unclasp and then right here is the
volume button ribbon cable just lift up
a little clasp and slide out the ribbon
cable and then latch it back down so you
don't break it and then this part to
release the battery you do have to lift
up this little ribbon cable that's glued
onto the battery well more like just the
sticky tape stuff it lifts up very
easily once you get it started lift that
up and off the battery and then the
battery will be free to be lifted off as
well you just have to take your prime
tool and slide it underneath the battery
let's go down pretty tight I'm so have
to use a little bit of force I've
already taken mine off one so it'll
usually be a little bit harder than this
to lift up and off see kind of where
it's stuck the sticky stuff on the back
anyway now the batteries out so there's
five more screws for the top of the
phone and this is kind of the plastic
piece that holds on the camera and
everything like the little vibrator is
once those five screws are out just lift
this up and off and once the intamin put
all these replacement parts listed in
the video description below Amazon is
where I usually get them alright
replacement parts from Amazon Prime
usually gets them here the fastest
anyway here's the top plastic piece and
then there's two screws right here next
to the SIM card slot I would recommend
taking the SIM card out before you start
this project but you know as long as you
take it out right now you'll still be
fine just to go you know a paper clip
works fine my little tweezers are thin
enough that I can press it in this
little hole and the SIM card pops up and
out now the motherboard you get to be
careful when you're lifting this stuff
off too because there is a ribbon cable
underneath the motherboard attaching it
to the screen right there so you can
take that lift up the little black clasp
then you can slide the ribbon cable
out just like that and then you freed
the motherboard from the phone the
camera is also replaceable same ribbon
cable lift up the little clasp and the
camera slides out you can replace it pop
a new one back in pretty simple and then
latch the clasp back down into place
once the ribbon cable is fully inserted
back into the phone so this is the
screen the glass part and the LCD they
are glued together so if you crack your
glass you have to replace both parts and
by the whole component you can't replace
just the glass alone there seems to be
confusion about that but they are
definitely glued together anyway so to
put the phone back together take the
same ribbon cable the digitizer cable
and slide it into the motherboard
latching the little black clasp down
again set the motherboard into place
make sure to lift up the front camera
ribbon cable so there's no ribbon cables
attached underneath and make sure that
the bottom wooden cable isn't bent in
any weird ways either when you put it
back down you don't want to damage
anything when you're screwing everything
back into place put a little metal
bracket back in there's two little
screws that go on to the upper side here
and then the lower side right below that
take the black plastic piece clip that
into place and then there's those five
screws on that you took off that will
fit right around the edge of that again
there's the placement of those battery
slip it in stick the little ribbon cable
back down again it'll still be sticky so
it's kind of press it into place
and then we have the volume ribbon cable
I'm going to slide in and reel a CH
if you don't lift up the latch it's not
going to go in so lift it up slide it in
and then pinch it back down again and
then these two bottom cables for the
battery and the antenna just go ahead
and click those into place kind of like
Legos again and then the bottom plastic
piece remember this one has four screws
going around the bottom edge of it and
putting the SIM card back in the same
slot it came out of check and make sure
the phone works before I put the back on
it looks like everything is going well
all right everything looks like ice I'm
going to go ahead and put the LED ribbon
cable back into the slot and latch it
back into place and like I mentioned
before all the replacement parts and
tools that I use for this project can be
found in the video description below I
will put links to them and then go ahead
and clip around to the outside you'll
hear a series of satisfying clicks as
you put everything back into place and
that's it anyway if you have any
questions make sure to leave them in the
comments below you can also reach me on
Twitter and yeah like if this video
