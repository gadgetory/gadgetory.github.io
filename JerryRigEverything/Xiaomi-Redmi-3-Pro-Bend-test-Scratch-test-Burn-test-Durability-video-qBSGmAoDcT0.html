it's a fairly expensive hobby but I
enjoy it most phones survive my tests
but there are a few that don't like the
next bit Robin the Nexus 6p twice the
HTC m9 and the show-me me five cell
phone durability is important and I
enjoy reviewing the external and
internal construction of every phone
today we have the xiaomi redmi pro 3 the
last time i tested a ShowMe phone this
happened so let's see if all show me
phones share the same week build quality
this show me pro 3 is slightly smaller
than my galaxy s7 edge like usual let's
start with a scratch test not all glass
is created equal I have a set of pics
that let me know how hard or scratch
resistant the screen is show me doesn't
brag about having Gorilla Glass on their
phone but we can tell from the pics that
this phone start scratching at a level 6
perfectly on par with all of the major
flagship Slyke the iPhone 6s and the
galaxy s7 the front camera lens is made
of the same glass as the screen that's
good protection as well let's see what
the back is made of judging by the sound
its metal you can see that silver flakes
come off with my razor blade the
fingerprint scanner is painted metal as
well I'm going to heavily scratch this
scanner to see how well it holds up I
still recognize my fingerprint and
allowed me to set up the scanner and
still functioned at 100% which is
impressive compared to the Huawei p9
scanner that only worked half the time
after getting heavily scratched the rear
camera lens is made of glass which is
definitely ideal for a cell phone I
found three phones so far that use a
plastic lens the front camera on the HTC
m9 the rear camera on the Sony z5
premium and the rear camera on the
blackberry prif a plastic lens is still
optically clear and does well enough for
a camera lens but it scratches a lot
easier than glass will so it's not ideal
when used on a cell phone that is
constantly sliding in and out of your
purse or pocket so thumbs up to show me
for using glass I can put it in my purse
with confidence the top and rear of the
phone is made of plastic I imagine that
this is where the screw holes hide we'll
find out when I do my repair video if
the phone makes it that far
the side buttons in SIM card tray are
made of plastic which saves show me a
ton on manufacturing costs it is easier
and cheaper to work with plastic than it
is with metal and the low price of this
phone reflects that discount but if you
are looking for that ultra premium feel
of metal or glass on the buttons these
buttons won't have it you can compare
the color of the plastic buttons with
the silver metallic body onto the burn
test that shows how durable this IPS LCD
720p screen is under the extreme heat as
well as how thick the glasses and mostly
just because I like fire the screen
lasted 14 seconds which is pretty
impressive that pixels went black and
turned off but unlike the galaxy s7 this
phone completely recovered the galaxy s7
was left with a permanent white burn
mark on the screen that you can see at
the beginning of this video on to the
bin test if you haven't subscribed yet
but you want to see your next phone
tested before you buy it
now would be a good time to hit that
subscribe button it is free and you can
stay up-to-date on the durability of
every new phone that comes out when I
bend this screen the screen flexes out
of the back housing pretty far far
enough that the glass cracks on the
screen but it does not flex enough to
compromise the back housing so the phone
does not break if Xiaomi were to attach
the screen at a few more points along
the side of the phone it would have been
perfect and the screen would have not
cracked you can hear the phone vibrate
in pain but the good thing we learn
about this phone is that the digitizer
layer is not built into the top glass
layer there are separate components
which means that the phone is still
completely operational on both sides at
the crack if you remember when I tested
the Umi Super phone once the glass
cracked the phone was not operational
because the digitizer which was built
into the top glass was cracked as well
so even with the cracked screen the
phone is fully operational and it will
still most likely survive years of abuse
from the average person so if you're
trying to decide between the different
Xiaomi phones the me 5 is more powerful
but if durability is a factor in your
life you might want to consider the
redmi pro 3 my snapchat followers got a
snap story of my phone covered desk
before this video was uploaded to
youtube I do most of my
behind-the-scenes
up on Twitter Instagram and snapchat
thank you so much for watching I really
do appreciate it and subscribe if you
feel like it it is free and I hope to
see you around thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
