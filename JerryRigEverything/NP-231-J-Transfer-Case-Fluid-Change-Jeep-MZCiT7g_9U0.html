where our rebuilding right now um we're
gonna go ahead and put
the transfer case fluid back into this
transfer case is a 231 J comets on the
underside of a Jeep Wrangler basically
to fix the to put the transfer case
fluid in it I'm all you got to do is
pull this one out I'll actually start
with the fuel flow just on release that
I believe it's a thirty millimeter and
then once this is release Omega so that
the oil drains or the fluid drains
better out of this one um if you wanted
to get a super technical there's a plug
back here and you can also drain out if
you really wanted to just be careful
there's a spring in there you're
probably better off just to drink out of
this one was what it's for this has just
been rebuilt so there's no fluid in it
yet so I will not be taking this one out
I'll just take this one off and just
fill it up it's a pretty simple process
alright now for the putting in of the
transfer case fluid basically all you
need is a fluid itself a little pump I
think this was like ten bucks and you
put it in the fill hole and then you
just tear little heart's content making
sure all the fluid goes inside the
transfer case pretty straightforward so
I think it requires a little bit more
than two quarts and also we'll see what
happens all right I filled it up just
enough so that the oil would start
coming out of this little plug right
here and then I got to do is tighten it
and you're good to go that's how to
change the transfer case fluid in your
transfer case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
