note 7 and on the right we have the
black galaxy note 5 each with their
individual s pins the note 5 has a black
tip and is slightly longer than the
galaxy note 7 both pins do work on both
phones though so not too much has
changed with the Samsung stylus or
software unfortunately the phones will
only recognize one pin at a time though
so two-handed note-taking is out of the
question with the older Galaxy Note 5 if
you were to accidentally stick the S pin
in the phone backwards it gets stuck
permanently
I will not come out again without
breaking the sensor inside of the phone
now Samsung did quietly issue a hardware
fix for this about 4 months after launch
but there's no way to know for sure
which phones have the fix inside so it's
better off to just not try this I
personally received my note 5 at launch
and as we can see it definitely does not
have the fix in place if you want a
detailed video on how to open up the
Galaxy Note 5 if I did make a video
exclusively on the teardown process but
in this video I'm just saving my s-pen
and showing you why it got stuck in the
first place if you look close you can
see this little niblet is attached to
the circuit board this is what tells
your phone that the S pin is in its slot
or not it's also what catches the end of
the S pin when it gets inserted into the
phone wrongly when Samsung fixed the
issue on some models they add a little
bumper over the latch so that wouldn't
bend back the wrong direction or get
caught on the S pin itself so does the
note 7 have the same issue let's find
out I've opened up my Galaxy Note 7
because reviewing technology from the
inside is kinda what we do around here
and since the note 7 is waterproof the S
pin has its own sealed housing which is
interesting I'll go more in depth about
the waterproofing on the note 7 in
another video but with this video we can
see that the S Pen literally only fits
in the hole one direction and if we peer
down inside the S Pen slot we can see
that the hole is tapered ever so
slightly so that the head of the pin
will not slide through backwards even if
we wanted it to
in fact it felt correctly the S pin will
actually launch itself in the opposite
direction away from the hole seems like
a foolproof designed to me and
permanently took care of the issue if
you're curious about the durability of
the galaxy note 7 check out my previous
video and be on the lookout for my full
teardown and waterproofing analysis
videos both of which are coming up in
the very near future thanks for watching
hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
