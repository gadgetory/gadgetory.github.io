popped out a new and improved version of
their ultra lightweight laptop from last
year the LG gram itas last year's
modelled down a flight of concrete steps
and a survive just fine let's see what
secrets this new LG gram is hiding
inside
big thanks to LG for sending out this
laptop and sponsoring the video I love
showing off useful products with plenty
of features and LG has packed his laptop
full of the essentials LG doesn't charge
extra for dongles because they put all
the ports you need right inside the
laptop itself imagine that the best way
to review texts is from the inside the
2018 LG Graham is easy enough to open up
with eight normal Phillips head screws
hidden underneath these rubber boots I
should probably mention at some point
that LG does not endorse this kind of
behavior but that's never stopped us
before with the class on the back panel
unsnapped we can set it off on the side
and revealing an extremely modular and
powerful setup inside of the LG Graham
the quickest and easiest way to upgrade
an old laptop is to add more storage or
more memory and LG has their customers
in mind when they allow that to happen
gets a thumbs up for me it's got dual
downward firing stereo speakers but the
intriguing part to me is the dual SSD
slots
last year's model only had one as we all
know storage normally gets way cheaper
with time I remember my dad bringing
home a computer when I was about 10
years old and telling me that we would
never need to upgrade again since it had
a four gigabyte hard drive things are a
bit different nowadays this 1 terabyte
laptop has over 250 times more storage
than that computer my dad brought home
all those years ago plus the laptops
upgradable because at some point in the
far future one terabyte will seem small
the RAM is also removable and upgradable
this 8 gigabyte stick doubles giving us
16 gigabytes of ddr4 ram making it a
solid laptop for 2018 thermal wise over
top of the i7 processor we have a
massive copper heat pipe and a fan
cooling
off the tail end having only one fan as
part of what makes this laptop so thin
the whole laptop clocks in at 27
decibels under load making it pretty
quiet for reference a whisper or
rustling leaves is right next door at 20
decibels Apple users might want to look
away for a second so they don't get too
jealous but we have two USB 3.0 slots
along with the headphone jack and micro
SD card slot all connected into their
own circuit board apart from the
motherboard making repairability
a real possibility if something gets
damaged or broken down the road on the
other side of the LG gram we have a
charging port another USB 3.0 and a full
size HDMI the coolest port last years LG
Graham didn't have as a Thunderbolt 3
connector allowing this laptop to
connect with 4k monitors or even better
an external graphics card for gaming or
video editing which as a youtuber is
something we do a lot of even with
intense peripherals hooked up like an
external GPU LG says this fan and heat
pipe combination keep the frames per
second on par with other high-end
laptops
during a stress test the current display
on this 2018 LG gram is a 1080p IPS
display attached with this hinge and
these silver screws and interesting
enough it has the same circular
connector and cable we saw inside the
dual screen acts on M smartphone that I
took apart a couple weeks ago the smart
phone and laptop worlds are getting
closer together last year LG bragged
about having an all-day battery and this
year's laptops battery is even bigger
they're still calling it an all-day
battery but this one has enough guts
left over at the end of the day to still
charge a cell phone pretty impressive
I'll unplug the battery from the
motherboard so we can get a closer look
it's a 7 point 7 volt lithium-ion
battery made up of four pouch cells
connected together the trackpad is
replaceable and has its own connection
to the bottom of the motherboard I'll
get the massive battery put back into
place so we can turn this thing on for
the first time and see if it still works
the battery has 6 screws and the back
panel of the laptop has eight Phillips
head screws it really is refreshing to
see a company not try to keep their
customers out LG says the surface of
their laptop is a nano carbon magnesium
alloy giving the LG grama
but under that metallic layer it has
more of a plastic feel which makes sense
this is one of the world's lightest
laptops and their alloy is lighter and
more durable than pure metal when it's
this thin I can't decide if that was a
shark fin or a tidal wave but you get
the idea
fun fact the power button doubles as a
fingerprint scanner for an added layer
of security and another tidbit a lot of
laptops don't have is the keyboard is
backlit making things super functional
at night overall I'm impressed a super
lightweight modular repairable and
upgradable laptop LG has done a good job
as with all technology the price does
fluctuate swell linked to current
pricing in the video description right
below this video let me know if there's
any other laptops you want to see torn
apart or durability tested and thanks a
ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
