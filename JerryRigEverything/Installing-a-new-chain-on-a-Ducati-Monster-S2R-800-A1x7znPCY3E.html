chain on a Ducati the s2 are 800 right
now what I've done is they're taking the
back tire off I will post a link here
for a video on how to change that out if
you need to get that farm this is what
that guard looks like so just take that
off those are what the bolts look like
and then I've taken off a little shield
that goes right here as well it's just
got those little allen bolts in there
and there's two of those bolts on this
thing and now I'm going to take this off
right here it's got the little bolt
right there and then it'll give me
access to a chain the chain you can see
is connected with a kingpin like this
you can see the orientation of the
kingpin is it slips on the bolt like
this little clip pulls on these little
nubs and so I'm going to take that out
and then the chain will become loose
once I take this pin out all right so
I've rotated back this kingpin all the
way to the end and I've broken off the
little metal bit on there and now this
piece comes out it was pretty rusted on
there so I've had to break a little bit
of it and now this pin will come out and
that leaves the chain to come completely
off the bike anyway I got one of these
guys right here this is to adjust the
chain that's about 20 bucks on Amazon
these things are pretty hard to find so
I'll make sure to put a link for that in
the video description below and then the
chain right here it turns out that for
each link each link is considered two
little links right here
so there's 54 of these little guys and
these little red things and so the whole
chain is 104 links long so that's what
fits on the Ducati s2 are the 800 so to
loosen this up right now because the old
chain you can see when I line them up
directly right here at the very end the
old chain is slightly longer than the
new one so it's been stretched out so
what I'm going to need to do
is loosen up these pinch bolts back this
in a little bit so it's shortening the
distance between the two sprockets so
that the new chain will fit on perfect
when I put the new the King link in the
main link the master link alright so I'm
gonna show you how to loosen and tighten
the back sprocket these are fourteen
millimeter bolts right here you just
have to loosen them up all the way and
then you take your little Ducati chain
tool and you can pop it in here and
pushing it down actually loosens up the
chain because it moves the sprocket
towards the front of the bike and then
swishing your tool around and pushing
upwards tightens the chain because it
moves the sprocket farther away from the
front of the bike like that so down is
loose up as tight and then once you have
it in the right spot you just tighten
these two little bolts back down and
you're good to go so I got one of these
clip two kingpins
or master links because they're a whole
lot easier to put on than the other ones
so basically I put the two rubber
washers in there I'm just going to slide
it through the back two slots
and put the other two washers on the
other side and slip that master link in
there in order to get this link on you
have to press this part of the master
link farther on there's a little tool
that I'm going to link in the video
description below that works better for
this I'm just going to use my chain
punch tool and just kind of press it
right there in the center and now that
it's pressed on enough to show those
grooves right there I can take my little
link pop it in and then I'm going to use
grabbing it like that I can just pitch
it on into place and you want to make
sure that the round part of that clip is
always going in the direction of your
motorcycle that way it never
accidentally comes off so for the chain
tightness the ducati chain it needs to
be at 30 millimeters which is just over
an inch it's like 1.18
so right now it's a little bit below 2
when I pull down and it's almost 2 1
when I pull up so I'm going to loosen up
just a tiny bit so I have the one point
one eight inches of flex in there so
that's about what it looks like when you
have the right tension um the biggest
thing is is that you don't want like
when you're on the bike your weight
comes down and tightens up the chain so
the biggest thing is you don't want the
chain to bind up when you hit that final
like when you hit a bump or something
like that and kind of bind your
suspension into place so just make sure
that it's not super tight when you sit
down otherwise you might need to loosen
up tiny bit more the reason I changed my
chain in the first place was that when I
would go around corners and stuff my
chain would start clicking or when I
would accelerate the chain would click
because the links had stretched out
enough that I wouldn't quite fit on the
sprocket anymore so now with the new
chain works like a dream
alright got those two pinch bolts down
there tightened up got all the guards
back into place and the chain is good to
go if you have any questions make sure
leave them in the comments don't forget

don't forget to subscribe I put up
videos fairly often thanks for watching
