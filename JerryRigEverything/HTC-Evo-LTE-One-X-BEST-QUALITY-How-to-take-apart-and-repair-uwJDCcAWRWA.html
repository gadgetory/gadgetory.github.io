To take it apart, first you remove the back.
Then we need to remove the bottom piece here.
Just use your little chuck, come up underneath
here.
Then there’s a bunch of tape right in this
area.
So you just take that and it will come off.
Just be careful not to break the housing of
the speaker right behind it.
There’s your adhesive.
Now we’re going to take apart 5 screws.
Removes the back housing.
It comes off there.
Then you have 4 screws down here next to your
speaker housing.
And then by the kickstand you’ve got some
screws there.
And then you have 2 screws holding the main
board down.
Now you can take and remove that by lifting
up on the housing, letting the speaker exit.
And your volume button will come off as well.
There’s your battery and battery connection.
Your speaker comes off with a single screw.
There’s some adhesive there.
Your sticker…just be careful lifting up
the battery.
Multiple flex cable points on top.
Vibrate, and flex cable underneath…and your
antenna connection.
All to remove the main board.
Just unlock the housing…the cable housings.
And lift up the vibrate.
And there’s your main board.
Rear facing camera is removable.
Front facing camera’s removable.
Then everything else is built into the main
board.
To remove the ear piece, undo these screws
connecting to your sensors.
The ear piece is right there.
It goes back.
Reattach.
Connect your flex cable.
There’s your antenna.
Set the vibrate back in place.
You can remove that, if you like, by peeling
the sticker and removing the connection there.
Set the flex cables back in place.
Reset your tape.
Set your battery.
And your rear speaker.
Then put on the back of the housing with the
earpiece first.
Put it back up into place.
Put the volume button back into place.
More screws at the bottom of the phone.
Set your housing.
5 screws on top.
Bottom housing fits onto the frame itself.
Snap back in and re-adhere.
If you’ve worn down your adhesive, put double
stick tape around there and then just back
there.
And you’re done!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
