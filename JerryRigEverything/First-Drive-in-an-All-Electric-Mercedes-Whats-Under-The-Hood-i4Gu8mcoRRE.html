guy who had zero interest in electric cars
until I rode in one and became a believer.
Mercedes just started rolling their brand
new, all electric, EQC off the production
line and invited Dan and I out here to Norway
to check it out from the inside.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
[Music playing]
Mercedes has been around for over a hundred
years, and even though this is their first
all electric vehicle.
They've taken that experience and that quality
that they've obtained over the last hundred
years and put it right into the EQC.
They're even building the EQC off of their
same assembly lines that they build the gas
powered vehicles on.
It's all-wheel drive with one electric motor
in the front and another electric motor in
the rear.
Taking a look inside the EQC.
Leather everywhere.
Fancy stitching on the sides, and a lot of
buttons.
If you're familiar with driving a Mercedes,
you're going to feel right at home in this
cuz all the buttons are the exact same.
Every aspect of the seat is motorized, along
with heating and ventilation of the seats.
And my favorite part about the EQC is that
it's...since it's a fully electric vehicle,
they have some detailing along the sides that
mimic electronics, like the fins on a heat
sink, or the circuit board patterns on a motherboard.
The same type of circuits we see inside of
cell phones.
We have the same dual screen that we saw inside
of the G-Class.
You know, you have your navigation sitting
right over here and then your speed and power
over here.
I'll talk about regen in a second.
And then up here we have a little hole in
the dash where the heads up display shines
out of.
And the cool thing about the heads up display
is that if you're sitting here, you can't
see the display, but as soon as you're in
the driver's seat, that head's up display
positions itself right in your field of view.
The head's up display is something that I
haven't seen in a whole lot of other vehicles,
but it's just sitting right there on the glass,
projected from the dashboard onto the windshield.
So you don't have to be distracted looking
around at, you know, your navigation system
when it's just right there projected in your
field of view.
It does take a second to get used to, but
it's not a distraction...or as much as I thought
it would be.
But yeah, just the quality and the attention
to detail inside of the Mercedes is insane.
Leather stitching everywhere.
I really like the heat sink and the electronic
circuit board design all throughout the theme
of this vehicle.
Coming around to the rear of the car.
We have the same fancy leather stitch seats,
rear air conditioning, speakers built into
the doors.
And check out the back.
Plenty of room for activities.
Power outlets.
The seats fold down with just a simple button
press.
And one of the coolest things that I've seen
about this car is that if we press this button
here, that drops down a tow hitch down here
at the bottom, which is completely concealed
until we press the button again.
And it should go right back up.
It's kind of like the hidden pop up camera
on the OnePlus 7.
Speaking of pop up cameras, any time we put
the Mercedes in reverse, there's a rear pop
up camera that sticks out of the Mercedes
logo.
Pretty cool.
So people aren't gonna buy an electric car
just to “save the planet.”
They're only going to buy an electric car
when the benefits outweigh those of a gas
powered car.
And honestly, I think we're at that point
where electric vehicles are taking over the
gas powered vehicles.
They are more powerful, they have enough range,
and just the features are better on electric
vehicles.
Like take this for example, on the Mercedes
EQC, there's something called regenerative
braking, or recuperation.
So instead of using the brake pedal, the car
is going to use it's electric motors to slow
the vehicle down and use that inertia, that
energy, to put back into the battery.
It's pretty cool.
So while Dan is driving, on his display we
have this super wide dashboard display right
here.
We can see when he accelerates, we have the
energy being used.
And then when he decelerates, we see the recuperation
or the regeneration where it's actually charging
the battery as he's slowing down, instead
of using the brake pads.
So while we're driving, the front of the two
motors is the more efficient motor, and so
that's what we're using right now, but when
we accelerate, it engages both motors at the
same time.
And then when we do regen, it's using both
motors to slow down the car and put power
back into the battery.
So let's say you're driving through a mountainous
area and you're up at the top of the mountain
and you start coasting down using the recuperative
braking, you could end up with more charge
in your battery at the bottom of the hill
than you had at the top of the hill because
it charged up the whole way down, using gravity
and inertia to put all that energy back into
the battery.
Which brings me to another perk of electric
vehicles, is that there's hardly any maintenance.
Yeah, there's coolant running around inside
of the battery to keep it an optimal temperature,
but it's not something you even need to change
out like changing your oil on a gas powered
car.
And since it uses the recuperation, or the
regenerative braking, also, brake pads are
something you almost never need to switch
out on an electric vehicle.
So there's a reason pretty much every single
car manufacturer is coming out with electric
versions of their vehicles, it's because electric
vehicles really are the future.
The same type of cultural shift that happened
when cars were invented, you know, going from
a horse, to a car, to a gas powered car, is
the same shift that's coming from gas powered
cars to electric cars.
The amount of power, efficiency, and speed
that you get with an electric car is just
that much better.
[Music playing]
[Dan] Did I get close?
[Zack] Yeah, you were way too close!
[Dan] It was beeping at me like dee-dee-dee-dee!
[Zack] Okay, so when we're charging, there
is an 80 kilowatt hour battery in the bottom
of this Mercedes, and it is good for about
220 miles, give or take, depending on how
you're driving.
Obviously more conservative driving equals
longer range.
And there are over 300,000 charging locations
compatible with the Mercedes vehicles.
And what's cool about it is that when you
put your payment information in the car, it
just bills you once a month for all the charging
you do outside of your own home.
Now obviously the ideal situation is to be
able to charge in your own home, drive up
to your house at night, plug it in and it
has full charge ready to go the next morning.
Just like you would with your cell phone.
Pretty simple and easy.
I think in the past when people thought about
electric cars, they were like, 'ah, but on
road trips we have to sit and charge forever.'
This Ionity supercharging network can charge
the car in just 40 minutes, which is pretty
quick.
You know, stop for lunch somewhere and then
the car is completely ready to go for the
rest of your road trip.
Let's see how it works.
So while you're driving, when it knows that
it's coming up to a charging station, it will
preheat the battery to the optimal conditions,
so it can, you know, receive more power into
the battery.
Charging a cold battery takes longer than
charging a warm battery.
And it is ready for us.
So now I can come out here to the plug itself.
We can grab the plug and plug it in.
And now it'll tell us that we have 70% battery
left.
And from inside the car, it shows us we have
71% and it's going to take us 18 more minutes
to charge all the way up to 100%.
And then when you're done charging, or you
have enough power to make it to your destination,
just hit stop, unplug, and you're good to
go.
So one perk that electric cars have over gas
powered cars is that they are so much more
quiet.
There's no rumbling engine or revving, and
because of that, you can hear the road noises
quite a bit more.
And Mercedes has gone through a couple extra
steps to quiet down the road noise inside
of the EQC.
So behind me we can see the front of the car
with the front electric motor, which is the
more efficient of the two motors, and then
we have the battery compartment in the center
and the rear motor.
So this is the rear of the car, and this is
inside the wheel covering, so you can see
the recycled materials here and the large
foam pads to keep the noise down.
And the rear motor back here also has a lot
of foam around it to keep the motor noise
down as well.
So this foam perfectly encapsulates the rear
motor.
So behind me is battery pack for the EQC,
which is located in the floor of the vehicle
because it gives it a super low center of
gravity.
There are 384 pouch style, lithium ion cells
inside of this, which is kind of the same
thing you see inside of your cellphone.
Each of the individual pouches are all wired
together into one module and then placed into
the larger battery pack that goes underneath
the EQC.
One thing we've learned from all the cellphone
tear downs I've done is that lithium ion cells,
which are inside of this battery pack, can
be damaged.
So Mercedes has made this crumple zone around
the outside so if, for whatever reason, the
EQC does get in a wreck, that gets the impact
and not the battery itself.
While this is Mercedes first fully electric
vehicle, we won't have to wait long for the
rest of the models.
They plan on having 10 more electric vehicles
by the year 2022, because electric vehicles
are the future.
So as we're driving, it overlays the street
names and where we need to turn.
See those arrows just pop up?
It's literally telling us to turn on this
street.
It can see the road in front of us and it
has a blue arrow on the video feed that does
live motion tracking and puts the street exactly
where we need to turn, with arrows where we
need to turn at.
And it shows up live in real time.
So underneath the hood we have this very large
nice plastic covering.
So there's no frunk like we've seen in some
other electric cars.
Underneath this plastic covering we should
see some hardware because Mercedes is manufacturing
this EQC on the same lines that they're manufacturing
their other gas powered vehicles.
So here we see the electric motor right here
inside of it's own chassis, which is disconnected
from the frame of the vehicle.
And this is for sound dampening so that the
noise of the spinning motor doesn't enter
inside of the cab because it's an electric
vehicle and it's meant to be quiet.
So electric cars are the future.
The car you're driving right now might not
be electric, but the one...but the next one
you buy could very well be.
So my buddy Dan here, he has transitioned
to all electric vehicles.
Has that been hard?
[Dan] I mean, we have 3 electric cars, and
my wife and I both drive them, and every day
around town they are fantastic.
Like they're way better than gas cars.
I just feel like they are.
They're comfortable, they're fun to drive,
and they just get up and go.
Um, the only time when I would say that it's
kind of a hassle is when we go on long road
trips, like 10 hour road trips.
The range just isn't as good as what I would
hope.
Maybe 400 miles would be good...500 miles.
And also charging does take a little bit of
time.
So you have to be patient, but I would say
that's only 5-10% of my driving time.
The rest of it is just the best, and I love
electric cars.
I don't see us ever going back really.
[Zack] And the more electric cars we see showing
up in the space, the more competition there
will be, and the more range they'll all have.
So it's great to see Mercedes, a luxury vehicle
manufacturer, coming out with a fully electric
vehicle.
The more competition there is with the manufacturers,
the better it is for us consumers.
If you have any questions about the Mercedes
EQC, leave them down in the comments.
Make sure to check out Dan's video over on
his channel.
He made a list of his 5 favorite things about
the EQC, so check that out right here.
And yeah, thanks a ton for watching...
[Dan] Oh, and if you saw any drone shots in
this video, I explain a little bit of that
on my video...why...how we got those and it
was pretty tricky.
[Zack] Yeah, we had some drone....
[Dan] I cut you off!
[Zack] Yeah!
Thanks a ton for watching.
We'll see you around!
