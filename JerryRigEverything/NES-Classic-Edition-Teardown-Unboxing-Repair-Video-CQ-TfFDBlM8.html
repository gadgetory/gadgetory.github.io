console the NES classic edition at only
$59 I could not pass it up it has 50
games pre-loaded including all the
graphically violent games my mom
wouldn't let me play as a kid but since
I'm now an adult I can play whatever I
want after my room is clean of course
opening up the box we find a poster and
probably some instructions here is the
controller the red buttons and Direction
pad are made of hard plastic but the
center star and reset buttons are made
of grippy rubber the controller cable is
protected by the blue plastic and after
pulling that off it seems very very
short the original NES controllers had a
6-foot cable the NES classic controller
you see here only measures to about 30
inches and I imagine most people don't
plan on sitting just inches away from
their big-screen TV I did see that
wireless controllers are being sold and
controller extension cables are pretty
cheap I'll link those in the video
description along with the console and
everything else you see in this video so
you don't have to be all up in Mario's
business while you're playing I'll open
up that controller in a minute let's go
back to the box under the controller
there is a wall charger with the USB
slot I'll set the console off to the
side and lift up the cardboard to find
the included HDMI cable and the micro
USB power cable that gives power to the
NES classic and finally here is the
console itself it is a cute little guy
much smaller than I thought it would be
it has an HDMI port and the micro USB
power port on the back and the power and
reset buttons on the front the cartridge
slot is purely for decoration and does
not open unfortunately what would have
been really cool is if you could put
gameboy games in this thing now this is
where the average person would consider
their product open and where the average
youtuber would end their unboxing
experience but here on my channel we
keep going there are no visible exterior
screws on the Nintendo which leaves the
only other obvious place for screws
under these little rubber foot pads I'll
pop those off and stick my long shaft
Phillips head screwdriver into the hole
to remove the four screws and then the
NES classic will open exposing the
internals it's pretty simple on the
inside a lot less complicated than the
original NES that I opened up a few
years ago on my channel I'll link that
video at the end of
this one then we can see five more
screws holding down the main board to
the plastic frame before the main board
can be lifted out there are three
connections we have to remove two of
them with these super tight white plugs
and then one little ribbon cable off to
the side this is the same type of ribbon
that we've seen in multiple other cell
phones before now that the board is out
we can see the microUSB and the HDMI
ports are both soldered to the main
board nothing is really modular here and
then the metal plate can pop off
exposing the opposite side here are the
brains of the whole operation
all the preloaded games are here and the
processor the metal plate even has some
thermal foam attached to it to help the
heat dissipation you know since the
Nintendo has some pretty intense
graphics the power and reset buttons are
pretty standard you can see how they
operate here and the controller plugs
can also be swapped out pretty easily
there's only one screw holding the
bottom to the frame I'll put the console
back together real quick before we tear
down the controller the plastic bracket
over the power buttons then the five
screws on the mainboard and each of
those three little plugs the whole build
of this gaming system is incredibly
simple the plastic shell goes on top and
then four more screws go through the
bottom don't forget to reinstall those
little rubber foot pads as well
now onto the controller this was pretty
interesting
there are six Phillips head screws on
the back holding it together and after
those are removed the back housing comes
free showing us the wraparound folded
cable and the first plug I'll explain
why the cable is tucked in like that in
just a second
flipping the controller over you can see
the integrated circuit as well as the
little contact pads that can sense when
each button is being pressed believe it
or not this controller is more
complicated than the original controller
I'll link the teardown of the original
controller that did about three years
ago at the end of this video the four
sided thumb pad is hard plastic on the
top and then rubber underneath with the
same type of contact pads that the rest
of the buttons have then the plastic
tops of the a and B buttons just slip
out of their slots as well I'll line up
all the buttons with their holes and
then slip the control board back into
place over top of them the reason that
the cable is wound between all these
little pegs is so that when the
controller is pulled or dropped or
thrown against the wall all of the
stress just ends up tugging at the chord
of the cable and not any of the actual
plugs or the more important internal
components of the controller it's a
pretty smart design since controllers
are probably the most abused pieces
of any console if Nintendo can get their
inventory in order and make enough of
these consoles for everyone who wants
one this is going to be one of the most
popular Christmas presence of the year
the only fly see is the short controller
cables I will link this console and the
controllers in the video description so
you can check out the current pricing if
you're interested let me know what your
favorite Nintendo game was down in the
comments if you enjoyed watching this
teardown make sure to check out the
original system that I took apart a few
years ago and as always bonus points for
follow me on Instagram and Twitter
you'll know what videos are going live
before they are even posted to YouTube
thanks for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
