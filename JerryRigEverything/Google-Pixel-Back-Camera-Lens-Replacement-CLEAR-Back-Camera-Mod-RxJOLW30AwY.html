color combinations with their pixel to
this week I figured I'd take matters
into my own hands with the original
pixel and assess some of our own color
options by swapping out the back glass
this also works if your camera lens is
broken of course and just want to
replace it like a normal person
it's surprisingly not that difficult of
a project let's get started now breaking
your glass camera lens on purpose would
be pretty dumb only a crazy person would
abuse a perfectly good phone but I am
going to simulate this repair on a phone
that does have the glass that's already
broken and I'll let you know what to
watch out for as I go along Pete is
gonna be our best friend during this
repair it does soften the adhesive under
the glass which there's actually not
very much up surprisingly enough but it
is pretty strong stuff Apple honestly
should have attached the back glass of
their iPhone 8 with the same method and
saved everyone some major time and money
but I'll save that conversation for a
different video once I got that tiny gap
open by utilizing the sharpness of my
razor blade underneath the glass I was
able to slide my slightly thicker metal
pry tools around the edge and then lift
up a pretty major chunk of the glass
there are a few important ribbon cables
you have to watch out for under that
glass slab one being the fingerprint
scanner ribbon which I'll show you in a
second and the other is this little
antenna thing along the right side at
the back avoid these fragile ribbon
cables is to peeling off the glass
layers because they can tear the
adhesive is only along the sides of the
back lens so the glass is pretty easy to
lift up and off in the phone
also remember that glass is the same
hardness as glass and can scratch itself
so try and keep the glass dust and
larger shards of glass out from
underneath the screen getting closer to
that fingerprint scanner all very
carefully push it down with my finger
and then lift up the rest of the glass
up and away from the back of the phone
leaving the home button in place pull
too hard and it'll tear and stop working
applying the replacement glass is pretty
straightforward I'll link these
replacements down in the video
description the pixel and pixel XL are
both different sizes so make sure you
buy the right one for your model the
phone i'll pull off the little bit of
adhesive protection i forgot to move
over the flash diffuser from my previous
glass so maybe you'll want to transfer
that before pulling off the adhesive
protection also needless to say make
sure the inside of the lens is clean
because
no defects in your pictures I'll just
set the glass down in place inside the
phone making sure it lines up with all
sides of the rectangle cut out before
the adhesive can grip too hard once it's
in place it's hard to remove this is the
black and blue version which looks
pretty solid and I like it but I also
want to try out that white glass the
picture-taking capabilities is still
working great the exterior glass of any
cell phone is there for protection and
not for focusing so as long as the lens
is visibly clean and clear it won't be
messing with the functionality of the
camera if the camera itself is not
working or focusing correctly it's a
hardware issue inside the phone and now
it's time for the white lens I think
this one's gonna end up looking pretty
cool the back glass was already adhered
pretty tightly to the foam body
soif lies some more heat and lifted off
with my metal pry tool and then again
prematurely pull off the adhesive
protection on the white lens before
adding the flash diffuser
I'll orient the diffuser like the shape
of an upright 8 to line it up with the
dual LEDs right below it I also cleaned
out all the extra black adhesive out
from underneath the glass so the new
lens will sit super level and flush with
the foam body getting that fingerprint
scanner lined up in the center of the
white lens here and I think this color
combination looks pretty awesome and the
white and really blue combo is legit I'm
probably going to keep this visually
appealing setup but I do want to try one
more lens and it's pretty clear what its
gonna be the coloring on all these
bonafide hardware glass lenses can be
scraped off it wasn't totally perfect
but it still looks pretty clean what
color do you think looks best the black
white blue or this nuclear version I'll
still need to add some of my transparent
double-sided adhesive to hold it down
but it's ready to go I'll link all these
replacement lenses in the video
description right below this video come
hang out with me on Instagram and
Twitter to see some of the projects that
don't make it all the way to my youtube
channel and thanks for watching I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
