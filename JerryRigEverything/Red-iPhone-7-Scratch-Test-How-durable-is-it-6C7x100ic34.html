iPhone 7 I've already tested the glass
display of the iPhone 7 in one of my
previous durability tests the only thing
we haven't tested is the deep red
coloring is it is scratch Abul at the
jet black iphone 7 or can i handle
everyday life let's find out
one thing I do like about iPhones is
that they have an all-metal design it is
heavy and solid which is good and it
looks like Apple is kept with that same
theme on this red version the top is
metal the red iPhone 7 still has those
plastic antenna lines that curve around
the corners it blends in pretty well
with the metal even if it doesn't sound
as delicious during the scratch test the
sizer metal as well and it's even metal
down here where the headphone jack
should be and for the ultimate Perkin
quality the buttons are also metal it's
a very good feeling phone all round I
approved so far the anodized coloring on
the back should be pretty resilient as
well we're going to find out if you were
toss your unprotected cell phone into
the same pocket as your keys the red is
just not as good at hiding the marks as
the matte black version I tested earlier
most of the marks can rub off but a
faint outline is still there it's still
more scratch resistant than the jet
black 7 though coins seem to have the
same effective keys it's almost as if
the keys and coins are rubbing off onto
the red instead of the red getting
damaged but either way the marks are
permanent so it's probably a good idea
to have some kind of protection on your
phone the center Apple looks like it's
made from polished aluminum my razor
blade can definitely mark it up but
something normal like keys or coins
should be just fine the coin didn't add
any marks into the mess now Apple and
product red are pretty interested Apple
has been partnered with product red for
about 10 years now and by selling
product red items in the store they've
raised more than 130 million dollars for
the Global Fund to fight AIDS that's
pretty impressive because Apple
estimates that even one dollar can
provide three days worth of life-saving
medicine for some
another notable contributor to the
Global Fund is the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation they've contributed
about 1 billion 400 million dollars
since 2001 and if you know Bill Gates is
donated to something it's got to be good
it's great to see two huge organizations
contributing to something so impactful
and life-saving on a global scale every
penny counts so thumbs up for Apple and
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
for contributing if you're interested in
donating to the Global Fund to fight
AIDS but don't want to buy an iPhone
Apple has included a link in the bottom
of their website but all it seems to do
at the moment is cycle through to
Apple's own iTunes Store so I'll include
a working link in my video description
where you can contribute directly to the
Global Fund until Apple gets their link
fixed maybe with all of us working
together we really can have an aids-free
generation that concludes math time with
Jerry anchor was kind enough to send me
some clear cases to protect my artwork
on the phone or maybe it was to protect
the phone for my artwork I forget
exactly what the letter said the case is
surprisingly clear which means that this
might be the perfect solution for
someone who wants to show off the red
iPhone without covering anything up it's
a pretty tight and snug fit all the way
around the phone if you want something
slightly more structural than just
rubber they also sent an ice case with a
more rigid plastic bumper it has the
same type sit but has the bonus
protection of the harder plastic ring
around the side and the best part of all
is that they are surprisingly
inexpensive I'll toss some links right
below this video if you want to check
them out huge thanks to Ankur for
sending me these cases my phone
definitely appreciates it since I'm sure
a few people are curious I did do a most
tests to the back of the aluminum the
level-4 pick behaved the same as the
keys and coins but the level-5 pick was
able to scrape off some of that red
coating
kind of interesting most of my
behind-the-scenes stuff happens on
Twitter and instagrams to follow me over
there and thank you so much for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
