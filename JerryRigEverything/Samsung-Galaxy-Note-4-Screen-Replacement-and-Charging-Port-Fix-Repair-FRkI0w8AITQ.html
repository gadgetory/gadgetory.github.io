everything inside the Note 4: the screen,
the charging port, all the speakers, everything.
Take off the back plate, the battery, the
S pin and remove the 16 screws that are around
the back side.
You can see here along the edge that it’s
the easiest place to lift up around the edge
of the screen, but the back frame is still
very securely adhered to the screen.
So what I do is I take a heat gun and gently
warm up around the outside of the phone.
Not getting the phone too hot to touch or
that will burn your hand, but just warming
up the adhesive underneath that will soften
it up.
I’ve found that it’s a lot easier to push
up from the top of the phone because the bottom
of the phone, next to the charging port, is
still inside and it’s a little harder to
lift up down there.
So once the screen is pushed away from the
frame you can lift the bottom up and out,
that way the charging port doesn’t get caught.
Here is the headphone jack.
You can see the little gold connectors down
there at the bottom that just press up against
the motherboard and that’s how you get your
audio.
All the replacement parts and tools will be
linked down in the video description below.
So if you need anything go down there and
check it out.
I have it all priced out for you.
Looks like the loud speaker is attached to
the back frame and it’s not removable.
So if you’re going to replace your loud
speaker for the phone you’re just going
to have to get a new back frame.
But luckily, the SD card reader and the SIM
card reader are replaceable.
Just lift up that little connector; it’s
kind of like a little Lego piece that you
unsnap.
And then you can slide your pry tool underneath
the little ribbon cable that releases all
the adhesive.
And that’s all you need to do to replace
your SD card reader and SIM card.
Once again the replacement parts will be down
in the video description below so if you need
anything go check it out.
And when you go to install it again I’ve
found that it’s easiest just to clip it
in first and then remove the adhesive on the
back of the new part and just set it down
exactly where the old part was.
You can release these little wire cables,
including the Home Button, the ear piece and
the two little antenna ribbons.
And then there’s another little connection
underneath that the charging port uses to
connect to the main board.
Unsnap that and then as you lift up the main
board from the screen you can see that there
are two more connections back there.
And that’s what the screen uses to connect
to the motherboard.
Two connections there and there.
There’s the camera.
I’m going to go ahead and lift that up.
Same little Lego connection technology.
You can see here on the screen it has the
image stabilization and apparently in the
little silver box is where the gyros are.
Pretty interesting.
Set that aside.
Then you can see the front facing camera here.
Lift up that little connection and that releases
the part.
Now, sometimes when you buy replacement parts
it won’t come with these little rubber doohickeys,
so make sure you remove those from your old
parts and then put them on your new ones before
you install them back on the phone.
But anyway that’s how the front camera comes
off.
The heart rate sensor and the flash look like
they’re soldered to the main board so we’re
just going to leave those connected.
Here’s the ear piece.
Just lift that out of the little groove.
Once again all replacement parts can be found
in the video description right below this
video.
So here’s the Power Button and also the
vibration motor.
So if either of those two items break, they
are connected and they have the same little
contact points that the headphone jack did.
So I’m going to set that back into place.
And the reason I show you this is because
both of the other buttons, the volume buttons,
have the same little connection pads as before.
So if you need to replace those, that’s
how you do it.
I’m going to go ahead and lift off the antenna
wires from the charging port and set those
off to the side.
And the charging port is here.
Just lifts up from the body of the phone.
Now this is the hard part.
The capacitive buttons are attached to the
charging port and those are underneath the
screen, which is unfortunate.
I wish it was a little bit easier to replace.
So what we have to do is we have to heat up
the screen.
We’re going to do the same thing that we
did with the back cover.
Heat it up not so hot that you burn yourself
so that it’s too hot to touch, but hot enough
it softens the glue underneath.
And then we’re going to slide a hard object,
it could be like a playing card or in this
case like a debit card or something that you’re
not going to use anymore and slide it above
the capacitive buttons, but below the glass,
LCD and the copper foil underneath the screen.
And you’ll see what I’m talking about
here in just a second.
I’m going to take another card and slide
it over the other capacitive button, making
sure to be between the copper foil and the
mid-frame.
You don’t want to start separating the glass
from the LCD because that’s an entirely
different repair that I’ll show you in a
different video.
Also make sure to watch out for the ribbon
cables in the back as well as the Home Button
cable that you can see from the back of the
phone as well.
And you’ll kind of see what that looks like
as I lift up the screen.
This whole process should take you between
10 and 15 minutes.
Make sure to go slow because you do not want
to damage the screen during this process because
that is a much more expensive repair.
Now if your screen is already damaged I wouldn’t
worry about it as much.
So here we are lifting off the screen.
You can see the ribbon cables that are attached
to the top of it.
The reason I suggest coming from the bottom,
next to the capacitive buttons is because
if you come from the top, these cables can
be damaged as well.
So coming from the bottom is much easier.
Now if you want to separate the glass from
the LCD, that’s an entirely different repair
and you can watch that video here of me working
on a Samsung Galaxy S5.
The screens are made the same so it’s pretty
much the exact same process.
Now to replace the charging port we’re going
to lift off the capacitive buttons from the
mid-frame.
They just pop right off.
They’re just held on with a little bit of
adhesive.
And that’s the charging port.
I will have replacement charging ports linked
in the video description below if you need
one of those.
And here’s the Home Button and fingerprint
scanner.
It’s just connected to a little ribbon cable
that feeds up through the mid-frame and out
the back of the phone like you saw before.
So be very careful with this during the screen
replacement.
If you need a new one go ahead and check the
video description below.
Now putting the phone back together again.
We’re going to set the Home Button down
first.
And make sure to feed it through that little
slot on the back of the phone.
And here’s the adhesive.
It’s double sided tape.
I’ll link this down in the video description
below.
The more you use the better.
Put a couple strips underneath and also put
some on the four corners of the phone to help
hold the corners of the screen down to the
mid-frame as well.
Getting those cameras hooked back into place.
Just snapping them in like little Legos.
As well as the charging port.
Make sure to connect that before you put the
motherboard down, otherwise you’ll have
a problem hooking that together.
Make sure to press the motherboard into place.
Clamp on the Home Button ribbon cable to the
main board.
And then make sure those capacitive buttons
are wrapped around to the back side and pressed
down and adhered with the little adhesive
that comes with the new part.
Now you can take the screen and connect it
to the back of the motherboard because it’s
much harder to do if the screen is already
in place and held down with that sticky tape.
So make sure to do it in that order.
Get both of those connections secured to the
motherboard and then line up the screen with
the Home Button, as well as the ear piece.
And that will tell you exactly where to press
it down onto that tape that you placed earlier.
Now that the charging port is in place with
the capacitive buttons on the other side,
we can make sure that the ear piece is down,
clamped in, just like a little Lego.
And then we have the wire cables down here
for the antenna.
Nothing super special with these, just make
sure that they’re clipped onto the little
holes that they came from and also set into
the little guiding pins.
Because if these are out of place then the
back of the phone is not going to clamp down
as well because these will be obstructing
it.
Before I put the back down I am going to test
out the phone really quick just to make sure
that it’s working and I don’t need to
readjust or re-clamp on the screen connections.
Everything looks fine.
Battery’s out, back of the phone is on.
Now watch here: as I placed it down, I realized
once again that the charging port does not
go down normally.
You have to lift out the phone, put the bottom
in first (like line up the charging port with
the little hole), and then you can squeeze
up the body of the phone and clamp it all
into place like that.
So charging port first…the rest of the phone
later.
And then you can just press in all the corners
and everything all around the outside of the
phone.
Anyway, pretty straightforward repair.
It is very difficult.
It is hard to replace the screen but it’s
definitely possible.
Make sure all the screws are in.
If you have any questions make sure to leave
them down in the comments below, or suggestions
or things that help you out during your repair.
I’m sure it will help out other people as
well.
