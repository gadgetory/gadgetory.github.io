BlackBerry Prive the actual build of
this phone is pretty complex but the two
most important repairs a battery swap
and a screen replacement are
surprisingly easy and I'll show you what
I mean throughout the video first thing
remove the SIM card tray and the SD card
tray and they're both along the top once
those are out you can peel back the back
cover from the phone make sure to watch
out for the power button and volume
buttons will just unsnap from the frame
then you can slide the phone out from
the back cover pretty simple here you
can see the rear 18 megapixel camera and
then a couple of the antennas that are
long the back of the phone with the NFC
pad and the Qi charging pad all of these
have little contact points that just
rest on the motherboard here's a
close-up shot of the contact points on
the motherboard and the contact points
on the pads and remove this plastic
shield and for the next step you'll need
a screwdriver
this one is a t5 screw that's holding
the battery in place you can just unplug
the battery it's just like a little Lego
piece that snaps into the mainboard
pretty straightforward and to remove the
battery it does help out a lot if the
battery is a little bit heated up it'll
soften the adhesive behind the battery
and you can use a little pull tab to
pull it up you really do not want to pry
this battery out at all and I'll show
you why in just a second here behind the
battery you can see that there are some
small ribbon cables that are very very
easy to rip therefore the power button
here's the battery itself you can see it
as a 3400 milliamp battery there are two
screws down here for the loudspeaker
there's a little housing with some funky
white glue surrounding it you can remove
the freaky white glue and then the
loudspeaker will just pop out from the
housing itself pretty cool pretty easy
to replace I will link all the
replacement parts down in the video
description there's a little protective
cover over the headphone jack as well
and then there are eight screws on the
mainboard
once those eight screws are removed
there all the t5 s as well you can take
off these little connectors there for
the screen and they just pop off like
little Legos then this one down here is
for the keyboard you can pop that off as
well and then the mainboard can be
removed from the frame of the device
there is one more cable along the bottom
for the power button just unclip that as
well and here you can see the thermal
paste for the Qualcomm 808 processor it
will help dissipate the heat from the
processor onto the main four
the phone and here's the camera the rear
18 megapixel camera so you can see here
the screen and the slider mechanism the
headphone jack just falls out from the
frame you can see that it has a bunch
little connection pads that just rest up
against the motherboard and that's how
it receives its signal the rest of the
screws are a bit smaller I'm going to
use my t4 driver there's eight of them
that hold the keyboard part of the frame
onto the screen part of the frame so
we're going to remove that from the
sliding mechanism just make sure that
the screen ribbon cables slide through
the little slot in the keyboard frame so
let's take a look at the keyboard the
keyboard has stuck to the frame
relatively permanently if you remove the
keyboard you will have to find some way
to adhere it I do have to fix my keypad
though because of my durability video I
did mess up the keypad a little bit so
we're going to tuck that back in it
looks like the keyboard can be replaced
it just depends on how they sell the
replacement parts if it comes with the
copper piece you can remove that from
the frame if the keyboard comes without
the copper piece make sure you leave the
copper backing installed on the frame
and just remove the keyboard section I'm
going to put my keyboard back on I will
have to use some kind of superglue or
something else to adhere it because
there is no residual adhesive on the
back of the plastic so here is the
sliding mechanism it's a bunch of these
little wire springs you can detach from
the front frame and if you're going to
remove this section you want to lift it
up over the gold little doohickey fold
up the ribbon cables and tuck it down
into the screen this is a fairly
difficult process so I would recommend
not touching this sliding mechanism
unless you have to it is not essential
to repairing the screen and I will show
you that in just a second I did end up
bending this part of the frame just a
little bit to slide it out from the
little grooves this next part is not
essential to a screen replacement either
it is only important if you're trying to
get into the front camera there's a
little metal bracket and one more screw
as well and then you can just remove the
front 2 megapixel camera from this
little holster it's a tiny little guy
not super important now here's the
screen and let me show you how easy this
is it is way easier than the galaxy
screens where there is a bunch of
adhesive on the LCD and the glass you
got to make sure not to break anything
there is only adhesive surrounding the
edge of the BlackBerry Prive which is
very nice I found it easiest to go in
from where the earpiece is because
there's not a whole lot of glue and
there's a little slot between the frame
and the glass
so once I lifted that up I could slide a
business card in between the glass and
the frame that QR code just takes you to
my youtube channel speaking of which if
you've enjoyed this video so far make
sure you've hit that subscribe button it
does help me keep making videos like
this into the future now that I've
heated up the phone my business card
will slip in make sure you don't put it
too far into the top of the phone and
I'll show you why in just a second but
once you pop out through the side you
can just take it and slide it all the
way down as long as the phone is still
warm from the heat gun I usually get it
to about guess where it's too hot to
touch and the card will just slice
through the adhesive all the way down to
the bottom of the phone and you can just
slice through the bottom of the phone as
well
super simple I imagine that a
professional technician to replace this
screen in about five or ten minutes once
they're used to the operation it's a
pretty impressive design there's one
ribbon cable underneath holding the LCD
onto that screen extension cable that we
were talking about before now that I've
unplugged that we can see the part that
was warning you about now if your screen
is shattered or broken you don't need to
worry about damaging it anymore
since my screen is working I want to
keep it functional now about this point
during my teardown this is where I
realized that the screen can be removed
without actually opening up the phone
you can see that your new replacement
screen can just be plugged into the body
while everything is still intact which
is fantastic now I'm going back into the
track mechanism I'm gonna put the phone
back together just to prove that the
screen can be replaced without the phone
being taken apart now the track
mechanism is put back together I'm going
to put in the front-facing camera put
the back fragile plastic pieces back
into place now if you did take apart
your sliding mechanism make sure you
line up the Flex ribbon cable with
little holes in the frame so that the
ribbon won't be pinched when you're
sliding the phone up and down then you
can take the screen extension cable and
slide it through the keyboard section of
the frame it will end up near the top of
the little slot there are eight screws
and then you can take your 18 megapixel
rear camera and plug it back into the
main board plug your power button into
the bottom of the mainboard fold that
over and put it back onto the frame
there are eight screws holding the
motherboard onto the frame of the phone
and you plug in all of your ribbon
cables like the keyboard and the two
screen extensions put in your
loudspeaker with the protective black
housing
the housing for the headphone jack get
those three screws back into place now
the phone is completely assembled let's
install the screen it just plugs into
the main body of the phone just like a
little Lego piece and all the other
connections we've been working with and
then most of replacement screens come
with adhesive pre-installed so just
remove the protective covering over the
adhesive and then set the screen down
into place and you're done
I'm going to plug in the battery make
sure the phone works by pressing the
power button and everything is great
pretty fantastic design I'm impressed
that the screen can be replaced so
easily screw the battery back in and
then you can tuck it back into the back
housing starting with the bottom and
just moving your way up the sides
clipping it down into place put the SIM
card and the SD card trays back in and
everything is good feel any questions
make sure leave them down in the
