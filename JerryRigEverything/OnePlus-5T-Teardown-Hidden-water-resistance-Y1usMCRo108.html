test and it's time for the teardown I
review technology from the inside it'll
be interesting to see if oneplus has
added any unadvertised water resistance
to their newest flagship let's get
started at the bottom of the phone there
are two tiny screws my pentalobe
screwdriver did work for this but I
think the actual bit is a t - just make
sure not to strip the screws the SIM
card tray does come out at this point as
well this time it is mandatory now
lifting off the screen is pretty
difficult I feel like the 5 t is much
tighter than the previous one +5 I am
using a thin metal pry tool to get
between the plastic edge of the screen
and the metal edge of the phone there is
no adhesive holding the screen down but
the clasps are extremely tight so as you
get one up and out the rest of them get
pinched and harder making the screen
difficult to remove but the good news is
is that the screen is attached to the
pretty solid mid frame which gives it
stability and also includes the
motherboard and battery so the whole
thing lifts up and out as one unit
leaving the back panel and charging port
behind this also exposes the totally not
red battery kind of disappointing but
maybe next year one plus will go back to
the cool-looking insides they used to
have we can always hope the back of the
phone is still attached with two ribbons
the first is for the ceramic fingerprint
scanner hello and plug that ribbon like
a little Lego and then fold over the
back panel so I can unplug the battery
and charging port ribbons both of these
ribbons are hidden under a metal latch I
did remove the screw next the latch but
it's actually a new screwless design it
just unclips with a little leverage
interesting I'll unplug the battery
connection first and then the charging
port ribbon this allows the back panel
to be completely removed from the phone
this metal panel has the fingerprint
scanner and a bunch of gold contact pads
for the antennas and button connections
we'll talk more about the charging port
and headphone jack components in a
second but first let's remove the
battery I remove one little screw at the
bottom right of the motherboard and then
unclip the metal bracket over the
extension ribbon and fold it back away
from the battery then I grab the green
pull tab at the right side of the
battery and
it was refreshingly easy to remove not
much force is holding it in place making
this a pretty simple repair the battery
is a 3300 milliamp hour and it also says
it's not removable oops the loudspeaker
inside the 1 + 5 T is held in place by
six normal Phillips head screws the
loudspeaker then pulls away revealing a
circular vibration motor and the other
side of the extension ribbon cable the
dual cameras are up here at the top of
the phone the connectors are held down
by yet another metal bracket and one
silver screw then both cameras can
unplug and come away from the phone now
neither of these lenses have optical
image stabilization both have the same
focal point as well meaning there is no
wide angle or telephoto lenses just the
normal portrait mode I do kind of wish
the camera had a few extra perks to it
like that oh is or telephoto they are
pretty important but it is what it is
there are six silver screws holding down
what's left of the motherboard I'll
remove those and set them off the side
in an organized fashion and unclip the
black signal wire from the edge of the
board this allows the whole thing to
pull away from the foam body even though
the 1 + 5 t as a flagship grade Qualcomm
Snapdragon 835 processor inside it does
not have any kind of copper heat pipe or
thermal cooling system like other
flagships have the difference in
performance and lifespan will probably
be negligible but sometimes those little
details do matter in the long run the
front-facing camera does not have oh is
either but most smartphones don't the
screen is still attached the mid frame
at this point and if the screen does
need to be replaced I would use heat to
soften the adhesive between the two
layers and pull them apart a lot of heat
but that also destroys the screen and I
want my phone to still work when I put
it back together only do that if your
screen is unsalvageable I'll link all
the replacement parts and tools in the
video description the buttons like the
volume and power are also attached the
mid frame so just make sure that the new
screen has all the parts you need from
your old screen before you put it back
together I'll set the motherboard back
down into the frame and get those six
screws screwed back in to hold it down
and then set the dual camera unit into
its slot and plug both of them in with
the silver metal bracket holding it all
down the signal wire gets plugged in and
then we'll mosey on down to the
loudspeaker I'll plug in the extension
ribbon cable first and then secure the
whole thing in place with the six silver
screws now as far as waterproofing this
phone goes oneplus did
talk about any IP ratings for the 5t but
it looks like they were playing with the
idea of including an IP water resistance
rating in the future the phone does have
a mesh screen protecting the insides of
the loudspeaker from water plus the USBC
charging port has its own red rubber
ring around the tip this could be for
water resistance or shock absorption
from plugging and unplugging the
charging cable every day
either way rubber is a good thing at
least something inside the phone is red
thumbs up for that the inside of the
frame does have foam running around the
entire edge and this is probably to keep
things tight with no squeaks or sounds
there is no tackiness or adhesive
element to it so it's not for water
resistance so even though it looks like
oneplus is thinking about water
resistance in the future definitely
don't trust anything yet I'll tuck the
boring yellow battery back into the
frame and then plug in the extension
ribbon cable over the top and protect it
with that metal bracket and bottom right
screw on the motherboard the charging
port is next I'll clip that right by the
battery which plugs in last and the
whole thing is held down by the last
metal latch and the final screw the
fingerprint scanner gets plugged in and
then the whole contraption can fold over
back on top of the phone the screen is
mostly held in place by friction and the
metal tabs around the side but I'm being
careful not to apply too much pressure
because glass is still glass
thank you much pressure can break it
which would be pretty unfortunate at
this stage of the game lucky for me
though the whole thing still turns on
I'll add those final two bottom t2
screws and call it a success the 1 + 5 t
might be hard to get inside of initially
but it's pretty repairable once you get
in there if you haven't seen the
durability test of the 1 + 5 t you go
check that out and make sure to follow
me over on twitter we have a good time
over there thanks ton for watching and
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
