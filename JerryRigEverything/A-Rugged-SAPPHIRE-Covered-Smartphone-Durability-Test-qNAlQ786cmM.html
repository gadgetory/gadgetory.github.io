while has released a new phone an
extremely rugged smartphone called the
dura force pro to Kyocera claims this
phone has a full sapphire display but
there's only one way to find out for
sure not only $450 this should be
interesting on the back of the phone it
says class 1 division 2 which means this
phone can be used in hazardous locations
without causing explosions gotta love
that let's get started right out of the
box the phone feels smooth plastic
almost fluffy compared to the dense
glass and metal phones were used to
seeing it definitely still has that
rugged durable look to it let's get
started with the scratch test a phone
with real sapphire on the display
doesn't come around very often as we
know these Mohs hardness picks tell the
difference between different materials
plastic would leave marks at level 3
normal glass would scratch it a6 and
Sapphire should only start to scratch at
level 8 sapphire has a totally different
composition than glass it's a crystal
structure that's actually grown in a lab
and its hardness level is up there with
precious gems and diamonds an incredibly
impressive expensive and premium
material taking a look at the level 6
and 7 pick locations where glass
normally starts to scratch we see no
marks the screen of this dura force pro
2 is still flawless let's take it up to
a level 8 finally in pedal of late we
start to see some damage this is exactly
where we would expect sapphire to be
it's what we saw on the HTC u ultra
sapphire edition as well as the sapphire
covered T so watches that I've used to
explain sapphire in the past
Kyocera says the camera lens on the back
of the phone is sapphire as well
we'll be verifying that in just a second
a level 9 pick of course also leaves
marks on the crystal as wood diamonds at
level 10 but I'm kind of fresh out of
those at the moment the earpiece up at
the top is covered in plastic and can be
scratched the whole phone is designed to
handle a few stone and keep working so
superficial damage is kind of irrelevant
there is a 5-megapixel selfie camera
under that same sapphire display so
definitely protect it from scratches the
thick knobby corners of this phone
though are made from a softer slightly
grip
plastic under the large flap on the side
we have our sim NSD expandable memory
slot and a dedicated camera button below
that this could be programmed to be a
Google assistant or another app instead
it's super nice of Kyocera to let us
choose how to use our own buttons
phenomenal idea
I hope Samsung is watching the bottom of
the phone has a huge watertight ip68
plastic flap covering the USBC charging
port we have you in more plastic along
the sides with another large
programmable button on the left side
this button is supposed to be
push-to-talk ya radio style button but
can also be remapped to literally
anything else I'm a fan the volume
rocker is also made from plastic and
look what we have up here a headphone
jack instant thumbs up it's protected
with the same watertight flaps that
cover the SD card and charging port this
durable smart phones turning out to be a
winner the power button doubles as a
fingerprint scanner I'll scratch that up
to simulate a guy on YouTube who
scratches stuff but while adding my
fingerprint I would get constant
fingerprint scanner as dirty messages
even when it finally did accept my
fingerprint the dirty little fingerprint
scanner was not efficient at recognising
my finger nor would it unlock the screen
every time there is always other ways to
unlock your phone of course but the
weaker fingerprint scanner is just
something to keep in mind the back of
the Kyocera dura force pro 2 has four
smooth hard rubber pads on each of the
corners definitely an added perk for
drop protection now back to the Sapphire
it's a pretty incredible substance the
optically clear stuff used in technology
and like on phone screens and camera
lenses is lab-grown fabricated in a lab
over weeks into a large clear cylinder
called a bull this massive chunk of
sapphires then bored out and cut up to
make watch faces or smaller bores to
make camera lenses or sawed into
rectangular chunks and polished to make
smartphone displays like the one here on
the Kyocera it's a fascinating process
that I'd love to show off in real life
if anyone over there at Kyocera is
watching the back panel covering the
wireless charging pad is plastic not all
sapphire is created equal one company
who shall remain nameless uses an impure
version of safe
fire just kidding it's Apple Apple is
using junk sapphire on their camera
lenses you can see here with the piece
of sapphire that's covering the normal
13 megapixel camera and 8 megapixel
wide-angle lens
great combo by the way it does not
scratch with a level six or seven most
pic it's only when we reach levels eight
and nine that the surface of the lens
starts to get damaged this is the good
quality sapphire Apple on the other hand
has subpar sapphire lenses on every
single one of their iPhones those get
scratched starting at levels 6 and 7
just like glass wood there is a definite
difference in quality
I'm impressed with Kyocera their product
is behaving as advertised imagine that
like any rugged smartphone this guy is
supposed to work in extreme heat which
might just give us another reason for
this burn test been struggling for years
trying to justify this one and mostly
just like fire the 1080p IPS LCD
underneath the 5 inch slab of sapphire
on the Kyocera dura force pro 2 lasted
30 seconds under the heat from my direct
flame watch how fast it recovers though
it's ready for round 2 with zero damage
done to the display underneath
impressive now for the bin test
a rugged smartphone with no structure
would be rather dumb independent
third-party testing though is really the
only way to tell this rock-solid er
force pro 2 has zero flex and passes my
durability test
Kyocera has managed to make a durable
rugged phone out of premium materials
and I'm very impressed
it might even very well be the most
durable phone of this year Apple should
be reaching out to Kyocera to find a
quality sapphire supplier should we be
putting sapphire on all cell phone

future hit that subscribe button and
coming out with me over on Twitter and

thanks ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
