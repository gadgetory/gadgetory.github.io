semi-transparent smartphone they've
dropped a translucent black option onto
their you 11 Plus model which is a huge
step in the right direction for nerds
who like to see inside the expensive
tech they are paying for I kept waiting
for HTC to release this phone in the USA
but it's still currently unavailable
when Squarespace offered to sponsor a
video I knew immediately what phone I
wanted to check out let's get start
and here it is the translucent black HTC
u11 plus and while it is
semi-transparent it's still much darker
than I anticipated I guess that's why
they call it a translucent black I'll
bump up the exposure on my camera so you
can see all the details inside the phone
the one prominent feature is the copper
ish looking coils that peek through the
center of the glass while easily
mistaken for wireless charging these are
actually just the NFC coils for payments
or transferring files via near-field
communication to other devices within a
few inches personally I think HTC could
have made the glass a bit more
see-through you know so let's see if we
can help them out a bit
removing the back panel is pretty
similar to all the other glass back
smart phones like Samsung or LG not the
new iPhone though that piece of glass
can buzz right on out of here
after the HTC u11 is warm I can lift up
with a suction cup and slip my metal pry
tool between the glass edge and the
middle frame and work my way around the
edges with a piece of paper do not put
too much pressure on the curved glass
the reason the U 11 partially failed my
durability test was because the metal
frame and the screen glass have no
cushion between the two layers metal
isn't very forgiving during drops or
bins and the glass shatters paper is
much more forgiving than my metal pry
tool so I'm using that to slice through
the adhesive and it's working just fine
finally the translucent back can lift
off I'll unplug the fingerprint scanner
with my blue pry tool and check it out
the phone is revealed it's interesting
that the glass is semi translucent in
the center and then gradients out to
black pretty quickly around the edges
when I first saw this phone I was pretty
excited about the wireless charging
being so epically prominent and
prevalent but it's just NFC no wireless
charging option it's still cool looking
of course but wireless charging would
have much more substantial copper inside
to handle the induction looking closer
at the back glass it almost has a green
tint to it as the colour gets darker
around the edges reviewing tech from the
inside has its perks
it looks good don't get me wrong but
let's show HTC what a real transparent
phone looks like I'll pop off the
fingerprint scanner and the camera lens
frame from the underside of the glass
and then I can start scratching away the
color normally with a glass back LG or
Samsung phone this would either pull off
in one
junk or some industrial paint thinner
would help remove the color but HTC is
using a different laminate layer
material that left some pretty heavy
residue on the glass even after the
laminate coloring is gone I'd like to
get a little bit of a grip on the
laminate by scraping away with my razor
and then using heat to soften the
laminate and pull it up off the glass
I don't have to worry about my razor
blades scratching the glass because a
razor is a level 5 on Mohs scale and
glass won't scratch till level 6 you can
see the hefty amount of residue left on
the glass right here
I thought paid thinner might help get
this off but it's pretty invincible gunk
the only thing that really worked was a
whole lot more scraping and some glass
cleaner even after the laminate is
pulled off the glass it still has a
tinted mirror like finish to it which
I'm fine with
I think it looks pretty sweet I'll get
the camera lens put back into place
along with the plastic flash diffuser
I'm gonna leave the black plastics
intact this time around since it kind of
goes with the darker tinted aesthetics
of the phone but clear plastics have
been around for a hundred years
so if HTC really wants to make a
transparent phone on their next device
all the way down to the circuit boards
I'm sure they could kind of like the
clear Nintendo switch mod while I put
adhesive around the square of the phone
let's talk about square space for a
second huge thanks to them for
sponsoring this video and making this
teardown possible Squarespace is an easy
to use website builder the cool thing
with Squarespace is that all of their
tools are in one spot buying the domain
the hosting and even the templates for
building a website whether you want your
resume online or you're building a
legitimate online storefront with
products and inventory
Squarespace can handle it and it never
needs to be updated you get 10% off your
purchase by heading to squarespace.com
slash jerry-rigged and speaking of being
updated how do you like the new updated
transparent glass of the you 11 plus I
do like now that we can see more of the
internal antennas and the massive 39 30
milliamp hour battery huge thumbs up to
HTC for pushing the boundaries in phone
design and taking official steps to make
the fully transparent phone we all want
check out Squarespace if you need a
website
and thanks a ton for watching I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
