replace just the glass on an iPhone
screen this video will work for the
iPhone 5c the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5s
what I've done to this point it has
taken off the back metal plate the home
button and the earpiece from the phone
if you want to watch how to do this on
your own phone go ahead and click the
link that goes to yours and it will show
you the teardown video for that this
video is just how to replace the glass
on your iPhone taking off these little
plastic pieces from the top of the phone
because we're going to reuse those on
the glass once we get it back into place
that last piece was a little metal grill
be really careful with these ribbon
cables during the process because if you
bend or tweak them in any way your LCD
is going to stop working permanently
grab a heat gun and start heating up
your phone very gently you want to get
it to 70 degrees Celsius but don't go
over 95 degrees Celsius or you will
start burning the LCD underneath if
you're not using one of those
handy-dandy laser heat temperature
sensors which I will link in the video
description below you just want to get
it just too hot to touch
pull off the plastic frame from around
the edge of the glass because we are
going to reuse the plastic frame with
your new glass that you purchase from
the link in the video description below
now I'm going to grab a playing card and
kind of slide it between the plastic
frame and the glass to kind of help out
if your screen is shattered this will
come off a little bit easier but since
my screens mostly in one piece it's
slightly harder clean off any shards of
glass that are down in this plastic
since we're going to reuse it and now we
need to separate the LCD from the glass
itself so we're going to grab that heat
gun and heat it up again to that same
temperature range as before just getting
it barely too hot to touch
we don't want to do any damage to the
LCD underneath the LCD will become
yellow or brown if you've heated it up
too much now I'm going to grab my
playing card wants us to temperature and
slide it between the LCD in the glass
I'm going to flip it over and show you
what it looks like you can see that the
glue is kind of liquid between the two
layers and it's just kind of sliding
away from the the card itself
if you've enjoyed the video so far if
you feel like you've learned something
go ahead and kick that subscribe button
it does mean a lot to me and it does
help me keep on making videos like this
one also check out my Instagram I
promise I do more interesting things
than just fix phones all day links to
social media and repair parts will be
found in the video description below now
you can see as I slide the card in that
the glue is not responding as quickly as
it was before it's because the glass is
cooling down it does cool down fairly
quickly because it's so thin so I'm
going to go ahead and stop sliding my
card around here in a second I'm going
to reheat the glass again so that the
glue will become more liquid this is
pretty freaking exciting I'm going to
eat it up to that same temperature range
as before 70 degrees Celsius 95 degrees
Celsius
and you can watch the cards separate the
glass from the LCD I'm not going to
speed this up at all just so you can see
exactly how the glue reacts with the
card
some people use wire some people use
razor blades if this isn't the funnest
thing you've watched all day I don't
know what is
you can see that this glass shard is
about to pop off if your screen is more
crack than this you'll be pulling glass
shards off more often but since my
screen is not too bad this is all the
excitement that you get pull that guy
off and we are almost done so buckle up
ladies and gentlemen we're almost there
the anticipation is killing me and we
are finished
you can go ahead and pull that glass off
and just throw it away we're not going
to need it anymore
replacement glass pieces it will be
found in the video description below so
here's the LCD when you look at it I
want you to think eggshell because any
more pressure than what would crack an
egg shell will crack this and you'll be
left with just a broken piece of plastic
we're going to pull off all the glue
that we can from it just kind of rolling
it off with your finger remember being
super super gentle the whole time once
you've gotten all the big pieces of glue
off you can use a gentle solvent like
alcohol and just kind of rub it around
on top of the glue and it'll just kind
of make it dissolve I will link in the
video description the alcohol that I use
and you can buy that if you need to I'm
taking a plastic pry tool you can also
use you know that broken debit card or a
plastic card and scrape off some of the
major pieces of glue from the edge of
the screen and then heading back to the
alcohol
kind of helps clear up the last little
bits of it some people recommend using
Google I personally haven't tried that
before but it's an option here is the
very clean LCD screen not I've gotten
all the glue off I'm going to do one
quick last little rubdown with the
alcohol a new piece of cloth to make
sure that there's not any dust or
anything before I put this UV activated
loca glue on top of the screen so what
this glue is it is an optically clear UV
activated glue I will link that down the
video description below as well and you
just going to lay it out in a pattern
similar to this so that you don't trap
air bubbles underneath the glass when
you lay it down
if you get any air bubbles in the glue
you can just tap it with your metal
tweezers and those will pop the little
bubbles that are inside anyway taking
the glass lining up the earpiece with
the ribbon cables to make sure that it's
oriented in the right direction and then
I'm just going to gently place the glass
down on top of the LCD and the glue
remember the slower you do this the
better because if you do it fast it's
going to trap little air bubbles inside
and they're going to be almost
impossible to remove because they are
between the glass and the LCD so if you
do get bubbles you can just kind of like
massage them out towards the edge of the
glass but just you know the slower you
do it the less bubbles you have
preferably none anyway if you need to go
grab popcorn feel free to pause the
video it is pretty darn exciting still
just pressing the glue out to the edge
of the screen you can kind of see that
the glass will slide around a little bit
this is fine and it's actually
preferable because we are not using a
mold at the moment I figured the
majority of the world wouldn't have
molds to work with so we are doing the
video without them I'm sure you prefer
that as well okay now that the glue has
been pushed out to the edges of the LCD
I'm going to lift it up and the glue
kind of acts like the suction which is
nice and makes our job a little bit
easier the goal here is to line the LCD
up with the glass so you want an even
distance on the left and right side of
the LCD and then along the top here
you're going to see a white line you
want that line to be completely hidden
by the top glass once you've kind of
gently put it in place making sure that
there's no air bubbles or anything
between the glass and the LCD I'm going
to doing a couple last-minute
adjustments here before I grab my UV
light the UV light is what cures the
glue or makes it dry the glue will
always stay liquid until the UV light
hits it I've heard of some guys going
outside and using the Sun but I feel
like that would take too long and I
honestly don't think it really works
that well so just grab a UV light and
stick it over the top of the screen I
did mine for about
any seconds and then I flipped it up
just to make sure I didn't need to do
any last-minute adjustments to it while
the glue is still kind of tacky because
the glue will dry completely in about a
minute or two once the UV light is on it
now that it's all dried I'm going to
flip it over and then clean off the back
any excess glue making sure that it's
not going to stick around get it now
there are some adhesive that you want to
use to get the frame onto the glass this
3m stuff that you see me putting on
right now is actually garbage do not use
it I would recommend using the sticky
tape that I showed previously that comes
in the giant roll that stuff is a lot
more sticky and does a lot better job
but hindsight is 20/20 now that I've
placed the glass inside of the frame I
can start putting the whole film back
together again if you're bored of this
part you can kind of skip towards the
end especially if you know you're doing
getting that metal plate back into place
putting the home button down getting the
metal brackets screwed in making sure
that the frames in the right spot and
now I'm putting in all of those little
bits and pieces that I took off in the
beginning of the video like the earpiece
the grille rubber bit a little other
little plastic thingy majiggy and
setting down the camera and proximity
sensors into place in that plastic
bracket earpiece goes in your piece
bracket goes in screw on the top screw
on the bottom and there you go
everything seems to be working now the
screen is back into place if you have
any questions be sure to leave it in the
comments down below don't forget to like
if this video helped you and don't
forget to subscribe it does mean a lot
hope see you around
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
