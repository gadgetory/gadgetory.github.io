iPhone se phones I've done 18 bin tests
on high-end smartphones over the past
year which means I've probably bent more
phones than anyone else in the world
I'm pretty sure my mother is extremely
proud let's get started with a scratch
test I have a set of picks that tell me
how hard or a scratch resistant the
front glasses a level-one would be the
equivalent of talc powder and level-10
is diamonds this screen starts to
scratch at a level 6 and has a deeper
groove with a level 7 pick which is
exactly what the galaxy s7 scored as
well now for the back camera glass some
smartphones use a plastic lens for their
camera like the blackberry Prive which
optically doesn't matter much but
durability wise on a heavily abused
smartphone glass is a little less prone
to scratching so I personally like when
manufacturers use real glass luckily
Apple did use glass for this phone let's
give them a thumbs up for using the
glass to cover their 4k camera the lens
does sit perfectly flush with the back
panel though there is no protective lip
like with other iPhones so impacts can
directly affect the glass watch out for
that the back metal is aluminum Apple
didn't brag about their 7000 series
aluminum this time around so it's
possible they did drop back to the 6000
series for the more budget device keys
an coins can scuff up the bead blasted
satin finish the Apple logo in the
center of the phone is made of stainless
steel another positive point for the
iPhone se is the home button it appears
to be made out of glass or ceramic and
does not easily scratch like the plastic
home button on the galaxy s7 or the note
5 on to the burn test this is always
interesting to me every screen is made a
bit different Apple uses an IPS backlit
display which isn't quite as vibrant or
saturated as an AMOLED screen I feel
like the IPS is a bit more true to life
though with time pixels turn off from
the extreme heat and then come back on
again after the heat is removed
unlike the galaxy s7 AMOLED display
which turned white and never recovered
onto the bin test remember I do these
tests for every new phone that comes out
so hit that subscribe button so you are
always up to date
when I apply force to the iPhone se it
flexes a bit and then cracks right along
that bottom volume button always a weak
spot on phone
it stops flexing after the crack though
and nothing is permanently damaged it
survived more force than the Nexus 6p
did as well as the Xperia z5 so it's a
tough call but I think this phone passes
the bin test even with the minor edge
damage what do you think let me know in
the poll in the upper corner thanks a
ton for watching and supporting my
destructive habits let me know in the
comments what phone you would like to
see tested next and click this card if
you want to see the rest of my
smartphone durability tests check my
Instagram and Twitter for behind the
scenes pictures and a secret Lego Star
Wars project I am working on thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
