knocks off' or is it the ax on em with
so many phones these days I'm starting
to get confused this is the most recent
dual screen Android phone released from
ZTE which unfortunately is an exclusive
to the AT&amp;amp;T network so not many people
will get the chance to check this out
today we'll be reviewing the axon M dual
screen smartphone together my way let's
get started
the axon M folds open like a book
revealing to 5.2 inch displays it can
mirror extend or just rock that normal
dual display showing split-screen apps
on either side right now I have the
camera and the calendar open at the same
time I'll fold it shut to turn off the
back screen and go back to normal mode
you can also try an extended display
whatever movie you are watching jumps
across the divide and shows one half of
the flick on either side of the screen
this is great for people who think
center pixels are overrated those Center
bezels take out a decent sized chunk of
the movie real estate flipping the phone
sideways though will allow you to get
the full screen effect while being able
to read and participate in the comments
at the same time that part is pretty
cool let's start the scratch test
resistance of both screens I have a set
of most pics that tell me what the
screen is made from plastic scratches at
level three tempered glass at a six and
diamonds would be a level ten you might
be thinking that this is the first dual
screen Android phone but actually back
in 2011
Kyocera released its echo with dual 3.5
inch displays it's cool to see a more
modern version now in the axon lineup
both screens have scratched at a level 6
with a deeper groove at a level 7 which
makes sense for this Gorilla Glass 5 on
both sides so I'll make my way up to the
top of the phone and we find a dual tone
flash that's made from plastic and one
camera lens that's embedded underneath
the Gorilla Glass 5 it's a 20 megapixel
camera and it's the only one that exists
on this phone but with a screen on both
sides it's easy to switch back and forth
the earpiece is flush with the front
glass and also make the plastic up here
the top of the phone we have some metal
and a headphone jack
this Android phone made room for two
huge screens and a jack some companies
can't even fit a jack in a phone with
one screen there's always room for Jack
besides the phone are full of our
favorite sound a solid metal frame along
with the metal camera button fingerprint
scanner metal volume rocker and the
metal SIM and expandable memory SD card
tray it really does make you wonder what
cool things Apple could do with their
money if they ever decided to innovate
checking to see if the scratch
fingerprint scanner still works I
registered my finger and tried it out a
few times it went well and still
functioned but normally I scratched
things a little bit more the second time
around the fingerprint scanner only
functioned about half the time but it
would seriously be hard to cause this
level of damage on accident at the
bottom of the phone we have dual speaker
slots
another thing the iPhone I have and a
USB C port all surrounded by that metal
frame now most of the acts on them is
metal but the surround of the secondary
screen is plastic I'll dig more into
this in a second
but first check out the canvas size on
the back of the W Knox if there was a
survey done of sixteen thousand people
that found 72% of those people check
their smartphones at least once an hour
it's impressive how addicting
smartphones can be a separate survey
found seventy-five percent of people
admitted texting and driving interesting
to see how closely those numbers match
up and that's why I do this hourglass
maybe we don't always need to check our
phones every hour
I mean you already know none of those
dm's you just slid into you're gonna get
a response so you might as well just
wait calling the battery door panel is
metal and the rest of the back surface
is plastic
this little extrusion here fits
comfortably into its counterpart on the
other side of the foam keeping both
sides extremely solid there's no
wiggling around when the phone is shut
but as you know we'll be testing this
more in a second it's time for the burn
test this phone has dual 5.2 inch IPS
LCD s and it lasted about eight seconds
before the pixels turned black they did
recover completely after the heat was
removed which is always kind of fun to
watch just remember don't do this to
your own phone some screens don't
recover and now the bin test the bin
test shows a lot about what kind of
abuse the phones can handle during its
lifespan in an ideal world phones would
never get damaged but accidents happen
luckily both halves of this phone are
totally solid no flexing or shifting
between the layers so even sitting on
this phone in your back pocket the hinge
will remain intact with the way those
grooves are situated in the back panel
of the phone supported by that super
long full-length hinge everything is
solid at least while the phone is closed
now if I were to open the phone up and
intentionally snap it at the weakest
point then yes it would be catastrophic
but in the normal used closed position
this phone is a winner when it comes to
build quality I think we'll gain more
from a functioning teardown video then
we would by taking a cheap shot at that
open hinge hit that subscribe button if
you haven't already and we'll review
this tech from the inside would you ever
buy a dual screen phone what would you
want to change to make it more useful
thanks a ton for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
