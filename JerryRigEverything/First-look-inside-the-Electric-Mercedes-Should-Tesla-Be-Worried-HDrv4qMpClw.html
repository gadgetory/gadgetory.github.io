look at the EQC and right off the bat
you can tell it's a Mercedes Mercedes
has been making cars for the last 130
years and today they just announced
their brand-new all-electric vehicle the
Mercedes EQC kind of an SUV type of
vehicle competing with Tesla's Model X
while Mercedes has been around for a
hundred and thirty years Tesla's only
been around for fifteen Mercedes made
2.4 million cars last year Tesla only
made a hundred thousand so vientiene to
see what the two companies can't come up
with when comparing the two vehicles
let's get started and even though it's a
fully electric vehicle it does have a
grille in the front which I found
interesting a lot of the tests let's do
not have a grille because there's no
need to cool down anything inside of the
engine because there's a trunk in a
Tesla but the Mercedes on the other hand
has its motor in the front engine
compartment so the front headlights to
have their LED bands that go all the way
across the top giving it a very unique
look and the grille is actually
functional there's a cooling system
inside that brings the temperature of
the batteries and the motor down with
the airflow the door handles are pretty
normal open it up inside of the EQC
let's take a look my cameraman has
arrived Dan you want to hold the camera
for me so I've been inside of a couple
different Mercedes cars I've been inside
the g-class when we did that road trip
across Spain I've been inside the
a-class and the S Class if you've driven
a Mercedes in the past you're gonna feel
right at home in this it has the same
Mercedes vibe as their previous cars
with a few subtle differences so we have
the standard dual screens that we saw
premiered with the a-class with these
little buttons right here that toggle
back and forth between all the
information there are quite a lot of
buttons in this vehicle including this
trackpad but one thing I do like is that
specifically Mercedes design these two
look like circuit board patterns the
same type of design you would see
pattern inside of a cell phone or a
motherboard computer as well as these
silver lines going around the sides are
modeled after an aluminum heatsink which
is pretty cool
so while mercedes has maintained true to
their normal interior design there
couple aspects that are more futuristic
so if you've been on the Internet at all
in the last couple years you know that
Tesla's had some production issues
obviously scaling vehicle production is
one thing but there's minor issues like
body panel gaps in the model 3 that
Tesla has had problems with one step
ahead that Mercedes has is where they've
been designing vehicles for 130 years
they already have those little cosmetic
issues figured out and probably won't be
a problem with their newer electric
vehicles another cool thing is that
Mercedes has dual charging with AC and
DC and go from 10 percent to 80 percent
in about 40 minutes which is pretty
quick with how massive that battery pack
is now that we've seen the outside let's
jump inside the components and see how
the battery pack and the motors actually
work underneath the car
so the interior of the car there's two
motors there's one right here in the
front and there's one in the back as
well and so the front is a more
efficient more powerful motor but if you
want the performance then they combined
the back and the front at the same time
the front motor has more copper windings
inside which makes it more efficient so
the battery pack is in the floor of the
car and to charge it up it's right back
here also one more cool thing with the
motor is that there is individual motor
mounts here here and there as well as on
the other side because the motor is one
of the things that's gonna have the most
vibrations in it as it's moving and this
whole contraption is gonna keep the
thing stable eliminating a lot of the
noise transfer inside of the car so one
cool thing about having the battery in
the very bottom of the vehicle is that
it gives it a low center of gravity so
there won't be any rollover if you're
taking corners super tight obviously
with lithium ion batteries there's a
couple things to be concerned about one
is temperature another is like damaging
like punctures to the sides and so
Mercedes has taken special precautions
with this frame that their side impact
zones and front impact zones to keep
those battery cells safe gives more
structure to the side of the car
so it's something impacts that has
multiple layers of metal to go through
before it reaches the internal battery
compartments and if you look at the top
of the battery these black tubes running
along the top can keep the battery cool
as well as warm up the battery in cold
conditions where I'm from in Utah
there's a lot of snow on the ground in
the winter and the batteries aren't
optimal when they're cold when they're
in the freezer if you take your cell
phone and stick it in the freezer for a
couple hours your battery percentage is
actually going to go down so where the
cooling and heating system are combined
in this battery you can drive the car
optimally in cold conditions which is
pretty cool so these are the individual
cells inside of the battery pack right
here and the battery pack sits inside of
the massive chassis over there it's
interesting that Mercedes chose to go
with the pouch style with the mi on
instead of the cylindrical batteries
like Tesla does so where there are three
hundred and eighty four of these pouch
style lithium batteries inside of the
EQC Tesla has about 7,000 of those
little cylindrical batteries inside of
their car with the same battery capacity
one cool thing about the EQC is that it
has two motors so it's effectively
all-wheel drive
if one of the motors for some reason
stops working the other motor can take
over and fully power the entire car
whereas if you have a gas-powered
vehicle if your motor dies it's over and
done with so it's nice to have like a
redundant system in an electric car with
two motors
so there's no official price point on
the EQC yet but rumor has it is supposed
to be competitive with the Model X when
it comes out and my buddy Ben here has
had a Model X for a long time so what
are your thoughts how do you feel are
you gonna trade in your Model X for this
thing I like the car I'm availabilities
supposed to be in the US maybe early
2020 which is around the same time I'll
be getting my roadster so I'm gonna hold
onto my Model X for a few more years
like there's no reason to go and like
put down a deposit I think I can wait a
little bit but I do like this car and I
think there's still a lot that we need
to learn about it over the next few
years like what is the super charging
network or the charging network going to
look like in the US because right now
it's kind of weak and really weak
compared to my Tesla I love road trips
what is the price going to be rumors are
it's gonna be less expensive than the
Model X we don't know yet it's gonna be
a while till we know for the u.s. so
it's a good-looking car and we're
Mercedes build something they build it
with really really high quality
they've taken a long time to build this
thing and I think a lot of the reasons
is because they're doing a lot of
different testing on it I'm sure that
there's going to be a lot more thought
behind this than the Tesla's that are
some would say thrown together in a rush
from a car company that's only been
around for a few years so Mercedes has
been around for a long time and I love
my Tesla I love it but I know I've never
I haven't even driven in it yet so I
need a test drive okay so back to you
would you trade in your Tacoma for this
next week first of all there's no good I
need a truck and there's no good
electric trucks right now that are ready
to buy and also one thing to keep in
mind is that this Mercedes car like Dan
said is still way out down the road it's
not even gonna be released in the United
States until maybe 2020 so even though
Mercedes has been around for 130 years
there's still a baby in the current
electric market space where Tesla would
be the adult even after 15 years of
being there it's exciting I love it like
there's a lot of questions like would
you buy this over a model 3 I think I
would feel like it's nicer especially if
the price points closer as of right now
as of right now remember the model 3 is
gonna be like a year and a half old by
the time Ryan comes out right you might
have a $35,000 model 3 in a year
could go either way overall though this
is great this is great for sustainable
energy this is great for the future of
electric cars more competition people
that have been on the fence and said I'm
not gonna buy a Tesla it's not a legit
car company they're gonna look at this
and say oh look at this Mercedes has an
electric car it must be ok to get an
electric car and they might start
looking into it and buy a car and that's
good yeah the more knowledge and the
more cars and the more information
that's out there is better for everyone
we do know that the top speed is right
around 110 miles per hour so it's a
little bit slower than the Tesla's but
the EQC does have regenerative braking
so every time you step on the brake it
can charge the batteries or if you're
going downhill charge the batteries and
that's a good feature to have in an
electric car most people are never gonna
buy an electric car just to save the
planet
they're gonna buy an electric car when
it's performance and the price outweighs
its gas-powered counterparts and as more
car manufacturers jump into the industry
the overall price should come down while
the performance should go up competition
is always a good thing and the more
competition there is and the lower the
price is the more people are going to be
buying electric vehicles which helps the
planet overall Mercedes is working on
their own version of autopilot with a
bunch of cameras up there behind the
rear-view mirror as well as radar behind
the Mercedes logo which also lights up
underneath this LED bar up at the top
and then there's another camera right
here down at the bottom so on the back
of the car we have the gas cap it opens
up and we have the AC and DC charging
right here top and bottom and it also
has a QR code right here and that QR
code is for emergency responders if they
come in the car has been wrecked or been
in an accident or something like that
the emergency spotters can scan that QR
code and know exactly where to turn off
the battery and help the person inside
so we don't know the exact range of the
EQC but it does have an 80 kilowatt hour
battery which means it should be around
250 to 300 miles give or take a little
bit and which is pretty interesting
compared to the different battery pack
inside of the Tesla remember this one
has those flat batteries that I showed
you earlier the nice thing about
Mercedes stepping into the electric car
world means that now everyone needs to
step up their game and it's just going
to be improvement for all the consumers
around who want an electric vehicle
super huge thanks to Mercedes for having
us out if you have any questions go
ahead and leave them down in the
comments and I'll try to answer those
and think
not for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
