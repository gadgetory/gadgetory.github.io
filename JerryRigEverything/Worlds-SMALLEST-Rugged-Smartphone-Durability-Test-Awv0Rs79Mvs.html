smartphone called atom running full
Android just raised over a million
dollars on Kickstarter but how durable
is it really and what's it made of and
how small is too small let's find out
this little guy which is literally the
same size as your ear is probably the
smallest smartphone I've ever tested the
2.4 inch screen makes navigation unique
but not impossible
running the full version of Android all
the normal apps should open and work
just fine just you know they'll look
like they were made for ants the screen
resolution is 240 by 4 32 which gives it
a few thousand more pixels than the
Apple watch but even then YouTube videos
still look pretty solid but we're here
for the durability and with that comes
the scratch test Adam is rocking an
unspecified version of Gorilla Glass
under that pre-installed screen
protector which means we know it'll hold
its own during a scratch test my most
scale is drawn much smaller this time
but the screen is indeed Gorilla Glass
and not the plastic stuff we've seen on
some other rugged phones scratching at
level 6 and a deeper groove at a level 7
so keys and coins won't affect the phone
that's the size of a razor blade and not
even razor blades can scratch the
surface there's a front-facing 8
megapixel camera tucked up under to that
screen glass also protected from
scratches and there's two capacitive
buttons down at the bottom one that
opens your recent apps and a back button
both sitting next to that Center
fingerprint scanner which is unscratched
while kind of nice to have that
invincibility on a rugged phone that's
basically the same size as your finger
anyway the earpiece grille is made from
plastic and very securely attached to
the phone and the bottom grille is also
made from that same plastic material
digging into the sides of the atom we
show a thick layer of rubbers rounding
the whole phone along with the black
plastic power button and a programmable
red plastic button that can be used to
activate the camera or phone calls as
long as Bixby doesn't start popping up I
think it's a great feature we have a
modern USB C charging port along the
side nothing along the bottom but up
here at the top the little guy has a
headphone jack which is awesome even
though the atom is a fraction of this
of an iPhone and at ip68 is more water
resistant than an iPhone it still has a
headphone jack
I think if thumbs up is deserved for
companies that pack their phones full of
useful features the other side the phone
next to the volume buttons has a dual
SIM card slot with plenty of rubber
around the tip to keep liquid from
leaking the red accents on the outside
of the phone are aesthetically present
on the inside I'll have to delve into
that more later the rear camera is a 16
megapixel sensor covered with glass with
a phone this small and inexpensive you
might expect cheap materials but so far
things have been pretty solid the single
color LED flash is also under that glass
the back of the phone is covered and yet
another layer of thick black rubber I
try drawing the electron trajectory of
an atom on the back of this atom phone
but the rubber thwarted my razor by
hiding most all traces of scratching the
textured back material does provide
substantial grip though on the film the
universal logo is made from plastic but
also solidly attached to the phone body
one unique thing about the atom is a
little slot for a tether or necklace
strap down at the bottom it might also
be used for the optional bike mounts or
outdoorsy stuff if you're one of those
people that likes to go outside speaking
of dangerous things to do it's time for
the burn test the flame from my lighter
basically takes over the whole 2.4 inch
screen and something new happens 10
second send it to burn the screen goes
black with a bright white center to the
burn mark normally we would see this on
an AMOLED screen that wouldn't recover
but this LCD display still recovered
completely which is scientific in some
way I'm sure the cute little guy is just
a tad longer than my thumb and it's time
for a bin test to see how well it will
actually hold up under stress it's quite
a bit thicker than most phones at point
7 inches thick to include that 2,000
milliamp hour battery which is larger
than an iPhone but who's keeping track
the thing is built like a small brick
and as you might assume nothing I could
do would make the phone break overall
I'm impressed if you've ever wanted an
oversized tic-tac with full Android
capabilities in your pocket this is the
phone for you I'll toss a link in the
description if you're interested in
getting one as a backup or even a daily
driver hit that subscribe button if you
haven't already and thanks a ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
