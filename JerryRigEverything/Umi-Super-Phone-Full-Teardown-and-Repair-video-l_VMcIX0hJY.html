phone that is the same phone did my
durability test on so that's why it has
a couple of scratches on the back and a
crack screen on the front you can see
when I turned the phone on at the top
half of the screen does function but the
part below the crack does not function
so this phone only costs $200 so it will
normally not be cost effective to fix
parts are hard to find for this device
so why am I taking it apart first off so
we can analyze the build quality of a
$200 phone versus a $700 phone like the
galaxy s7 and sometimes when you have
important information on your phone and
the screen breaks you'll need to
Frankenstein two phones together in
order to save or backup your information
many non techie people don't backup
their pictures or text messages and are
willing to pay money to recover those
when their phone breaks so let's get on
with the teardown holding down the power
button just restarts the phone so we're
going to do this live like you see and
remove the SIM card tray and the bottom
plastic protections over the bottom and
top of the phone there are six screws
that hold the back housing into the
front housing and then you can just pull
that off the back all of the buttons do
fall out which is extremely annoying the
battery is a four thousand milliamp
battery the buttons will be annoying
later on but I'll show you how to deal
with them there's four screws around
this back plastic piece and then one
more screw underneath the fingerprint
scanner talk to the fingerprint scanner
through the back plastic and then pop
that off of the phone then there's
little latch connection that holds the
side buttons into place you can just
lift that up and slide that out remove
the wire cable connector and unplug the
battery since this phone was not turned
off when we started working on it that's
very important there's not a lot of tape
or sticky stuff underneath the battery
just pops out on its own using the blunt
end of my metal pry tool be careful to
not damage this extension ribbon cable
and this is just like you see on the
oneplus series there's another latch for
the screen ribbons we're going to pop
that off and then there's a weird little
cable that's actually soldered on to the
mainboard
this design is not my favorite I'm going
to remove the top tape and that exposes
some more connections for us there's a
similar Lego type connection right here
at the top we're going to pop that off
and lift it up so it's not in the way of
the motherboard and the motherboard is
released from the frame there's a little
metal pocket at the bottom of the
motherboard that holds it in place and
then make sure you lift up the earpiece
as well so that doesn't get caught and
remove the rear facing camera and the
front-facing camera from the motherboard
one has the Lego connection D
front-facing has the latch the rear is a
Panasonic 13 megapixel and the front is
a 5-megapixel selfie camera stick it
back into place just tuck it in with
little latch and plug the Lego one in
and then make sure you lock down the
latch so that the camera doesn't fall
out if you ever drop your phone there
are four screws at the bottom near the
charging port once those are off the top
plastic piece will come away
there aren't any components on this
plastic piece unplug little wire
connection and then unsnap the extension
ribbon cable there's one screw holding
the charging board into place and you
can pull that away after pulling off the
vibrator motor from the plastic itself
you don't want to damage those wires
here is the type C charging port I will
try to find replacement parts and link
as many as I can down in the video
description below but if you're trying
to back up someone's information you
might just need to buy a new phone or
swap motherboards and screens because
this is the screen this is where you
would take your replacement parts and
put them on the new screen that's
working if you want to back up your data
the screen is embedded into the metal
frame I imagine if they sell parts at
all it will be without the metal frame
you'll need to transfer the new LCD into
the old frame after removing the cracked
LCD kind of complicated putting a
charging port back into place plug in
the extension ribbon cable the wire and
the little screw underneath the plastic
panel and then there are four screws
that hold the top of the panel into
place
motherboard gets tucked in after making
sure there's no wires or ribbon cables
underneath it don't want to pinch those
down set the earpiece into place and the
motherboard gets tucked underneath that
little metal edge on the bottom right
corner get all the buttons into place
plug in that wire cable connection slide
the ribbon cable into the latch and
latch it down after making sure all the
contacts are straight if that ribbon
cable is kinked at all in the contacts
aren't touching where they should be
it's not going to work right get the top
ribbon cable snapped down like a little
Lego and put the tape back into place
the tape is in super mandatory so if you
ripped that or anything just tries to
get back as best as possible volume
buttons are plugged in and the battery
is the last thing that we're going to
plug in so there's no power coursing
through the board I'm going to test the
phone before I put the back panel on and
it looks like everything is working
besides the fact that my phone is still
busted from the durability test but the
back plastic gone get those five screws
into place before tacking down the
finger
scanner now these buttons are super
annoying they're not held into the back
housing I imagine because this is a $200
phone design so I'm setting those into
place as best as I can and then I'm just
taking the top of the phone with
motherboard in the screen and setting
that down into the back instead of the
other way around which is how I would
usually do it that way the buttons don't
fall out when I'm moving the back panel
there are six screws holding down the
back panel into the front housing and
then we're going to put those plastic
pieces back into place as well
they just tuck in it's actually a lot
easier to use these snapping back pieces
than it is to use the glue covered ones
on the Nexus 6p if you have any
questions them down in the comments I do
behind the scenes stuff on Instagram
Twitter and snapchat recently as well
check out my durability video of this
Umi super foam I've done 27 other
durability videos on popular phones like
the iPhone 6s the galaxy s7 and the LG
g5 so check those out in my smartphone
durability playlist hope see around
