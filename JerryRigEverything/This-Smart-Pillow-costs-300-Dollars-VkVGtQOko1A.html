places today we're going to review a
very expensive pillow and this mattress
for a high-tech 21st century bedroom
let's get started
so this pillow right here caught my
attention on Amazon at a very expensive
$300 which might change in the future
Sense technology appreciates and
appreciates I'll leave a link in the
video description so you can check the
current pricing it's been featured at
CES started on Kickstarter and has been
reviewed by quite a few different people
this smart pillow has a two week battery
life I never thought I'd be plugging in
my pillow before I think it's time to
review this from the inside there are
some speakers there's a vibration motor
and it also can keep you from snoring
which is pretty interesting so inside
the box we have a plastic cover and then
a pretty firm pillow inside it
definitely has some weight to it which
is a good thing it's got a free pillow
case and it has some more foam so you
can adjust it and add more if you need
to I guess has the wall charger with a
bunch of adapters for different
countries so here's the $300 pillow
itself looks like we have a wire here on
the edge and then he also can plug it in
right here
let's take off this outer shell that's
probably so you can wash it without
actually having to wash the actual
pillow there's another zipper right here
it's open Oh check it out this is a
bunch of the purple foam that comes
inside of the pillow I have a feeling
this is going to get rather messy in
here I fully expect that I would have to
rip this pillow to shreds to find the
electronics and I still might I don't
feel any of the electronics in this
pocket so we'll just close that back up
it looks like there is a nother zipper
on this side still no electronics in
this side just a bunch more of this foam
stuff we might actually have to rip it
open still the good thing is that you
can't really tell where the electronics
are inside of it because of all the
padding on both sides so I mean sleeping
on it you probably be able to tell that
it's electric
so I found one more zipper deep inside
of it whoo check this out
I think I got it grabbed you want to
slice things open
here's the brains of the operation
here's where it might get a little
destructive yeah so it's got a little
bit of adhesive here on this kind of
memory foam stuff yeah this definitely
is it made to be serviced
looks like we have several speakers one
two three four and we have a flexible
ribbon between each of these little
modules I'm going to grab a screwdriver
and see if we can take these things
apart I don't think I've ever done a
teardown on top of a mattress before but
we have four screws in each of these
little modules there's also a gyroscope
in here similar to what your cell phone
has that can track your sleep motion and
wake you up at the opportune time
depending on your REM cycle so now that
we have the 16 screws removed we can see
all the internal components and so each
of these little things right here are
little tiny speaker so there's four on
the top and there's also four on the
bottom part of it and I'm seeing two
vibration motors on the two exterior
modules right here and right here I
assume these go with the anti snoring
and with the alarm you know if you start
snoring like this little microphone
picks up it'll vibrate a little bit
waking you up just enough to stop
snoring and then let you fall back to
sleep again without actually waking you
up all the way inside these little
extenders are the wires these rubber
parts just help keep the wires together
then we have the massive 5,000 milliamp
battery right here in the center pretty
interesting I never thought I would
actually be tearing down a pillow on
this channel but there's a first time
for everything
so with that snore alarm apparently when
you're snoring gets past a certain
decibel level that's when the vibration
motors kick on and you can set that
vibration level depending on how loud
you snore and when you want it to kick
on overall I think it's a pretty fun
idea I'm not sure how many people want
to spend $300 on a pillow but if you're
into like the high-tech environment it
might be fun it might just make a better
gift for the person who has everything
because I guarantee they don't have this
let me know what you think would you
spend $300 on a pillow even if it does
do all the crazy things this one does
let me know down in the comments now
let's talk about this mattress I've been
sitting on this queen-size mattress
which shipped to me in the mail inside a
relatively small cardboard box this is
intriguing for multiple reasons because
it was shipped to me it's actually
cheaper than a normal old-fashioned
store-bought mattress because those
physical store locations have to pay
rent utilities and mold
locations and Commission for their
employees so this thing just got shipped
to me and it's completely flatted
vacuum-sealed right now so I'm going to
cut it open let air inside of the
plastic and watch to expand Casper on
the other hand can cut those costs out
of the equation by vacuum sealing their
mattresses for tight storage and can
pass the savings along to their
customers so that's pretty cool with
free shipping things are pretty much
always cheaper on the internet this
mattress was made here in the USA and
it's really nice of Casper to sponsor
this video and support my channel I hope
they don't mind too much if I show
what's inside of their mattress zippers
seem to be the theme of this video so
obviously we have a top layer up here
that everyone can see then we have some
layers underneath that not everyone can
see looks like we have a layer of normal
foam up here and then this layer here is
more of a memory foam you can see it
takes a second to replenish itself after
I poked it well the rest of the foam
doesn't we have a transition layer here
with a green foam it has slightly larger
air pockets inside of it and then on the
very bottom we have the support foam
this is probably the heaviest and the
firmest layer this 10 inch sandwich of
foams is what makes the mattress so
comfortable pulling all of the air out
from inside the foam is what compresses
it and makes it easy to ship in this
modern Internet world
Casper said anyone using the code
jerry-rigged can get a $50 discount on
their mattress another perk of a modern
mattress is that with Casper you get a
100 night free trial if you don't like
the mattress during those hundred days
you can ship it back to Casper with that
free shipping I'll put a link in the
video description with an average of 4.8
stars on both Amazon and Google reviews
the mattress pretty much speaks for
itself you'll have to take my word for
it sometimes I think random technology
is the most interesting kind of
technology so if you liked this video

a ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
