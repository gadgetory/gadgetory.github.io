smartphone giveaway and this time I'll
be giving away an HTC 10 I asked you
guys on Twitter yesterday which phone
you'd like to see giving away and it was
neck and neck between the galaxy s7 and
the HTC 10 for quite some time but the
HTC 10 did end up winning by a couple
votes so I'll be giving away a brand new
HTC 10 not one that's been durability
tested by me so it'll be new in the box
but before I tell you the requirements
for the giveaway I will be in Ireland on
June 6th for a conference called the
power of video I'll be speaking in the
morning about how small businesses and
small YouTube channels can make a big
difference through video Casey nice -
shonduras what's inside sulie breaks a
bunch of big youtubers will be there and
I'm gonna give away two free tickets to
see the conference but I want to give
them away to someone who actually lives
in the UK so to get the two free tickets
take a picture of yourself buy something
iconic inside the UK and post it to
Instagram and tag me Zach's jerry-rigged
and tag the power of video and leave a
short one or two-sentence description
about why you want to go to the
conference and one week from today we
will pick the winner for the two free
tickets
I also scored a 20% discount using the
code jerry-rigged everything so if you
don't win the contest and you still want
to go to the conference you don't have
to pay full price I will leave all of
that information down in the video
description of this video as well now
for the HTC 10 giveaway the last couple
of phones I gave away on Twitter ended
up working out pretty well it's an easy
way to keep track of everything so head
over to Twitter Zak's jerry-rigged
follow me on Twitter and retweet this
tweet and that's how you'll be entered
into the drawing I will be giving away
one HTC 10 brand new make sure tell your
friends about the giveaway as well
because if they win they'll probably
hook you up with something nice for
letting them know about it
I am super close to two hundred thousand
subscribers on YouTube and I plan on
giving away either an Xbox one or a
Playstation 4 or something else big when
I hit that number what do you think why
should I give away when I hit 200,000
subscribers let me know down in the
comments thanks a ton for watching I do
appreciate it a lot
without
subscribers like you guys I would not be
able to continue doing what I do
bonus cool points if you already
subscribe to my youtube channel and if
you follow me on instagram as Zacks
jerry-rigged obviously around and may
the odds be ever in your favor
