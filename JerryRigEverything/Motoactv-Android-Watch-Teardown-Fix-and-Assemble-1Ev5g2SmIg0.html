watch for about a year now and basically
just an Android wash they can keep track
of where you run as a GPS and it has a
gigabyte mp3 player with the headphone
jack it does bluetooth if you have
wireless bluetooth headphones you can
listen to him while you run is pretty
cool anyway today I decide I'm going to
take it apart so I'm going to slide it
off the wristband here I'm gonna grab my
non-marring tool and kind of pry from
the outside between the plastic edge in
the screen just kind of wheel it down in
there and then the screen pops out
actually surprisingly easy here you can
see the ribbon cables that attach it to
the motherboard and if you lift it up
from the bottom right there you can see
that the ribbon cables have a little
latch that holds them in place and if
you grab the little hole first of all
grab the piece of tape off the top then
if you lift up on the little black piece
right here that's the clamp that kind of
holds the ribbon cable in place so now
that I've released that I can kind of
wiggle the ribbon cables out of the the
clamp and that releases the screen so if
you ever ever cracked your screen on the
Moto active that's how to replace it pop
it off pop the new one in place and
you're good to go you don't need to mess
with anything else on
so the battery pops out is taped in
there on the bottom with double-sided
sticky tape so you can just lift that up
and off so if you need to replace the
battery that would be how to do it and
then there's one screw holding the
motherboard into place it's a very small
Phillips head
there's a little rubber piece around the
charging port that kind of helps you
know a shock and stuff like that so kind
of put that somewhere you're going to
find it and if you lift up very gently
on the ribbon cable you can pry the
motherboard out and there's one ribbon
cable holding the motherboard into the
the frame of the watch still and it's
the same concept as the other ribbon
cables just kind of grab your little
tweezers and pop up the little latch
then the motherboard is now free from
the back housing the large ribbon cable
that goes from the motherboard of the
screen the other half of it same thing
lift off a sticky tape and grab the
little black latch and lift that up then
you're free from that battery pops off
as well and now all the components are
separate from each other including the
headphone jack which is interesting only
Motorola seems to do the headphone jack
in that way it's the same thing on the
motorola Photon there to there phone
anyway popping the battery back in
ribbon cable back in this is all the
same way that you took everything apart
watch everything down into place put the
piece of tape back on top of the ribbon
cables as well it helps them from coming
loose now here's the part where it kind
of got tricky so underneath the
underneath the headphone jack there was
a another place for a ribbon cable
I actually took that off the bottom part
and put it into the motherboard before I
did this step this step of connecting
the motherboard back into the back
housing and you'll see why I took off
the headphone jack ribbon cable right
here because it makes it much easier to
lift up the motherboard a little bit put
the headphone jack back down on top of
the ribbon cable connection and then
kind of wedge it into place just like
this make sure the headphone jack is put
into like the rubber where it came out
of that kind of helps like the
waterproof part of it anyway put the
screw back into place the rubber grommet
thing back on top of the charging port
and then the screen just reattaches
right into here with the old ribbon
cable connectors and make sure you latch
it back down into place and put the tape
on top
and you can see that it turns on you
want that being snapped back fully into
place
and everything still works all my music
is in here anyway I will put a link in
the video description to Amazon so you
can check out more specs of this
particular watch and I've used it a lot
it's great for mountain biking to tell
if are you've gone elevation change and
the GPS on it is pretty awesome if you
have any questions make sure to leave in
