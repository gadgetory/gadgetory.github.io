couple different options of what we can
do with big speed to disable the button
and I think I have an idea so if you
remember for my durability test this
bixby button comes out relatively easily
right here on the side I think the
easiest way to disable bixby would just
be to cut off this little niblet down
here at the bottom that tip is what's
actually pressing the little button
inside of the phone you can see right
there the crevice itself most of the
waterproofing I believe happens inside
of the phone and doesn't have much to do
with the button since it's relatively
sealed off so as you can see once the
razor blade cuts that little white
niblet off I can take that same button
without the niblet and press it back
into the phone which lets the button
keep its same position inside the phone
and keep the same basic level of
waterproofing but when you try to press
the button it doesn't activate bixby
which is what we're after the problem is
is that the button is semi loose so it
won't hold its position anymore so if
you tip the phone down the button will
hang loose a little bit but it won't
fall completely out of the phone if you
want to get crazy you could put a little
dab of glue in there and keep the button
completely flush all the time with the
outer surface of the phone body so even
though we've found a solution to
permanently disabling bixby there's
something else I want to try that jiggly
button might bother a couple people this
methods a little more extreme but it
should be interesting today we're gonna
be working with a little bit of gold so
I've worked with gold a little bit
before you might remember this solid
gold Han Solo that I did here with se
Needham's a while back this is a little
Star Wars Lego piece that we cast it
into 14 karat solid gold I'll link the
video up in the corner so you can watch
that and today we'll be doing the same
thing with bixby whether he likes it or
not so as you can see when we take the
button out of the phone it leaves like a
void kind of like a cavity which makes
sense because in the past they use gold
and silver to fill cavities and teeth
and that's basically what we're doing
today so how much is this stick of gold
if this gold is worth about $250 and
it's just a straight bar of gold but
we're just gonna use a small section
which breaks down to maybe about
dollars in gold so we were fabricating a
big speed button for the Samsung Note 9
the first step is to make the metal
slightly more workable and we do that by
annealing which heats up the metal and
makes it slightly softer and easier to
work with then we can cut the 14-karat
gold stick into the basic size that we
need and start trimming it down so it'll
fit the hole perfectly and tightly fill
that cavity so it snug all the way
around
after the button goes into the phone
it's not going to come out so we're
gonna make sure that it's polished
sanded and looks good before we set it
into place inside of the phone we wanted
to sit relatively flush with the surface
so that it's not sticking up too far or
falling down inside we took a bunch of
measurements throughout this process to
make sure the buttons were the same size
as each other and once we got the gold
button into the frame of the phone it
was so snug we couldn't get it back out
again which is exactly what we wanted
before we start chopping bixby into bits
let's get a definitive answer on whether
he has anything to do with water
resistance or not and the only way to
know for sure is from the inside you can
see both the volume and bixby buttons
are run off the same sensor ribbon with
little square contact pads and when I
pull the buttons out you can see some
gray rubber blocking the whole inside of
the cell phone the button undercarriage
contraption is made up of two components
one is this metal bracket with the
electronic buttons themselves and to the
secondary bracket with the rubber pads
on the surface that secondary bracket
with the rubber pads gets pushed very
tightly against the side walls of the
phone effectively making a water
resistant barrier against liquid coming
inside the buttons once that rubber pad
is gone we can see the little hole leads
directly out of the phone after pushing
the gold button out from the inside we
can see that the Bigsby cavity has the
same design with a little hole
underneath the volume buttons themselves
don't appear to have any rubber
watertight seals around the button so
it's pretty safe to say that the gray
rubber on the inner metal panel is doing
most if not all of the work keeping
water out and that gray rubber is held
very tightly in place by the dual metal
bracket design inside the phone in my
opinion the water resistance will remain
intact with the buttons gone but I've
also never been a person to trust my
phone around water in the first place
even if it has a water resistant rating
water resistance wouldn't be the main
worry if you pull out your buttons
avoiding your warranty is probably the
thing you'll need to take most into
consideration before killing off
anything
Samsung of course could save us all some
trouble and allow Bixby to be turned off
or remapped but they probably won't so
there you have it a solid gold bixby
button obviously there's a lot that can
go wrong during this process and taking
apart your phone probably isn't
something Samsung really wants you to do
but hypothetically if you wanted a solid
gold bixby button do you think that's
possible yeah it's definitely possible
okay if we decide to not sure if we will
yet down in the video description there
will be a link if you want a solid gold
bixby button for your phone right now
it's probably just for the note 9 but
we'll see what we can come up with for
the for the other phones it's a
conversation piece but it works
working with precious metals is always
an adventure super huge thanks to Joe
here at SC Needham's for helping me out
with this project and thanks stuff for
watching we'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
