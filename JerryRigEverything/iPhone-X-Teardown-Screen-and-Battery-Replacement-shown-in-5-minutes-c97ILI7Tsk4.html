video will show the basic screen
replacement along with how I swap out
the uniquely shaped battery inside of
Apple's newest flagship accidents happen
and things wear out and break so it's
good to know how to get things back up
and running let's get started getting
into this phone is pretty similar to the
iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 but it does get a
bit easier once you are inside the same
familiar two pentalobe screws are at the
bottom of the phone I'll have a little
tool kit linked in the video description
for you along with all the parts needed
to complete these replacements after
getting these two screws out I like to
warm up the screen a little by softening
the ip67 water-resistant adhesive under
the iPhone 10 display I'll use a suction
cup and a pry tool to lift up on the
glass a little and get my metal pry tool
between the plastic edge of the screen
and the metal edge of the frame then I
can slice along the edge of the phone
just underneath the glass to detach the
rest of the adhesive when the screen is
mostly free it doesn't pull down this
time to unlock but instead just folds
right open like a book the ribbons you
see on the right side of the phone are
extremely fragile so don't put any
pressure on them Apple did simplify the
process with only one metal bracket this
time which is nice of them still using
the same y triple-zero screws as
previous iPhones or remove the five
screws holding that metal plate down and
then keep them organized off to the side
because they definitely need to go back
in the same hole they came out of it was
also nice of Apple to put all the
connectors in one solitary row for us
here in the center the connectors we
care about during this video are first
the battery connector making sure to use
a plastic pry tool when lifting this off
as to not short out the battery then we
can detach the two screen ribbons one at
the bottom right and the other at the
bottom left side of the connector row
and Alaska is for the earpiece and
microphone this also detaches like a
little Lego from the motherboard and
here is the screen part of it simpler
designed now that we don't have the
fingerprint scanner at the bottom these
OLED displays are definitely going to be
more expensive than the LCD iPhone
screens of the past just because the
part itself costs a lot more
I'll have the current pricing in the
description like always it does
fluctuate with time and will get cheaper
as the phone gets older the new screens
will probably not come with the earpiece
attached so there are three more screws
when you transfer over
I'll pull these out being careful to
keep track of the little
niblet on the top screw then I can fold
the speaker down and away allowing me to
pull up the microphone and the other
small sensors these ribbons are
extremely fragile so go slow and be
careful now that I have the speaker out
it really does depend on how the new
screen ship but you might also need to
transfer over some of the clear plastics
but that's not too big of a deal
historically Apple has not made things
easy for people trying to fix their own
phones with the old error 51 and
fingerprint scanner hardware issues
they've made things pretty complicated
but with this screen we shouldn't have
any issues all the phones face unlocking
Hardware is still tied to the phone and
not a part of the display so thumbs up
for that with only the display and
digitizer connectors left on the screen
we should be safe I'll put the screen
back together before jumping onto the
battery replacement portion of this
video it's pretty straightforward with
all the sensors going in the same slots
they came out of and then the earpiece
speaker folding over back on top of them
there's the three white triple zero
screws holding everything in place
making sure to get that gold niblet back
on that Center screw I'm not sure
exactly what it does but it's probably
important remember the display is one of
the most expensive parts of this phone
so be nice to it now let's take a shot
at removing the oddly shaped battery
since the screen is already off and the
battery disconnected I'll grab the first
magical pull tab at the top of the
battery and slowly pull it out from
underneath these are very fragile so go
slow Plus that sound is delicious at the
bottom of the battery there are three
more stubby pull tabs these are hard to
get at but if you have a pair of wide
tip tweezers that would be ideal with my
needle tip so I'll just grab the edge
and then fold out as best I can with my
fingers
if you do fail at pulling out the
magical pull-tabs you'll have to
commence the pry of shame another trick
that might help out is to grab the
tweezers and twist the pull-tab around
the tip of the tweezers to get a better
grip and now the battery is out this is
the most unique battery I've ever seen
inside of a cell phone kind of
interesting design choice
hopefully the replacements aren't too
expensive like always I'll have them
linked in the video description below
the battery we can see the wireless
charging and the metal frame of the
phone if you're replacing your own
battery you'll want to use some
double-sided tape to keep things from
jiggling around personally I'm going to
be opening this phone up more in the
future so I'm skipping my adhesive for
now with the battery in place and the
three ribbons coming from the screen
I'll reattach to that center connector
bridge I can finally plug in the battery
it goes in last just to be safe I'll
test the phone out before adding that
metal plate just to make sure everything
is working if there are lines going
through your display or it's gray or
nothing shows up it might just be a bad
connection reseat those little Lego
connectors and try again my phone is
turned back off and the metal plate
slides into place with its five screws
all of these are different sizes so they
need to go back in the same hole they
came from finally the phone can full
shut just like a little book and clip
down into place and everything is still
working I'll toss the bottom two
pentalobe screws back in and it's ready
to go if you enjoyed this video or if it
