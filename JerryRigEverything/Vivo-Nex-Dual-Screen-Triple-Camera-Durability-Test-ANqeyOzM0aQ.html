the motorized pop-up camera the vivo NEX
s well vivo is back at it again with
another super innovative design with
both a screen on the front and back of
their latest flagship in the box comes
with headphones charger and a thick
bumper case to protect the phone from
drops it's time to see how much dot vivo
put into durability let's get started
this is the second dual screen phone
we've seen with the Nubia X switching
screens was they carefully calculated
simultaneous double button breaths
but with this vivo phone pressing one
power button on the right side of the
phone will activate whatever side is
facing you much easier it also has a
three finger side swipe to switch
between the screens on the go which is
as equally easy so the whole point of a
dual screen phone is to one look cool
but also to get rid of any notches or
hole punches in the larger front display
with an additional screen on the back
all selfies can be done with the higher
quality rear main cameras instead of
having lower quality front cameras
taking up space inside of a notch the
main camera on this phone has three LED
lights for better lip pictures two of
which can activate a circular lunar ring
for more even light during pictures or
video you know the same circular lights
that youtubers might use during makeup
tutorials I'm gonna leave the makeup
tutorials to the experts but a ring
light is definitely a cool addition to a
cell phone camera the included case has
a solid fit I always have a case on my
personal device so I'm glad vivo added
some extra protection in the box
speaking of protection there is also an
included plastic screen protector on the
front surface the guys over a vivo are
getting all the bonus points today as
you know with my systematic durability
test we checked the scratch resistance
of the screen with Mohs scale of
hardness it's a pretty safe bet that if
a company is an advertising Sapphire
it's probably going to be tempered glass
which is where we start seeing faint
scratches at level six with deeper
grooves at a level 7 vivo was the first
manufacturer to come out with an under
display fingerprint scanner and the same
technology is here in this phone as well
underneath the front screen protected by
the front glass but is
shines up onto your fingerprint and the
little sensor underneath the display can
tell if it's your finger or not so you
can unlock the phone securely with two
screens we need double the testing since
there's twice as much real estate to
cover let's scratch test the back dbrand
should start making clear skins for
these dual screen phones this side as
well as covered by a screen protector
which makes sense screen protectors not
only stop scratches but also at a
cushion layer of impact protection so
brittle glass doesn't shatter right away
during a drop this time after testing
all the different levels we still find
tempered glass covering the back panel
resulting in scratches at level 6 with
deeper grooves at a level 7 the rear
design of the vivo dual screen phone is
unique instead of a metal lip around the
camera lens the whole circular unit is
glass and protrude just slightly over
the top of the glass rear panel with its
own little screen protector the circular
camera lens is very solidly adhered to
the rear panel even with some prying
from my razor blade it doesn't want to
come off the back panel surprisingly
does have its own earpiece a
bi-directional earpiece speaker shooting
out both the front and the back this
will be fun to see from the inside it's
a thin little sliver especially here on
the front side to minimize the bezels
but the grill can come off on its own
there isn't much adhesive holding it in
place it's definitely interesting to see
speaker grilles on both sides of the
phone
speaking of sides the material inside of
this dual screen sandwich is metal the
long volume button and power buttons are
both made from metal the bottom of the
phone has a loudspeaker and USB C
charging for it along with the dual SIM
card tray with a protective rubber ring
around the opening to help keep water
out the vivo next dual display doesn't
have an official IP rating but it's good
to see some steps were taken this hole
is protected and I'll have to check the
other holes from the inside during the
teardown the far side of the phone is
also made from metal along with the
second tower button with vivo printed on
the surface and what's this dust mine
eyes deceive me a headphone jack you
gotta love a phone with all the features
another interesting design choice is at
the edge of the screen on both the front
and the back are surrounded by a layer
of plastic plastic as we know is much
softer than metal or glass so it does
provide a nice cushion layer between the
hard metal sides and the clear brittle
glass so if it does happen to get
dropped it might not break is easy it's
a good thing and not something you would
notice at first glance with the previous
dual screen phone I tested the Nubia X
it had an LCD front panel while the
smaller rear panel was AMOLED this phone
the vivo next dual display has a larger
rear screen than the Nubia at 5.5 inches
and is still a 1080p AMOLED it's kind of
sad when you think that the backup
screen on this phone is still higher
resolution than Apple's iPhone 10 are no
permanent marks were left on the display
even after my lighter was in place for
45 seconds it might be the dual
thickness of the clear camera lens glass
but even with all that heat there is no
separation of the rather unique circular
lens there's a 12 megapixel main camera
a 2 megapixel death sensor and another
3d camera called tof or time-of-flight
for facial recognition are all back here
the tof camera has some pretty cool 3d
scanning capabilities I jumped into the
camera app to check it out it has the
standard measure a banana features that
a lot of phones have but it also has
this pretty in-depth 3d face scanning
unlocking thing that vivo claims is
better than Apple's but I think we can
all agree that this is either super
creepy or super awesome
isn't that right digital Jerry the front
screen is a massive six point four inch
no not CH 1080p AMOLED display this time
with different placement of my lighter
and without the dual layers of glass a
white burn mark appeared at about 27
seconds and never did quite recover and
now for the bin test this phone has no
moving parts just one solid hunk of
glass metal and plastic and the whole
contraption seems very heavy and very
solid with only a slight bend during the
Flex but with no creaks snaps kinks or
cracks anywhere in the body even when
bent from both directions I like where
things are headed this whole flagship
phone with dual screens 3d camera
headphone jack and in screen fingerprint
scanner is still cheaper than Apple's
budget iPhone the 10r and vivos phone
comes with double the internal memory
vivos got my attention
I'm impressed and I'm excited to see
what they come out with next hit that
subscribe button if you haven't already
so we can find out together and coming
out knee over on Twitter thanks dumb for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
