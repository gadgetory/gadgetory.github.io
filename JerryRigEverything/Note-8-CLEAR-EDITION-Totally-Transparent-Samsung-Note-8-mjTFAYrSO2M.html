clear Galaxy Note 8 it's important to
know that I highly recommend not
attempting this project yourself so many
things can go wrong during this project
I'll try to mention most of them but
still it's an expensive phone so don't
try this unless you have nothing to lose
all right now that we have that out of
the way let's get started
the Galaxy Note 8 is a beast of a device
and just like how most high-end gaming
PC's are see-through
I think Samsung should offer a clear
version to show off their top of the
line components it would be cool if
Apple did it too mediocre hardware it's
still interesting to look at I just like
clear gadgets the note 8 has Gorilla
Glass 5 on the back that has glue to the
frame of the phone I'm pretty sure they
use some new kind of adhesive this year
because I had an extraordinarily hard
time removing this back panel the phone
is turned off at this point and I'm
warming up the phone until it's too hot
to touch comfortably with my hands then
I'll slip a thin metal pry tool along
the side edge of the glass panel since
that's the only entry point I could find
then gently cut away the adhesive under
the glass with that metal edge remember
we are working with glass so any
pressure in the wrong spot and the whole
panel shatters it's a delicate process
I'll try and link the replacement back
glass panels in the description as soon
as they're available in case yours gets
broken or is already broken and you just
need to swap it out as the phone cools
the adhesive hardens back up again I'll
be reheating the phone with my heat gun
about every 30 seconds or so tucking a
sturdy piece of paper or business card
under the glass also helps it keep from
reott hearing to the phone again I've
told you this is a very painstaking
process Samsung doesn't mess around at
their waterproofing finally my back
panel lifts up and away from the phone
exposing some of the plastic shrouds
protecting the internal components I'll
do a full teardown of this phone talking
about the components and the OIS and the
cameras in a future video one thing I
did mess up though was the fingerprint
scanner ribbon cable I managed to slice
through that with one of my pry tool x'
I wasn't planning on using it anyway but
still I'll try to avoid doing that in
the future the bottom of the phone over
the charging port has six regular
Phillips head screws holding down the
plastic I'll just set those off to the
side to keep them organized and I'll
have a tool kit linked in the video
description that fits these screws the
top plastics and wireless charging have
ten more screws the same Phillips head
screws we saw at the bottom it's good
practice to lay these out in a way that
they go back in the same hole they came
from the wireless charging panel unclips
from the metal frame of the phone at
this point and we can see the golden
contact pads on the back that
transferred the power from the copper
coiled inductor to the battery I'm going
to leave my wireless charging intact
this time around and I'll explain more
how I do that in a second the bottom
plastics of the phone snap off exposing
the charging port and headphone jack
things are starting to look how we want
at this point the loudspeakers built
into the bottom plastics has got that
water damage indicator on it I do want a
speaker in my finish phone so I'll cut
off the unmanned Ettore part of the
plastics leaving the speaker and golden
contact pads intact with a few of the
screw holes so it can reattach perfect
the battery has some separation foam on
the back that I'm gonna remove and now
we look at the wireless charging itself
the wireless charging has one little
niblet up at the top that is a battery
temperature sensor this is excruciating
ly important without this Niblett your
phone will not charge so this needs to
be left intact personally I'm just gonna
cut around the golden contact pads
leaving everything intact but the
plastic I want all the features to
remain functional in this build I left
one screw hole next to contact pads to
hold everything in place but if you look
closely you can see the leads under the
black stuff that go from the battery
temperature sensor Niblett to the
motherboard so if you are anti wireless
charging you can just cut around those
leads leaving them intact like I did
with my clear Galaxy s8 but if you mess
up that Niblett your phone will never
charge again my phone is turning on at
this point and still functional so so
far so good
plus it can still charge which means I
didn't damage that battery temperature
sensor now for the back panel itself the
super strong adhesive that Samsung
placed around the outside edge needs to
come off the glass is curved along both
sides and it's glass so I'm being super
careful with it once all the sticky
adhesive is gone I can start moving the
color
using the metal pry tool scrapes off the
color but it leaves a slightly cloudy
laminate layer underneath above the
glass this would still look cool since
it's kind of like that frosted effect
that the older gameboy colors had but I
want my phone to end up completely clear
the laminate layer is extremely adhered
to the phone and does not want to come
off on its own I'll use some heat remove
the camera lens it has a metal frame so
as long as they don't put any pressure
on the glass part of the lens it'll come
off in one piece this premium stripper
will hopefully help soften the bond
between the laminate layer and the glass
I'll spray the foam over the back panel
let it sit for about 15 minutes it
really helps if you have chemically
resistant gloves at this point you can
tell that the stripper started eating
through my finger tips on my gloves so I
just rinsed it off and kept going once I
got a large enough piece of the laminate
lifted up it just peeled away from the
glass back entirely but now if the glass
breaks in the future it'll fall away in
large chunks instead of being held
together by that laminate you win some
and you lose some I'm going to dbrand my
phone at this point by removing the
logos from the underside of the glass
they just scrape off
I'll get my clear double-sided tape
around every edge of the phone this is
probably a good time to mention that
anytime you open up a water-resistant
phone it will 100% not be water
resistant anymore when you put it back
together so this project definitely has
its own pros and cons the tape all
around the edge should keep dust out but
I wouldn't trust it around water my back
glass panel is clean at this point a bit
of glass cleaner got rid of all the
fingerprints and then the camera lens
with this sliced fingerprint scanner
ribbon gets put back into place and the
whole back panel can get set back on the
phone now I might be a bit biased but I
think this looks awesome and this is
without Samsung even trying they could
take two seconds and design the
internals to be viewed from the outside
and it would probably look even cooler
like the black insulation over the
copper wireless charging coils it can be
scraped away like I showed in the video
I did with what's inside if Samsung used
clear insulation around those copper
coils it would take the aesthetics to a
whole new level
I did put my SIM card into the phone and
got 4G signals texts and phone calls all
worked and even Wi-Fi and bluetooth were
still functioning so everything's
working as it should you can see both
camera units the iris scanner and front
cameras the s-pen holster the
loudspeaker circular vibrator motor and
wireless charging pad itself with of
course the charging port down south next
to the headphone jack
so what do you think should Samsung give
us a clear phone option maybe if there
are enough comments asking for it below
this video
Samsung will consider it share this
video with someone you could see rocking
a clear phone like this one thanks for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
