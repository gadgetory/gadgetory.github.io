in the United States just yet with only
5% of my video views coming from people
stateside the vast majority of you are
watching from India and Indonesia but no
matter where you're from this nokia 8 is
super interesting and it's time to
review it from the inside with no
visible screws on the outside of the
Nokia 8ps friend when trying to get this
thing open since I'm one of the first
people to ever open up this phone with
no tutorials or guides it's kind of a
cross your fingers and hope for the best
type of situation
I'll get the screen to the point where
it's just barely too hot to touch and
I'll slide my metal pry tool between the
plastic antenna line and the glass of
the phone screen I'd like to use the
sharpness of a razor blade but to each
their own
avoid pressing the power button during
this process waking up the patient
during surgery is not an ideal situation
once that initial insertion has been
completed it gets a little easier using
that same gap to slide my second tool
around the edge carefully slicing
through the warm adhesive while avoiding
the display of the phone if the metal
touches the display under the glass the
display will shatter so stick to the
edges I'll keep warming up the phone as
needed to keep the glue soft the bottom
of the phone does have the capacitive
buttons so don't let your tool Knick
those either the glass is pretty sturdy
so once the majority of the adhesive has
been cut I can just twist my tool
leveraging the glass away from the frame
and lifting up definitely go slow and be
careful this thing is fragile there are
two ribbon cables holding the display to
the body of the phone the first big one
is attached under the center metal
bracket with its two screws I'll set
that bracket off the side while keeping
the screws organized of course and I'll
unsnap the little battery ribbon cable
first just like a little Lego from the
motherboard using a plastic pry tool
since it is a battery connection with
power to it after that's off all unsnap
the bigger ribbon that goes up to the
screen there's one more screw at the
bottom to display for the buttons I'll
unscrew that bracket and then lift that
over and out putting it next to the
screw it came with so it doesn't get
mixed up or lost and now the screen is
free from the body this is what
replacement screens will probably look
like I'll link these in the video
description as they become available
along with the tools that I'm using
during this repair you'll need a good
screwdriver
because there are 19 screws holding the
mid plate to the frame and these screws
are different sizes so lay them out in
the same shape as they are inside the
phone that way they can be put back in
the same hole they came from during the
reassembly lifting up the graphite plate
from the bottom of the phone allows us
to pull the top out at an angle
releasing the whole plate from the frame
I think this design is brilliant not
only is the screen relatively easy to
remove and replace but the battery is in
its own separate frame this frame also
includes the copper heat pipe which I'll
show more of in a second but it was
interesting to see that the thermal
paste applied to the graphite panel is
next to the heat pipe and not right on
top of the copper personally I think it
would be a bit more efficient if the
processor and thermal paste were
directly connected with the copper
instead of just the graphite since
copper has better heat conductivity but
either way this setup will probably get
the job done just fine it's nice that
the battery is in its own little frame
this means no amount of prying will
damage the display or the internal
electronics of the phone since they
aren't and you work close to the battery
at the moment there are no magic pull
tabs like we've seen on some of the
iPhones but the adhesive doesn't have a
death grip on the battery either and it
can be pried out using just the flat end
of my metal pry tool taking special care
not to puncture anything of course
pretty sure this is the biggest heat
pipe I've ever seen inside of a phone
maybe it's not positioned over the
processor because so much of its
underneath the battery and Nokia doesn't
want the battery and processor connected
with the same heatsink removing the
motherboard so we can get a look at the
exclusive Nokia both the cameras we have
four screws along the top of the phone
I'll keep these separated from the
twenty two screws we've already removed
and there's one large stand off screw at
the bottom of the motherboard we've seen
this situation on some of the iPhones I
just grabbed a flathead screwdriver and
twist it off at an angle like you're
seeing here then I'll set it next to the
other twenty six screws that we've
removed the SIM n SD card tray can be
taken out this can also be performed as
step number one if you're into that kind
of thing and then I'll unsnap the ribbon
cable along the right side of the
motherboard just like a little Lego the
whole motherboard can shift down to
clear the little grooves in the frame
and then tilt it up to disconnect some
stuff along the bottom edge the volume
button ribbon is first and then on the
back side we have a circular antenna
wire the charging port ribbon and
another signal wire on the side
the board the snaky headphone jack
ribbon you see here is rather
interesting it coils along the frame of
the motherboard bringing together the
headphone jack the camera flash and the
rear sensors all into one cable looking
at the rear facing cameras the upper
lens is that monochrome sensor with no
OIS and the bottom lens is the main 13
megapixel sensor with oh is personally I
think a wide-angle or telephoto camera
lens would be slightly more useful than
the monochrome but to each their own
the camera is replaceable and pops off
as one complete unit know√∂ is on the
front facing camera but that's pretty
normal
moseying are way down to the charging
port we have additional three screws and
then one more little guy on the right
side this one actually doesn't need to
come out but I'm gonna do it anyway
I'll unclip the signal wires and then
lift up the super wide charging port
extension cable allowing us additional
access to pull out the loudspeaker
housing out of the milled aluminum the
loudspeaker has a little splash
resistant ip54 screen at the bottom this
is just a reminder not to trust this
phone anywhere around water ip54 doesn't
mean much the charging port has the USBC
connector and the microphone with its
own little water screen it's nice that
the charging port can be replaced if
needed even if you do have to unscrew 30
screws to get it and now it's time to
see if the whole thing still works after
I put it back together the loudspeaker
is in place and the charging port tucks
in over the top of the black plastic
with the four little screws holding it
all into the frame the motherboard has
its own series of connectors along the
bottom just like that signal wire along
the edge and the one at the bottom as
well as the charging port ribbon it's
pretty hard to connect all these little
guys but after they're in I can tuck the
motherboard up into the top edge the
Nokia a-frame and get that headphone
jack ribbon plugged in on the front side
the sim an SD card tray can go back in
the slot that came from and I'll get
that large stand off screw at the bottom
of the motherboard using my flathead
screwdriver there are four screws along
the top edge of the motherboard and the
one on the far right has its own cold
bracket connecting it to the frame and
lastly I'll plug in the little Lego
connector at the bottom for the volume
and power buttons I've tucked the black
signal wire into the grooves along the
edge of the frame to make room for the
battery and mid plate which gets set
into place by tucking the top end first
and getting those 19 screws back all
along the edges remember most of these
screws are different so if it feels too
tight you're probably going in the wrong
grabbing the screen I'll get the
capacitive buttons plugged in at the
bottom of the phone first with its
little metal latch and small screw
holding it down tight and finally the
screen ribbon gets lined up and plugged
into the motherboard followed by the
battery connection at this point I will
purposefully wake up the patient from
anesthesia to see if everything's in
place and functioning turning on is a
good sign so I'll continue with the
metal bracket and the final two screws
of the whole operation a new screen will
probably come with its own adhesive but
if you plan on reusing your old screen
you'll need some double-sided tape to
hold it in place again this is
definitely not the easiest phone to
repair even the Nokia 6 bit easier but
it does have most of the features we
have come to expect on flagship androids
and the screen and battery replacements
can be performed easy enough so it gets
a thumbs up from me hit that subscribe
button if you haven't already I'd love
to have you around and let me know in
the comments if you have any questions
oh and let me know in the comments what
country you are watching from I'm
curious thanks a ton for watching and
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
