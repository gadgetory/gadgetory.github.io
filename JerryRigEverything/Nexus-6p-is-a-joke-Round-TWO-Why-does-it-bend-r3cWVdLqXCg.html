that I attend my Nexus 6p Bend video a
second time there seems to be some
question on whether the lighter
compromised the structural integrity of
the phone before it snapped in half so
if there is only fair if we did the test
over again everyone needs an expensive
hobby right so it's really easy to jump
on YouTube and pretend to make a bin
test video or your phone survives having
an honest comprehensive durability
testing system is a bit harder to find
just like cars have safety ratings
phones should be tested for durability
and that's where I come in I'm equally
prejudiced against all devices it either
survives my tests or it doesn't I've
done tests on all of the recent
flagships so far and most phone survives
only two phones so far have not so let's
jump in and do the Nexus 6p again as a
side note if you're having problems
seeing any of the logos on the phones go
ahead and bump up your video quality to
1080p or you know maybe it's time to
just upgrade your monitor
so there are three fatal structural
flaws in the Nexus 6p down here at the
bottom of the phone there is an aluminum
mid frame inside the phone that is
supposed to add virginity to the device
and it does kinda the flaw is that the
aluminum frame is not actually screwed
in or attached without housing of the 6p
they are completely free-floating
separate entities so the aluminum frame
is just chilling down there inside of
the device the only thing holding the
aluminum mid frame to the rear of the
phone is a super thin piece of glass on
top of the device right here at the
bottom and a few plastic dovetail joints
inside and even though it is Gorilla
Glass 4 the glass is not designed to
structurally adhere aluminum chunks
together luckily you guys will be able
to see the plastic dovetail joints I'm
talking about in just a few seconds the
second design flaw in combination with
the first is the thinness of the
sidewalls on a 6p rear aluminum back if
the aluminum back and mid frame were
solidly screwed together the thinness
wouldn't be an issue but since the mid
frame freely floats right out of the
rear frame when it's bending the
sidewalls of the rear frame becomes
super worthless all by their lonesome
the third flaw and the absolute weakest
point of the phone is right here by the
power button the battery stops here and
the motherboard stops here there is such
a small bit of aluminum holding this
together it's insane this allows for the
purpose kinking point in the middle of
the phone
now before I start I want to reiterate
that if you treat your phone nice you'll
have zero problems with it bending
especially if you have it in a case but
remember the smart phone is the most
accidently abused piece of equipment on
the planet you sit on it accidentally
drop it step on it it's important to
know how a durable it is before you buy
it
cars have a safety rating for a reason
it's good to know what to expect before
you buy it
nobody plans on wrecking their car but
it's good to know it's safe if you do
now let's find out what we can expect
from the Nexus 6p let me show you those
small dovetail joints I was talking to
you about before you can see right here
this is the free-floating aluminum back
that I was talking about luckily I have
another phone here with the same issue
weird of that works huh so you wanna
know where I learned about dovetail
joints my high school beginners
woodworking class must have been
brainstorming amateur hour at Huawei
when they suggested joining aluminum and
plastic with the woodworking joint down
here at the bottom of the phone
you can see here are the tiny little
plastic dovetails that are supposed to
keep this phone in tact remember that
any positive thing anyone has ever said
about this phone is probably still true
just because it has one fatally
significant Hardware flawed doesn't make
it a terrible phone just treat it nicer
than you normally would there are phones
have been in half and there are phones
that don't fit that the Nexus 6p is just
one of the phones that end in half my
buddy max Lee is a Channel high on
Android and he did a rather interesting
bin test video if you haven't seen it
yet definitely go check out his channel
he put 90 pounds of pressure right on
top of this Nexus 6p
it was super lucky that his bin test rig
sat right on top of this dovetail joint
and kept it pinched together during the
test otherwise he would have lost his
phone as well lucky guy
not as lucky as me though I have now the
proud owner of two Nexus 6p s durability
test videos like this one aren't a waste
of time they're what sparked changes in
the cell phone industry if nobody caught
flaws improvements would never be made
I bet Google never uses this plastic
dovetail joint again here's the other
flaw was talking about right here next
to the power button is the weakest piece
of aluminum holding this phone together
the motherboards on this chunk of the
device the batteries on this chunk of
the device and the aluminum in the
middle is the perfect bending point
between the two here's another look at
those dovetail joints that are supposed
to be connecting with this back plastic
piece to the aluminum mid frame and
here's the front glass that is also
supposed to be helping to hold the whole
phone together
thanks ton for watching like any typical
youtuber would be great if you subscribe
to my youtube channel it also makes me
feel all special and stuff if you
followed my Instagram thanks ton for
watching let me show you a little small
dovetail joints I was talking to you
about before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
