here that we're going to take apart
today it's also called a dual shock 4 so
there's four screws around the back just
here Armel Philips head screws so I'm
going to take apart each one of those
they're all the same size so I'm just
going to set them aside and then I found
that if you kind of pinch each of the
little handles it kind of will separate
the back from the front of the
controller and you can kind of wedge a
little pry tool in between there's a
series of latches around the outside
that are stuck really tightly holding
the top to the bottom of the controller
so if you find each little clasp and
clip it it'll pop out and you can see
that the back of the controller right
here is coming loose from the buttons if
you watch at the very end of the video
how I put it back together it'll make a
lot more sense how it comes apart you
see the button came loose right there I
can just click it back into place so
it's pretty simple right here you can
see the battery as well as the white
ribbon cable which goes to the charging
port so I'm just going to pull that away
from the little connector on the
motherboard and now I'm going to show
you how to replace the charging port if
you don't need this step and just want
to go to the battery replacement you can
skip ahead to about 2 minutes and 30
seconds 2 screws right here that you're
going to undo they're just your normal
Phillips head and then you can start
moving a little pieces of plastic and
this is all for the light and that is on
the controller for the how it
communicates with the camera and the
expo and sorry the PlayStation get a
little plastic out of the way and
there's two little Phillips head screw
drivers down screw heads down at the
bottom that I'm going to undo and then
the charging port itself just comes
loose from the controller usually these
parts aren't very expensive at all so if
yours breaks if you need the part and I
haven't listed it in the video
description below yet just shoot me a
comment and I'll find one for you
getting it all put back together getting
eels two Phillips head screws back into
place
tightening them in and then the glass
has its own little pins that it kind of
sits on top of so everything goes back
in its own little groove the controller
was made pretty sturdily and then you
have the top two Phillips head screws as
well so here's the battery the
interesting thing about the battery is
three point six five volts and a
thousand milliamp hours it's lithium-ion
I think that this battery feels really
light and that you can get a nether
battery that would be about the same
size that you know doubles the milliamp
hours in it so I think it's switchable
anyway so here's the two vibrators and
the handles of the controllers one is
bigger than the other I thought that was
interesting as well to kind of give you
kind of dual vibrations then to take out
the main board inside the controller you
have the one screw that holds it into
place as you're separating the main
board from the top half of the
controller there's a few little buttons
that might fall out there's not very
many it's mostly just a share button at
the top along with the other button you
can see that mine came loose all you got
to do is just grab your little button
and pop it back into place not too big
of a deal and so all these buttons they
are swappable as well you can just pop
those out and pop a new ones in then
here's the main board nothing on this is
really swappable all the like the
vibrators and everything else is
soldered onto the main board so there's
nothing really that you can change out
on this section of the controller and
then this is a little touch pad up at
the top and it comes loose you can see a
little white ribbon cable that goes into
the main board clip that back into place
and then back to the main board again so
this is the little speaker right here in
the main section so if your speaker goes
out you can swap that out and you can
see on the main board these little
connectors right here is how it gets its
communication it just rests against
those little gold connectors and then it
tells it what to play kind of fun anyway
get that position back into place again
back on the main board and then set it
directly on top of the plastic I keep it
facedown just so I don't have to deal
with all the buttons coming loose and
falling out and then make sure
everything finds its correct groove get
that little ribbon cable back into place
that you took out before just press it
in there's a little latch that you have
to clip down then get the back plastic
with a little battery compartment and I
think you know if you do find a
different size battery one that lasts
longer you can modify that compartment
is a little bit you know shave away a
little bit of the plastic
it looks like the battery you know
there's room around the battery as well
anyway here's the charging port ribbon
you can kind of see me getting that into
place just making sure just do it super
gently not to bend the cable at all and
not to scrape off the little gold
connectors on it just push it straight
in and it holds itself there's no
latches or anything on this connector
and then this little guy fell out this
is for the reset button on the
controller it's just like a little
rubber thing that just goes in it so if
that popped out just kind of slip it
down in the groove in the plastic where
it goes
took me a second to figure out where
that one came from anyway so you see
this is how the back goes on it just
latches on between the left and the
right the triggers and then once the
back is clasped on the rest of it just
kind of falls into place you can kind of
see it just kind of snap it in and you
can hear all the little latches clicking
shut as you close it you know if you
have any questions make sure leave in
