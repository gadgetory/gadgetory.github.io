latest flagship the moto z2 force
keeping the same modular theme from last
year this self-proclaimed durable phone
has solid specs built into a
surprisingly thin body
Motorola's pushing that shatterproof
screen again so let's see what this
phone can really handle my most pics to
a fantastic job of differentiating
between different materials by the
relative hardness plastic is soft so it
scratches at a three glass is harder and
scratches around a six and real sapphire
like the HTC u 11 sapphire edition is
basically impervious to scratches
lending at an eight or a nine on Mohs
scale of hardness shatterproof screens
are normally made from plastic like
we've seen with previous Motorola phones
and the Samsung active series the z2
force is no different plastic this
obviously has its benefits your screen
will never break and that's a huge plus
but the softness of the plastic leaves
it more susceptible to superficial
damage as you can see even my
fingernails which are a level 2.5 on
Mohs scale can leave a mark
so it's scratch is pretty easy motorola
has replaced this outer plastic covering
on previous phones for a reasonable fee
and hopefully they continue doing that
with this model so customers like us can
replace them if necessary the home
button is not scratch resistant either
my razor blade does do some damage but
luckily it does remain 100% functional
even when it's excessively scratched
beyond normal use thumbs up for that my
fingerprint still unlocks the phone
every single time without fail the
earpiece is recessed inside of the phone
and it's made out of that thin vinyl
covering well not as durable as a metal
earpiece at least it's not going to fall
out on its own
now motorola has paid special attention
to the front camera of this phone adding
its own front-facing dual tone LED flash
for you selfie lovers out there the only
problem is that the camera is still
covered by that same plastic as the
screen so one thing your nails
scratching the wrong spot and your
pictures are ruined until you have
Motorola swapped out that top layer of
your phone adding a simple screen
protector over the plastic would solve
this problem though the dual 12
megapixel rear cameras are covered by
glass finally
so that is scratch resistant these
cameras aren't wide-angle like the LG
6 or telephoto like the iPhone the dual
combo is just for depth effect which is
slightly less useful in my opinion but
still has a nice bonus over the average
phone motorola says the body is made out
of 7000 series aluminum the same high
quality stuff that Apple started using
with the iPhone 6s and it definitely
sounds like one awesome thing that I
want to point out if by chance the
screen on your moto z2 force ever breaks
motorola has a warranty for four whole
years that's longer than Donald Trump's
going to be President
super cool of Motorola to stand behind
their product such a gigantic warranty
the gold pins at the bottom of the phone
are for all the modular components that
magnetically attached to the back like a
speaker or bigger camera personally I'm
most excited for that projector the
sides of the phone do have the same
premium feel of metal that we expect on
flagship the top is metal as well and
even the busts are made for metal down
here at the bottom we have a USB C port
and an unfortunate lack of headphone
jack
having no headphone jack rules this
phone out for me as a daily driver I
treat my phone like a tool and a phone
without usable basic features is not
worth my time to carry headphone jacks
are a dime a dozen and wireless
headphones are not always accessible
maybe someday in the future but today is
not that day the screen of this phone is
pretty darn awesome 5.5 inch 1440p OLED
and most importantly not ever having to
worry about your screen breaking during
a drop that peace of mind is really
truly amazing even if you do have to
compromise with the front plastic the
screen lasted 10 seconds before the
plastic melted and the screen turned
white leaving a permanent bolt in the
top layer and a permanent white spot on
the display itself if you ever do drop
your phone it will survive unless it's
drop and fire so try to avoid that to be
modular ready this phone is shockingly
thin and I fully expected it to flex
more than it did there was a little
screen separation from the main body but
since this phone has no water resistance
rating nothing's been compromised
bending from the back yields no
destruction either the phone is
extremely
solid in its construction while this
phone might not be the phone for me it
still gets my approval
I think it's awesome that motor roll is
pushing the limits of design and
functionality with their mods some of
them are super appealing like that
projector I think I'll have to take an
inside look at that in a future video
what do you think would you prefer a
plastic shatter resistant screen or a
glass screen let me know in the comments
and come hang out with me on Twitter and
Instagram I have a lot of big videos
planned for the future at that subscribe
button and thanks for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
