durability test and now it's time for
the teardown and review from the inside
we had a vote over on my Twitter
yesterday to name our new little mouse
friend and out of the suggestions in my
last video came mouse emic mouse face
and mr. MOS Jerry from Tom and Jerry
ended up winning though good choice I
like that name let's call him mr. Jerry
Mose and I just hope he survives the
teardown let's get started since there
are no visible external screws on the
razor phone the only logical explanation
is that they are hidden under the
plastic speaker grills and as with most
adhesive this stuff gets softer as you
heat it up I'll take a thin pry tool or
in this case a razor blade and pry up
that bottom plastic grill exposing a few
screws I'll repeat the process with the
top grill by warming it up and putting
my razor into the razor and razoring it
around a little bit the camera lenses
come off with that top plastic I'll try
to find replacements for these and link
them in the description but since this
isn't a super mainstream phone it might
be difficult I'll pull the SIM card tray
out just in case that's important and
then there are six screws at the bottom
a combination of Phillips and t5 screws
there's another four screws up at the
top one t5 and the rest are Phillips
head getting the screen out of the frame
was a little bit easier than I
anticipated it's held in place with
friction and a few small clasps still
with a little leverage at the bottom of
the screen and some gentle persuasion
the whole thing can pop up and out of
the phone body way easier than the 1+5
three already we can see some pretty
interesting things inside this razor
phone but we need easier access to get a
better look there are a billion
different sized screws in here so I am
going to keep things organized I'll
detach the screen ribbon cable first by
unscrewing the metal bracket over the
battery connector it's a fillip set and
I'll peel back some of the metallic
shielding over those connectors first
thing to unplug is the massive battery
and then the screen ribbon and now that
the screen is free let's look at this
massive heat pipe this might be the
biggest heat pipe I've ever seen in a
cell phone it's also got the thermal
paste right over the top of the copper
so the heat dissipation will be more
efficient between the copper and the
processor under the black tape there's
another sheet of copper thermally
adhered to the copper below it more
copper is always a good thing the
adhesive only sticks one time though so
I'll just
put that off to the side and as good as
new
this is the screen component the 120
Hertz IPS beast of a display that this
phone is known for if you manage to
break yours unfortunately I'll try to
have some replacements linked in the
video description for you so far it's
been a pretty straightforward
replacement now let's get that gigantic
battery out
I'll unclip the fingerprint scanner
cable from the motherboard and then on
the other side of the phone I'll remove
the two screws holding down the volume
ribbon bracket I'll set that off to the
side and then unclip the volume button
connector just like a little Lego this
battery does have the magical pull tabs
thankfully and razer was nice enough to
give us a big enough tab to actually
grab and pull on
but wait there's more
unfortunately there was some premature
decapitation and now I have to commence
the private but still pretty simple to
replace the battery in this thing
a 4000 milliamp hour razor branded
powerhouse which is over twice the
capacity of the iPhone 8 pretty
impressive now for the charging port and
vibration motor this is where things get
a little more complicated there's a
total of seven screws holding this thing
down with a few golden frame attachments
to that plastic antenna line I'll
disconnect and peel back that charging
port ribbon from the motherboard and
removed the signal wires and the whole
thing can come free the USBC charging
port has a little bit of rubber around
the tip but remember that this phone has
no water resistance so be careful now
for that vibration motor in most smart
phones we find an eccentric rotating
mass motor or circular coin vibrators
but razer has stuck in a taptic vibrator
similar to what we've seen on the
iPhones but a fraction of the size it's
incredibly small Marquez was complaining
about his vibrator being trashed it
sounds broken like it's but it sounded
that way out the box since day one and
now we can see why it's barely even
there I assume Razer is making up for
its small size by overpowering the
itty-bitty guy and getting that blown
out rattling sound like you would with a
speaker apparently size matters when it
comes to vibrators the bottom
loudspeakers on the other side of the
phone and it's pretty interesting
once again no waterproofing but the
speaker cone is made from rubber kind of
like what we saw in the Apple earpods
so even if moisture does get into the
speaker it won't distort or blow easily
and will wear out less with time it's
nice of Razer to put quality speakers
inside of their phone I'll toss the
loudspeaker with its golden contact pads
back into the frame and make my way up
to the top of the motherboard the dual
camera system is hidden under that
metallic tape I'll peel that up and
unscrew the one screw holding down the
metal bracket over the connectors it's a
weird bracket with a little rubber
doohickey keeping it from popping out on
one side the cameras themselves can
unplug like little Legos and there are
two screws holding the whole thing down
one screw is tucked up underneath the
camera connector this is not the most
organized phone I've ever been
inside but it's still not as bad at the
old HTC's neither the regular camera
lens nor the telephoto camera have OAS
which is unfortunate optical image
stabilization is pretty important when
it comes to cameras been taking video
there is no side-to-side Hardware
stabilizing that we've seen on other
major high-end flagships there are five
more screws holding down the gold and
ten align brackets to the motherboard
and then one more screw hidden next to
the front-facing camera the whole
motherboard can lift up and away from
the phone body after that the eight
megapixel front-facing camera is
removable if you're into that kind of
thing also one more cool thing is that
the front earpiece looks like it's the
same size as the bottom speaker so there
will be equal sounds coming from both
ends of the phone
it's just oriented in a different
direction the top speaker also has that
same durable long lasting rubber cone
that we talked about earlier and now
it's time to see if our little mouse
buddy is still alive I'll get all those
golden and tan aligned brackets back
into place with those six motherboard
screws there's another two screws
specifically to hold down the rear
cameras
I'll get that silver bracket situated
with its one screw and funky white
little rubber pad thing and make my way
down to the bottom of the phone the
charging port goes in with its golden
tan align brackets and six screws and
the long extension cable can run up
along the frame to the top and plug into
the motherboard I'll tuck that massive
battery back into place and get this
silver bracket with its two screws back
over the volume button ribbon the
fingerprint scanner lego-like connection
is next and then I'll toss that metallic
tape back on over the cameras an SD card
slot
I do like saving the battery connector
for last to be safe so I'll get the
screen lined up and plugged in and then
the battery the metal bracket goes over
the top of all those connectors with its
one screw to hold it down tight getting
the screen lined up and press down was
easy enough the kink near the power
button from my bin test didn't mess me
up too much since I am working with
glass though I was pretty gentle and
careful getting it back into place
cracking the screen at this point would
be incredibly unfortunate and it looks
like everything still works
this phone is currently available on
Amazon right now so I'll leave a link
for that in the description along with
all the parts and tools I use during
this video hopefully you never break
yours but accidents happen I'll get all
the screws back into the frame and
unfortunately the speaker grilles are
not going to go back into place nicely
once they've been peeled off the
adhesive is not reusable I'll probably
try some double-sided tape it's
point or just wait till I can find some
replacements Jerry mouse is glad he
survived the teardown and thanks you all
for his new name come hang out this on
Twitter Jerry and I thank you a ton for
watching and we'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
