little bit different this is the first
video in a series of videos about laptop
durability normally I deal with cell
phones but laptops are portable as well
and still suffer the same amount of
abuse being towed around everywhere LG
was brave enough to send me the LG gram
one of the thinnest and lightest laptops
in existence while still boasting some
pretty powerful specs I'll leave a link
down in the video description if you
want to check out some of those specs
but this video is going to be about
durability let's get started this brand
new 15-inch laptop from LG is one of the
lightest and most portable laptops on
the planet way near just 2.2 pounds it
is considerably lighter than Apple's new
macbook pro which landed just over 3
pounds now when talking about the
exterior surface material LG says it is
a nano carbon magnesium alloy which at
my first impression legitimately had the
look and feel of cold metal right out of
the box and even has the same metallic
sound we've all come to love but when I
get out the Roediger and dig a little
deeper through that top metallic coating
there is plastic material underneath now
this doesn't bother me too much on a
laptop this laptop was specifically
built to be light portable and powerful
and they've accomplished that my level 3
most pic tells us that this laptop has a
seventh generation i7 processor with 16
gigabytes of RAM and a huge 512 gigabyte
SSD hard drive LG said that these nano
carbon metallic powders on the surface
improved the laptop strength by 26% but
we'll have to test that out in a minute
the keyboard is also plastics and that's
normal I can't think of a single laptop
or keyboard with metal keys if you know
of one let me know about it in the
comments so when I was first thinking
about doing durability tests on laptops
besides just build quality checks I
tweeted it out and there are some really
good suggestions from you guys the most
relevant of which I think is the drop
test because that's probably what
happens most laptops you know being
dropped off a table or being dropped out
of a backpack for me personally anytime
my phone
damage the last office when it's been
plugged in and sitting on a table and
someone walks by and accidentally like
kicks that cable and pulls a laptop off
the table luckily with the LG Graham
they're boasting like a 12 hour battery
life which is pretty impressive so I
imagine it's not going to be plugged in
a whole lot but just for the sake of
continuity across all of my laptop tests
we're going to do this one plugged into
the wall you got to admit that this is a
pretty good-looking laptop it's got the
super thin bezels on the side it's got
the touch lit keypad and it's got enough
ports that it's almost like LG wants you
to be productive with their laptop so
right now the laptop is on and
completely functioning it's a brand new
laptop there's a couple scratches but
that's not going to affect the build
quality so review this three times I'm
going to stand up and trip over this
cable which i think is the most common
drop that happens with laptops all right
still functioning drop number one let
the ten drop number two same cable
dropped number two just completely
functioning it's almost like this laptop
is so light that there's no weight
there's not enough weight to actually
damage any of the internal components or
the screen hinge or anything this is the
third drop them and open up the laptop
as far as it'll go and drop it one more
time I'm still nothing wrong with the
laptop still functioning completely the
last thing I'm gonna do is a crush test
because as we know laptops are mostly in
backpacks or book bags and sometimes
they get leaned up against you on the
subway or the bus or in your car so I'm
going to close the laptop and stand on
it now I weigh about 200 pounds so if
this thing can survive a crush test of
200 pounds it can probably survive
anybody leaning up against it all right
here we go
stepping on the laptop all of my weight
directly on top of it the seat it still
works
Oh that is awesome there is no crack at
all on the screen I think we're good to
go let's double check oh that is amazing
so even after being stepped on with 200
pounds of pressure the screen is still
completely functioning and nothing is
wrong with the laptop I think that's
pretty impressive let me know if there's
any other tests that I should do in my
laptop series leave them down in the
comments below and I will read them I'll
also leave a link in the description of
this video for this laptop if it can
survive three drops in two hundred
pounds of pressure I would consider it
pretty durable it would be interesting
to see how big the battery really is
inside this laptop when I do my teardown
thanks ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
