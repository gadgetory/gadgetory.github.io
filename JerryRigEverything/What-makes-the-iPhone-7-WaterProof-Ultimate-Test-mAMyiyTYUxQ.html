what kind of help can we expect from
Apple if our phone does get wet let's
open it up and find out first off it's
important to remember that Apple never
said that their phone is waterproof just
splash and water resistant the
terminology is very very important and
I'll tell you why
the Apple iPhone 7 has an ingress
protection of 67 the first number is
talking about solids like dust and the
second number is talking about liquids a
seven at the end means the phone can be
immersed in water shallower than one
meter for short periods of time much
different than Samsung's ip68 rating
that can be submersed and water deeper
than one meter the testing standards are
different for each number IP 69 is the
highest IP rating which would be able to
withstand steam jet cleaning here is one
phone with an IP sixty-nine rating so
when compared to other water resistant
phones Apple is at the lowest end of the
immersion protection the most important
thing to remember from this whole video
is that if your phone does get wet it is
not covered by any kind of warranty
whatsoever it is written pretty clearly
on Apple's website liquid damage not
covered under warranty there aren't many
ingress points for water on the iPhone 7
especially since Apple got rid of that
headphone jack Apple saved a significant
amount of money by removing that hole
and not having to waterproof it I'll be
talking more in depth about that
headphone jack in a future video so
buckle up for that let's start with the
biggest hole in this phone one you might
not think of is the screen slot the gap
between the edge of the screen and the
edge of the phone is the largest area
that needs to be sealed you can see the
adhesive clearly when I did my bin test
and when I was removing the screen from
the phone this tacky black substance is
water-resistant and helps keep water and
dust out of the phone the second biggest
hole is the charging port here is the
port itself it's got six different
screws in close proximity to the port
that hold it tight against the frame of
the phone the rubber ring around the tip
helps keep water out and the Lightning
port hole is sealed with this clear
plastic each little component on the
charging port ribbon is also protected
by plastic this is pretty smart just in
case water does get inside the phone the
electronics close by the opening will
still be protected what about these two
speakers
at the bottom the one to the right of
the charging port is the loud speaker
hole it has a thin mesh inside the
exterior holes to keep water out as well
as a thin mesh inside the speaker itself
so there are two simple layers of
protection the left side of the charging
port is a microphone hole and this is
still protected by the same type of
waterproof mesh it lets air and sound
through as long as the water pressure is
minimal liquid would rather stick to
itself than pass through the small
openings thumbs up for the sweet
waterproof mesh what about the earpiece
it is held tightly against the screen of
the phone with several screws a rubber
seal around the front also helps keep
water out along with multiple layers of
that same waterproof mesh there is even
mesh on the back of the speaker just in
case so what is keeping water out of the
side buttons the power button internal
housing is here along the edge I pop off
these two screws and normally there
would be some kind of rubber sidewall
between the button layers and side of
the phone but it looks like Apple is
just hoping that these really small
holes work in their favor if I remove
the button entirely each prong of the
button has a little rubber washer on the
tip and that will probably help keep
water out as long as it is extremely
shallow water with no pressure the SIM
card tray has a loose-fitting little
rubber ring around the edge of it so how
will Apple be able to tell if your phone
has been wet right here on the
motherboard is a water damage indicator
it looks all innocent and white when
it's dry but turns red the moment liquid
touches it the motherboard itself is not
water resistant at all some electronics
will be covered in a hydrophobic spray
that repels water liquid would beat up
and roll off without sticking to the
board at all but as you can clearly see
from both water droplets here the water
is clinging very tightly to the
motherboard signaling that it is not
treated with any hydrophobic coatings so
if water gets in water will kill it so
if you use your iPhone as your daily
device I would strongly recommend that
you still avoid water just think of that
ip67 rating as an added layer of
protection a slight peace of mind but do
not trust it with regular liquid contact
and definitely keep it out of a hot
shower steam gets into more places that
regular water will not and if your phone
gets damaged it is entirely your problem
and not apples so what do you think you
trust Apple's water resistant measures
if you want to see the slightly
beefier water-resistant protections on
the note seven go ahead and click the
link up in the corner or down in the
video description
Samsung even managed to waterproof their
headphone jack it's pretty interesting
like always my behind the scenes stuff
is on Twitter and Instagram so follow me
there and you could be the first to see
the high-end tech reviewed from the
inside thanks for watching hope see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
