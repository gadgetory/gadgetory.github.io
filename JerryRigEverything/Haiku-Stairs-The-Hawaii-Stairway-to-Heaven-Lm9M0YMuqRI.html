the bed it's illegal
beautiful shot my hair there's your
stairs in 1942 on the Hawaiian island of
Oahu the United States Navy constructed
a set of 4,000 stairs to access a secret
radio station on top of the mountain the
stairway is called the haiku stairs and
accurately nicknamed the stairway to
heaven you'll see why in just a second
the radio station at the top of the
Haiku stairs was used to communicate
with United States Navy all across the
Pacific during the Second World War
initially the stairs leading to the top
of the mountain were made out of wood
but were replaced in the 1950s by a more
structurally secure metal staircase
after the war the radio tower was
eventually converted into an Omega
navigation system which transmitted
low-frequency radio signals as a kind of
old-school GPS for ships and aircraft
this was also subsequently shut down
when GPS satellites became more
mainstream but the beautiful stairway
was left in place and intact and even
though the stairs themselves have been
closed to the public since 1987 that
doesn't keep people from ignoring the no
trespassing signs and climbing the
stairs themselves to enjoy this world
wonder often as I personally found out a
few years ago
trespassers get cited by the local
police on the way down in 2003 the city
spent eight hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars repairing the stairs
but even after that the constant flow of
trespassers the precarious location and
the aggressive foliage have left the
state again in major need of repair
unfortunately though just last year in
2016 the land owners the Hawaii Board of
Water Supply commissioned a team to
study the environmental impact of
dismantling and removing the stairway to
Hazzard that means this hike and this
view would be inaccessible for future
generation taking down the stairs would
be removing one of the most unique and
beautiful pieces of history we have from
World War two personally I think Hawaii
could make a huge profit by turning the
hike into a lottery system like
California does with the Yosemite Half
Dome hi Hawaii would get the money for
stairway maintenance and people could
participate in one of the most beautiful
hikes in the world legally do you think
that there should be removed from the
mountain let me know in the comments
all this aerial footage II saw was
filmed with the DJI Matic hit that
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video and subscribe for more videos like
this in the future
thanks for watching called fuer
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
