key coded Bluetooth smart lock hopefully
it's a bit more secure than the last
lock we tested I'm going to show the
installation on it to huge thanks to
LastPass for sponsoring this video let's
get started this residential door lock
claims to be pretty intelligent but
today we're gonna find out how smart it
is ourselves with little installation
and of course a review from the inside
the first component out of the box and
the only portion on the outside of the
door is the keypad which appears to have
a solid metal construction and a couple
internal Phillips head screws holding
the locking mechanism in place the other
check of the housing is what goes on the
inside door with the metal mounting
plate and three screws holding the guts
to the metal exterior now we don't have
to worry much about this half of the
lock because an intruder wouldn't have
access since it's inside of the door but
we're still gonna take it apart anyway
the guts come out cleanly enough we have
a rubber button used to control some of
the alarm programming and the internal
for double-a batteries it's nice that
everything is self-contained and no
exterior power is needed it makes
installing this lock and much more
do-it-yourself project the large black
circle in the center of the board is the
alarm speaker so if the lock does fill
itself being forced opened or jiggled it
can blast a shrill high-pitched car
alarm sounding noise into the house so
far so good
it seems secure there is a series of
clips holding a motherboard to the
plastic backing once that's pulled away
we see a bunch of white gears and the
electric motor in charge of locking and
unlocking the lock whether it's from the
correct key code being entered or
wirelessly with the integrated smart
home system or phone app which will test
out in a second for reference this is
the little motor inside of the smart
padlock that I opened up in a previous
video there's a big size difference the
residential door lock is much larger and
much more powerful I'll put the
motherboard back in and plot the
components back into the solid metal
housing and get all the screws back in
place
I'll get the batteries installed and you
can see here how the two parts
sandwiched together
on either side of the door to make a
working lock one last look inside the
exterior portion of the lock the one
that's most vulnerable and we see that
even under the plastic keypad it's just
metal if an intruder were to rip off the
electronic keypad portion they would
have no access to the inside of the lock
just metal and as you can hear
the thing is pretty solid let's see what
happens when we install it installation
is pretty easy I'll just remove the two
screws holding the old unintelligent
lock in place and then pull the deadbolt
itself out from inside the door the new
bolt can be adjusted depending on the
size of the hole
mine needs to be fully extended and the
whole thing can be screw into the door
the front housing gets set into the door
and the solid metal plate gets placed on
the back and the two beefy screws hold
your two parts together I made sure to
pull the keypad display ribbon through
the slot in the middle plate so I could
plug it into the computer guts on the
backside of the door the computer guts
and the alarm portion slide on to the
metal plate easy enough there's a little
hole for the locking mechanism and then
there's two screws one large screw in
the center and a little guiding screw up
at the top the speaker hole might look
screwable but definitely don't stick
anything in there it is a speaker and
can be damaged everything seems to be
working so far to program the lock there
is a super important six digit number on
the back side of the instructions
as well as written inside of the lock
and that number is used to program the
thing there is an app directly from the
company dedicated to the operation of
the lock but we'll talk about that in a
second so from a hardware perspective
everything on this lock is working super
smoothly it only took me about ten
minutes to install and all of the coding
and programming internally in the lock
is working great from a hardware
perspective huge thumbs up from a smart
lock perspective I'll get to that in a
second the nice thing about this lock is
that it can hold thirty different key
code combinations which is kind of like
instead of having to remember a key
every time you leave the house you just
remember your simple password works
great for people who are running Airbnb
ease who have big families you can reset
the internal codes whenever you want you
can lose your keys you won't lose your
passwords lately it seems like we need
passwords for everything whether it's
the latest social media apps online
platforms are now your doorknob it's
getting hard to remember every single
one of them LastPass does have a
solution for that it is a free app I'll
link it down in the video description
that can remember all of your passwords
for you if you're like most people you
probably have one super simple password
for everything which is probably not the
most secure way to do things
LastPass has the ability to generate and
remember for you super long so
your passwords and all those passwords
are encrypted so only you can access
them not even LastPass employees can see
what they are because of that encryption
it is free to everyone but for an extra
two bucks a month you can get one
gigabyte of encrypted storage only you
can access and see those files that are
stored in your drive it has been
downloaded by millions of people so you
don't have to take my word for it
whether you just don't want to remember
your passwords anymore or you actually
want the secure long encrypted passwords
there's always that link right in the
video description huge thanks to
LastPass for sponsoring this video back
to the lock though from a smartlock
perspective from me it gets a massive
thumbs down like I said before
everything on the lock works perfectly
the hardware is great
it can't be physically hacked from the
outside but I was never able to connect
my phone to the lock I'm currently using
a galaxy s 8 and it would never connect
even after a master reset on the lock
itself and I wasn't able to unlock the
lock with my phone which is part of the
bare-bones smart lock capabilities you
would expect from this piece of hardware
at first I thought it was just me or
maybe my lock was defective but after
reading the reviews it is a widespread
issue of this lock not being able to
connect to cell phones it's a big deal
and you would think that the lock would
be smart all by itself
but if you wanted to connect it to like
an Amazon Alexa or like a smart home
automated system you have to have
something called a hub which actually
connects it via Wi-Fi so by itself it's
not smart at all and the thumbs-down is
the price I paid massive smart lock
pricing and receive something that has
no smart lock capabilities so for a
keypad lock it's great for a smart lock
it's not so great I will continue my
search for a smart lock better than this
one if you have any questions go ahead
and leave them down in the comments and
huge thanks to LastPass for sponsoring
this video I will leave that free link
in the video description and thanks a
ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
