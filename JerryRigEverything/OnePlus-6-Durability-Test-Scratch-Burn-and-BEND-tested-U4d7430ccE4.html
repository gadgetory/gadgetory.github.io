to draw from the company oneplus here on
jerry-rigged everything we semi
scientifically review cellphones with
razor blades so pump up that volume a
few notches and hit the subscribe button
let's get started this is the mirror
black version of the oneplus six super
reflective with the super deep black
there's also a midnight black version
out there where oneplus uses corrosion
on the back glass for a slightly more
matte aesthetic might be fun to take a
look at that in the future if oneplus
ever lets me touch a phone again after
this the AMOLED screen comes with a
pre-installed screen protector which is
a super good way to protect your phone
right out of the box it's nice they
don't make you go buy extra accessories
the six also comes with a soft
protective case in the red box right
above that - charger in charging cable
the scratch test is first you know how
it works most scale one through ten a
level three being plastic and a level
ten being diamonds oneplus said they use
Gorilla Glass 5 on both the front and
back of this phone which seems to be the
premium standard these days and the
results of the scratch test degree
scratches appear to level 6 and a deeper
groove at a level 7 everything's pretty
normal so far oneplus started shrinking
bezels with last year's 1 + 5 t and that
remains the same with this one + 6 a
slightly larger screen with no home
button at the bottom but we do have a
notch this time in the display for the
front-facing 16 megapixel camera this
camera comes with electronic image
stabilization and face unlock personally
I don't have strong feelings one way or
the other about the knotch it is what it
is but this speaker grille is pretty
cute it's almost as small as the Huawei
P 20 pro I reviewed earlier
either way the grille is very solidly
attached to the phone and will be
falling off on its own even with
intentional aggressive persuasion
besides the 1 + 6 or just as pitch black
as the rest the phone and made for metal
the power button and even the textured
mute switch which I'm still a huge fan
of is metal this is a button I would use
every single day it's a pretty useful
feature to have on a smart phone
the top of the phone is made from metal
no holes up here except for the noise
cancelling microphone and the far side
of the phone is still painted metal
along with the metal volume rocker
bottom the phone has a USBC slot and
more importantly a headphone jack
well not something I use every day the
convenience of having one far outweighs
the aesthetics of not and for me a cell
phone is all about making life more
convenient so thumbs up to one plus for
keeping that headphone jack another
super important point of good design is
the soft plastic cushion layer between
the glass and the metal frame of the
phone most people will never realize
this is here but it helps shield the
brittle glass from the hard metal if the
phone has ever dropped the glass is less
likely to cracked on impact with this
subtle protective ring in place a case
is still very important don't get me
wrong but every bit of protection helps
for the back of the phone all the
lettering is under the surface of the
glass and protected from ever scratching
off well at least until I open it up
anyway there is no wireless charging
though oneplus has retained their
invincible scratch proof fingerprint
scanner which is nice my razor blade
does no damage to the surface of that
scanner through your cameras are
interesting the main camera is a 16
megapixel sensor and this year we have
both optical and electronic image
stabilization the 20 megapixel secondary
camera is just there to support the main
sensor not sure all the details on that
support system yet but since this one
plus can shoot 4k video at 60 frames per
second whatever support it's giving is
working and it's all protected with
scratch resistant glass the 6.2 inch
AMOLED display to me is one of the best
features of this phone AMOLED blacks
make the bezel and notch pretty much
disappear you don't get as vibrant of
colors on a normal LCD display it still
made about 20 seconds though before the
pixels completely died so that's cool
it's hard to show off how impressively
reflective this black mirror is but you
can get an idea by looking at my camera
through the back panel it looks good
even though art class with Jerry gets
canceled with glass back phones
I think the oneplus 6 will make a great
clear phone candidate it'll be fun to
show off that red battery that oneplus
probably forgot about again previous
one-plus phones were milled from solid
blocks of aluminum making them pretty
durable it's time to see if this glass
redesign holds up to a structural bent
the first bin made me pretty nervous
there was quite a bit more flex than I
anticipated but it still managed to hold
up against an impressive amount of force
with zero cracks or kinks the metal
frame is still intact and the glass
remains unshadowed I believe this is in
part due to the plastic lining between
the glass and the metal frame but either
way this new oneplus flagship passes my
durability test and is definite daily
driver material what do you think do you
like the one plus six and what features
would your ideal smartphone include let
me know down in the comments and then
come hang out with me on Twitter and
Instagram
thanks ton for watching and I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
