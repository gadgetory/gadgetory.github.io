go I pulled this away right there so you
can see the brake line coming through
here this is the brake line we've been
working with I pulled it out a little
bracket and I've been bending it very
very very gently with the those I have
pliers just kind of like finished a
little bit at a time
I've kind of rerouted it back to you
there I put the Torx head back in the
screw screw right there and this is
still free loose I'm not going to
tighten it up just yet I have it in
position I'm going to go ahead and put
the shocks back in after I get the leaf
springs on and then make sure the lines
in the spot where I want to put that
screw back there now they want to do
with that as much as I have plus if you
strip that thing out you're pretty
screwed anyway so that's how you reroute
the brake lines and I'll make it all
look pretty as soon as I'm done kind of
like tuck it back in there pull it down
to the top the main thing is you just
don't want it to interfere with any of
the suspension system like when the
shocks are back in and it goes up and
down you don't want the brake lines to
be anywhere near there so right here the
tube lines this is the hard line that
comes from the front this is the line
that goes down at the back this is the
driver's side tire right here what we're
supposed to do is we'll unclip this and
have a little D drop bracket where we
connect this onto I can't get this apart
for the life of me and I really don't
want to take I don't want to break
either of these alliance because it's
not a couple hundred bucks in break
affairs so what we're doing is I'm just
bidding this bracket down which will
give me another two or three inches of
of room and they give this brake line
enough room to fluctuate as you can see
right now it's got plenty of flex in it
and I'm only bringing the Jeep up four
inches so we'll be we've plenty good
from there anyway so
I'll save me some time and effort just
by bending this down you just wanna be
really careful with these lines and not
kink em or break them or anything like
that
okay so underneath the front of a Jeep
Wrangler we're taking off the pitman arm
it's attached to the steering gear right
here
this bolt is a 33 millimeter bolt I
thought it was going to be a larger
takeoff than it was basically what I did
is I took some of this pv blaster stuff
sprayed it last night left it sitting
overnight and then sprayed it a couple
times this morning and then took my 33
millimeter socket head and my breaker
bar just popped it right off so yeah so
once I get that nut off I'm just going
to take off this other one hit with the
hammer a few times and hopefully that
pops right off I have a tip in arm polar
to you so that'll help me out on this
side this is a 19 millimeter bolt just
broke that loose with little tiny sake
there's a cotter pin inside that as well
I had to remove it pretty simple but
right here is a pitman arm pore that's
pretty much the most important tool when
you're removing a pitman arm so what it
does is it slides up in that groove
right there and then the end of the bolt
right there as a kind of divot in it and
then the peak of the tool also has a
divot in it that fits right inside so
I'm just going to kind of tighten it up
in there and as you tighten it it just
pulls the arm right off so let's do it
cuz the a little socket that fits around
the end of that okay so once you get the
pit are off the other end you just have
to tap it a few times it's kind of like
a it's a bowl that's kind of tapered on
the end just got to hit it up and out of
there
okay underneath the dress I leave spring
I just barely took off the u-bolt nuts
drop that plate down now I can take off
the the leaf springs themselves with
these bolts right there I believe there
are 19 millimeters on the front and
these ones I think is a21 and a.22 off
to double-check that though so yeah now
that I have that off I have the axle
supported because once I get that leaf
spring off of there's going to be
nothing else supporting the axle on this
side so I have to make sure that's all
propped up so it should be good okay
this is the part where the front of the
leaf spring on or in the front of the
Jeep here I'm you can see that this is
the inside of the bushing on the leaf
spring got the leaf spring out but the
bushing stayed in so I got to cut that
off because there's no way this is it's
kind of stuck on the whole bolt there
kind of unfortunate all right so this is
the get to focus here is the leaf spring
those are the nuts on it that would not
come out so I ended up cutting them off
what happens is is that not right the
bolt right here actually just gets
seized up inside of the bushing sorry
it's getting kind of blurry there so
it's completely stuck inside of it
there's no way of getting that out tried
wrenches tried breaker bars tried the
w4t try that other Lube stuff nothing
worked so I just have a drill here not
the best tool you want to use there's a
little grinder plate attached to it
probably go through about three of those
a bolt anyway
kind of a pain but when you're not
you're in a parking lot with Noah
extension cords well we're not allowed
to have extension cords is your best bet
anyway so sometimes that's what you got
to do
okay so right now just get some of this
grease like I did before and just kind
of put it down inside this hole get it
all around in there just so like the
that bit doesn't seize up on it on the
bolt like it did before this just helps
like if the if it springs of a break and
the other guy the next guy who repairs
it has to fix them doesn't have to cut
them all out like I did anyway that'll
help you out in the long run forced it
on the driver's side here I'm going to
have this little contraption rigged up
so I can get that moved over so I can
get these holes lined up with the leaf
string so as I click this that pulls
that towards me gives me more almost
lines these up so we'll give another
tour - perfect push there and I'll go
right in this is the upper set the leaf
spring you can see a little knob right
there at the top I'm inside of the axle
mount there's a little hole where that
has to slip down inside of it so what
I've done is I've loosened up the
u-bolts on the other end um so I can
have a little bit of play in it and I'm
just going to kind of juggle back and
forth until it slides down into place
it's with these u-bolts these will go
through the over the axle and through
the leaf springs and there's two
different sizes there's going to be two
of these bigger ones and the bigger ones
go on the front axle and then there's
going to be six of these other ones and
the other ones there's you know the four
on the back then the two on the front
these kind of like on the axle there's
another bracket that these have to fit
over and I'll show you those when I'm
installing it just so you know I'll just
make sure not to include the big ones on
the back axle or anyplace weird like
that
okay so we're on the front axle I just
want to show you where the bigger
u-bolts go I'm you can see that as to
fit over the top of this ledge right
here so the bigger u-bolts are on the
inside
and you can see going at the bottom how
the these ones are spaced farther out
then these ones are so the going seven
same with this one over here this u-bolt
is sitting on top of this ledge that's
the bigger the two those are the only
two big u-bolts that there are okay so
when you're installing the new shocks
just put the bolt through the bottom
there I'm using the shocks compound in
some kind of way obviously don't stretch
out it's easier ship and stuff I put the
rubber washer in the middle washer on it
and I just have to extend it up into the
into the housing there so I'm going to
do I'm going to cut that and it'll
extend on its own nice have to kind of
guide it in there a lot easier too with
two hands I'll tell you that
and then by its own means it'll go right
up into the top there then I'll put the
other little washer on top with a little
groove there so we'll go down inside the
middle housing
and then nut goes on top of that this
once I tighten it all down that's how
you install the shops</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
