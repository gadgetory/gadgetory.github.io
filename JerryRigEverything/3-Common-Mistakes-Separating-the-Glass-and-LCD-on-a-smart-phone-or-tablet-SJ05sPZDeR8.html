shattered glass on your new Samsung
phone works from the galaxy s3 and on
all the way through the nexus is the
notes all that good stuff
this video is just about tips so if you
want to see the full complete
restoration of the phone click on the
bottom left hand corner and that will
take you to a full video right now I am
separating the glass from the buttons on
the phone so the buttons stay with the
phone itself you don't need to open up
the phone to replace the screen on it
right now I'm just peeling off the glass
because the glass is just a solid piece
of glass there's no wires coming out of
it or anything so I've gotten the button
separated and I've gotten the glass
pieces coming out and you'll see in a
second why called this mistake that
teeter-totter effect for lack of a
better scientific term you can see as I
lift up on one corner of the glass the
other side of the glass is pressed into
the digitizer underneath and crack the
pressure cracks the digitizer underneath
and it doesn't take very much pressure
at all so you have to be really careful
as you lift up to not put any pressure
on the screen underneath the phone it
cracks the digitizer over the LED and
once that is correct there is no fixing
it you have to replace the screen as a
unit mistake number two not enough heat
so you can see I had my blow dryer I was
going on this phone I was kind of
melting the glue between the glass and
the digitizer and you want to get it to
a point where the glue is liquid enough
that the glass kind of just peels away
by itself here you can see I'm kind of
struggling with it the glass isn't
wanting to separate from the phone so
I'm heating it up again with the blow
dryer which just never really gets hot
enough some blow dryers might mind it
not if all you need is the glass for
your phone you can usually find them on
Amazon for less than 10 bucks I will
list them in the video description below
you can just click on the link and I'll
take it right to Amazon
this video is all about the common and
very costly mistakes that people can
make when swapping out your own screens
and how to avoid them this saves you a
lot of money and everyone is happy and
you subscribe to my YouTube channel but
really you should click the subscribe
button below right here you can see that
the glue is actually super stressed you
can see all the crack lines in it it's
just because it's not getting hot enough
still I'm kind of forcing it apart from
the screen underneath and it's not happy
about it so right here I'm going to come
up from the other corner and the
digitizer is stove stuck to the glass
above it that it just starts cracking
apart and once it starts cracking like I
said before there's no saving it
it is completely destroyed and you just
have to replace the whole screen as a
unit and I have videos for all of these
Samsung phones on how to replace the
screens as the units just kind of search
through my other videos if you end up
destroying your screen this is usually
just a cheaper alternative for the
people who don't want to spend a whole
lot of money the screens for these
phones are just will need they're about
ten bucks just for the glass part anyway
once I realize it was broken that is
ripped off the whole screen this kills
the phone alright mistake number three
too much heat so I got a new heat gun
and I started off way too close to the
screen they heated up way too fast so
you want the screen to be at the point
where you can barely touch it with your
hand where you wouldn't want to rest
your finger on the screen and that gets
the glue to the right temperature where
it'll separate from the clasp so here
you can see through the crack in the
screen that it's heated up so much that
it's actually started to discolor the
LED underneath the glass this point I
realized that I had messed up but I
decided to keep going anyway so you can
see that the screen is super hot at the
moment and as I kind of peel it up from
the phone it's super the glue just kind
of is super liquid underneath and it
just slides away and the glass
actually really easy to just pry up and
away from the phone right now I'm also
pulling it up at an angle to avoid that
teeter-totter effect so I'm not putting
any pressure on the digitizer underneath
the glass same thing with this you can
see the glue separating from the
digitizer in the glass itself you want
to find a happy medium you know between
this and mistake number two you don't
want to see those stress fractures in
the glue but you also don't want to you
know damage your LED either it's a
fairly expensive mistake now I have the
new piece of glass on top of the phone
and I'm just running the heat over
really quick just to make sure that the
the double-sided sticky tape that I have
underneath kind of melts again to the
glass and holds it a little bit stronger
than it would normally have the that
same screen attached to my test phone
and you can see the burn mark right
there in the LED there's no fix in it if
you want to see how a screen swap is
done correctly go ahead and click in the
bottom left-hand corner that'll take you
straight to the video where it's 100% is
done perfect and yeah any questions make
sure leave in the comments below you can
