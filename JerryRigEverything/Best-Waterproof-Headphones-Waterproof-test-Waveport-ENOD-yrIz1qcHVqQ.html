reached out to me with their new
waterproof headphones and asked if I
wanted to test them out naturally I said
yes
testing electronics is my specialty
these headphones are bluetooth but also
have 8 gigabytes of internal memory so
they can function as a normal mp3 player
without needing a phone to control them
the packaging is pretty solid little
magnets hold the flap in place and then
foam holds the headphones and all of the
earbuds these earbuds are important and
I'll come back to them later a soft
rubber coated wire wraps around your
head and over your ears to keep the
headphones in place the headphones have
a sealed body and supposedly a coated
PCB board but we'll check on that later
inside the mesh bag comes the microUSB
charging cable that plugs into the dock
and an extra batch of headphone buds now
these are extremely important if you
plan on using these headphones
underwater as we know speakers use air
to produce sound without air there's no
way for the speaker vibrations to reach
your ear so this extra set of earbuds
traps a little pocket of air between
your ear and the headphone speaker
allowing you to hear underwater now this
does quiet the sound ever so slightly I
had to turn my headphones up all the way
but it does still work if you try and
wear the regular earbuds with the hole
your headphones will still be waterproof
it just doesn't have air to transfer the
sound and you won't be able to hear
anything at all the air pocket earbuds
are extremely important the microUSB
charging cable plugs into the charging
dock and then the little pins on the
dock match up with the contact points on
the Left headphone to charge this is
part of the waterproof feature there is
an LED indicator on the dock that
indicates when the headphones are fully
charged and that takes about 2 hours or
so
I have tried quite a few wireless
headphones in the past when comparing
the wave ports to some of the big boys
like the power beats the beats have a
similar behind-the-ear design and weigh
about the same but the behind the head
wire design of the wave ports make it
slightly more comfortable and get the
ear buds a bit deeper into your ear and
since your ear is sealed off the base of
the wave ports comes through a lot more
than the base on the beats the
underarmor JBL headphones are another
favorite of mine
they also seal off your ear entirely but
since the JBL s do not have any over the
ear hooks they don't stay in quite as
well during running or lifting battery
life and bluetooth connectivity distance
are pretty much the same across all of
the headphone
I've been wearing the headphones around
for the last few days getting a feel for
the sound when not in use they'll sit
secure on my neck and don't fall out
when I'm bitching or lifting weights
like the JBL Under Armour's do and the
behind the neck wire gently keeps things
snug unlike the long loose ribbon on the
beats that catches and tugs of my ears
every time I turn my head and most
importantly they do not bounce out when
I am running I spend more time out of
the water than in it so the daily
usability factor of the headphones is
more important than the waterproof
feature for me but since the whole point
of the waterproof headphones is the
waterproof part let's test them out in
some water now wave for claims that the
headphones are ipx7
which means that they can be underwater
for 30 minutes at a depth of 1 meter I'm
not the best of following rules so I
took off my arm floaties and swam to the
deep end of the pool
Bluetooth does not work underwater so
Spotify or Pandora is out of the
question but since the headphones have a
gigabytes of internal memory my phone
does not need to be nearby
at this point I do have the water buds
attached the ones with a little air
pocket inside so the sound is a little
bit quieter than normal but definitely
still audible the headphones stayed on
well enough to the general floating and
swimming around but fell off if I ever
pushed away from the wall
I imagine wearing one of the little
rubber hair caps would help keep them in
place but I'm fresh out of hair caps at
the moment these headphones work great
in the shower or for a water aerobics
class but if they fall off they will
sink to the bottom of the pool now one
of my qualms with the water-resistant
Galaxy s7 is that the motherboard was
not coated with a hydrophobic spray and
therefore missing an important layer of
protection wave port didn't exactly give
me permission to take these apart but
here we go
remember I'm only doing this as a
demonstration and to verify advertising
like I always do if you open these
headphones at all you will lose any
waterproof capabilities and warranty and
all of that good stuff
once the speaker cap is off we can see
the shiny circuit board and speaker
wires and the internal memory card if I
drop any water on the components it will
immediately run off the board
leaving it completely dry unlike on the
galaxy s7 where the water would cling to
the uncoated circuit board and not run
off so this board is indeed coated with
the hydrophobic spray and with that you
are definitely safe to use them in the
rain the pool the shower or anywhere
else that they might get wet pretty
impressive now are these going to be my
favorite headphones ever time will tell
I usually decide which headphones to
wear as I'm walking out the door to the
gym I do know that these headphones will
hold their own against headphones that
are four times the price so thank you
wave port for setting these out to me
and I will leave all of the related
Kickstarter and product info down in the
video description if you are interested
in checking them out or curious and want
more information thanks for watching
hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
