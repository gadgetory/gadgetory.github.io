trace on to the board and not have to
you know measure everything out for each
half to do it I wasn't you know super
picky about it I just made the distances
between the circles the width of a pin
the distance is on the edge just the
width of the normal square you can see
that it just kind of fits right there
and on the end here as well and then as
far as the one of the circles to be two
inches in diameter see if we can focus
two inches in diameter and so I just use
the bottom of a just a normal cock a
little bottle right there so it fits in
so I just race that around and how I got
the two inches in diameter is because my
little beads that go across the center
of it
I'll show you so the other man called
boards that I've seen have enough beads
for or enough marbles to go across the
circle four times
that's just comic proportions you need
so we're just finishing rounding out the
dips in the board so I have a big lie
standing up over here
that I can shine in through this window
so I can see the lines and where they're
at so yeah so the the bit that I'm using
is called a half inch core box and then
it's just you know it just takes out the
inside of that and then I'll end up
probably sanding it down and then making
it all smooth you can see I have I've
cut it a little bit long here and here
so that when I get the other board I can
lay them on top of each other and then
just use a table saw to cut them the
exact same size that they're going to be
on then on the finished product
so before I start tracing this other
stencil with my last inside trace it on
this side of the board this time I'm
going to trace it on this side of the
board for here because what I want to do
is when the thing the board is going to
end up being like this so that's what
the whole Mancala board is going to look
like and it's going to be able to fold
over on top of itself but the reason I
need to cut it money to trim this side
to lengthen this side to length so if I
do it on this side when it folds over
the long end is still going to be over
here so it makes sense you got the long
end right here in the long guy on this
side because I'm doing it on the
opposite that way when I laid over top
of each other like this I can just run
this into the table saw and cut off the
same and um both sides and keeping you
the exact same length so I just took the
two boards laid them down on top of each
other and then slid them through the
table saw cutting off the same thickness
on both the top and the bottom board so
now they're both even so I'm going to do
now is the ends right there where the
hinge is going to be is too long so I'm
going to lay one off each other again
flip them around and then chop off right
here so you can see the difference
between this one which I've sanded out
I'm on the insides and this one which I
haven't so just getting rid of all these
little ridges and stuff
so right now I'm just placing the hinges
on it so I can you know get a get an
idea of where everything is going to
line up so with the as far as I'd align
the hinge is up and then I have a drill
dip that I take if you see the drill bit
right there if you line it up so that
when you put the screw behind it you can
barely see the threads behind the bit
and it makes putting in the screws a lot
easier and it won't when you put the
screw and it won't bolt the wood out
anywhere which is nice
we're just putting the stain on right
now just rubbing it on a rag I'm going
to sit for a couple minutes and then
wipe off all the extra I'm going to do
these two sides first wait a little bit
and then do the the top and bottom I'm
using this wood finish it's early
American alright nice have them stood up
and Ryan you can see the the holes from
the hardware that I pulled out so I can
stain it I said to Harbor in there so I
could line everything up right so I'll
let it dry here for a couple hours and
I'll put the hinges back on and
everything should be done and there it
is cut the little flying pieces inside
of it it's got plenty of room for more
as you can see from this beads really
then come up to the top of the board so
there's more than enough room when this
comes down and closes then when this
locks on top of there it keeps the whole
thing from opening
so if I lift up on the top word there's
no way that those novels are going to
come out of there that's it
