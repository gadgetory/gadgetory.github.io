repairing the iPhone 6s plus I'm
recording this particular video with my
note 5 I will also include a free pdf
screw chart to help keep your screws
organized the 6s and the 6s plus are
pretty much the same just a few
different screw locations I will link
all the tools and the replacement parts
in the video description right below
this video there are two screws at the
bottom these are pentalobe screws remove
those and then you can pry up around the
edge of the screen using a suction cup
and a pry tool make sure you are only
plying on the edge of the frame of the
phone and the edge of the frame of the
screen that way you're not going to put
any pressure on any components on the
inside there is a little bit of adhesive
around the edge of the screen once I
have a little bit of an opening I can
use my plastic pry tool and this will
keep from marring the edge of the metal
frame once you have it up high enough go
ahead and lift it up don't bend to past
90 degrees just yet there are some
gradual ribbon Cable's remove the five
screws around this metal plate and then
take off the metal plate and that will
expose these little ribbon cables these
are just like Legos unsnapped them from
the motherboard lift them up and put
them out of the way and then you can
separate the screen from the rest of the
device this is the screen right here
there are some components that we need
to remove like the home button and the
earpiece and front camera so let's get
started with that there's three screws
along the top that hold down this metal
plate remove that metal plate and that
exposes the front-facing camera as well
as the earpiece which we're going to set
off to the side on that PDF screw chart
the front sensors and the front
microphone going to pull that off here
is the top component I will link these
replacement parts in the video
description there's two screws holding
down the home button remove that and
then unsnap this little Lego connector
right there and then you can pop the
home button away from the body be super
careful with this you want to reuse your
home button as much as possible Apple
has been handing out warning messages
and breaking people's phones who have to
switch the home button so be very very
careful there are three screws along the
side one at the top and then three
screws along this other side and that's
for this back metal plate that rests
against the pressure sensor for the
screen and here is the 3d touch
component if at all possible you want to
buy a replacement screen with the 3d
touch already attached this is the 3d
touch on top of the LCD which is
attached to these glass screen of the
phone and this is the whole screen unit
that you
be purchasing we're going to go ahead
and put the metal plate on your
replacement screen that you purchased
that will include those links down in
the video description below get all
seven screws attached to the metal plate
and then put the same home button that
you took off onto the foam there's this
little pin that helps you guide it into
place and then take your little Lego
connector and push that down as well
you'll feel it click in but the metal
plate down with its two screws and then
if you took off these little plastic
components from your old screen some new
screens come with them already installed
so it just depends on where you got your
screen from and then you can line up the
microphone with this little plastic pin
at the top there get the sensors in
place and then you can take your
earpiece and put that down making sure
the little niblet is down tucked inside
of that little hole and then each of
these little gold springs will line up
with the gold circles on that little
ribbon cable it looks a little messy and
complicated but it sits down pretty well
once you get them all lined up here's
the metal plate get that down and put
those three screws back in then you can
take your ribbon cables line them up and
then click those down into place just
like little Legos all three of them and
before I put the metal plate back on I
just want to test it and make sure it
works if you have any lines running
through your screen or if it's gray or
discolored you might want to try
reconnecting those ribbon cables again
there's a chance that one of them is not
sitting quite right everything's looking
good so I'm going to turn off my phone
again and then install that metal plate
get the five screws back into place and
we're good to go I'm going to line up
the top of the screen first or these
little plastic grooves that slide into
the metal frame of the phone and then I
press down evenly on both sides snapping
it down into place all the way around
the edge make sure you get your bottom
two pentalobe screws in and you're set
the only questions leave in the comments

Instagram and subscribe if I helped you
out thanks ton for watching hope see you
