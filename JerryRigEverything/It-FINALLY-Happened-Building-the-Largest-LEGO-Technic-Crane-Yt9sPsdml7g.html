mom I've made it I have a sponsored
video with Lego look at the size of this
thing
it only took 600 videos worth of
mentions to get it just like a little
Lego done clips like a little Lego like
a little Lego Lego style ribbon
connector both unsnap like little Legos
Lego lega lega lega lega lega lega lega
occasions the squeaky wheel gets the
grease I need an extra couple hands for
this video
you might remember cambrie she's here to
help let's get started so this is one of
Legos bigger sets this is called the
rough terrain crane and it's one of the
Lego technics which is a slightly more
complex system of Legos you know for for
people older than just children the
4,000 pieces we might we might be here a
while we can't rebound what we think is
the manual have any end pages back we're
barely three step one but we already
have some pretty intricate designs going
and I'm not sure how this all fits
together just yet but all of these
little different parts that we're
building just snap in together like a
little Lego
like a little Lego so we've been at it
for about two hours or so this is the
first instruction booklet and we are
this far into it
but it's been fun I feel like it doesn't
feel like it's been two hours I lost
track of time we've done 143 steps 144
pretty proud of this it's big but it's
gonna be like 10 times this size so I'm
excited to see what it looks like
finished not exactly sure where this
goes and the whole scheme of things but
it should all come together in the next
couple hours on to step number two back
up to there so this right here I'm
assuming is the front portion of the
crane so we have this gear right here
which turns the the steering and the
wheels will be attached on either side
here and as the wheels are spinning you
can see the gears inside as kind of like
a differential so if one wheel let's say
this wheel up here is stopped spinning
the other one can still function all by
itself and they can work independently
of each other that's the the purpose of
a differential all those gears in the
little housing right there pretty sweet
okay so it might not look like we have
accomplished much with the bags there's
still a lot more steps left
we just finished number four but the
cool part is we just mounted this motor
and you can see the individual pistons
right there inside and so as the motor
turns you can see the Pistons moving
here's the fan in front but you can also
see where the wheels mount right here
they're turning as the motor pumps
okay so we've been here for about seven
hours working on this Lego project and
we've gotten pretty far it doesn't quite
look like a crane yet this is what it's
supposed to look like this is where
we're at right now it's kind of like a
huge jigsaw puzzle and I think we've
made it through half the pieces but the
last couple of pieces are gonna probably
be the trickiest because they're all the
same color what's nice though is that we
have these two massive books and they're
pretty detailed this is the first book
that we're in and we haven't gotten to
that second book yet yeah even though
we're not through the first book I still
think we're probably halfway there
just because by the time you get the
second book you have less steps less
pictures because you're adding on to the
whole structure so after working on this
for seven hours it's definitely not like
a difficult project but it is very
intricate and it keeps your mind and
your hands active the whole time which
brings me to one of my favorite quotes
that I've ever heard by Harrison Ford
anyone who stops learning is old weather
at 20 or 80 anyone who keeps learning is
young the greatest thing in life is to
keep your mind young and I think
building one of these LEGO Technic
projects is a way to keep your mind
active and to keep your mind young the
wheels feel like they're pretty
heavy-duty rubber so it should be
interesting when we see them finally on
the whole contraption we're making
progress so when you turn this little
knob in the back it rotates all four
tires at the same time also fun little
fact as its rolling forward and backward
you can see the Pistons inside of the
engine piston
firing firing is the word of flame we're
done so one interesting thing that
translates into real-life construction
equipment and traffic cones are these
these indicators so if you see when they
go on a piece of construction equipment
like so they indicate by slanting down
which direction you should walk or which
direction you should drive your car to
avoid the dangerous obstacles in the
middle so it's nice to see that Lego is
translating these real-life stickers
onto their project alright this is day
three hour how many hours we've been
doing this 11 hours and we should be
able to finish today we're on step ten
and a half
just to be clear we're halfway through
step 10 there's no so on this crane
there is some powered movement and it
looks like it's all powered off with
this one motor back here using a couple
different switches like this guy right
here switching you know to drop the legs
down or to raise the boom and this motor
connects to this battery pack right here
if you remember those old-school Lego
Mindstorms it has the same style of
connector there's these little metal
bits inside of the Lego plug and when it
connects right here the whole thing is
powered and you can go forward and
reverse so really to see how all of the
gears and contraptions inside of this
LEGO Technic set work together when the
motor and the battery pack are working
so we're about to install the lift cable
so it's powered on right now we have the
battery pack here the motor and then
this right here is a switch so we're
gonna bring that over to the side this
right here is a switch so we're gonna
bring that back and now the battery is
on and we're reeling the line in on this
spool all automatically what's cool as
you can see all the gears turning inside
and I imagine if I were to switch this
it would now drop the lever out and
unspool the spool pretty sweet and I
think it's gonna be more challenging to
put it all together when it's all one
color so we're done with step number ten
and we have the whole base over the
whole base put up and I think now we're
gonna build the arm for the crane itself
so still like the interior stuff but it
should still it should look much more
like a crane when we're done with it so
we're 12 hours into it on step 11
cambrie right now is wiring up the the
cable attempting to there's a series of
pulleys that she's threading it through
all right three hours later we finally
have the the arm of the crane done down
okay little burger instruction at its
finest all-terrain we are currently on
step nine hundred and sixty seven and we
will be adding some exterior some
clothing to the crane
working
now that we finished one of these I kind
of want the whole suite of construction
equipment ladies a pretty cool stuff all
right we are finished how many days how
many days that diggeth 17 hours five
days it was worth it 17 hours of
entertainment a week a Lego had eleven
hundred and seventy steps but the steps
were very detailed if this fell apart
right now I don't think I'd be able to
reconstruct it but with the step-by-step
instructions it did make it a lot easier
if I do this again the crane is pretty
sweet and the other construction
equipment but Lego also had a few cars
one is a blue Bugatti which I think
would be awesome to construct so if you
do end up buying one of these LEGO
Technic sets the price factors into the
entertainment of building it as well as
having something afterwards you get to
play with and have like as a piece of
art it's kind of like educational
entertainment if you're interested
seeing what kind of LEGO Technic sets
Lego has to offer I'll put a link down
in the description let me know in the
comments which one you think is coolest
and which one I should do next and I
lean in towards the Bugatti maybe I can
talk cambrian it coming over for that
one it looks cool you have any questions
leave in the comments like ice cream or
something thanks for shopping bye I'll
see you around know also know how we do
it what is it thanks a ton for watching
we'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
