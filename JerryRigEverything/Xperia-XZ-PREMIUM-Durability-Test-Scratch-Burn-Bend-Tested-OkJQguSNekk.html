past and even though none have failed my
test yet they have not been my favorite
as far as build quality goes Sony's had
cracking plastic side rails a plastic
camera lens so it'll be interesting to
see how this new X Z premium holds up
Sony released be regular XD in 2016
which I already tested I figured the XE
premium would use the same body style
and just spruce up the specs but it's
actually a completely different phone in
size and in power which makes it much
more interesting let's get started
the biggest difference between the X Z
and the X Z premium is that the premium
has the world's first 4k HDR enabled
display there isn't many places that
supply 4k HDR content yet but for people
who have an Amazon Prime membership they
can access the Amazon Prime video
library which does have 4k HDR content
even if your 4k is an HDR though 4k is
still 4k and that's impressive all by
itself the most scratch test on the
Gorilla Glass 5 of the EXCI premium
scores at level 6 that sentence probably
sounds weird to someone who's never seen
my videos but the important thing is
that it's perfectly in line with these
Samsung's
and the iPhones when it comes to scratch
resistance the most scratch resistant
Vaughn I've ever tested it's still the
sapphire screened u ultra that scored at
level eight a screen protector is always
a good idea but coins keys and razor
blades won't damage this display there
is no home button on the front of the
phone but we do have dual front-facing
speakers inside the speaker that does
have a vinyl light grill covering the
top I usually prefer metal on a phone
but at least these won't fall out even
when I try to pull them they stay in
place the front camera is protected by
the same Gorilla Glass 5 so no worries
about that scratching just like with the
Samsung Galaxy s8 this phone does not
hide fingerprints very well the back
panel is made out of the same Gorilla
Glass 5 which means that our class with
Jerry is canceled on this phone but we
might be able to turn the phone clear
during the teardown video if you know
this phone survives that long the flash
is protected under that glass solid
design choice the rear camera lens is
also made of glass and that's good news
because Sony was actually one of the few
companies using a plastic camera lens on
their z5 premium back in 2015 I'm glad
to see that this XE premium is using a
premium lens material now here's we run
into our first non premium feature the
plastic side rails they do feel like
plastic when holding the phone you can
see the color difference between the top
coating and the plastic underneath the
buttons are a more premium feeling metal
though which is great the fingerprint
scanner can scratch but remains mostly
intact I'll test out the functionality
here in a second one thing I do like
about this phone is a dedicated camera
button
it's nice when a phone company as
extra button to your phone that's
actually functional the fingerprint
scanner is still totally working even
with the major scratches I did too with
my razor blade it still registers my
fingerprint and unlocks the phone every
single time so no worries there one cool
thing about the Xperia XE premium is
that it is water-resistant you can see
the rubber ring around the dual SIM card
tray there's room for an SD card in here
too if you remember the iPhone 7 is ip67
this phone the XE premium takes it one
step farther with an ip68 rating which
means it's more water resistant than the
iPhone 7 is and what makes it more
impressive is that this phone has more
gold glory about Google front casement
speakers an SD card slot and a premium
headphone jack so thumbs up to Sony for
not removing features and still being
able to score higher on a water
resistance test than Apple there is
metal by the headphone jack as well as
down here by the bottom of the phone
next to the USB state charging port now
one of the biggest selling points of
this phone to me is the new screen it
still is an IPS display that's slightly
larger than the original xperia x II but
instead of a 1080p resolution it comes
in full 4k with the high dynamic range
built in pretty impressive on a smart
phone and if you light it on fire it'll
last 10 seconds before the pixels turn
off you know I'm just here answering the
questions that nobody's asking maybe
someday I'll find a purpose to the burn
test the pixels do recover though which
is convenient and now the ultimate test
and structural integrity the bin test if
you're the type of person who goes
outside you'll eventually see a phone in
someone's back pocket the good news with
this phone is that the phone will remain
in one piece if it ever gets
accidentally set on no matter what
direction is flex from it won't snap in
half like the next bit Robin nor will
the screen pop off like the BlackBerry
key one and the best news is is that the
plastic side rails will not crack on
this phone like they did on both of my
other previous Sony phone tests the z5
and the normal Sony XZ cracked this XV
premium has a huge increase in the
quality of plastic use for the sides
this is definitely the most well built
Sony phone that I have ever tested and
it's also one of the most requested
international phones that have ever had
on my channel I'm interested to know
what country you are watching from let
me know in the comments and tell me if
there are any phones you want to see
durability tested on my channel I'll
test them just like I did with this
xperia x
premium it'll be tuned to see what it
looks like on the inside during the
teardown video and interesting to see if
we can make the back glass clear like I
did on the Galaxy s8 hit that subscribe
button and make sure the notifications
are turned on so you don't miss that
video and come hang out with me on
Twitter I'll be waiting for you thanks
for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
