the mail today this is the explorers
edition charcoal color so we're going to
see what's in the box so right here on
the inside of the top of the box so you
turn on by pressing the power button
adjust the nose bridge and position the
display to see the whole screen clearly
along the top of the box this this
smokey paper has just glued very gently
along the edges and here's the glass
itself
initial feeling is I'm surprised at how
light it is it is you know slightly more
heavy along this side obviously that it
has all the components this piece of
crystal right here is actually pretty
interesting I might never noticed in the
pictures that I've seen before the the
diagonal angle inside of that where the
lens reflects the display from this end
right here
pretty interesting this this part right
here almost feels plastic even though I
know they say that it's metal it has a
plastic feel to it does flex a little
bit here and there apparently you can
adjust these just by bending them a
little bit says the display should fit
just above your field of vision here
inside of the box it says listen so this
is where the speaker actually connects
with your skull there's no speakers on
it just communicates through vibrations
got your on/off button and then a touch
panel along the side and then you have a
camera button right here which actually
starts and stops the camera taking
pictures and videos so anyway let's see
what's in the rest of the box it's also
got the same microUSB charging port that
most cellphones have nowadays grab this
tab and lift up
this pouch has been crafted using
Japanese microfiber made from recycled
materials designed to be both light and
durable take this with you protect your
glass and accessories so this bag right
here so the little headphones that it
comes with go ahead and just pull this
out
so this little earbud apparently this
just sits right inside of your ear and
you can roll up or hold down the cord
interesting little bag it kind of feels
like felt along the outsides and it's a
hard plastic down here at the bottom to
protect the glasses it sits inside of
there I guess and here we have a charger
for it and the data cable to charge it
up and then right here
there's like we had a few more pieces
for the nose bridge and a set of
instructions and that is it I plan on
messing around this for the next couple
weeks I'll make another video here in
about a week or so when I get a feel for
how it works and eventually I hope to do
a teardown on this plan on taking it
apart and showing all the internal
components and how it's all put together
anyway if you have any questions or if
you have anything you want me to test
out for you go ahead and leave those in
the comments below and I'll try to get
around to them as many as possible don't
forget to like if this video is
interesting and don't forget to
subscribe I plan on putting up quite a
few videos in the future
along with the glass itself it also came
with an extra lens for the sunglasses
as that same felt like material that the
other bag is made out of all right you
see this little tab on the back if you
put it between the nose bridge and just
kind of twist it up into place it locks
on the lenses to the front of the glass
and there you go overall pretty handy
little device it'll be interesting to
see how it all plays out anyway if you
have any questions leave in the comments
below don't forget to like this video is
interesting to you and don't forget to
subscribe right now obviously the price
tag of these things is a little bit tall
but we'll see if it's justifiable thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
