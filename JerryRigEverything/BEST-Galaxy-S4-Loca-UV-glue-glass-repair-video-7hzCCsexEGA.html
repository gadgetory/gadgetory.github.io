my Samsung Galaxy S4, just the glass, screen
replacement video.
In this one I’m going to show you how to
use the Loca glue to fix your phone in a more
permanent way.
I still like to use a little bit of the double
sided tape to help keep the glue on top of
the LCD instead of having it bleed into the
Home button and the ear piece.
So now that I have the tape on there I’m
going to go ahead and use some denatured alcohol
to get rid of any finger prints and dust and
excess glue that’s still on the screen.
And then here’s the Loca glue.
This is a UV activated optical adhesive.
For such a scientific name, it is pretty inexpensive
and easy to use.
The best way I can explain how to apply the
glue is to mentally divide the phone into
four separate parts.
The bottom segment will be the legs.
You’re going to gently squeeze the glue
out into legs.
The middle two segments will be the body.
Just go straight up the phone.
And then the top segment, the top fourth of
the phone will be the arms spread out towards
the corners.
And then you’re going to come back and just
do a little line across the center.
This is more than enough glue.
You actually can get away with doing a little
bit less than this.
The goal is to not have too much excess though.
You don’t want the glue to flow into the
ear piece and the home button.
If there are bubbles in your glue, now is
the time to get it out.
You can just kind of poke it with your tweezers,
dry them off, and then poke it again to pop
any bubbles.
There’s no rush at this point because the
glue’s not going to do anything until the
UV light gets on it.
I’m going to go ahead and get rid of the
plastic on my, on the glass.
I’ll put a link for this in the video description
below as well.
Make sure not to touch the back of the glass
or else you’ll have some permanent fingerprints
on your phone.
Make sure the Home button and the ribbon cable
for the Menu button is intact.
And then I’m going to put my tweezers up
at the top of the phone and then my hand down
at the bottom and gently press down.
Make sure you’re ready to do this cuz once
the screen touches the UV glue, you’re committed.
Go as slow as possible.
The slower you go the less bubbles there will
be.
As you can see here I kind of speed up towards
the center and I’m going to get three massive
bubbles right in the middle of my screen which
is very unfortunate for me, but lucky for
you guys because you get to see how to get
bubbles out of your screen if it ever happens.
Now in the ideal situation there would be
no bubbles here and all I would have to do
is apply, you know, minor pressure to the
center of the screen to get the glue to flow
out to the edges.
This is normal and as soon as the glue would
touch the edges, then I just plop the UV light
on there which I’ll show you in a second,
and the glue would harden in about a minute
and you’d be good to go.
But since there are some bubbles in the center
I have two options.
One is to leave them, not a big deal; you
can’t really see the bubbles when the screen
is on anyway.
Or two, I can massage the bubbles out to the
sides and get rid of them that way.
So as I press down on the screen, the bubbles
kind of run away from my finger.
But you can also see on the sides of the phone
that the UV glue is kind of leaking.
Out of the sides of the phone is not that
big of a deal.
You just want to make sure that the UV glue
isn’t getting into the earpiece or the front
facing camera slot because it will make all
of your pictures blurry and foggy.
Remember that any glue that is not touched
by the UV light will remain liquid.
So any of the glue that is underneath the
black portion of the screen will still bleed
out later on.
Anyway, now that I have the bubbles out of
the phone I’m going to go ahead and start
it with the UV light.
I’m keeping a little bit of pressure on
the screen just so that bubbles don’t start
to seep in from the sides.
It’ll take about 20 or 30 seconds for the
glue to become tacky enough that it’ll hold
the screen in place.
Once it’s tacky enough I can set the light
directly down on top of the phone and give
it about another 2 or 3 minutes while the
glue completely cures.
To get rid of the excess glue on the outside
of the screen, I find that it’s easier to
start with a dry paper towel instead of using
the alcohol.
Once the glue is off with the dry paper towel,
then you can use the alcohol after that.
You can see that I have a little bit of glue
seeping through the Home button here.
Once I get that glue just pressed out it’ll
work just fine.
The glue does not affect how the phone works
at all.
Here’s the UV light just kind of sealing
up anything else that would have leaked through
on the back.
And that’s it.
Now you have a completely working phone.
The optical adhesive does turn out very well.
It’s just like new.
Thanks for watching.
