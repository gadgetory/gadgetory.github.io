we're gonna talk about two methods of
securing your stuff
one is this high-tech fingerprint
scanning padlock from tap lock we'll see
if we can physically hack our way into
it and see how it works and the second
is securing yourself online or on your
cell phone with a VPN huge thanks to
Nord VPN for sponsoring this video let's
get started unlocking smart phones with
fingerprints has been around for years
now it's effective and pretty darn
efficient today we have a padlock that
can use a fingerprint unlock the tap
lock one it seems pretty high-tech it's
been seen on CNN unbox therapy and
raised over $300,000 on IndieGoGo last
year before going into production and
like always on my channel we're gonna
see how it works from the inside you
might be thinking to yourself hey Jerry
it seems pretty cool why shouldn't I buy
it well let me tell you the little guy
has a proprietary charging port and a
power button down at the bottom nothing
wrong with that yet one click of the
power button activates the fingerprint
scanner which allows you to scan one of
your fingers and unlock the lock pretty
simple right I'm a fan of it so far the
little contraption can hold 500
different fingerprints and has a
one-year battery life it's even ip66
water-resistant so as long as your
treasure chest isn't locked up
underwater it'll still work just fine in
the rain or the elements thumbs up for
all of that so far plus the whole thing
is made for metal which makes you think
it would be hard to get inside of but
sit tight and let's find out scratching
up the face revealed the whole front of
the lock with solid metal and the sides
are also metal and even the back of the
tap lock is metal with no visible
openings or so I thought at first it
didn't appear that the back was
removable it wouldn't pry off when I
tried before I break out the heavy
artillery though and review this from
the inside let's scratch the fingerprint
scanner a few initial scratches and the
lock still opens just fine
you can hear the little motor inside
motoring up the shackle and unlocking
the padlock even after a few more
scratches the lock still functions so
far it appears to be solidly constructed
durable and secure or so at least that's
what I thought let's keep going I broke
out the dremel to gauge the thickness of
the metal but trying to cut through the
stainless steel
and advertised anti shim and anti pride
assign my dremel just wasn't making it
through the body even dribbling through
the fingerprint scanner itself there was
zero weights for a hacker to unlock the
lock and steal your stuff like your bike
or your sweaty gym clothes from this
side it was only after I brought out the
big guns that I find the fatal flaw in
tap locks design
you devout here that I realized and back
panel of the lock wasn't secured at all
right next to that sliced in half with
the mi on battery it just falls away
from the law apparently I was opening it
wrong before
it doesn't pry off it's a twist to
unlock like a jar I couldn't see that
until I had a view from the inside I'll
be testing my twist off theory in a
second digging deeper there were three
normal Phillips head screws on the back
half of the lock and once those were
unscrewed the face of the lock fell away
revealing more normal Phillips head
screws and a metal plate covering the
motor once those were gone and I got
inside I can lift up the locking bar in
the center and the shackle comes
completely free from the housing
exposing your goods to the world if my
theory is correct anyone with a simple
screwdriver could hack this lock in
under 30 seconds so should we try it
yeah we should I went out and bought
another $100 brand-new tap lock
available on new egg and Best Buy opened
up the box and twisted off the back of
the lock like an expensive cookie jar
using a GoPro mount revealing a battery
and three screws and in the space of
about 30 seconds I had the front panel
off and it's screws removed and the
locking bar up and out of the lock
housing and all of my stuff that was
previously locked up in the shackle is
now not my stuff anymore obviously a
thief walking around with bolt cutters
could totally steal your bike in about
30 seconds as well but no one is ever
going to call the cops on a guy with the
screwdriver this lock just doesn't do a
good job of locking tap lock could
easily fix this problem by welding the
back shut or even using proprietary
screws inside instead of a normal
Phillips head I'll be more than happy to
make a follow-up video if tap lock
decides to fix these issues with the
next version of their lock as of right
now though the lock costs $100 and can
easily be hacked in 30 seconds by anyone
with the normal screwdriver and a GoPro
mount so I just can't really recommend
anyone buy it
bad guys are always gonna find a way to
figure out how to do bad stuff so it's
good to find out from the good guys if
there's a flaw or not in the system and
speaking of good guys rated number one
Virtual Private Network by PC Magazine
is Nord VPN they had nothing to do with
this lock situation I seriously thought
this thing was going to be fine a
virtual
network does a couple different things
one it encrypts your network traffic
from one location to the other
so your information is untrackable when
you're on a public Wi-Fi like an airport
or hotel everyone knows that Virtual
Private Networks or VPNs can be used on
computers but they can also be used on
cell phones like androids and iPhones
and windows phones and with Nord VPN it
can secure six devices simultaneously
your computer your laptop and all of
your cell phones and since Nord VPN has
over 4,000 servers in over 62 different
countries it can appear like your
traffic's coming from anywhere and you
can get around country specific
censorship laws like in China in the
Middle East or if you want to access
YouTube video that's not available in
your country you can just jump on a
different server for a totally risk-free
trial of Nord VPN you can use discount
code jerry-rigged and get a seventy
seven percent discount off of a
three-year plan I think it comes down to
like two dollars and seventy five cents
a month WWN or VPN slash jerry-rigged
and if you don't like it at least you
were protected for those thirty days and
their 24/7 customer support will take
care of you either way it's probably a
lot more secure than this thing was the
only questions leading down to the
comments and if taplok ever does any
upgrades or updates to their lock to
make it more secure you'll find out here
first thanks ton for watching and I'll
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
