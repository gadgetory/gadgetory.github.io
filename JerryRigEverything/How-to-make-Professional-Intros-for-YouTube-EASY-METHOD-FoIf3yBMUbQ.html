regards to starting a YouTube channel is
how do I get professional-looking intros
made for my videos and it's actually
pretty simple
I'll start with the easiest and the
cheapest method I get intros from a
website called video blocks they have
customizable After Effects templates
that you can modify specifically for
your channel
I spoke with video blocks and I got a
$50 discount for you by using the link
in the video description so huge thank
you to them for sponsoring this video
here on their website they have over 2
million different stock videos and After
Effects templates but today we're just
interested in the After Effects
templates you can hover over all the
little preview windows and check the
style that will fit your YouTube channel
or your project the best I'm going to
choose this amazing beast looking intro
because it looks cool and because there
are multiple variables that I can walk
you through it's actually really really
simple so don't stress out just yet over
here on the right hand side you can see
which version of After Effects you need
to work with the file and if there are
any plugins needed this one doesn't need
any extra plugins so I'll hit that
download button and that will get the
after effects file onto my computer I
just saved the zip file to my computer
and then extracted the files onto my
desktop so I can open them first thing
you want to do is jump into the readme
just to see if there are any extra tips
from the template creator this readme
file has the font type and the
instructions on how to change the text
in the intro because unless your YouTube
channel is called fantastic beasts
you're probably going to want to modify
the text a bit and now for the fun stuff
I'm going to click into the after
effects file and this will open up Adobe
After Effects I am using this cc version
and this is included with the Adobe
Premiere that you use to edit your main
videos I can scrub through the clip with
that little blue bar down in the
timeline just to make sure everything
looks okay and then to edit the text in
the intro I'll jump up to the left hand
side and double click then I can move to
the center window and double click again
to modify what is written there you can
literally put anything you want the
everything part of this logo is looking
a little big so I'll jump to the right
hand side and adjust the size of the
text just like you would when you're
editing a Word document
to preview the file again I can click
here and then it'll show up as a preview
of the final version thumbs up for how
simple this process is now this intro
has more than one place for text so I'll
jump back into that
textedit box and click the edit text to
slot this will open the text box that
appears after the main text I'll add a
little tagline here and then shrink the
font down just a bit so it will fit the
screen completely and then for the last
section of the video I'd like a website
or a YouTube channel name remember that
this is just one of the thousands of
templates on video blocks so each one
will be a little bit different but they
will all be pretty easy to work with
that's kind of the point of a template
you have unlimited downloads with your
subscription so you can replace and
change your video intro as often as you
want and if you ever cancel your
subscription you still own all of your
files and can use them forever you can
also drop the preview resolution down so
if your computer is struggling with the
graphics that will help it display
correctly and then to render the video
of full quality head up to the file then
export and then add to render queue down
here in the bottom box make sure that
it's set the best settings and then you
can click the output and go to QuickTime
Havey I would work too but here in the
QuickTime settings you have h.264 and
that is what YouTube likes to receive
I'll just keep my audio on the AAC and
then click the output location and set
the location of the finished file and
then I can finally click render this
whole process took about 10 minutes and
I was able to create a pretty
professional-looking intro there are a
lot of youtubers out there using this
same method for their videos and it's
nice because you can use your files
commercially for YouTube contests
whatever you want you own the footage if
you personally are an After Effects
master you can also submit your own
templates to video blocks for other
people to use and you can make money
each time someone downloads your
template here are some other intros I've
made in the past if you need a very
specific design or intro for your
YouTube channel
you can always hire someone to make an
intro specifically for you but that
might cost anywhere from a hundred to
five hundred dollars depending on the
complexity and the artists you hire
hopefully I was able to save you some
money with this video if nothing else at
least now you know how most of youtube
gets their intros if you want to learn
more about editing videos on Adobe
Premiere check out my workflow video and
if you have any questions leave them

for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
