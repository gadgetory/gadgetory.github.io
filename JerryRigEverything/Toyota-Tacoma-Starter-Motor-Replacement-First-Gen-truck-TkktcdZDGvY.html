replace the starter motor on a 1998
Toyota Tacoma the starter motor is
actually here underneath the passenger
side wheel well right back there make
sure that when you take the wheel off to
get access to that starter motor behind
the wheel well that you support the
truck at more than one point so you have
a backup we don't want any flat
do-it-yourselfers out there if you look
at the replacement starter that I just
bought there's only two bolts that hold
it in place right here on the bottom and
then up here at the top as well and when
you're looking at it from the inside you
see that bottom bolt down there it
actually comes through the other side
and screws into the starter motor so
there's nothing to ratchet off on this
side you just have to take the bolt out
from the other end so now I'm going to
go underneath and show you what the
bolts look like coming into the back of
the starter there's the wheel well
coming underneath the truck and we got
the transmission here so the first bolt
is going to be this guy right here it's
a fourteen millimeter so undo that guy
and then way up in there right here
there's another fourteen millimeter bolt
that we're going to take out as well so
I'm going to unscrew both of those bolts
pull them out this one's not going to
have room to pull out so I'm just going
to bring it up up until this bracket and
then it should be unscrewed all the way
from the other side and then the starter
motor has two connections on you can see
this guy right there I'm going to take
off this other side right here that's
just clipped in that I just undo from
the back side to get a little more
leverage with your wrenches you can see
it's up there attached to the bolt and I
have two wrenches hooked together and I
can move them like this I'll give me an
extra foot of leverage on that bolt so I
can break it loose so before I get too
crazy disconnecting things on the
starter I'm going to go ahead and remove
the battery connection the negative
battery terminal so it doesn't start
sparking on me or anything when I'm
working below it and now that that's
done I've already popped off this little
plastic piece it was sitting just like
this up underneath the starter on that
little bolt right there that's a 14
millimeter so I'm going to unscrew that
and pop off that connection from the
starter
and then there's one more connection on
the other side you can barely see it
just plugs right into this little
plastic connection on the starter so I'm
going to undo that as well that'll get
rid of all the electrical components
from the starter and allow me to pull it
out from the transmission there's a shot
with it disconnected got that nut off
and then a little wire just pops down
off of that bottom part the little
plastic connection is down there with it
as well that's popped off the starter
remember that if you try to do this with
your vehicle hot you're gonna have a bad
time because these things are right up
right next to the bolts now I've got
those two bolts out on the sides of the
starter that hole for the starter is
pretty worthless because the starter
comes out better down here anyway so I
pulled it down out by the axle and that
is it so there we go now I'm going to
take the other starter put it back in
next to the axle and try to mount that
boy back into place new starter is in
place bolt it in got the wire to wire
connections down at the bottom I'll put
it in place make sure that you don't
over tighten that bolt down at the
bottom or that bottom connection will
just twist right off and you'll have to
get back in there and attach a new
starter so make sure you don't over
tighten that at all battery connections
screwed on again we'll give it a test
start
and we're good now I need you just put
the wheel back on and we are good to go
if you have any questions about the
painted calipers or the LED light bar or
the truck box I will link each of those
