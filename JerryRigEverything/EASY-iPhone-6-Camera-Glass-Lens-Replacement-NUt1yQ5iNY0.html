replace your glass camera lens on your
iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 plus it's the exact
same process for both phones grab a heat
gun or your mother's hairdryer and heat
up the back of the phone right next to
the camera lens until it is too hot to
touch what you're doing right now is
melting the glue that holds that metal
lens into the back of the phone it's
going to make it easier to remove the
lens with a razor blade later on
now remember razor blades are sharp so
keep your fingers out of the way you're
going to take the razor blade and slide
it around the lens and eventually pry
out a little bit and the lens will pop
out of the phone here's the old lens
that I just took out of the phone so if
your lens is cracked or scratched or
shattered you can easily replace it and
take a new lens which is this guy right
here I will link these in the video
description below they come in all kinds
of colors the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6
plus lenses are different sizes so make
sure you get the right one that matches
your phone I have super glue here the
slope drying kind this one takes about
10 minutes to dry I didn't want it to
stick to my fingers during the install
process taking a toothpick and kind of
wrapping it around the edges to get the
glue all over the outside making sure
not to get any glue inside of the lens
or that will mess with your pictures so
be super careful when you're pressing it
back into place make sure to never touch
the inside of the lens otherwise your
fingerprints or smudges will make your
pictures blurry later on so be careful
I'm going to press it into the phone and
hold it there for about five or ten
minutes while the glue dries and take
some practice pictures here to see the
quality of the new lens as you can see
from the pictures the camera is doing
just as good as it was with the old lens
so I'm pretty impressed with these parts
