charging port on the iPhone se it is
very similar to the iPhone 5s but it's a
little bit different and the charging
ports are not interchangeable so make
sure you buy the right one I will link
all the replacement parts in the video
description there are two pentalobe
screws down at the bottom remove those
and then using a suction cup and a thin
metal pry tool
lift up and pry gently between the
plastic frame of the screen and the
metal frame of the phone you can lift up
a little bit on the plastic edge of the
screen without damaging it don't pull it
too far away from the device because
there is a funky little ribbon cable
down here we're going to remove this
metal tab and then lift up on the tiny
little connection down at the bottom and
that will disconnect the home button
from around the charging port then you
can lift the screen up to the 90 degree
angle don't bend it past 90 degrees
remove these six screws and the two
metal plates on top of all these
connections we're going to unplug the
battery first so there's no power
coursing through the device and then
we're going to remove all the ribbon
cables that are attached to the screen
just unsnap those like little Legos
there is a ribbon cable down here by the
battery this is what the charging port
uses to connect to the motherboard there
are seven screws that actually hold the
charging port in place remove those but
keep your screws organized they are
different sizes and lengths and if you
misplace them it will be very bad for
your phone there is a little sticker on
top of the loudspeaker you might not
need to remove this I did just for fun
there's a little metal doohickey on the
bottom right of the loudspeaker as well
so if you lose that you know where it
goes there's a little round ribbon cable
that attaches to the motherboard and
snap that and the loudspeaker can pull
away from the phone this is the
loudspeaker you can see the two little
contact points on the bottom of it that
rest on top of the charging port ribbon
cable it's where it gets its signal from
the phone now the charging port can just
pull away from the device you can see a
lot of the sticky glue down there along
the bottom I think this adds to the
water resistance of the iPhone se here's
a charging port itself there might be
some parts that you need to transfer
over from your old charging port to your
new charging port like this little
rubber microphone channel I'm just going
to unstick the microphone from the
rubber part and then transfer that over
to my new charging port ribbon cable
just make sure that your new one looks
exactly like the old one before you go
to install it same thing goes for this
little metal bracket where
the home button plugs into the charging
port I'm going to stick my new charging
port down into place making sure that
the headphone jack is seated into it
this little slot on the frame you'll see
these screw holes line up once
everything is in its correct position
you shouldn't have to force anything
into place everything has its own little
slot once everything situated you can
slide the loudspeaker back into place
making sure that the left side of it is
tucked down underneath that little port
where the home button plugs into the
charging port sits underneath that and
sits underneath the motherboard as well
get a little sticker back into place
with this two little screw holes on
either side I'm also going to seat the
little round signal cable make sure you
get the seven screws back into place and
plug in the charging port now up here at
the top of the phone I'm going to
connect the screen but I'm not going to
screw in the metal plate yet we're going
to test it before I get to that part I'm
going to plug in the battery turn on the
phone and everything seems to be working
if you end up with grey lines or a white
colored screen there's a good chance
that your ribbon cables up at the top
aren't connected correctly just reseat
those and then try it again get those
six screws back into place once you get
the metal tabs down and then we're going
to try to get this little ribbon cable
seated correctly I'm going to use my
tweezers to line it up over the little
Lego type connection and then press it
down into place making sure it's snug
with my fingers and then getting the
little metal latch all up in there like
rocket surgery it is a big pain trying
to get all that connected I'm glad they
got away from this design with the
iPhone 6 and 6s once that's in and
connected we're going to go ahead and
take the top of the screen and line that
up with the frame tuck it in and then
you can continue down the sides of the
phone and clamp that down into place you
turn the phone on at this point make
sure everything works and then put those
two bottom screws into place if you have
any questions leave down in the comments
like this video if it helped you I have
done some fun videos recently besides
cell phone repair done a lot of
durability tests and even a fun rap
battle with the YouTube channel Kay face
TV the same guys who did the Harry
Potter Dark Lord funk videos go ahead
and check those out if you're bored
thanks dumb for watching hope see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
