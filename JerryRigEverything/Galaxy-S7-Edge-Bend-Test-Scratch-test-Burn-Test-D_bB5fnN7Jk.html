new Galaxy s7 edge on the table and
we're going to see how durable this
thing is and what situations you'll have
to watch out for in everyday life let's
start with the scratch test like always
I have a set of picks that help me
determine where the hardness of the
screen falls on Mohs scale of hardness I
gradually increase the hardness of the
picks until I can see scratches on the
screen now normal glass would fall
around the level 5 on Mohs scale
tempered glass like on the galaxy s7
edge is a tad bit harder you can see
that a level 6 makes a mark but a level
7 leaves a much deeper groove this is
pretty on par with most major cell
phones these days except for the Droid
turbo 2 which has a plastic shatterproof
screen that scratched at a level 3 you
can watch that video if you're
interested
lucky for us Samsung continued using a
glass camera lens this means that the
Linde is much more scratch resistant
unlike the plastic lenses on the
blackberry Prive and the Sony z5 premium
give the Galaxy s7 edge a thumbs up for
the glass camera lens now the little
heart rate sensor and flash gives mode
to the side are protected with a plastic
covering definitely not as important as
the camera lens itself but at least now
you know it was the same way with the
note 5 if these get scratched up it's
not a big deal the side of the phone is
solid aluminum so it won't chip or
discolor like the older notes or the
plastic Galaxy s5 now the back panel of
the phone is glass as well and the
Samsung logo is printed on the underside
of the glass so you won't have any
issues with that rubbing off or chipping
out like on the Lumia 950 or with the
older Nexus 6 the back glass does
scratch if it easier than the front
clasp you can see that my razor leaves
some marks on the back but that same
razor leaves the front unscathed
they do sell clear protective covers or
skins so you can protect the back glass
if you're into that kind of thing let's
jump into the burn test this one always
is interesting to me when some phones
are burned with the flame the pixels
turn black and shut off while the flame
is in place other phones like this
Galaxy s7 edge will turn white and never
quite recover look how reflective that
screen is it is definitely fingerprint
central speaking of heat it will be
interesting to check out the internal
liquid cooling inside this device during
my teardown video I'll slice open that
heat tube to see the guts inside so
check out that video before we do the
bin test make sure you're subscribed
I've tested 15 phones now 12 of which
survived my bin
test and three of which snapped in half
like very expensive crackers let's see
how the s7 edge holds up bending from
the back holds up pretty well when I
flip it around and press on the screen
though you can see the back panel lifts
up just slightly from the frame once
that seal is broken on the back cover it
is definitely not water-resistant
anymore but the phone itself does not
break no matter how I bend it it is a
solid beast of a device so if you're a
heavyset skinny jean wearing individual
I would not recommend putting this phone
in the back pocket of your skinny jeans
it would compromise that water-resistant
seal but other than that this phone is
stronger than Donald Trump's hairspray
and that's saying something it really is
one of the strongest most durable phones
I have tested so far zero complaints on
my end I post behind the scenes stuff on
Instagram and Twitter so follow me there
for updates thank you so much for
subscribing you guys make tests like
this possible and I appreciate it a ton
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
