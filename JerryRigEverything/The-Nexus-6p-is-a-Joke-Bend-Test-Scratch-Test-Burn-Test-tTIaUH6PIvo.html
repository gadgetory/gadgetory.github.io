a durability test on a brand new Nexus
6p made by Huawei I test every new phone
that comes out I phoned Android Samsung
HTC I see if they can be scratched
burned or bent things that can happen in
everyday life so let's jump in and see
what happens with the Nexus 6p I'm going
to try something a little bit different
this time doing scratch tests with keys
erasers is great and everything but
would be nice to have a more definitive
scale so I have set of picks that will
tell me where the glass falls on Mohs
scale of hardness it will give us a
numerical value of how hard the screen
actually is a number one on Mohs scale
would be the equivalent of talc powder a
10 would be as hard as diamonds my razor
blade ranks in at about a 5 or a 6 on
the scale so you can use that as a
reference from my previous durability
videos the pics have a different
material on either end that correspond
with a different number on Mohs scale a
level 5 pick can't scratch something
that is a level 6 in hardness none of my
picks would scratch a diamond because it
is a level 10 and the hardest of them
all you can see that the picks 1 through
5 did absolutely nothing to the six PS
Gorilla Glass 4 but right around pick
number six we can see a faint mark 7
left a more visible scratch and 8 and 9
were obviously tougher than the glass as
well I'm fresh out of diamonds at the
moment so we won't delve into number 10
wait did you just see that
I tap the screen with my pointer finger
and the glass cracks from my finger and
a scratch test these scratch tests are
not overkill sand can be a level 9
pavement in a parking lot can reach a
level 9 and the glass from the 6p
cracked from a scratch test
well maybe the phone won't suck in every
other category hit that thumbs up button
if you're glad that this is my phone and
not yours let's try the burn test this
phone has an AMOLED screen which is the
same type of screen that the Samsung
phones have and some of the LG phones
every other phone has survived the burn
test including the iPhone so let's see
what happens with the 6p strange enough
the phone turns white when heat is
applied every other phone turned black
so let's see if it recovers spoiler
alert it does not the white stays on
screen even when the phone is powered
off this is a sad day for the Nexus 6p I
never thought I would be comparing
something to the HTC m9 positively but
even the m9 s brushed aluminum back is
more scratch resistant than this the
iPhone 7000 series aluminium is
infinitely better it is super
disappointing to see this behavior from
a Nexus flagship the camera lens is
relatively scratch resistant yay let's
move on to the bin test as you can see
the phone is still fully functional at
this point although it is probably angry
with me I am going to apply a little bit
of pressure and yikes I am being
completely serious when I say my little
sister could have bent this phone in
half with her hands the Nexus 6p is a
joke
hands down I have not been this
disappointed since seeing Jar Jar in the
Phantom Menace hit that subscribe button
if you want me to continue testing
phones before you go out and buy them I
hope this video answered any questions
you had about the Nexus 6p s durability
or lack thereof thanks ton for watching
hope see you around and if you're super
bored follow me on instagram @ Zach's
jerry-rigged thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
