apart the galaxy s6 edge+
it is the bigger and older brother to
the galaxy s6 edge to do this repair
you'll need a giant suction cup I'm just
using a window mount and a heat gun
you'll use the heat gun to take off the
backplate make sure everything is turned
off on the phone make sure the SIM card
tray is out of the phone and then heat
up the back of the phone make sure you
eat up the top the bottom in the middle
uniformly all the way around the outside
you want to get the phone so it's too
hot to touch with your fingers what
we're doing here is we're warming up the
adhesive underneath the phone so that it
will be easier to pry off grab my
suction cup and kind of lift up along
the center there and put my metal pry
tool in between the glass and the frame
and then I can slide my playing card in
between the glass and the frame so that
it won't reseal back down once I take my
metal pry tool out I would recommend a
flat metal tool for this if you use
something thicker like a razor blade it
will crack the glass I have done that
before
once you're underneath the glass make
sure to heat it back up again so that
the adhesive is still loose and you can
take your pry tool and slide it all the
way around the outside and cut away the
adhesive the adhesive is you know just
inside that 1/2 inch all the way around
the edge now this is much harder than it
looks this video is sped up to not take
up too much time so I would recommend
taking your time and making sure not to
crack that back glass especially if
you're planning on reusing it after your
repair is over once that back is off you
can see the old adhesive right around
the edge of the back glass I will put
replacement parts down the video
description
I'll do a quick camera lens replacement
so you can just put your razor blade or
probably tool underneath that little
groove and pop up the lens the lens will
come in two parts the metal frame and
the clear glass you can just take the
clear glass from your replacement lens
pop it in the metal frame and then take
that metal frame and put it back down on
top of the camera make sure there is no
dust or glass shards or anything inside
of the camera and make sure not to touch
the inside of the camera lens there are
a bunch of screws around the inside of
the phone so take your Phillips head
screwdriver I will link tools and parts
down in the video description below once
the screws are out the back will just
lift off from the frame you can see here
the Qi charging pad has a bunch of
little connections that will just rest
up against the motherboard same with
these
IDE buttons the power button the volume
buttons and then down here for the
speaker as well they just have little
contact pads that get their
communication when they're pressed up
against little pins on the motherboard
here's the battery connection I take
that off first so I don't have any
electricity coursing through the
motherboard and there's two wire cables
down at the bottom that is going to
unsnap and pop off here is the LCD
ribbon cable here is the proximity
sensors going to lift that up and away
from the motherboard and then the
motherboard will lift up and fold up and
then there's one more cable down there
at the very bottom that we're going to
take off and that is for the charging
port
now the motherboard is up we can take
off the earpiece the front-facing camera
and the rear-facing camera all of these
parts are replaceable which is very nice
except for the SIM card tray that is
soldered onto the mainboard here is the
16 megapixel rear camera and the five
megapixel front camera now here's the
charging port that I'm fairly
disappointed in you can pop up that
fingerprint scanner and get that one
little screw off in the charging port
and then there's the two ribbon cables
as well you think you're good to go but
you're not there are two little wires
that are holding the back button and
menu button and they are pinched between
the glass and the plastic frame securely
holding the charging port to the phone
it is irreplaceable unless you're some
kind of wizard now to take out the
battery of the phone I am heating it up
so I can pry it out away from the
plastic frame I did not check to see if
there was any pull tabs down at the
bottom of the battery so that you can
pull the adhesive out Motorola's kind of
switching to that so before you start
prying away at your battery make sure
there's no pull tabs down there at the
bottom
check comments I'm sure other people
will have tried this as well I am taking
a metal pry tool and just sliding it in
between the plastic frame and the
battery make sure you don't do any
slicing motions though because you can
puncture the battery making it unusable
so be very very careful when you're
probably that out from the phone also
make sure not to bend the screen you
don't want to crack the LCD on accident
when you're replacing the battery so
here is the charging port that has
pinched between the plastic frame and
the glass it is pretty much
irreplaceable it is very very similar to
the Galaxy Note 5 you can click that
video and watch how we replace the
charging port on that phone but with a
curved screen of the galaxy s6 edge+ I
would say it's almost impossible to pull
off the LCD from the plastic frame
without breaking it I am NOT going to
attempt it on my phone but between this
video
and my note 5 video you should be able
to see everything that needs to be done
in order to attempt to repair yourself
go ahead and clip those cameras back
into the motherboard and then clip that
charging port down onto the base of the
motherboard here is the earpiece speaker
going to clip that down there just like
little Legos position it right about the
connector and push it down here is the
LCD ribbon cable and the battery I'm
plugging the battery in last just
because we don't want electricity
coursing through the motherboard when
we're unplugging stuff here's the back
of the phone going to place that down
and get all the screws back into place
and the back glass your replacement back
glass should have adhesive of its own if
you're buying a new one if you're
reinstalling your old one you can use
double sided tape I will link that down
in the video description as well and
you're good to go if you have any
questions make sure to leave in the
comments don't forget to like if this
video helped you if you did it up taking
apart the phone yourself make sure to
leave your experience in the comments
I'm sure we'll help out more people in
the future thanks ton for watching and
check out some other videos help see you
