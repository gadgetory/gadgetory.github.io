budget phones from the company oneplus
we're going to take it apart tear it
down and show you what's inside of it it
is a fairly difficult phone to take
apart so be warned about that there is a
screen protector on the device and it
comes with the case which is pretty nice
now they must have known I was going to
take it apart because it comes with this
warning please do not disassemble the
back cover so let's see how hard it is
and remove the dual SIM card tray and
then the back cover is a piece of glass
we got to be really careful when we're
prying it away from the device it is
very helpful if you use a heat gun to
warm up the glue underneath it will
soften the glue and allow the back to be
separated from the phone a lot easier
I'm going to heat it up until the glass
is just barely too hot to touch and then
I can slide a razor blade between the
frame and the glass or use a playing
card and just slip it all the way up
once it's at the right temperature the
glue will just cut very easily away with
the playing card when I use my pry tool
to pull off the glass back the last
little bit and you can see the adhesive
as it separates from the very top of the
phone now the batter does have this
nifty little pull tab reminds me a lot
of the iPhone 4 and 4s but before we
start pulling things we do have to
remove some screws that will link all
the tools and replacement parts in the
video description so check that out
there are seven screws on this top panel
I'm going to remove those and then the
battery can be unplugged from the
motherboard then we can start pulling on
things once the battery is lifted up and
away from the device we can see some
extension ribbon cables fairly
interesting we'll jump into those in a
minute
here are eight screws on the bottom
housing I'm going to remove those and
then this is the loudspeaker for the 1
plus X you can see the two little
contact points that rest on the charging
port and that's how it gets its signal
here's the extension cable for the
AMOLED screen we're gonna unplug that
just like a little Lego I'm going to
unplug the buttons and then the
extension cable here on the motherboard
you can just see that it routes down to
the bottom of the phone that's really
all this piece is it's just an extension
cable to plug the screen into there's
one more screw up at the top of the
motherboard gonna remove that also a
wire cable down at the bottom left and
then the camera this is a 13 megapixel
rear camera the front is an 8 megapixel
now to remove the motherboard there are
two little pins at the bottom of the
board
so just unpin those and then the whole
thing should pop out there's a little
groove at the top of the motherboard
that sits in there as well here's a
ribbon cable for the charging port we're
going to pull that down to the bottom of
the device now before we start tugging
on things there is one more screw at the
bottom and then we're going to lift away
the vibrator motor as well as the wire
cable that we unsnap before and then the
rest of the charging port can be pulled
away from the device it's nice that the
charging port is replaceable since this
is one of the common things that are
replaced on the device you can see here
it also has the mic attached to it now
here's the screen of the device the
screen is glued very securely into the
frame of the phone which is unfortunate
it makes it very very difficult to
repair if you are going to repair your
screen just heat up the screen to hotter
than you can touch and then remove the
AMOLED in front glass with the same
method that you remove the back panel
the glue is much stronger for the AMOLED
screen though it is a very messy and
dangerous process and I do not recommend
it unless you have absolutely no other
option and have nothing to lose because
the screen will not survive the process
so your new screen will have to work
just slip it through the frame and plug
it into the main board I don't recommend
it but if you have to do it you have to
do it putting the phone back together
and take the charging port plug in that
wire cable make sure that the pins on
the charging port line up with the
plastic pins on the frame as well I'm
going to plug in the charging port to
the back of the motherboard before I lay
it down into place putting the top in
first making sure there's no ribbon
cables or wire cables on the bottom side
and then I can just press the bottom of
the motherboard back into the frame of
the phone and you'll hear it clip down
as each of those little clasps grab onto
the bottom of the board again putting
the 13 megapixel camera back into a slot
getting that screw back into place on
the top right plugging in the wire cable
getting the extension cable for the
screen bringing it down to the bottom of
the phone and then plugging that screen
back into the cable and setting it down
into place plugging the power and volume
buttons back in getting the screw into
the charging port before I put this
loudspeaker back into place and clipping
it down there are eight screws that hold
that into place and we can plop the
battery back in and plug it in before we
get the top metal panel and put that
into place as well I'm going to test the
phone this is actually the first time
I've turned this on I forgot to turn it
on when I pulled it out of the box
getting the top metal plate back into
place remember there are seven screws
holding that down
and then to put the back panel back on
I'm just using the double-sided tape you
can use as much or as little as you want
and then putting the dual SIM card slot
back into place and everything is good
if you have any questions leave them
down in the comments thanks ton for
watching make sure to hit that subscribe
button so I can keep making videos like
this in the future
hope see around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
