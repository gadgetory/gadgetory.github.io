coolest technology of this year today
we're gonna review a couple of these
drones starting with the spark and
working our way all the way up to the
inspire 2 with my buddy Devin Supertramp
he's unpacking that drone right now
we're gonna fly him here inside Devin's
office and we're gonna measure the
decibel levels of the props and talk a
little bit about the drones individually
and I have an extra DJI spark that I'm
going to be giving away at the end of
this video so stick around for those
details let's get started all right so
these are all of DG eyes drones we'll
start here with a spark we have the
Mavic Pro and then we have the Mavic Pro
Platinum which is a drone the DJI
recently released there's a couple minor
differences mostly in the propellers you
can see the shape difference between the
regular Maverick Pro and the Navajo a
tanam we'll talk more about this in a
second but apparently this is supposed
to be slightly more aerodynamic a little
bit quieter and because of that there's
a little more flight time then we have
the Phantom 4 these props are not
collapsible and it's not as portable
we'll talk about that in a second and
then here we have the inspire 2 which is
an incredible step up from all of the
lesser drones this drone right here
belongs to my buddy Devin who has a
channel called Devin Supertramp and
Devin tell me why you chose this drone
over all of the other ones so we really
started with the Phantom 4 absolutely
love this drone and then we upgrade to
be inspired to you're looking with the
whole package $10,000 plus but for us we
do this as a business and for us we work
with a lot of different companies
filming commercials so this is a
commercial drone as far as like they
even use this in Hollywood for a lot of
stuff as well and it films in 6 K it can
go extremely fast I want to say that
they say you can go around 55 57 miles
per hour super fast image is incredible
super stable one thing I want to point
out that the sensor size of this drone
is huge like if you look at that
compared to the Phantom 4 like the
sensor behind this thing is going to be
so much smaller and even more so with
this Mavic Pro platinum as far as like
going cinematically that has to do with
the lenses so the lenses on the actual
inspire 2 are interchangeable here we
have a 16 millimeter at 35 24 and a 50
millimeter lens that we can hot-swap I'm
gonna give that super cinematical
all right so jumping back to resolution
we have the DJI spark which is the
cheapest of all of these drones I think
this one is right around 500 bucks for
the whole package it's got an extremely
small sensor does 1080p but it's still a
good little drone but the reason for
this video today is the newest drone
that DJI has released called the Mavic
Pro platinum you can see that the
Platinum is a slightly different color
than the regular one back here and with
that different color there's a slight
increase in price and a slight increase
in flying time it can fly an additional
three minutes so instead of twenty seven
minutes of flight time you have thirty
minutes of flight time I don't know if
that's worth the extra price but it's
kind of fun the reason for that slight
difference in flight time is because the
propellers are quieter I think there's
less drag I'm not an expert in
aerodynamics but because of that less
drag the propeller isn't making as much
noise and it can support itself for
longer right now we're gonna take this
little device right here which measures
the decibel levels of the drones and
we're gonna see which drone is the
quietest which I think we know which one
that is and to see if there's a
difference between the Mavic Pro and a
maverick Pro platinum and finally we'll
finish off with Devin and his super
drone here at the end and we'll see how
loud that thing really is or how quiet
the size of the blade is actually
roughly oh two and a half times bigger
than the drone itself so slight
disclaimer I've never flown this drone
before so we're gonna find out how well
it really flies I'm worse than the big
guys so the little guys be a whole
different story alright so we are
currently going through technical
difficulties we have to update the spark
before it'll take off inside of here so
while we're waiting for that Devin
where's the most interesting place you
have flown your DJI inspire scariest
place Easter Island we're always
traveling all over the world
Easter Island though we didn't realize
like you're not a lot of flight drones
at all on that island so we took off and
within a minute minute and a half we
were surrounded by police officers they
grabbed us all they threw us against the
car and they made it very apparent that
you are not a lot of fly drones on
Easter Island and they took the drone
and they said if we took off again and
they put us in prison we didn't fly for
the rest of ship which was a bummer
because we spam a flight cross halfway
across the world to fly drone and then
Allison we're not a lot of flight at all
we did our homework we'd seen other
people that are flown drones out there
but they must have done it
super under the radar but I
with all the crazy rock heads and I mean
that place within itself has its own
amazing history crazy insane place and
what's this one right here so this is
New Zealand we actually flew a drone
there as well mrs. Hopkins where they
actually filmed Lord of the Rings and
The Hobbit so we've got special
privileges special access from new
zealand tourism to fly there and each
one a 15-time story this was on the back
lot of Universal Studios for overwatch
video which actually it's a long story
but we're not allowed to release it for
legal reasons so you'll never see that
video we should be good to go
three two why yes all right so we've got
a foot away from the blades right now
and it's about 91 decibels going from
the drone
blankety was that your first time flying
this drone
first time flying the spark no crash no
crash landing ok so right now this is
set to attract the max decibel level you
know the peak that it reached and so the
peak that it reached with the spark was
94 now I imagine that the decibel level
between all of these is going to be
pretty darn similar but let's try the
DJI Mavic Pro it's almost double the
size of the props we'll see if it's
twice as loud
alright so now we're gonna take off with
the Mavic throw this is the second time
Devin has flown one of these the first
time we were in Hawaii right and what
did you do with I I almost destroyed it
I got so bad that you actually I'd take
the controller away from me yeah we were
at like Jurassic Park I think it's a
video on what's inside is youtube
channel but Devin was flying at around
he went through some really tall weeds
he's getting a second chance here a
second chance time to redeem myself here
we go I stand back a little bit safety
first
right about that
amazing
all right so that's how Mara 89.9 which
is a few decibels less than what the
spark is the decibel scale I think it's
like a log base scale so it's not like
an exponential scale but it does go up
considerably with each you know 10 sets
of decibels so this is DG is newest
drone the DGI Mavic platinum i think
it's going to be a little bit quieter
than the DJI Mavic pro so these are the
two propellers that we're looking at you
can see the propellers for this one are
just like you know straight out and then
these ones are shaped differently now
I'm not sure what the aerodynamics of
the blade has to do with it
but let's see how much quieter or
efficient this is
so just off of your ear alone what do
you think which one is this is by far
the quietest substantially in my opinion
so that one ended up being 83 which is 7
decibels less than the 90 from the
previous medic so it is considerably
quieter which my mind blown because this
one's so much smaller so I would have
initially thought this would be much
quieter the reason helicopters make
noise is something called the like blade
vortex interaction and the sound you
hear from a drone or from a helicopter
is the sound of the blade hitting that
pocket of air or that vortex from the
previous blade because you know the way
it's slicing through the air and so I
imagine that however this tip or this
fin is it's minimizing that vortex
effect and minimizing the sound because
this one was considerably quieter than
this drone was so my question is now
that we're going back to the older shape
when we jump into the DJI phantom or
your drone how much louder isn't really
going to be the mono truth so going back
to the blade vortex interactions so this
blade even though it's super small the
pocket of air it creates could be what's
making it so much louder it is
interesting that the smaller drone is
the loudest so far but I think that's
about to change with the phantom 4 stand
back boys and girls
so we were at 94 to hover and then a
95.9 at you know the fold max I think
like snoring is like 40 decibels and a
jet plane is like a hundred and 20
decibels and this is at 96 we'll just
round up and say 96 so it's pretty darn
loud for a drone if you're gonna go for
stealth
none of these drones are gonna be good
but so far the platinum is the quietest
all right so check out the aspire to
these I'd feel much more confident
hitting your fingers this one will cut
off your fingers so it's like sticking
your hand in the blender so stand back a
little bit more than normal
I'll try to avoid that
yeah at peak this was 97.7 so guaranteed
the loudest drone is the DJI inspire but
I'm curious if DGI was able to make the
smaller props quieter do you think they
could put that same style on this and
make them bigger drone quieter I wanna
say yes and then actually the inspire 2
has 2 different kinds of blades already
these are your standard ones we also
have high altitude so when we're out
here in Utah or higher up elevation
there is thinner so those actually
handle differently too so I'd be curious
to if those sound quieter than these as
well I was looking over here this
picture was all down but it is now
Cricut so the whole picture went like
this from the air pushing out this way
so this is definitely the most powerful
and even though we saw was at 96 97.7 so
even though we saw at 19.7 wasn't moving
fast at all just cuz but if we were
taken out going 50 miles per hour I
think it was going to be a much
different than all these drones combined
so either way all of the drones are
extremely loud there's gonna be no
sneaking up on anyone with any of these
things the thing that I am most shocked
about though is that the littlest drone
was not the quietest the quietest drone
goes to the DJI Mavic platinum but have
you ever gotten in trouble for shooting
with the drone before yeah so I have
gone in trouble
both Glamour's say how it is we actually
six months ago we were filming in
Ireland give or take and we were filming
a skellig michael that's where they fill
in the last two Star Wars movies episode
7 episode 8 and very famous part is
where Luke meets ray or Ravens Luke and
we took the drone or from a boat and
we're flying over the island and going
back to what we're just talking about as
far as the loudness of all these you
can't fly a drone in bursts jingchou
Ares we were outside of the sanctuary
but it was still loud enough that I felt
super close to them so they actually had
a radio us in and tell us to kind of not
be as close to the island
we were there are pros and cons with
having a big drone con is definitely how
loud they can get we would've had a much
easier time with the smaller drone but
we wouldn't have gotten the cinematic
shots that we got with this one Star
Wars Island video you shot with this
drone is coming out today right today
right now check it out on the YouTube
channel Devin Supertramp a lot of work
went into it and it's one of my favorite
places in the world when the most
mysterious places it has incredible
history and you'll see that history on
the video and it shows you a sneak peak
no spoilers in the actual video for Star
Wars but if you have any interest in
Star Wars it goes over the history of
how they made things happen for the
actual movie so I think any Star Wars
fans gonna be stoked on it every type
I'll leave a link for that video down in
the video description you can check that
out and if you have not seen Devin
Supertramp channel I'll leave a link for
that as well thanks a ton for letting me
use your office and yours thanks a ton
for letting me use your office and your
inspire to I super appreciate it I am
not about to go out and buy one of these
how much you say it was a wrap just for
the body itself a $6,000 but once you
start getting the batteries the camera
and everything else you're ten thousand
and thirteen thousand dollars into it
well so drones are expensive but the
consumer drones are way less expensive
than this now these are essentially the
same drone so if you already have the
BGI Mavic Pro you don't need to go out
and buy the Platinum gens because like
they're essentially the same you get
three minutes more flight time and it's
slightly quieter if you're trying to
decide between these two definitely go
with the platinum because of those small
differences so everyone crashes this
John I've got inspire to we've crashed
three of them one in the ocean sad story
but if you're gonna you're gonna crash a
drone if you're just flying or even if
you're professional so it'd be much
better to get a smaller cheaper version
make mistakes on this one before you
start giving you these other drones so
definitely keep that in mind as you're
considering and dream to get so I have
an extra DJI spark that I'm gonna give
to one of you guys now this is a white
version and it's got like the full
package in it with the controllers I
think it's the fly more package either
way it's coming to you guys I will leave
a link in the video description for that
thanks a ton for watching make sure you
check out the Star Wars video on Devin's
I'll have that link for you and we'll
see you in the next one over and out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
