smartphone in the Xiaomi line up, but at the
same time, still pretty fairly priced for
the specs and power it brings to the table.
And the box looks legit.
Xiaomi is claiming to have added a sapphire
glass protective layer on their camera lens.
Sapphire is an ultra hard, ultra premium product
with superior scratch protection, right there
next to diamonds.
But not all sapphire is created equal.
Today we'll see if Xiaomi is using real quality
sapphire like HTC, Tissot, and Kyocera, or
if they are using junk sapphire like Apple.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
You got to hand it to Xiaomi for this color
scheme.
This is the Holographic Ocean Blue.
It's definitely a deeper blue than I anticipated,
with hints of purple and basically all of
the other colors.
The phone feels pretty lightweight, but we'll
get to that in a second.
Let's start with the scratch test.
I have a set of Mohs hardness mineral picks
that are used to differentiate between different
minerals and gemstones, and they let us know
exactly what kind of materials we are dealing
with.
Glass and sapphire, while both optically clear
and at first glance might look the same, are
completely different materials.
Plastic scratches at a level 3.
Glass scratches at a 5 or a 6, and pure sapphire
would scratch at a level 8 or 9.
Diamonds, of course, are the hardest mineral
and scratch at a level 10.
The screen of the Mi 9 scratches at a level
6, with deeper grooves at a level 7.
Xiaomi is advertising Gorilla Glass 6 on the
screen of this phone, so those numbers are
pretty typical for what we find on tempered
glass screen flagships.
Xiaomi has the teardrop notch up here at the
top, hiding a 20 megapixel selfie camera.
The small sliver of a speaker grill is also
tucked up here in the top bezel.
It's very secure.
The build quality of this Mi 9 is off to a
good start.
The phone is made from anodized 7,000 series
aluminum.
It's pretty normal of the glass sandwich style
phones these days.
The volume and power buttons are also metal.
Down here at the bottom of the phone next
to the USB-C we have no headphone jack.
But over here on the left side we do have
a fully customize-able side button that can
take pictures, open apps, or start a voice
assistant.
The dual SIM card tray has no expandable storage.
It does have a rubber ring around the tip,
but unfortunately, just a light touch of my
SIM removal tool popped the low quality rubber
band from around the SIM card tray opening.
There's no official IP rating on this phone,
which is good because this rubber is totally
worthless and shouldn't be officially protecting
anything.
Xiaomi's flagship Mi line does not have the
SD card slot or headphone jack anymore, but
the budget Redmi line does include those extra
features.
If the Redmi line is cheaper and has more
features, it's honestly worth considering
even if the phone is plastic.
Up at the top of the Mi 9, along with more
metal, is the infrared remote control which
is a fun little addition to this smartphone.
The Mi 9 does have a plastic layer between
the screen and metal frame of the phone which
is good.
It helps absorb some of the impact between
two brittle layers if it's ever dropped.
Xiaomi has advertised over and over about
their new sapphire glass camera cover on top
of the triple camera setup.
The first problem with that sentence is that
it's never actually called sapphire glass.
Glass is glass, and sapphire is crystal.
Two totally different materials.
Both materials should be impervious to my
level 5.5 stainless steel razor blade.
Glass won't start scratching till right above
that at a level 6.
The reason sapphire is so valuable and premium
is because of it's scratch resistant properties.
It should hold out till a level 8 before it
gets damaged.
Unfortunately though, I can start to feel
my level 6 pick grind on the surface of Xiaomi's
sapphire, leaving permanent marks.
The level 7 pick also leaves marks on the
sapphire lens cover when it should definitely
not.
And finally, the point when we should start
seeing scratches, level 8, we get some pretty
hefty gouges.
Things aren't looking good.
I'll pull out my level 6 one more time to
double check, and indeed we see more scratches.
I'm not impressed.
This is not the good stuff.
Before we pull out any pitchforks though,
let's see if it registers as sapphire.
You can see here the glass lens of my Galaxy
S8 Plus has no reaction with my electronic
gemstone detector tool.
But when I place the same tool up against
the sapphire lens of the Mi 9, the tool does
indeed have a reaction.
The selector can detect the thermal conductivity
that sapphire and diamonds have, but that
same conductivity is not found in glass or
fake gemstones.
So Xiaomi is indeed using sapphire, just not
a quality version of it.
Maybe Xiaomi found a way to combine sapphire
and glass, and that's why they called it sapphire
glass instead of the correct sapphire crystal.
Either way, Xiaomi has just joined Apple's
ranks with sub-par inferior sapphire that
should not be compared with the real stuff.
There are a few companies that are doing it
right like Tissot, HTC, and Kyocera.
So if you want real premium quality sapphire,
head over to those guys.
Xiaomi is using an under screen fingerprint
scanner, an optical fingerprint scanner just
like the one found in the OnePlus 6T.
We'll have to take a look at it from the inside
if this phone survives the bend test.
But first we'll scuff up the surface of the
glass with level 7 scratches to see if Xiaomi's
fingerprint scanner can function due to the
unrealistic exorbitant amounts of abrasion....and
indeed it can.
Scratches are definitely not an issue for
this optical fingerprint scanner.
Thumbs up for that.
Optical scanners only work with LED displays
and not LCDs, since LED panels are slightly
opaque allowing the under screen camera to
see through the display.
We can verify that indeed it has the characteristics
of AMOLED by using this highly scientific
Bic inflammatory device I obtained at a gas
station.
The Mi 9 has a 6.4 inch 1080p AMOLED display
that turns white after about 30 seconds.
But then the pixels do end up turning back
on and recovering.
If you think the burn test is extraneous,
you are definitely not wrong.
Now for the bend test.
The last Xiaomi phone I tested, the Redmi
Note 7, did not do so well.
It's plastic frame eventually succumbed to
the pressure and fractured into unusable bits.
This Mi 9 however, with it's metal frame,
survives the first bend from the back, and
second bend from the front.
The thin phone slightly flexes each time,
but no permanent damage is done to the frame,
the display, or the glass on either side.
The Xiaomi Mi 9 is a survivor.
Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the sapphire glass
attempt, or the lack of headphone jack and
expandable memory card slot, but Xiaomi has
built a solid phone and I can't get too mad
at the guys building flagship phones for hundreds
of dollars cheaper than Apple and Samsung.
If you do buy this phone, it's more for the
cool kaleidoscope of colors and not for the
sapphire on the camera lens.
Come hang out with me over on Twitter and
Instagram, and let me know what phone you
want to see tested next down in the comments.
Thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
