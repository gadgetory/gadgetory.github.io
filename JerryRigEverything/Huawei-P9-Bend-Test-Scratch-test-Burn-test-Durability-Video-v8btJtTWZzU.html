Android smartphone with dual Leica
camera lenses on the back
I do durability tests on cell phones if
you are outdoorsy rock-climb do
construction hike or have a generally
active lifestyle you need to have a
phone that will withstand any accidents
out of 30 phones that I have tested so
far only four have catastrophic we
failed one of which is the Huawei Nexus
6p this phone the Huawei p9 was released
seven months after the 6p will it have
the same weakness or crinkles near the
power button or were those seven months
sufficient to correct any design issues
let's find out if the p9 is stronger
than the 6p let's start with the scratch
test this screen has something called
2.5 D glass which means it has a very
slight curve along the edge not as much
as the s7 edge or the blackberry proved
it's a very subtle curve I have a set of
pics that let me know where the screen
falls on Mohs scale of hardness not all
glass is created equal
phones like the droid turbo 2 and the
galaxy s7 active scratch at level 3 the
yumi super phones crashed at level 4 but
this phone the p9 scratched at level 6
and a deeper groove with the level 7 pic
this is the norm for smartphones these
days you don't have to worry about keys
or loose change damaging your glass
screen thumbs up for this durable glass
display so what's the fuss with these
dual Leica cameras well theoretically
the left lens takes monochrome pictures
which are black and white and the right
lens takes colour pictures and the
software combines them together to form
one higher quality or more detailed
image and this feature doesn't work
while recording video though as we saw
in my camera test yesterday and it also
turns out that Leica nor huawei
manufacture this camera it's a
third-party company called sunny optical
I'll talk more about that during my
teardown video if this phone survives
the bin test the important thing is is
that the lens is made of glass and is
scratch resistant plus it will allow you
to catch Pokemon and Pokemon go and
that's really all that you need from a
smartphone camera these days I initially
thought that the back panel is going to
be plastic because of how thin and light
the
back panel feels but you can tell by the
sound it's making and the silver shine
that it is indeed metal the fingerprint
scanner is painted metal which is normal
I scratched it pretty heavily to test
its functionality and while it still
worked after being scratched it only
responded about 50% of the time the LG
g5 fingerprint scanner would scratch far
worse than this and still functioned
100% of the time so don't let your
fingerprint scanner scratch the size of
the device are made of metal and aren't
coated with any plastic or primer the
volume button is also metal as well as
the very textured power button if we
flip the phone around to the SIM card
tray it is metal even the earpieces
metal I'm very glad when the
manufacturers stay consistent with their
materials now onto the flame test on
this IPS neo 1080p display this tells us
how thick the glass is and how much heat
the screen can take before reacting the
Huawei p9 lasted about 10 seconds before
the pixels went black and turned off
normally the screen would still function
over the next few seconds with the black
pixels while they cool down and
recovered but this digitizer stopped
working I turned off the screen and turn
it back on again to restore
functionality to the phone and it did
completely recover leaving no white burn
marks on the screen like you see with my
galaxy s7 edge onto the bin test
remember that I test every new phone
that comes out so if you haven't
subscribed yet now would be a good time
with the initial flex the screen pops
out from the frame and then the metal
strip near the power button cracks but
there is no catastrophic damage or
folding like the Nexus 6p which is a
good thing
durable phones are important to most
people unless you want to be able to
snap your burner phone in half like
Walter White then you should get a 6p
but this p9 is still functional which
means it survives the bin test just to
clarify even though the phone survives
my tests I still recommend getting a
screen protector and a case I always
have a case on my phone even if I trust
its durability my behind the scenes
stuff can be found on Instagram and
Twitter I even did a snap story about my
editing process on the p9 camera
comparison video I'll try to have the
teardown video of this phone up in the
next few days it'll be interesting to
review this phone from the inside thanks
for watching I hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
