this drop test today will be dropped
testing the iPhone 10 our burst the
pixel 3 I noticed something strange when
the pixel 3 came out all of the review
units were breaking from people like
iJustine mkbhd Danny even Jonathan
Morrison broke Austin Evans unit and I
don't think it's their fault it could
just be that the pixel 3 is weaker than
it should be but the only way to find
out for sure is with a drop test huge
thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this
drop test switching phones as a hassle
every single app has its own password
and if you're probably being lazy and
using the same password for everything
that's not good one app that makes
switching phones easier is LastPass used
by literally millions of people LastPass
has the ability to generate long secure
passwords that are encrypted which means
they're secure and you never have to
remember what they are since they're
saved inside of the LastPass app and
autofill for you and since you don't
need to remember your passwords you
don't need to write them down somewhere
that's not secure and you don't need to
use the same password for everything
whether you're at your computer or your
cell phone LastPass is 100% free I'll
leave a link in the description but if
you want a few extra perks like a
gigabyte of encrypted storage it's just
two bucks a month use things - LastPass
again for sponsoring this drop test link
is in the description let's get started
so you might remember from the previous
iPhone 10's drop test the 10s did really
really well it didn't break it all but
the side rails of the iPhone 10s are
made from stainless steel which is much
different than aluminum aluminum is
softer which could change the results of
the drop test so right here we'll be
recording in slow motion with my
transparent pixel three and then over on
this side we'll be using the razor phone
too which is also transparent and then
I'll be performing the drop test from
relatively realistic situations you know
like getting up from a chair or knee
height dropping it as it pulls out of
your pocket from waist height and then
if it lasts long enough we'll be doing
from a head height drop all the way onto
the concrete both these phones are brand
new and ready to be drop tested so for
the first drop we'll start from about
knee height because that's why if you're
sitting in a chair and the phone's on
your lap and it just slides off that's
where it'll be we'll start with the
iPhone first sitting a knee height so
far so good and now we'll do the pixel -
starting from knee height
both phones so far looking pretty good
no damage done to the iPhone 10 are and
no damage done to the pixel 3 a little
bit of scuffing right there along the
the aluminum frame scuffing up along the
top but no cracks or anything yet both
phones are still working perfectly fun
drop test number two this time I'm gonna
be pulling it out of my pocket and
simulating it just slipping out of your
hands starting with the iPhone 10 are
and the pixel 2 pulling it out of my
pocket letting it drop
check this out no damage done to the
back glass yet still got those same
scuffs along the bottom no cracks along
the screen yet same thing goes for the
iPhone 10 are no damage whatsoever a
little bit of scuffing right there along
the top let's go for drop number three
will do the same pocket style drop as
last time starting with the iPhone 10
are pulling it out of my pocket
and then the pixel three pulling it out
of my pocket so far no major damage yet
pixel three oh wait just kidding the
pixel three is the first one to get
damaged right there along the corner the
glass is shattered just a little bit
down at the bottom
still no major damage just a little bit
it's a little bit of scuffing no damage
on the back and no damage on the front
it'll be itching to see which phone
cracks first this time we'll do it from
chest height I'll be pulling out of my
pocket and dropping it from about you
know a four and a half feet or so
drop number four okay we'll go with the
pixel oh yeah my pocket four-and-a-half
feet
still no damage I'm impressed
you would think the phones from a drop
that tall do you think there'd be more
damage we're gonna keep going until one
of these is completely broken
yeah the pixel three has a little bit of
damage up top but that's not a crack yet
let's do one more from chest high
chest high iPhone drop right here
straight down
chest high pixel three drop right here
straight down
I think we might have a crack check that
out right there all along the bottom but
still no damage to the screen we'll keep
going until one of these screens is
shattered no damage to the camera lenses
no damage to the upper glass one
interesting thing to note with the
repair prices of both of these phones to
repair the screen on the iPhone 10 are
is a hundred and ninety-nine dollars to
repair the back glass it's 399 now to
repair the back glass on the pixel three
is just a hundred and to repair the
screen is two hundred and sixty nine
dollars because it's an OLED so the
screen is more expensive on the pixel 3
but the back is much less expensive to
replace than the iPhone 10 are now let's
do it from head height alright we've got
the iPhone 10 are from head height just
like you're talking on the phone and you
accidentally drop it oh that's a bad one
and then we got the pixel three head
height talking on the phone accidentally
dropping it
I bet still no damage to either one
let's keep going we're going telescreen
breaks iphone 10 our head height
and then pixel three head height
oh boy pixel three is not having a good
day check this out right there the
camera lens is completely shattered out
of the pixel three that's not good news
but the iPhone 10 are still intact I'll
check it out there's a screen crack
right there all through the screen all
the way down so would you rather have a
cracked screen or a shattered camera
lens the reason I don't do drop tests
very often is because the results are
totally unpredictable you know it really
just depends on what surface you're
dropping on how high it is how the phone
flips in the air but it's still
interesting to see what breaks first on
which phone with the pixel three the
back glass is cracked along with the
camera lens both relatively inexpensive
repairs but with the iPhone 10 are the
front screen cracked which is the
cheapest thing to fix $199 but the back
glass is still intact which is good
because the repair price on the back
glass of the iPhone 10 are is 399
dollars through Apple directly let's do
one more drop for kicks and giggles from
above head height and we'll drop it from
there all right the screen cracked
iPhone 10 are from above head height
will do it right here
no the screed and then we have above
head height the pixel three oh man above
head height that did not turn out well
for the iPhone at all the back glass is
totally shattered all the way through
and the screen is now completely
worthless
Wow the pixel three the screen is still
totally functional which is good because
it's an OLED and relatively expensive to
repair and the back glass has about the
same amount of damage as before cracks
running through the whole thing and
there we have it
I tried to keep it as scientific as
possible but the results of this
particular drop test are a completely
destroyed iPhone 10 are both the front
in the back non-usable the display is
completely non-functional
and we still have a functional pixel 3
with the cracked glass and it cracked
camera lens so the main takeaway from
this is that a case is always a good
idea because glass is glass and glass
can break which phone held up the best
