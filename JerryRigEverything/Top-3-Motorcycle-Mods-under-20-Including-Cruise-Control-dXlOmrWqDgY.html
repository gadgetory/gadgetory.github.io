you is actually this little guy it's a
throttle lock that can clamp on your
throttle and hold it any speed you want
let's take it and it sticks on your
throttle just like that I can open up
the throttle be going on a certain speed
and just take my finger and press this
down and it'll hold me at that speed
that I was at before works great and if
I ever need to come to an emergency stop
I can just let the gas push the gas
forward and it still rotates underneath
the clip and I can still use the brake
as well
the second mod that costs less than 20
bucks is this guy right here it's an
external fuel tank that holds enough gas
to get me other twenty miles of fiber
run out it's great for those long rides
when you're not sure when the next gas
station is going to pop up if you want
to see how I installed extra fuel think
my motorcycle go ahead and click right
here and that'll be a little video to
show you all the parts and all the tools
and stuff that you need to put that onto
your own bike all right the last thing
I'm going to show you is this rotor lock
so you can take it it's got this little
pin in there that you can either stick
through one of little holes in your
rotor or you know the gap so that the
tire won't spin and this is really handy
if you don't have a lock on your bike
already and like a handlebar lock lock
that bad boy up and then I have that to
remind me that the bike is locked if I
don't take off well it's still on there
alright if you can think of any other
modifications so you can do to your
motorcycle for under 20 bucks leave them
in the comments below and I'll make sure
to include them with my next video
