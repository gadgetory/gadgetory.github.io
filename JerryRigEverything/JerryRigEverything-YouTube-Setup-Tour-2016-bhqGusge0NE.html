my YouTube studio and how I make my
videos so I've been building this set up
for the last couple of years
each of these monitors has been added as
I buy them I think this top one is like
four years old and then this side one
here is a 4k monitor that I bought a
couple months ago I built the computer
myself in the past I did have a
wall-mounted computer I did move and I
took down that wall mount a computer put
it in a tower and then I did upgrade my
computer I'll talk about that in a
second I do have JBL 3 or white studio
monitors they're on both sides
I have those attached to the focusrite
scarlett 2i2 I did build the desk myself
I posted a video about a month ago on
that I just took a solid wood door from
Home Depot and then sunk granite and
marble blocks down into it I will link
that video so you can check that out if
you want to on the side there I just
have a brother printer this is the
camera that I use it is the gh4 and one
of the really cool things about this
camera Oh like some other cameras have
as well is that it connects to this
monitor here so the camera itself is a
4k camera and when I turn it on anything
that the camera is seeing will pop up in
my 4k monitor over here so as I'm making
a video I can see up close and in more
detail on the monitor than I can with my
own eyes also another cool feature this
cameras has something called focus
peaking so you can see if the image is
out of focus as soon as it becomes in
focus it'll put little blue dots around
whatever is in focus and that's really
helpful when I'm working on small things
like cell phones so we have the gh4 up
top we have the speed booster here and
then the actual lens is a sigma 18 at 35
it's can zoom in and out has a focus
ring down here as far as the lights go I
have these two LED lights that I can
position wherever I want and then I have
these two other desk lights that is a
5000 color temperature light so it gives
off a white light which helps make the
white balance on the piece of paper a
little bit better learning little by
little as I go along
when I first started I actually just had
a cell phone hanging off the edge of a
desk with the camera lens pointing right
down to where I was filming so my first
hundred or so videos is all done with
the with a cell phone here's a shelf
it's a little cell phone graveyard with
a bunch of toolkits I have some watches
I'm actually going to be doing a video
on Moto 360 and the fossil queue that
will be posted in about a week or so my
keyboard is a corsair k70 it's a
mechanical keyboard if you're into those
i am using the brown keys this is my
computer tower and my sound i will show
you how I do my voiceovers in just a
second so this is my desktop this one I
just put together a couple months ago
this isn't the wall-mounted rig that I
took down and put in a case this is an
upgraded system if you want to pause the
video you can check out all the specs
here I also link everything down in the
video description that I use including
the tripod and the camera and stuff so
the tripod that I use is called a
reveille and I like it because I can
take my camera and actually mount it
underneath the tripod legs so when I'm
working I can just sit right here
between these two legs and tear apart or
durability test any phone that I'm
working on at the moment I also have a
huge vinyl world sticker up there at the
top to remind me who my audience is and
I got a special gift from YouTube a
couple days ago thanks ton for
subscribing everybody so when I do my
voiceovers I have a microphone it's a
samsung meteor mic and then I have this
little sound wall right here that kind
of helps dampen the sound for it and
then I lay down a towel to help dampen
the sound that's gonna reflect off of
the wood table so when I'm doing my
voiceover I'll watch the video on the
top monitor and then record down here
below the top monitor and then the
little pop filter helps kind of filter
out any of the popping sounds that your
mouth makes when you're speaking thanks
ton for watching if you're interested in
starting your own YouTube channel you
really don't need all this stuff to get
going most cameras on smartphone these
days are way more powerful than
what I had when I started you can
accomplish a lot with gesture cell phone
if you have any questions about my setup
or what I do leave them down in the
comments I do respond fairly regularly
and thanks for subscribing hope see your
own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
