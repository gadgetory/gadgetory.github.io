it was going to cost one thousand
dollars to fix so looked on YouTube and
found a video that showed how to fix my
Jeep for $80.00 instead of a thousand
the guy who made that video four years
ago is right here Brian what are we
doing today
today we're going to sign the cell phone
in a turkey the size of a human head
airborne using the airbag out of a Mazda
and a Honda alright let's get started
all right Brian's were blown up airbags
how does this work so the airbag is
really simple it's an explosive charge
it explodes into a bag and just rips
through the front cover you have two
wires that you're dealing with you see
I've got some special terminals for
probing or testing but you have a red
wire and a white wire a positive and a
ground and basically there's an igniter
behind this that will set off a charge
so I'm going to take my orange wire put
it in with the red and then the black
wire into the white and then we're gonna
set the cell phone on it and then I've
got some speaker cable to keep us a safe
distance from the trucks I don't want to
lose my truck doing this I do want to
entertain some folks maybe we'll lose a
phone and a turkey that's acceptable so
this is the cell phone that we're going
to use this is an iPhone 6 it's actually
locked and the screen is crack so it's
not worth very much we're going to plant
it on top of the air bag
alright so Brian we got the air bag
right here and it looks like this is
just what's coming out from inside of
the steering wheel you know the steering
wheel goes around the airbag so how does
the air bag work in the car it's a lot
more complicated you have the air bag
computer you have sensors and there's a
lot of if this then this kind of type of
programming on the computer so that your
air bag doesn't deploy and cost your
insurance company a bunch of money if
you're going five miles an hour
in the parking lot or something like
that air bag like this new from the
Honda would probably be like 500 bucks
or something like that and get them from
the wrecking yard for about a hundred
bucks 50 bucks you know so there's
there's a lot of options where you can
repair the car so how many sensors are
there on a car usually like inside of
the bumper on the sides most cars will
have sensors in the front
bumper at least one if not two like a
Chevy pickup truck or something we'll
have a couple up front if it's in the
late 90s but it just depends on the car
German cars they'll have sensors all
over the place and airbags all over the
place
my truck that you see over there it's
got airbags in the side curtains in the
front you know both sides and it's got
all kinds of sensors and wiring like
explosive charges onboard to that if you
count in airbags there's at least six of
them I believe so all right a lot of
explosives on board that you don't
really think about let's see how far
this baby flies and we have these wires
right here leading up inside of the
truck and Spencer what's going on right
here so it's not live right now but we
have it hooked up to the battery and
once I touch this wire right here just
like that it'll shoot off the airbag
three two one oh boy
hi how high do you think that gob Ryan
I'd see 30 feet 30 P I was expecting
more so the air bags started off right
here next to the sandbag and it jumped
actually all the way over here so this
is what an air bag looks like after its
deployed it looks like we've got some
smoke coming out of it nice some of that
will be talcum powder was the talc
powder for inside of it if you want
something to deploy smoothly and not
snag on itself you do the talc powder if
you want a book page to open a certain
page you can talk powder the pages
anytime you open the book it'll just
automatically is it you know there's not
the friction there with the powder looks
like the center of the steering wheel
just opened up right along that crease
it just blew out that Center seam his
bag feels like nylon feels kind of like
a canvas tarp so the air bags here and
the phone it's about 30 feet in this
direction
oh no got some more damage to the screen
good thing I know a guy who can fix
phone screens so we lost a lot of energy
during the last explosion because the
airbag actually hopped up off the ground
so we're going to take some wire this
time around and strap the airbag to the
sandbag so that it won't lose as much
energy and all of the energy will be
transferred to the phone launching it up
into the air the phone is still working
I mean it was a little bit broken before
oh look dude the phone is bent like it's
bent from the compression yeah oh
back I kinda thought that happened
iPhone 6 pin gate from an airbag okay
three three two one
and it hit
ah that was in the air for a while
secured it makes a difference it's a
whole F equals M or force equals mass
times acceleration F equals MA tied well
look this this airbags a different color
that's kind of fun
so it looks like even though we attached
wires to the airbag egg still exploded
and separated itself from the sandbags
we lost a little bit of the power but we
had what three and a half seconds to
hang time on that one this is a
significant difference so that's
incredible I think about that much power
hitting you in the face during a wreck
so I hear to you know four thousand
pound car yeah I guess it's better than
your face hitting the dashboard but you
know it's like it's a it's not a
marshmallow either though airbags have
to hurt a lot of force there there is
venting so that when your face hits it
it actually cush is it and it the travel
after impact makes a big difference
that's why they do the life-saving job
that they do where we started from way
over there landed right here looks like
there's a few more cracks on the screen
that we have a little impact crater here
even looks like yeah the ribbon just
ripped right off of that you can see
where it hit the corner here wonder if
it still works we've got some green
lines on the screen looks like the LCDs
cracked this time around which you know
a little bit to be expected either way a
new replacement screen this phone will
be as good as new
that's not too bad when you consider
that it was impacted to get it up into
the air pretty hard that's where the
bending came from and then hitting the
ground too that's respectable
yeah the inertia is lifting over here
back so big thanks to Brian without him
my youtube channel wouldn't exist when I
messaged him about my Jeep breaking down
four years ago and asked him why in the
world he makes YouTube videos he said it
was to decrease worldsuck and because
you can make a little bit of money on
YouTube so I started doing the same
thing with cell phones and that's how my
channel came to be we have a turkey and
what are we doing with this turkey this
isn't just any turkey this is a
Butterball turkey that the same size and
weight is a human head oh boy airbags
come in contact with people's heads all
the time that's what they're supposed to
do but what if your head was right
against the airbag when it went off what
kind of forces are we dealing with so
we've got a
1996 was the millennia side side-impact
airbag that we're going to launch this
turkey with so if you want to see what
happens to this turkey using an even
bigger airbag than what we were using on
this cellphone click this video right
here and show Brian some love on his
channel thanks for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
