mate 8 it is very similar to the honor
5x in this video I'll show you how to
replace the screen the battery the
charging port all the different
components it's pretty simple turn off
the phone at the bottom of the phone
there's two screws they are t2 screws I
will link all of the tools and
replacement parts in the video
description of this video and remove the
SIM card tray now the phone pops out
from the back metal housing I'm just
using a thin metal pry tool to slide
between the frame of the screen and the
frame of the phone I find it's easier to
start on the sides of the phone first
and then release the bottom of the phone
after that now don't pull the screen
away from the back housing yet my phone
did come on during the process I'm going
to turn that off really quick again
before I start messing with connections
the back fingerprint scanner is still
attached to the phone so I'm going to
unclip that like a little Lego with my
plastic pry tool and then here we can
see the back of the phone the
fingerprint scanner can be pushed
through and replaced as well as the
camera lens that can also be pushed
through and replace I will try to link
replacement parts camera lenses are
usually pretty hard to find my power
button was bent you can see that here
I'm just correcting the metal frame a
little bit with my pliers if you have
rubber tip pliers it makes it a little
bit easier when you're correcting bent
phones now there is a protective flap
over the ribbon cable connections I'm
going to remove this tamper evidence
sticker it just falls apart when you
touch it that's how Huawei knows if
you've been inside the device or not
now that metal protector is off I can
unclip the screen ribbon cable and then
here is the battery connection you might
want to start with this one so it's a
little bit safer and then here's the
Flex extension for the bottom charging
port going to pop that off on the top
there's an arrow that tells you what
direction goes up towards the top of the
phone there's a screw down here at the
bottom with another little metal flap
that protects the connection and remove
that set that off to the side and then
the extension ribbon cable can just come
away from the phone now there is a
secret trick to removing the battery try
not to bend the battery at all during
this process because it could ruin the
battery and be pretty bad for your phone
up here at the top there is a magical
pull tab do not let this pull tab break
when you're pulling on it mind snapped
halfway through but I was able to grab
the little niblet that was left and
finished pulling out the rest of the
adhesive with that when the adhesive is
stretched it loses its adhesiveness
unless you pull out the battery
easier unfortunately there is
non-magical adhesive at the bottom of
the battery so you have to use a
combination of heat and a plastic pry
tool to remove that remember no bending
the battery and definitely do not
puncture it I will try to link
replacement batteries down in the video
description below as soon as they come
available there are four screws down
here at the charging port and the
loudspeaker also going to remove this
wire cable and then there's two clips
holding an e charging port there's a
little rubber boot down here at the
bottom then the charging port itself
loudspeaker can also just pull away from
the frame of the screen make sure you
keep all your screws organized some of
them are different sizes now there are
nine screws up here for the motherboard
going to unsnap this connector for the
power buttons as well as the top of this
wire cable going to unclip that from the
board one more protective plate over the
camera connector and then the
motherboard is held in by some clasps
around the edges so pop that out is this
frosting one of the employees at the
factory must have dropped their doughnut
on the motherboard before installing it
I'll just spread this glaze back on top
good as new
and this concludes another episode of
baking with Zack
tune in next time as we pet fluffy
puppies and ride little ponies the
unedible frosting more commonly known as
thermal paste helps dissipate the heat
from the processor into the aluminum
exterior of the phone it is pretty
important the front-facing camera and
rear camera both unclip from the
motherboard with the same Lego type
connectors that we've been dealing with
the headphone jack does not come away
from the motherboard it's soldered in
place so here is the screen of the phone
the screens are actually really
inexpensive for this smartphone while
way does a great job of keeping the
replacement parts cheap in order to
replace the screen you do need to remove
it from the metal frame of the phone
you're going to reuse the frame unless
while we start selling their replacement
screens with the frame which they
haven't done in the past to remove the
LCD and glass from the frame just heat
it up with a heat gun and pry it out the
metal frame most likely will not be
damaged during this process it's pretty
resilient but the LCD and glass will be
damaged it's pretty non salvageable once
you start prying it away from the back
panel the more heat you use the easier
it is to remove it softens the adhesive
your replacement screen will come with a
ribbon cable that you'll just feed
through the frame like this and it'll
look the exact same when you plug it
back into the mother
when you install your motherboard make
sure the frosting side is down there are
a series of Clips around the outside
that will keep it in place this camera
does have oh is image stabilizing you
can see that here get those nine screws
back into place along with the little
protective metal flap over the camera
connection getting the power button
ribbon plug back in same thing with this
signal wire cable I'm going to clip that
down into place down here at the bottom
of the phone we have the loudspeaker and
the charging port board pushing that
into place you'll feel it snap in as
those plastic connections around the
sides clip it in place getting the wire
cable plugged in as well as the ribbon
cable for the loudspeaker get those four
screws back into place then we're going
to set the battery down plugging in the
ribbon cable plugging into the extension
cable for the charging port make sure
that metal plates down there at the
bottom as well and then lastly plug in
the battery putting the metal plate over
the top getting that screw back into
place and I'm going to see and make sure
that the phone is working if there are
lines in your screen it might be a bad
connection so check that ribbon cable
again and if that's still not working
you might be a defective screen so
double-check that remember I'll have all
the replacement parts linked in the
video description I'm going to plug in
the fingerprint scanner to the
motherboard and then set the front back
into the back panel I start at the top
first make sure that's seated and then
press down on both sides turn the phone
on one more time and we are good to go
the only questions leave down in the
comments I post behind the scenes stuff
on Twitter and Instagram I did do a
durability test on this phone go ahead
and click that card if you're interested
in watching how this phone holds up
against the rest of the smartphone's
these days get those two screws back in
at the bottom and you are set thanks ton
for watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
