the defining mineral a top Mohs scale of
hardness so what happens when we try and
scratch a glass i phone screen with a
real diamond let's find out as we know
from previous videos cell phone screens
usually start to scratch at a level 6 on
Mohs scale of hardness diamonds are a
level ten Mohs scale grows exponentially
so the hardness difference between a
five and a six on Mohs scale is not much
when compared to the difference between
a six and a ten the diamonds that I have
in front of me are real but they are
shaped and cut for jewelry and not
industrial applications diamond dust is
much more abrasive but we'll get to that
in a minute if I press the diamonds into
the glass nothing will happen there are
too many flat points on diamonds cut to
maximize reflections to cause any severe
damage to the iPhone but what if we use
the sharp tip on the bottom of the
diamond I have a diamond holding tool
here and we can see that even though
these rocks are not meant for cutting
they can still do some serious damage to
the glass no harm is coming to the
diamond node because of the hardness
difference a level six object cannot
scratch a level seven much less a level
ten
fun fact there is a man-made diamond
called cubic zirconia while it looks
pretty much identical to the real thing
to the average person
it only Falls around an eight point five
on Mohs scale diamonds are used in the
industrial world quite often they are
heat resistant and very hard this
particular tool has a diamond dust tip
and is used for drilling holes through
tile stone and glass it is meant to spin
inside of a drill but we can still see
the damage that is caused from the
abrasive dust on the tip any dust speck
harder than a level six on Mohs scale
will leave a mark on the glass screen of
your phone even when your phone is
inside your pocket or purse a screen
protector is always a good idea hit up
my Instagram and Twitter for
behind-the-scenes and future projects
and subscribe for more videos like this
in the future thanks it done for
watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
