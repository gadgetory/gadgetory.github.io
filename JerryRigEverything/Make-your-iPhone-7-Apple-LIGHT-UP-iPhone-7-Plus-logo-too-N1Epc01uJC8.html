showcasing an inexpensive light up local
kit for your iPhone 7 and 7 plus that
you can install to make the Apple logo
illuminate on the back of your phone
just like how the old Mac books used to
light up I figured since my stormtrooper
phone is already unique I might as well
take it to the next level and see if
these light-up logos are worth it let's
see how easy this really is just like
all the rest of my videos this will
avoid any kind of warranties you have on
your phone this whole process is pretty
similar to a battery replacement with a
few small added steps for the led after
the battery comes out I'll start by
removing the two proprietary pentalobe
screws on the bottom of the phone I'll
include a toolkit in the video
description for those of you who might
want to attempt this project once those
are out I'll use my metal pry tool sled
between the plastic edge of the screen
and the metal frame of the phone a
suction cup does help a little while
trying to get leverage on the screen
it's important to notice that the screen
folds open like a book and all the
important and fragile ribbon cables are
along that right side of the phone so
I'm keeping my metal pry tool from going
too deep inside the device along that
edge I don't want to slice through those
ribbons definitely do not put any stress
on those screen ribbons during the
opening of this phone they do break easy
now we grab the extremely uncommon Y
triple zero bit Apple does try to make
repairing their phones as difficult as
possible for the average person
luckily tool kits with the correct bits
are inexpensive there are four different
sized Y triple zero screws so keep them
organized as you set them to the side
after removing the metal plate I'll
unsnap the battery connector from the
phone using a plastic pry tool and then
make my way down to the bottom of the
battery to remove the magic pull tabs
these pull tabs are extremely fragile
but if removed successfully the battery
removal is super easy some repair guys
remove the taptic vibration motor to get
a better angle at the full tabs and that
might be a good idea since one of my
tabs broke and I had to commence the pry
of shame with the battery finally out of
the phone we get our first look at the
back of the Apple logo on the iPhone 7
this needs to come out and don't do what
I'm about to do watch closely my pry
tool slips directly stabbing the power
button ribbon cable I didn't notice at
the time but this one tiny mistake
ruined my power button and it no longer
functions I'll show you what I mean
after I reassemble the phone my razor
blade did a little better job of
grabbing under that metal iPhone logo
and peeling it up it is watertight and
pretty secure onto the back of the phone
this is a good time to mention that your
new logo
not be watertight nor will your phone be
water-resistant after you open it up so
you win some and you lose some here's
the new LED logo I'll link these in the
video description they aren't that
expensive it's touch sensitive so we'll
display a different flash pattern when
you touch it with your finger after it's
connected I'll peel off the clear
adhesive protector and then drop it down
into the frame of the phone it fits very
securely and it's flush with the back
surface of the phone even though it's
not watertight it will still keep dust
and dirt from getting inside your device
I'm still being careful with the screen
and not putting any pressure on those
display ribbons since they're still
connected to the phone now the LED gets
set on top of the white Apple logo
plastic this gets folded along that
white line so that all the circuits get
placed between the battery and the main
board and not crushed underneath the
battery then the part that rests over
the battery connector gets tucked onto
the connector itself
I found it easiest to place the new LED
connector over the battery side of the
plug first and then plug it into the
motherboard of the phone since the
screen doesn't need to be on for this
logo to start working it might light up
at this point it is LED so the extra
power depletion is minimal on the
battery I'll add some extra adhesive
strips below the battery to keep it from
rattling around inside the phone and
then I'll plug the battery into the
phone it would normally click in like a
Lego but with the extra material between
it and the plug the connection is not as
connecti it should stay in place though
there is one little extra square of
black foam included with the packaging
and this goes on top of the metal
battery plug to keep it secure once the
metal plate is screwed back on this is
the point where I realized I destroyed
my power button ribbon and that my power
button no longer functioned the phone
will still turn on when it's plugged
into a wall it's just super annoying
luckily the part I damaged only a few
dollars though so it's not too big of a
deal I got my four screws and metal
plate screwed back onto the phone as
well as folded the screen back over just
like closing a book before it can clamp
tight again the top clips need to be
tucked up into place along the top edge
of the frame of the phone and then the
rest of the screen can be gently pressed
down along the edges don't forget those
bottom two screws the LED logo is
functioning like a champ it is
capacitive and recognizes my finger
touches personally I wish it would just
glow I don't need the extra flashiness
but to each their own
the whole process took me about 20
minutes to complete and if you've never
opened up an iPhone before I would
highly recommend you do not attempt this
I'm pretty experienced and I still
manage to break stuff during the process
but like always you get to make your own
decisions and I'll include the LED logo
link in the video description I think
there are multiple color variations just
don't let your mom get me in
trouble when you break your phone hit
that subscribe button if you enjoyed
watching this video even if you're never
actually going to try it yourself and
hit that thumbs up to help me feel
better about breaking my own power
button would you ever attempt this
project or do you prefer the original
logo do you think Apple should start
including this on all their phones let
me know down in the comments thanks ton
for watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
