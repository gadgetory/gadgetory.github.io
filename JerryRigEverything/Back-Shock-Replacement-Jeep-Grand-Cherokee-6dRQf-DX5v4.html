work on a 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee
replacing the back shocks basically this
this video will show how to replace the
fingers on any Grand Cherokee from 92 to
98 I believe anyway so we start just by
loosening the nuts now this is an 18
millimeter I believe the other side is a
15 you're twisting them off these ones
are pretty rusted on there the one up
here there's only one you got to worry
about it's an 18 millimeter as well what
I've done because these are rusty you
can see this is I've taken my ratchet
and I've also attached a wrench onto the
end of it to kind of give more leverage
so when I grab the wrench it kind of
extends in my reach a little bit so I
have more torque on the bolt works out
pretty well I've already gotten it
loosed up so that's what we're doing
right now we're just releasing all the
bolts as you can see this thing is
pretty hashed it's all rusted up what
you get for living in those southern
states when I've done on the bottom here
I've lined my 15 millimeter wrench up
with that side and I'm just letting it
rest against the ground so it'll do all
my holding work for me and I can just
press this forward and just keep on
ratcheting it as the as the wrench holds
the other side of the bolt steady right
here you can see a considerable
difference in quality of shock bonds
brand-new many other ones just freakin
rusted anyway besides the shock out of
the vehicle I just got these little that
head right there that sits in and then
this little notch right here there it
also sits in pretty pretty
straightforward so when you're
installing it it's relatively simply no
the top part just because there's the
sleeve on it think about it like as if
water was running down it wouldn't go
inside the sleeve the sleeve is here to
protect it from you know being like a
cup and holding the water up and down
in it so as the car goes up and down it
protects the whole whole shock anyway
make sure the nut is on the inside of
the vehicle facing away from the tire
and the top has a washer on it as well
so make sure the big washer goes inside
of the nut that's let's say you install
a shock on a Jeep Grand Cherokee
probably one of the simpler shocks that
I've done anyway I do throw up videos on
YouTube every every week or so so if if
this helped you make sure to LIKE and
subscribe so one last look at these
awesome shocks and they're the exact
same on both sides so it's pretty simple
to put on and off
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
