and it's finally time for the hands on experience
you've all been waiting for.
Samsung has basically kept the same build
style as last year...and the year before...and
the year before that.
And they have never really failed a durability
test yet so it's working for them.
But it's time to see what happens with this
new Galaxy S9.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
The Galaxy S9 is still rocking the Gorilla
Glass 5 on the screen this year, but this
time the glass is a bit thicker which is supposedly
going to help with drop protection.
I'll have the drop test in a future video,
but as of now we're still scoring the same
on the scratch test as other flagships.
It'll scratch at a level 6 and a deeper groove
at a level 7.
HTC is still holding that top spot with their
scratch resistant sapphire crystal display,
scratching at a level 8.
Tempered glass is pretty normal for smartphones
these days.
At least razor blades, coins and keys won't
do any damage.
The bottom of the phone has digital buttons
underneath that glass so nothing new to check
down here.
The earpiece is sitting flush and tight inside
it's little slot.
It is metal with little holes protecting it
from dirt and metal shavings attracted to
that magnet underneath.
It's a smart design and better than some of
the cloth ones we've seen before on other
phones.
The 8 megapixel front facing camera is sitting
under the front glass and protected from scratches.
The sides of the phone come with a thin plastic
covering protecting that painted surface underneath.
I'll peel that off so we can get some adequate....verification
of material.
[Scratching sounds.]
Yeah, it's metal.
One cool thing about this phone is that Samsung
has upgraded the aluminum so it is more scratch
and impact resistant.
This has added about 8 grams of weight to
the phone since the glass is a bit thicker
too.
But in my mind weight is associated with quality
so I'm fine with these upgraded materials.
The SD card slot up top is upgraded to hold
an impressive 400 gigabytes of whatever you
need that many gigabytes for.
It's nice to have more features than you could
ever need on a phone.
All the buttons are made from metal...and
oh!
Samsung took that dedicated Bixby button that
nobody wants and upgraded it to version 2.0.
So that's cool.
Down here at the bottom of the phone we have
the USB-C slot, as well as the headphone jack,
which makes the S9 definite daily driver material.
I don't use a 3.5 jack often, but it's incredibly
nice to have on the phone when I do need it.
The camera on the back of the phone is where
we start to see some pretty significant improvements
over the Galaxy S8, which I'll get to more
in a second.
This 12 megapixel sensor is still protected
by glass, and thankfully the fingerprint scanner
is now below the camera in a much more reachable
location.
Thumbs up for that Samsung.
The fingerprint scanner can get scratched
by my razor blade though, so we'll give it
a little test to see if it still works.
And even with that much damage to the surface,
it still functions like a champ.
Pretty solid.
Now let's see what that camera can do.
One thing Samsung did add this year is something
called the AR emoji which makes a little resemblance
of yourself and sticks it on screen.
It's pretty similar to Animoji that we saw
on the iPhone X.
But if you look closely at my lips, one follows
a lot closer than the other one does.
Fun fact, you can change different hairstyles,
and in real life, back in high school, my
hair looked a lot more like this.
No joke.
If you scroll back far enough on my Instagram
you can probably see a couple more pictures.
Long story short, if you're into animated
characters, iPhone's probably going to be
the way to go â€“ the lips actually work.
So dbrand did say they were going to send
me some new skins to show off in this video.
I haven't seen them yet though, so I'll just
leave a link down in the video description.
You can check out their new selection so you
can hide the fingerprints on the back of this
glass sandwich.
Thank you dbrand for sponsoring this video,
and I'll let you know if your camo skins ever
show up.
The feature that impresses me the more with
this Galaxy S9 is the rear camera.
This is the first smartphone camera with a
dual aperture sensor inside.
It's got a mechanical system that can expand
and contract to let more light hit the sensor.
Professional camera lenses have this and it's
incredibly cool to see it start making it's
way into the smartphone world.
Better pictures for everyone to enjoy.
We'll have to take a look at this from the
inside during the teardown.
The larger S9 Plus also adds a telephoto lens
to the phone, which is impressive.
Here I'm adjusting the aperture manually in
Pro mode.
You can see the light difference as I jump
from a 1.5 to a 2.4.
The 1.5 will help considerably in low light
situations.
The back glass of the Galaxy S9 makes Art
Class with Jerry impossible.
The Samsung logo is still on the underside
of the glass and won't ever scratch or run
off...well, unless you want a clear S9 of
course.
Let me know in the comments if I should turn
this phone transparent.
It's time for the burn test.
Bixby 2.0 is already getting in the way, so
I'll just roast him for a second.
This HDR 101440p 5.8 inch super AMOLED display
lasted 12 seconds before the pixels started
to go white.
After I removed the flame, the pixels did
start to recover which doesn't always happen
with LED displays.
The oleophobic coating though, never survives
the burn test.
You can see my fingerprints still on the surface
of the glass, so it's important not to try
this at home.
It's cool to see the Samsung screen recover
though, even though the only person who probably
ever deals with this kind of damage is me.
And now the bend test.
Samsung has never failed my durability test
before, and with this upgraded aluminum frame,
the results are consistent, surviving both
flexes from the front and the back.
With the Galaxy S7 a few years ago, we had
some glass separation during the bend which
compromised the water proofing.
But with the Galaxy S9, even with the abuse,
the glass is still sealed and the ip68 rating
is intact.
Another solidly built phone from Samsung and
a good choice for anyone looking to upgrade.
I've personally been using the S8 Plus for
the past year, and while this new phone is
indeed tempting, it's not enough for me to
switch my stuff over.
I'll probably hold off and see if the next
Note has anything worth switching for, or
maybe I'll jump ship entirely and use another
Android phone from a different company.
Let's just see what 2018 brings.
Huge thanks again to dbrand for sponsoring
this video.
The camouflage skins are pretty sneaky.
Check the link in the description to see all
their new stuff, and then come hang out with
me on Instagram.
Maybe I'll post some more old school hair
pictures.
Thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
