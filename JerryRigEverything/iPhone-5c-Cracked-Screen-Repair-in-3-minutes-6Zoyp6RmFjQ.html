how to replace the iPhone 5c screen in
three minutes
first of all just take out the bottom
screws these are the same size screws
with all the other iphones so any of
those pentalobe screw drivers will work
there's two screws right next to the
charging force take those out and this
second step is a little bit harder i'm
you need a suction cup and a plastic pry
tool so lift up with the suction cup and
just kind of twist your pry tool in
there to lift up the screen out of the
bottom latches once is lifted up gently
pry it away from the body and the other
latches along the side of the screen
will pull up as well be very careful
with the spring screen especially if
it's broken or cracked next there's four
screws along this plate there are three
different sizes so make sure that when
you take the screws out you put them in
a place where you're going to remember
where they go when you have to
reassemble the phone later once this
metal plate is off there are four little
latches that you have to lift up they're
kind of like Legos just kind of pry up
and unsnap them one by one
technically you don't have to do the one
on the bottom the left that's one just
attach the battery and I got a little
carried away and decided to do it anyway
anyway once the three important ones are
unlatched your screen is off now depends
on where you get your screen you might
have a few more steps you might have to
take the home button and replace it but
you can replace this back panel as well
but all you have to do is just loosen up
those screws and transfer it right over
to the new screen once you've done that
you can take the latches little ribbon
cables and snap them into place just
like Legos be very very gentle with
these because if you rip them you will
have problems one of them does go to the
earpiece so you might need to swap that
over as well just depending on where you
get your screen Amazon usually has the
cheapest screen so I will list them in
the video description below as soon as
they become available take your four
screws that you kept organized earlier
and pop them into place
bring them in this is just your regular
Phillips head screwdriver and then make
sure the top is aligned and snap the
screen gently into place there will be a
series of satisfying clicks as you press
the phone back together again
and as you can see the phone is
completely back together it looks
exactly like new
there is no raises in the screen it is
all flush just like it was before don't
forget to put your bottom two screws
back in and you are set
