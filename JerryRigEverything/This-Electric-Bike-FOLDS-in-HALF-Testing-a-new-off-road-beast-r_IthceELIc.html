tech that I've seen this year they're
fast they have a lot of range and they
keep on getting better and better you
might remember from the previous video
where I reviewed the rad power bikes and
how awesome those were out in the snow
these bikes are quite a bit less
expensive and can still do the same
stuff Ankur sent me both these bikes to
review on my channel so I'm gonna unbox
them take them out for a spin see how
they work and give you my opinion let's
get started
in the last couple years electric
vehicles like Electric skateboards
electric bikes electric cars have all
been coming more and more prevalent in
the news and online they're getting
easier and easier to buy all the time
and that's because the technology is
constantly improving while you buy this
year will be completely different than
what you can buy next year because it's
improving so fast now I haven't taken
these bikes apart yet but I imagine that
these are powered by the same circular
lithium ion batteries that we see inside
of like the Tesla cars that anchor power
house that I took apart last week and
the previous rad power bike remember
I'll link all this stuff down to video
descriptions you can check it out and
see the specs and things but it's really
exciting to see how things are
progressing over time and just because
things are getting so good so rapidly
doesn't mean you have to hold off and
wait to buy one yeah technology is
always improving but there's no need to
hold off when things are as good as they
are right now you've outdone yet yeah I
mean I think I got it the horn sounds
like some kind of SOS signal works
pretty well so this bike right here is
called the rat pack and this is what
I've reviewed before last year you know
we took it out in the snow it's got
these huge thick tires this is the bike
that was just barely sent to me from the
anchor company it's also got some pretty
thick tires not quite as big as the Red
Rover but still pretty massive
personally I think the anchor bike does
look a little cooler it's got the red
accents all over the middle frame and
here along the seat as well it's a
pretty good-looking bike I'll talk about
this one here in a second it's quite a
different
looking beef but we'll get to that after
we're done riding the big boys another
benefit of this anchor bike is that it
does have a fender on the back that
keeps like the mud and snow from
flipping up on your backpack if you're
going to school or going to work or
something like that
this bike does not have a fender on the
back or the front this one does have a
fender on the front but I just didn't
install it so we'll put that on later so
the biggest difference between these two
bikes I mean they're both fat tires
they're both electric they both have
motors in the back the biggest
difference is price the one that I got
sent from Amazon is about $800 and the
one over here the red power bike that is
about $1,500 now in order to test these
we're gonna do a couple different things
we're gonna ride them side by side see
what the acceleration is and I've
enlisted the help of my brother his name
is Spencer to help me out so in order to
turn on the red power bike there's a
power button right here along the side I
can just press that that gets the power
going up here to the console this is
also a secondary power button and so
here we can see the miles per hour how
many total miles it has the wattage the
pedal assist mode and how much battery
has left now this bike is a little bit
different this is the one I got from
Amazon right here there is a key that
needs to be turned on so if you lose the
key the bike will not work that's a
little bit annoying and then it has a
handle that flips up this is how you
charge it right here plugs into the wall
and then the whole battery pack can be
removed so you can swap these out if you
want seat lifts up battery pulls out see
it goes back in and then here the
heads-up display is not quite as
in-depth is over on the rad power bike
but you just hold on the power button
for three seconds and the whole thing
turns on it still has the pedal assist
modes the low medium and high and then
I'm guessing this as the battery
indicator we haven't burned this down
enough this is my first time riding this
bike both of the bikes have the LEDs in
the front so you can ride them at night
and this one has your standard five
gears in the back and then this one also
has the same gear setup so a standard
five gears and the throttle location is
in the same spot is right here just kind
of like a motorcycle you just grab that
pull it and it starts accelerating the
whole bike alright so I am currently not
pedaling my bike everything is going off
of the electricity now the top speed of
this thing is rated right around 16
miles per hour now legally electric bike
can't go faster than 20 miles per hour
or that makes them like a street-legal
vehicle or something like that so I
think the rad power bike maxes out of 20
so technically it's probably gonna win
this race but there's only one way to
find out all right Spence you ready
okay so what's gonna happen right now is
we're both gonna take off you know we
have our little throttles right here the
bikes are both powered on and ready to
go and we're gonna take it and we're
gonna go along this path wind around and
end up at that bridge over there okay
Kanna one two three I'm maxed out
all right so were you on the throttle
the whole time or did you let off around
the corners I let off on the corners
okay I did the same thing but you
definitely pulled away much quicker than
I did your acceleration was a lot more
all right so this time around we're
gonna do a straight away shot see what
the top speed is and to see what the
acceleration is like without like a turn
and it looks pretty sweet this straight
away shot right here with the mountains
in the background and I think we have
the drone positioned somewhere up there
you ready let's do it three two one go
top speed no pedaling
I'm coming alright Spencer so the top
speed of your bike was faster than mine
and it also accelerated quicker so is it
worth double the price
I think this bike would be a good
starter bike maybe not as good of a
commuter bike as the rad bike so after
looking into a little bit more the motor
on the rad power bike the one that my
brother was riding that one is a 750
watt motor and what just means like how
much power it has the motor on the
anchor bike or the ain't sure but I was
writing is a 300 watt motor the motor on
the anchor bike even though it's half
the price it's also half the power the
physical features of the bike are the
same but when it comes to that motor
size it just doesn't have the oomph and
consistency that the larger motor does
so I guess at this stage in the electric
vehicle game you're kind of getting what
you pay for and at this moment paying
double gets you twice the size of motor
so that's just something to consider
when buying an electric bike alright so
if you remember from the first part of
this video they actually sent me two
bikes and this one is quite a bit
different than the first one not just
because of how it looks but how it
behaves this whole bike can unfold in
half and then the whole thing can just
lock into place like that so it won't
fold in half while you're riding it so
the biggest difference between this bike
and the other bike is obviously that it
folds in half as well as the smaller
tire size and the battery location is
actually right here on the front inside
of this little pouch instead of under
like the back side of the bike like it
was before but it still has the top
speed of 16 miles per hour and it's a
lot lighter and more portable and when I
say light I would say it's probably
about thirty pounds give or take 35
pounds because batteries and motors
still weigh quite a bit so right here
there is a major shock in the backs like
if I press down on the back seat there's
some major absorption going on there and
this one also has shocks on the front
tire
which is quite a bit different than the
mountain-bike which had no shocks on the
front tire it just had the huge fat
tires so even though this bike is a
little bit smaller as far as like the
tires and stuff go
the motor is smaller as well the total
price of this bike is 750 bucks and the
motor is a 250 watt versus the 300 watt
that we've tried before and the 750 watt
from the rad power bike it's cheaper
lighter but also slightly less powerful
I'll have all the pricing and stuff
linked down the video description and
the most important thing is when you're
buying these bikes make sure you read
the reviews about them like I have
tested these initially and I've given my
opinion on them but your best bet is
going to be reading reviews from other
customers who have tested the bikes
before you can usually trust what the
reviews say either way I really like
where this electronic technology is
headed in the future I think everything
is going to be electric bikes cars
anything every mode of transportation is
going to be electric so I'm gonna pack
this thing back up I'll flip this up
unlatch it here and the whole thing can
fold in half anyway if you have any
questions about any of these bikes or
any electric vehicles that you want me
to test in the future Tesla is on the
schedule let me know down in the
comments leave a thumbs up if you like
this video and thanks a ton for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
