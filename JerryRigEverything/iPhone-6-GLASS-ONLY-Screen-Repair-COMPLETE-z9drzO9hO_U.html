the glass on an iPhone 6 if you want to
see me take apart the phone go ahead and
click the link in the upper left hand
corner I have already taken off the back
metal plate the home button the earpiece
and now the little plastic bit for the
camera the rubber piece for the earpiece
and the little plastic square up top you
will be using these on your new glass
when you install it be super super
careful with these little ribbon cables
here if you tweak or bend them too much
they will stop working grab a heat gun
and heat up your screen uniformly across
the whole surface you don't have any hot
spots between 70 and 95 degrees Celsius
is what's worked for me in the past if
you have a little laser temperature
sensor it's really easy to keep the
temperature where you need it to be now
I tried removing just a frame because
with the iPhone 5 and 5c and 5s that's
how you do it just a glass repair but on
this phone the frame is very securely
glued to the glass and does not come off
unfortunately it makes us repair much
harder so I took some of the smaller
shards of glass and lift them out with
my razor blade you can see that I'm
sliding the razor blade underneath the
glass not lifting up too high you don't
want to create a teeter-totter effect
and put too much pressure on the
digitizer underneath it's literally as
fragile as an eggshell
now that I have a slightly wider opening
I can take my playing card and use it to
separate the glass from the LCD because
of the heat that we put on it before is
kind of liquefied the glue so using the
combination of razor blades heat and
playing cards we're going to accomplish
this whole repair
anyways heating the phone back up to its
safe temperature range again remember if
you go too hot you're going to burn the
LCD so make sure to heat it up if it's
too hot to touch you probably went too
far with the heat I'm taking the card
and sliding it between the frame and the
glass and it's super important to
remember that no matter how boring I get
during this repair you're probably going
to want to watch the whole thing because
I'm going to be dropping tips the whole
way now that we're away from the LCD and
digitizer I can use my knife a little
more comfortably I'm going to make a
slot between the frame and the glass so
I can slide my card because it really
does make the repair a whole lot easier
once you don't have to do
with that frame in the way the card can
slide between the glass and LCD so I'm
going to eat the phone back up the phone
cools down obviously pretty quickly so
I'm going to be heating it up about
every 30 to 40 seconds just so I can
stay within that safe range you can see
that as the phone starts to cool down
the card doesn't slide as well between
the glass I could speed this part up but
then you wouldn't realize how slow and
meticulous this whole process is plus
removing tiny shards of glass from an
extremely fragile digitizer has got to
be on pretty bunch everyone's bucket
list so consider yourselves lucky to be
blessed with this fascinating spectacle
as you embark on a journey of a lifetime
also don't plan for the perfect
replacement even though mine worked it
was not completely perfect this repair
is best if you are already planning on
buying a new screen anyway and you just
want to try it just the glass repair for
kicks and giggles and not as a first
plan of action now just grab your heat
gun and heat that phone up to the
correct temperature again you can see
that I'm still between the frame and the
glass so taking off this big chunk right
here is pretty easy because I don't have
to deal with the frame honestly a year
or two down the road it might just be
worth it to buy a whole screen and not
deal with just a glass swap it would be
more cost-effective to buy the whole
screen as a unit the prices the screens
do drop over time you can check the
price of current screens down in the
video description below now if you look
up in the corner you can see another
link to a vo made last year called Tips
&amp;amp; Tricks three common mistakes that
people make when replacing just the
glass
I do recommend watching that if you are
serious about doing this repair yourself
I talked about things to avoid while
working on your phone plus it's
interesting because I actually break
screens in that video the video was very
expensive to make at the time as I'm
getting towards the edge of the frame I
take my razor blade and slide it between
the glass and the frame and this does
make it a little bit easier to get the
card between the LCD and the glass once
again the frame is really hard to work
with as a shame that it's glued on so
tight so this repair is really hard
chances are you're going to be working
along minding your business when out of
the blue your LCD is going to snap
you're going to think holy cow that
jerry-rigged guy was right this
digitizer is really fragile
if you lift up too high on this edge
it's going to drive the other edge into
the digitizer itself kind of like a
teeter-totter effect so you want to make
sure to slide the card horizontally
underneath the glass and not lift up too
much otherwise you'll end up with a
broken LCD if you also if you heat the
screen up too much you're going to end
up with like yellow or burn marks on the
LCD that's why I say heat the whole
screen up uniformly that way you don't
concentrate the heat in one spot and
cause those burn marks anyway go super
super slow you know that feeling you get
when you're driving down the road and
you see a cop and you freaked out for a
second because you have no idea how fast
you're actually going you should feel
that way during this entire repair a
little bit stressed out anxious nervous
you never know when the whole screen is
going to break kind of like finals week
of college when you haven't exactly been
going to all your classes just kidding
mom I totally went to all of my classes
like all of the days that there was
class to go to
I was definitely there back to the
repair sliding the card underneath the
glass still end up along the top this
piece of glass was connected to the
frame of the phone still but since we're
so close to the edge on this one I
decided not to mess with the glass
otherwise I might crack it along the
corner so I separated the glass from the
LCD and just left it there and I would
deal with it later since it wasn't
exactly connected at this point
this piece didn't allow me a whole lot
of access to either so I didn't lift up
on it I slid around got this second
piece off over here and then went back
to that one later I know you'd rather be
watching paint dry or grass grow but
this is extremely helpful to see the
whole process done start to finish so
hang in there while you're here you
might as well hit that subscribe button
down below it helps to keep me motivated
making tutorials like this in the future
also check out my Instagram I promised
my life is not as boring as this video
makes it seem I'm going to keep on
removing these itty-bitty shards of
glass lucky for me my screen was pretty
cracked up so I can remove the glass
pieces individually I imagine if you
just have one long crack or you know
several small cracks it would be a
harder repair because you don't have as
many access points as you get close to
the edge in the corners be super careful
because the screen the LCD and digitizer
are more fragile along those points and
also remember to watch out for the
ribbon cables up top you really don't
want to bend or tweak those or put any
pressure on them at all they are super
fragile slide my knife along the edge of
that frame to get the glass shards off
it really is amazing how well the frame
grips the glass during this repair
it also is interesting to note that as
you get rid of the glass the phone
actually cools down faster so you'll
find yourself heating the phone up more
and more as there's less glass on the
phone it kind of retains less heat than
it did when there was a full sheet of
glass on top anyway
we are almost there give me a thumbs up
down below if you've managed to stay
awake this long I promise the glass is
almost often well we will continue with
the repair I'm going to show you the
glue here in just a second now the glass
is off of this is the LCD as you can see
it's pretty darn dirty at the moment but
before we start cleaning it I want to
make sure I'm not wasting my time so I'm
going to make sure that it still works
plugging into the phone slightly
dangerous obviously I'm going to go
ahead and turn it on everything looks
good so far make sure to slide things
around a little bit make sure that the
screen is working obviously if the
screens not working at this point
there's nothing you can do especially if
you've made sure the connections are
good and everything and you can just
scratch repair by the whole screen and
put it back together again with a new
screen on it I'm getting out the glass
off of the old frame because we are
going to reuse that frame with the new
glass that we bought also check the
video description down below I have
replacement parts and tools listed down
below everything that you will need for
this repair will be there so I'm taking
a plastic pry tool and scraping the glue
off of the glass there is too little
doohickeys up at the top I don't know
what they are but they look important so
make sure not to scratch those off
during your cleaning process you're just
going to take your plastic pry tool and
just scrape all the glue off you can
kind of imagine it being similar to
scraping sticky gum off of an eggshell
except for that if you break this
eggshell it will end up costing you a
lot of money so make sure you go super
slow and be super careful remember that
the corners are the most fragile part of
the screen so be really careful as
you're working around the corners and
the edges once you're done scraping all
the major glue chunks off you can take
your alcohol and a rubbing pad and just
kind
rub it around on the screen and that'll
get rid of a lot of the glue residue and
you can take your pry tool and scrape
off any remaining chunks the whole
process took me about 15 or 20 minutes
to get the screen clean and you can see
here that - a few scratches everything
is still working the glue that I use
will fill up the scratches on the phones
you will not notice them once the new
glass is in place which is nice
everything still works make sure you
turn the phone completely off before you
move the LCD again and here is the loca
glue loca is an ultraviolet activated
optically clear adhesive it's a very
complicated name but a very simple
concept I'm going to put the glue on and
you want to make sure not to use too
much because it is a very hard to clean
substance it will stick on the phone and
is just not easy to clean off plus along
the edges if you get glue on the edges
it will discolor your LCD so you want to
really make sure that no glue gets on
the edge of your phone you can see at
the end of this video my LCD did have
some seepage inside and you can see the
discoloration and the mistakes that I
made towards the end so right now I'm
going to going to set the glass on top
of the screen and this is real time it's
not sped up or slowed down the reason
I'm doing it so slowly is because as the
glue touches the glass you want to make
sure that no air bubbles get caught
inside of there because the air bubbles
are hard to get rid of so the you really
just want to go slow and make sure that
the glue is going in one straight line
and not grasping all the little air
pockets so the moral the story is to go
slow kind of like this video is a fairy
tale that you'll watch every night
before falling asleep you know slow and
steady wins the race I should probably
write like a children's book or
something it would probably put
everybody to sleep so this will make
your life a lot easier if you use a mold
like this you put the LCD in put the
glue on it and then it'll put the glass
exactly where you want it on top now for
this video I'm not going to use a mold
just keep in mind
that you want to line it up with both
the left and the right sides of the
screen keeping it the same distance on
either side and also keeping in mind
that if you mess up even half of a
millimeter your phone's not going to
line up with the old frame that you took
off of your old screen so now that I
have it positioned over the LCD so that
you don't see the LCD anymore I'm
putting the UV light over the glue which
is causing it to cure or dry without the
UV light the glue would stay liquid so I
put over for about you know 10 seconds
or so lifted it up and I'm doing any
last-minute adjustments to the LCD that
I need to since I've adjusted it I'm
going to glue a little bit more which
will drive the little bit more and allow
me to do any more adjustments granted if
you were using a frame for the phone or
like a mold you wouldn't need to do this
since the screen is in the exact place
where I need to I'm going to go ahead
and cure it the last time for about 2 or
3 minutes and it should be dry now
here's another mistake as I was cleaning
off the glue I would kind of like force
the glue into the LCD on the sides
causing the discoloration that you see
in the end of this video so make sure
that you avoid getting glue on the sides
of the LCD at all possible it will
definitely save you some time and
headache later so with the frame of the
screen you want to use some double-sided
sticky tape and you want to use some
permanent stuff because this screen does
need to stay very very securely attached
to the frame without it your screen will
lift off grant it if you have a case
that would help keep your screen
attached to the phone as well so I would
recommend putting a case on after you
get this baby put back together again if
you need to see how to put your screen
back together again go ahead and click
the link it's the same one you clicked
on at the beginning of this video it
will show you to put the home button and
earpiece and the whole phone back
together again and here you go you can
see the slight discoloration at the top
and the bottom of my screen this is from
the glue seeping into the LCD other than
that the phone worked really really well
the LCD wasn't lined up perfectly with
the frame but it's usable so if you were
to buy a mold and if you were to keep
the glue from entering the LCD this
would have been a perfect
repair anyway hopefully you can learn
from my mistakes hope you liked the
