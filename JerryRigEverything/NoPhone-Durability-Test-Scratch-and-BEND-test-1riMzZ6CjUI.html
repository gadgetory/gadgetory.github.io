phone for people addicted to real phones
the back of the package claims more than
10,000 of these have been sold now The
Wall Street Journal has been known to
report things out of context though so
who knows what the real number might be
but with zero gigs of storage no Wi-Fi
and a solid black display the specs are
interesting enough but is it durable
that's what we're here to find out let's
get started
the exterior packaging is
less-than-impressive
doesn't even come in a normal box but
there is a small paper with instructions
the no-fun of the technology free
alternative to constant hand the phone
contact that helps you stay connected to
the real world so if you're on a date
you hold the no phone and look at your
date but let's be honest if you actually
bought this you probably won't ever have
to worry about that situation the front
of the no phone is obviously decide with
the home button and the earpiece it's
even got our front-facing camera we'll
start with the scratch test my most pics
tell us where the material falls on Mohs
scale of hardness most smartphones with
a tempered glass screen scratch at level
six
the little toothpick has a plastic tip
and the plastic rubbing on plastic
doesn't do too much damage but the level
three thick started to leave some
permanent marks there aren't too many
plastic screen phones out there the
droid turbo - the galaxy s7 edge and the
Nintendo switch but they do exist the
level 4 pic left an even deeper groove
on the phone people always comment
asking how I can live with myself after
damaging so many devices on my youtube
channel and it's actually pretty easy I
lost most of my soul paying for
textbooks in college the home button is
down at the bottom of the display and
it's not so much of a button but more of
a pad and it probably doesn't scan
fingerprints very well it works just as
well after the scratching as it did
before the scratching though so that's
good the earpiece of the top seems to be
made out of plastic and even after being
heavily scratched it's still 100%
waterproof this is probably the only
device I will ever say is waterproof
every other phone is only
water-resistant there's a hugely
important difference in the wording
waterproof is truly impressive the front
0 megapixel camera lens is covered by
the same material that is over the
screen so it's going to be equally prone
to scratching the most unfortunate part
is is that the camera does not come with
oh is and y'all know I ain't about that
nan-oh is life so I won't be able to
make this my daily driver purely for
that reason alone the rear camera is
equally lacking in OIS but it does have
that outer lip tile protect the inner
lens from damage
there's literally no glass anywhere to
be found on this back panel and you want
to know something else that can't be
found the headphone jack which means
this solid block of black plastic is
eerily similar to the iPhone 7 when it
comes to functionality now a few hundred
years ago in the sixteenth century
France changed up their yearly calendar
moving New Year's Day from April to
January some French citizens obviously
didn't get the memo and continued
celebrating New Year's on the wrong day
celebrating a holiday on the wrong day
is a valid reason to get made fun of
with time April first became left with
salt they are real or the fish of April
it became accustomed to tape a paper
fish to someone's back without them
noticing pranks were a little more chill
back then and that's why a fish is now
on the back of this phone I'll be honest
with all that plastic i legit think
would be cool if no phone released a
more premium metal version in the future
a flagship no phone the power button is
made of plastic as well and over here it
looks like we have either a full-size
USB port or maybe it's just a whole
button full size USB port would be
pretty sweet though it's time for the
burn test a normal cell phone would last
anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds before
getting a reaction even the Nintendo
switch lasted 15 seconds before the
screen got disfigured the no phone
started black and then well just stayed
black but after about 10 seconds it got
all bubbly and stuff at this point you
might be wondering what series of your
life decisions led you to be watching a
grown man scratching a plastic block on
the Internet and I'll be honest I'm not
quite sure either but if you need to
pause the video and rethink your life
that's okay with me the rest of us will
be watching the bin test most phones do
survive this ultimate test of build
quality and the no phone is no different
the solid slab of black plastic will
definitely stand the test of time
whether it's in your back pocket front
pocket or even ran over by a semi truck
or jumbo jet it's an incredibly durable
device if there's someone in your life
who might be a little too attached to
their phone maybe they need to see this
video or better I'll put a link in the
video description for those of you who
need a no phone of your very own
no phone very well could be an accurate
foreshadow of the next iPhone if Apple
courageously keeps removing features
like they have in the past behind the
scenes now must be found on my Twitter
and Instagram and happy April 1st
everybody thanks a ton for watching and
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
