apart the Galaxy Note 3 from Samsung so
pop out the S pin I'm going to link all
the tools and parts that I know of in
the video description below Amazon is
usually where I get all my stuff from
here is a diagram of the screws that you
need to release there's a little just
tiny Phillips head screwdriver so get
all those screws out take the battery
out and then grab right here and kind of
lift up with your fingernail and it will
help you slide the pry tool between the
plastic and the screen itself and that
will release the back plastic from the
phone there's a few little latches up
along the top as well but once you get
it started it's pretty easy to just
slide your tool around and pop off the
rest of the back one cool thing that
Samsung has done actually as they've
taken the microphone and put it on the
back of the phone so there's two little
connectors right there that go on to the
charging port and that's where the
microphone gets its power and its
connection to the phone from so I'm
going to show you how to to take off the
charging port right now there's just a
little latch up at the top it's kind of
like a little Lego piece that snaps on
and then I'm sliding my pry tool
underneath the charging port to release
it it's kind of just stuck on it with
sticky tape a little bit of glue and
that is the charging port the micro USB
3.0 that Samsung has started putting on
their devices the note is the first one
to have this kind of charging port
anyway once you get your new one you can
put it back on these are usually you
know once the part becomes available
they're pretty cheap so just check the
video description below for that anyway
so if that's all you're doing you're
done um if you want to keep on going and
replace the screen of the phone this is
a little wire cable that just latches on
just make sure to clip it back into
place when you're done
if you want to replace the screen of
your device there's a little bit more
you have to do there six little ribbon
cables there's those three is four and
five and six are right there you just
have to flip these up and out just like
a little Lego pieces they clip up and
out there's another one right here and
another one right here by the headphone
jack just be really careful with this
because if you rip any of these cables
you're out of luck and there's one more
down here by the yes bin so once you get
those all up and off the motherboard
comes free and the motherboard is
attached to the camera as well so if you
want to replace the 13 megapixel camera
just take the same little ribbon
connector pop it up and out your camera
is off so if you ever get any weird
purple dots or anything that's messing
with your cameras buy the replacement
and pop it into place now this is the
screen of the phone this is what you
have to replace if you crack your screen
you've got the digitizer on the front
and then the LCD the Super AMOLED screen
underneath you cannot separate the two
so if you break your screen that's the
part you have to replace anyway I will
leave those in the video description
below and to put your phone back
together just take the motherboard press
it into place make sure the camera goes
in the little square slot that it came
from and then just press the little
ribbon cables back into place just like
Legos and then we'll you'll hear a
little click each time that you get it
in the right spot let's get the charging
port cable back into place connect it to
the motherboard again and then the back
will also clip into place to start at
the top and clip around the edges all
the way around and then there's all
those screws again so here's the diagram
of where those go
they're all the same size the only to
worry about you know which one goes
where it's pretty pretty straightforward
and you wanna get the battery back in
there turn it on make sure you get your
SIM card back in there as well in your
SD card make sure you take those out
before you start taking apart the phone
anyway thanks for watching I put a
videos on a fairly regular basis I have
I get access to a lot of cool phones
take on part as soon as I get the chance
anyway don't forget to subscribe don't
forget to like its video helped in if
you have any questions make sure to
leave them in the comments below you can
