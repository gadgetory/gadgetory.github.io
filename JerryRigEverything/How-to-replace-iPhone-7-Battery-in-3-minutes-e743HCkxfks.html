the battery is replaced in a
regular-sized iPhone 7 the biggest
problem people will have with this
repair is damaging the screen in the
removal process so be very careful
always attempt any repairs at your own
risk turn off the phone and there are
two pentalobe screws at the bottom these
are the same type of screw that Apple
has used in previous versions of the
iPhone I will include all the tools you
need for this project right below this
video in the video description now
because of all the waterproofing
adhesive around the edge of the screen a
suction cup isn't going to help out a
whole lot plus there are a few ribbon
cables you have to watch out for and
I'll show you those in a second so to
remove this screen I'm taking a thin
metal pry tool and going between the
metal frame of the phone and the plastic
frame of the screen and gently lifting
it away from the edge slicing through
any remaining adhesives on the side lift
up gently we want to make sure not to
damage any parts of the screen as we do
this here are those sensitive ribbon
cables I was talking about earlier do
not damage this there is adhesive on the
top of the screen as well cut through
that with a metal pry tool and slide the
screen down a little and then opens up
like an $800 book remember it is
excruciatingly ly important that you do
not damage or put any stress on these
ribbon cables along the side there for
the screen and if they get damaged your
screen might stop working and will need
to be replaced Apple can't seem to use
normal screws so whip out your wide
triple-zero tripoint bit to remove all
four of these screws since most normal
people don't have one of these laying
around I'll include a good inexpensive
tool kit in the video description
keep your screws organized one screw is
longer than the others and we don't want
that going in the wrong hole later on
this ribbon is for the battery itself so
we're going to unsnap that just like a
little Lego some people would suggest
removing this oversized taptic motor
down here at the bottom to get better
access to the pull tabs it's just three
screws in a ribbon cable but I prefer to
just grab the pull tabs without removing
extra components these pull tabs are
magical but very fragile as they are
pulled the adhesive stretches out right
from underneath the battery no heat or
prying required as long as the adhesive
doesn't break on you mine did break once
but I was able to salvage the broken end
and pull it the rest the way out if you
are unable to reach your broken pull tab
you must commence the pry of Shame
if you end up prying out your battery do
not puncture or bend it it will start on
fire just like what you saw with my note
seven battery explosion video now that
both pull-tabs are out the battery is
completely free and ready to be swapped
replacement batteries are usually pretty
inexpensive especially a year or so
after the release of the phone the
iPhone 6 batteries are only about five
or ten dollars right now
thumbs up for these beautiful aluminum
machining marks on the inside I actually
do think this is really cool
I will link the current iPhone 7 battery
pricing in the video description along
with everything else
plug the new battery in and then plop
your metal plate into place getting
these four little tri point screws back
in then gently lift up your screen and
gently tuck the top of the screen into
the metal frame of the phone before
gently pressing down the sides and
clicking it into place I said gently
three times just barely press too hard
and you might crack your screen so go
easy on your phone it's had a rough day
everything should be working at this
point if your phone doesn't turn on try
charging it up for a bit sometimes the
new batteries don't arrive with a charge
