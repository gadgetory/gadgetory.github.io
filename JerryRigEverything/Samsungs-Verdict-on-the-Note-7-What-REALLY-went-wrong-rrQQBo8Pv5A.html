the battery on the galaxy note 7 some
estimates 17 billion dollars worth of
bad luck
yesterday Samsung explained if they used
over 700 engineers to figure out where
all their bad luck came from so let's
see what they found out lithium-ion
batteries are made of layers positive
and negative electrodes wrapped around
each other like an electrically charged
toilet paper roll normally these
positive and negative layers are
insulated from each other because as we
know any time the positive and negative
leads on a battery touch they
short-circuit and cause sparks
that's why nearly all batteries in
existence have warnings on them saying
not the crush will damage them i
disassembled my first note 7 right after
I bought it like I always do
notice that white battery icon in the
top corner of the phone I remove the
battery for the teardown video this was
before the first recall and before
anyone knew the batteries were exploding
you can see here on the corner of the
battery that occurs in just slightly
Samsung used the word deflected to
describe this curve that deflection is
what caused the positive and negative
electrodes to touch inside the battery
making a short circuit spark and catch
fire inside the phone I purchased
another no7 after the first recall was
complete and the phone was re-released
again see that black square on the label
of the box and the green battery icon in
the corner of the phone these two things
mean that the phone is safe to use or so
we thought
here is me taking apart the safe note 7
to analyze the new replacement battery
my mom says I need a girlfriend
the interesting part on this fixed
battery is that the printed date is
August 29th 2016 this battery was
manufactured before the initial recall
date of September 2nd and before the
re-release of the phone less than a
month later after the first recall
that's incredibly interesting Samsung
was using replacement batteries that
were manufactured before they even
announced the recall which also means
this battery was manufactured before
Samsung even researched the problem it
makes you wonder if some of their bad
luck is self-inflicted now the
manufacturer of these two batteries is
different the safe replacement battery
is made by this factory and the original
battery is made by this factory
so Samsung probably assumed that the
second battery was fine purely since it
came from a different factory
super interesting that both the old
battery and the fixed
safe battery have the same deflection in
that upper right corner iPhone batteries
on occasion have exploded as well they
are not exempt from the inherent dangers
of lithium they use the same internal
technology but Apple's batteries are
also straight up and down on the sides
as you can see here from the battery
inside the iPhone 7 there is no
deflection and no flaw which means that
the rate of failure is going to be
exponentially smaller now samsung said
that the reason for the second group of
batteries exploding through B or the
safe one was because the positive
electrode welding burr was poking
through the insulation tape when welding
or soldering a burr is something that
sticks up or isn't flush with the
finished surface the installation tape
is probably just blue stuff here and the
burr was pushing through that and
touching the negative electrode and when
the positive and negative points touch
sparks lie and that things happen my
tweezers are intentionally acting at the
short circuit in this video shorting the
positive and negative layers together to
effectively demonstrate the actual event
I think Samsung has done an amazing
thing by recalling three million phones
and unfortunately losing a lot of money
in the process it takes some real
backbone for a company to do something
like that and they do it for us their
customers so I'll give my thumbs up for
that with hindsight though it's
painfully obvious that the second
release of the note 7 was rushed and the
second round of batteries had the same
issue that the first round of batteries
had with that deflected corner and the
short circuit a little research on
Samsung's part between recalls and I
still might have a note 7 in my pocket
today it's been my phone of choice since
the note 2 the good news is that Samsung
is not canceling the note lineup and
there will be a note 8 in the future and
you can bet I'll be buying one for
myself if you haven't returned your note
7 you really should not because you
could hurt yourself that's totally fine
and I don't care about that but you
could hurt someone else or cause damage
to someone else's property and I do care
about that don't hurt other people with
your negligence out of 3 million phones
96% have been returned that leaves over
100,000 of you that are making
unintelligent decisions Samsung has made
it extremely easy to return the device
and you should take advantage of that
and let me know in the comments if you
think Samsung is going to have any
problems with the Galaxy s8 that comes
out and the bear
your future if you enjoyed this video
check out some of the other videos that
may on the note 7 like how they ship
exploding phones hit that subscribe
button I do appreciate it and you won't
miss any of my future durability tests
or tear downs thanks ton for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
