youtube-channel one is because they're
super unpredictable it's hard to make a
drop test scientific unless you have
multiple devices but they're still
interesting
so when Ankur reached out to me and said
hey Gerry we want to sponsor a drop test
we have a new case coming out called
karapaks we want to put on one of your
phones and see how the iPhone handles a
drop so today that's what we're gonna do
we're gonna drop test two iPhones one's
gonna have the karapaks case from anchor
on it and one is gonna be naked and
we'll see how durable Apple's new iPhone
glass really is let's get started so
just like with the essential drop test I
have both phones over here plus the case
that we're gonna be testing and then on
this side I have a phone recording in
slow motion this is the Galaxy Note 8
the clear version that I made a couple
of days ago and then on this side over
here
I had the galaxy s 8 plus also recording
in slow motion so I'll do a couple
different drop tests one sliding it off
my knee seeing how it handles the
concrete and then from waist height and
then chest height I did a poll on
Twitter a couple days ago actually
asking what the common height distance
was for a drop when you guys drop your
phones and waist height seem to be the
most common
so we'll probably do a couple different
drop tests at that level to get a good
idea if the iPhone 8 will survive a
normal drum so this is the karapaks case
looks like has two layers to it an outer
hard plastic layer and an inner rubber
layer for impacts and drops and it looks
like it has the dual protection where it
counts on the corners and the sides so
both of these phones are fully
functional and brand-new both of them
ran very pristine out of the box
condition the gold one's going to be
falling naked and the silver one is
going to be falling with the karapaks
case from anchor intact protecting it if
you remember for my durability test
video yesterday everything underneath
this glass is solid metal so it gives it
a lot of structural rigidity but there
is a circle right here in the center for
the wireless charging port and that's a
hollow point where there is no metal
behind the glass so if hypothetically
your phone drops on a rock in this
center panel it has a lot less
protection and structure than it would
if the rock hits somewhere up here where
there's a metal backing to it I know
it's impossible to plan how you drop
your phone in the future but if you can
avoid this circle in the center that
would be ideal one more thing is that if
you look at the
corner right here along the edge there's
a plastic ring around the inside of the
metal and this will give it a little
more cushion against drops and impacts
Apple paid a lot of attention to this
design there's also a little bit of
plastic right here along the edge of the
screen and that'll give us some cushion
because glass is really hard and metals
really hard but plastic has some give to
it so as long as there's a cushion layer
between the two hard materials it should
last a little bit longer in a drop but I
think we've done enough talking and it's
time to get dropping all right so both
cameras are rolling and we are just
going to stand up
take a look at this one first the screen
is fine the metal is fine that glass is
fine all right we're good to go
looks like the karapaks case is fine
looks like all four corners are good
just a small little divot in the plastic
right here but the screen is still
functioning let's do a little bit higher
up so now we're gonna do it from waist
high and this is where most people said
that they drop their phones from
probably when they're pulling it out of
their pocket
looks like the back panel is fine so far
we have some small dings up here in the
top of the corner but the screen is
still fine which is good and the back
glass is still fine with the karapaks
case the front is still fine obviously
that's probably the only part that's not
protected so as long as there's no rocks
that penetrate the glass I think we're
still good
the corners are still good having a case
with a hard plastic corner and the
rubber underneath with the two layers of
protection is a good thing let's do
another waist-high drop
all right the front is still working
there's some little damage on the corner
there the glass is still good and on the
karapaks from Ankur little damage on the
plastics but that's probably normally no
concrete plastic don't mesh well
together but it's still better the
plastic of your case and the metal of
the phone let's go again from waist
height we'll do it two more times well
drop it directly on the side like this
dang it right there right there on the
corner of the screen we have some damage
the screen still functions though but it
cracks all the way from the home button
over here to the edge of the glass the
metal is a little bit scuffed up on the
side but the karapaks is still fine the
screen is working and that's about what
we expected a case is gonna protect a
phone against drops way better than no
case since this phone has already broken
we'll do it from the back face down and
we'll do it from about chest high
looks like the karapaks the front screen
is still working we'll take the case off
really quick and check out the back
cover since it hit pretty hard on the
back back is still 100% fine let's check
out the gold one we have a lot more
damage on the screen but that's probably
cuz the glass is already compromised in
the last drop in the back also roasted I
don't know if this is the most durable
glass ever on the smartphone it only
took a couple drops to destroy the back
and the front glass I would say treat
this like any glass phone and don't
trust it with any kind of drop at all or
better if you're the type of person
who's ever dropped your phone before or
might drop it in the future a case is a
fantastic idea I'll do a couple more
with the case just for kicks and giggles
alright we'll try from head height
head height everything is still good so
I'm about six feet tall I lift it all
the way above my head and drop it from
there that gives us about eight or nine
feet of height
so we dropped it from about nine feet
the back of the case is pretty hashed
but the point of the case isn't to have
a pretty case the point of a case is to
have a pretty phone and the back is
still fine and the front is still fine
we'll see if it still works that's
pretty impressive I'll give a thumbs up
to anchor for sponsoring this video as
well as having a fantastic case for the
iPhone 8 I'll put a link in the video
description for this case if you want to
get one for yourself
obviously we've seen it works it
protects the front and the back during
drugs chest and waist time so anchor did
confirm that this supports wireless
charging and you can tell the cutouts
are perfect for the camera the mute
switch the volume buttons they still
feel pretty clicky and down here at the
charging port as well I'm sure if there
was a headphone jack there'd be a port
for that as well on the case but there's
not thanks Dom for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
