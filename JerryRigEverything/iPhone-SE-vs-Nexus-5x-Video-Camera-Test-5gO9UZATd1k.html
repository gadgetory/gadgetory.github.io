video cameras on the iPhone se and the
Nexus 5x seems like everyone has their
own vlog these days and the easiest way
to vlog is with a cell phone camera so
I've both these cameras mounted up to a
little rig that will stabilize them both
equally and let's test the camera
quality so right now I'm shooting in 4k
it is a little bit windy so if you can't
hear me turn on the subtitles you'll be
able to read what I'm saying
neither of these cameras have internal
image stabilizing so both qualities are
going to be a little bit shaky as I walk
around right now I'm focusing on the end
of the picnic table and then I'm going
to switch to the fire pit over there on
the side picnic table fire pit
everything is stock on these cameras
right now as well as the apps all the
stock settings so the iPhone se you can
only shoot in 720p for the front-facing
camera well the LG Nexus 5x can shoot in
1080p so if you're looking for a front
facing camera the LG Nexus 5x is
probably the way to go normally on the
type of guy who likes to sit down and
plan out a script before I get on camera
and start to talk about stuff but we're
just going to wing it today you know the
weather is rather nice so now I'm
recording in 1080p on both phones the
iPhone se has something called cinematic
video stabilization that kicks in at
this resolution and at 720p but looking
at the video quality from the 4k footage
it looks like it helps out there as well
it's kind of an electronic image
stabilization but without the warp
effect that we saw during my Nexus 6p
camera test video the Nexus 5x does not
have any image stabilization there are
workarounds for that but it does not
come installed stock on the device so
it's not included with this test the
cinematic image stabilization is
actually really really impressive look
what happens when I shake the
camera up and down quickly remember they
are both attached to the same camera rig
now let's look at that slow motion both
of these phones do their highest frame
rate at 720p the iPhone se can do 240
frames per second and the 5x does 120
frames per second the iPhone se has
twice the frames to work with so when we
max it out the slow motion will go for
twice as long and look twice as cool
keep in mind that both these devices are
mid-range devices the iPhone se is about
$400 brand new and the Nexus 5x is 350
dollars you might also have noticed that
I've included the bit rate of each
camera in the corner as well that just
tells you how much information is
allowed in each second of footage so for
this image while shooting in 4k the
iPhone se is allowing 20% more
information to go to each of its 30
frames every second the file size will
take up more room but the frames will be
more detailed which is a good thing
now I'm personally an Android guy but
when specifically talking about camera
quality for these mid-range phones
factoring in the higher bitrate the
cinematic image stabilization and the
better slow-motion I think that the
iPhone might win this round let me know
what you think down in the comments also
check out my Nexus 6p vs. Galaxy s7 edge
camera comparison I talked about some of
the high-end video stabilizing hit that
subscribe button for more videos like
this in the future and head over to my
Instagram and Twitter for behind the
scenes stuff with other tech tips thanks
for watching hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
