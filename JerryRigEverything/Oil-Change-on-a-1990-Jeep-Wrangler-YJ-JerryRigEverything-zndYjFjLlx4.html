oil to jeep wranglers is in 1990 here's
the dipstick where you check the oils
and then below the jeep we had the oil
pan here with all the oil in it the bolt
on this is a 14 millimeter I'm gonna go
ahead and unscrew that and then I have
my collection bin for the oil that comes
out there are six quarts of oil inside
of this so make sure your bin is big
enough to hold all six it helps that the
car is warm while you're doing this so
the oil is more liquid and it allows it
all to flow out through the engine
instead of it being cold not all of it
will flow out from inside of that oil
bin so the warmer your engine is the
better while you're doing this anyway
I'm going to let this drain out when I
go remove the oil filter so next to the
engine here this is the oil filter and
there's a good chance that oil is going
to come out of this a little bit while
you're taking it off is where it
connects with the new oil filter you
want to make sure that there is a little
bit of oil around this seal right here
and that'll help it seal up with the
engine so you won't have any leaks so
just take enough oil and get it around
the edge of this filter on the rubber
part
and you want to screw this in as tight
as you can by hand you don't want to use
any tools or anything else because you
might crush the filter all right got
that drain plug back in place
oil was done leaking out into my
container here so now that I have the
oil filter on and it plugged back up I'm
going to go ahead and drop six quarts of
oil into the engine that's how much
these Wranglers lot I made my own little
bump I'm cutting in half and one of the
quart oil containers and stick it right
down that hole and then dump my oil into
the top of that well the dipstick we can
tell right there
there's just underneath the add line
I've only put in about five and a half
quarts right now so I'm gonna add in
just a little bit more and see where
that gets us anyway if you have any
questions make sure to leave them in the
comments below don't forget to like if
this video helped you and don't forget
to subscribe I'll be putting up a bunch
more videos that have to do with this
Jeep during the next couple weeks hope
to see you around thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
