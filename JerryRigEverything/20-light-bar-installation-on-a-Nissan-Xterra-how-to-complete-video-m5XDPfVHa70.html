light bar on a Nissan Xterra here's the
light bar it is an ox beam I will link
this down in the video description below
luckily for us on the Nissan Xterra
there's a hollow spot right there in the
bumper where we're going to stick the
light bar I'll just slide right there
and that little groove and still has
room for the mounting plates right below
it to hook it to the bumper though we're
going to remove the license plate holder
and then this section of the bumper has
about six bolts underneath a few latches
here at the top that you can just unclip
and then this section of the bumper
comes away so we're going to mount the
light to the top of this section of the
bumper and then snap it back into place
blue eye bar comes with all kinds of
cool hardware we have the mounting
brackets down here at the bottom then
you have two side bolts and their
washers that go in either side to hold
the mounting plate in place and then you
have a locking washer and nut and a bolt
that just stick down here through the
bottom and that's what's going to go
into the bumper to hold it on you can
see the light bar has different lenses
for the different LEDs on the front
these are more for flood and these are
more for spots you get a wider angle
from the sides of it so not all the
light is concentrated in front of the
vehicle and the cable right here you
have to buy an additional wiring harness
for it and I'll show you how that's
installed later on these little mounting
plates down at the bottom
thank you move left and right and then
tighten down with an Allen wrench this
isn't included though with the kit so
this section of racket can move up and
down just depending on what angle you
want the Y bar to be and when it's fully
installed you can also flip around the
bracket and have it be positioned so you
can mount it straight from behind as
well just depending on what kind of
mounting positions you have available
lucky for us has a perfect slot right
here in the bumper for our light so what
we've done is we've measured the sides
make sure that it's centered completely
in the middle and then marked where our
bolts need to go it's going to bolt
right into this little plastic Ridge and
this is just marking the center point so
now that we've taken this chunk of
bumper off right here made the marks
with soapstone and then figured
where the bolt needs to go down through
and just started pretty drilling the
hole with a bit the front of the car
here this is where that section of
bumper will flip up and attach we've cut
two little holes here because there's a
metal bar down in here that isn't too
far away so I'll have a whole lot of
room to work with and then right here
we've hacked off the end of the bolt so
that this nut will just slip right down
inside of this hole and then the whole
thing will latch in these little slots
along the back and it will be mounted
for the wiring harness it comes tied up
in a little ball and it's actually
pretty simple to explain I'll start here
with the battery so with the battery
connection you have the one black that's
tied into the relay that's going to go
on the negative terminal of the battery
and then you're going to have two red
connections that will go to the battery
as well ones attached here to the fuse
and you want to take out the fuse before
you start working on anything
and so these two red connections will
attach to the positive terminal of the
battery
now following the wires from the relay
you have the white and the red headed
this direction and what we're going to
do with those is there's a little hole
here in the firewall right there and the
black wire is going to go through that
hole into the cab of the vehicle and
that's the switch that turns the light
on and off and coming from that we have
another black wire and it is just going
to attach to any screw that's on the
metal frame it's a ground preferably a
screw that's not painted so you can see
that screw down there has a wire
attached to it so that's grounding
something else and this ground can just
stick right on inside of that bolt as
well so I have two grounds coming off
the same bolt anyway back to the battery
here's that same relay with the black
negative terminal battery connection
it's going to have two wires coming down
the connect to the light bar now this
particular wiring harness has two
connections so you can have two light
bars it's got a black and a white and
then
the other end it has a black and white
as well since the cable is only coming
out of the two wires it's going to be
the same amperage whether you have two
light bars or one so we're just going to
use the one light bar connection and
it's got the black and the white right
there and we're going to take it over to
the light bar which has the red and the
black wires we're going to go black to
black and white to red and that should
power the whole thing so we're going to
make sure that all fits up before we
mount the light bar back onto the bumper
so our plan worked pretty good we got
this section of bumper clipped in our
little holes for the bolts snapped in
just nicely and we got the bottom of
this section of the bumper all screwed
back in and it is solid now we get that
license plate cover back on and we're
good to go alright so we're testing out
the lights right now these are just the
normal headlights obviously the camera
doesn't pick up all the light that's
spewing out so here's the normal
headlights and I'm going to flip on the
brights that's what the brights on and
then we're going to flip on the LED bar
and that place that's probably about 50
yards away and it's lit up pretty well
can't really tell with the camera but
it's lit up as well as the trees on
either side so now we're going to turn
off the regular lights and leave just
the LED light bar on so here's the
button from the cab where went through
the firewall so every time we click this
it turns the LED lights off and on quick
little tip if your light bar is like
blinking or flickering it means it's not
getting enough power so make sure that
the connections to your battery and the
grounding connection are clean and solid
and that should fix any flickering
issues that you have with the light all
the parts like the wiring harness and
the LED light we found in the video
description below
if you have any questions leave them in
the comments if you're curious about
this light bar that I had solved in my
trunk go ahead and click in this corner
to see how that was made I did some
custom brackets on the side and I have
another LED bar here that you can check
out as well it's one of the four inch
spotlights thanks ton for watching hope
