that if you change the date on your
iPhone 6 or 6s to January 1st 1970 it'll
break your phone turns out this rumor is
true I have an iPhone 6 that I tried it
on after scrolling all the way back to
January 1st 1970 I turned off the phone
and all it would do is power cycle when
I turned it back on it would stay on the
Apple logo for a few minutes turn off
turn back on and then stay stuck in that
fruit loop forever now you'd have to be
pretty silly to intentionally cause
damage to your expensive cell phone but
if you or someone else you know has
accidentally fallen for this prank there
is a way to fix it one way is to take it
to the Apple store and have them do
their thing but if that is not an option
a simple unplugging of the battery will
correct the software issue once the
battery has been unplugged from the
frozen device the day and time will
automatically reset giving you full
access to the phone again
to remove the battery there are two
small pentalobe screws at the bottom
then need to gently lift the screen away
from the device it helps if you have a
little suction cup to help the lifting
up there are two more screws holding
down the battery connection pop that off
with the plastic pry tool wait about 30
seconds before plugging it back in again
once that is finished put everything
back where it belongs and your phone is
as good as new the next time you need to
time travel you better get an Android

video with anyone else who might be
affected by the glitch thank you for
