repairing the sony xperia z5 premium
this is the international version so if
you have a broken screen or charging
port this is the video to watch first
things turn off the phone now to get off
the back panel it is glass we have to be
very careful with this but we do want to
warm up the adhesive underneath the
panel once the adhesive is warmed up
it'll soften and allow you to remove the
panel in one piece without breaking it
I'm taking a thin metal pry tool and
sliding around the edge to cut any of
the adhesive and then putting a playing
card so it doesn't seal back down again
as it cools there is less adhesive up at
the top and I'll show you why in just a
second you can see the glue actually
soften as I heat it up once I lift up
the side of the back glass you can see
the NFC pad which is rests on the
motherboard and you can also see two
pull tabs these pull tabs actually make
it really easy to remove the back I
recommend lifting up the top of the
glass and then pulling these pull tabs
off of the side that way you can remove
the adhesive underneath the glass
without bending it or breaking the back
panel smart move on Sony's part they
have the same pull tabs underneath the
battery so it's removed the battery it
should be a relatively simple process if
both of these pull tabs didn't break on
me now we have to pry the battery out
which is a much more difficult process
basically I'm lifting it up with that
same metal pry tool making sure not to
puncture the battery at all and slicing
away the glue that's underneath it
heating up the phone every now and then
from the front making sure not to burn
the screen and then once all the
adhesive is cut out then the battery
pops out there's a bunch of random
plastic brackets inside of this phone
that I'll show you there's one screw
down at the bottom and then another
plastic plate on top of the bottom part
of the motherboard remove that and then
unplugging the screen ribbon cables just
like a little Lego same thing with the
charging port connector then there's
four screws along the top of the
motherboard remove those and then
there's another plastic bracket here set
that off to the side make sure you keep
these organized here's the 23 megapixel
camera on snapping that from the
motherboard and then here is the ribbon
cable for the power buttons and vibrator
motor this is the top ribbon cable for
the front camera here's another random
plastic bracket piece set that off the
side pulling out the five megapixel
front camera and it has the same rubber
hat that the Nexus 6p has very
interesting I'm go ahead and put that
hat back on and set it off to the side
now there's two metal panels covering
the vibrator motor and the loudspeaker
so I'm going to unlatch
those and put those off of the side as
well there are a lot of small components
in this phone so make sure you stay as
organized as possible I will link all
the replacement parts in the video
description
here's another random plastic piece I'm
going to set that off the side as well
same here and then here's the power
button and volume button rocker it's
clipped into the side of the phone with
some plastic clasp you can see here I
have my fingerprint scanner once all
those class around done the vibrator
motor and all the buttons come away from
the side you can see how that spins
around to vibrate your phone there the
rest of buttons and then here is my
fingerprint scanner I do have the
International Version which does come
with a fingerprint scanner the US
version does not have a fingerprint
scanner surprisingly enough the charging
port is a cute little guy just pops out
of that little hole it is
water-resistant so that little red
rubber piece on the end is what keeps
the water from entering the phone now
remove the screen it is similar to the
back we're going to heat it up to soften
the adhesive underneath the glass and
then we're going to use a playing card
to put in between the LCD and the metal
frame making sure that you're not trying
to separate the glass in LCD because
that would be futile we only want to go
from the LCD to the frame that adhesive
is actually separate able heat up the
screen to hotter than you can touch and
then your card can slide in between I am
only doing this on the top of the phone
you'll see why in just a second as I cut
away the adhesive around the edge of the
screen will lift up along the sides the
glue is weird I've never seen glue like
this before has a similar spider-man
effect with my playing card
now that we've had sufficient fun we can
pull the screen away from the body you
can see that ribbon cable slide through
the frame right there and this is why we
don't slide my card around the bottom
edge of the phone because it will break
these ribbon cables and since I'm
planning on reusing my screen if I tore
these ribbon cables the screen would not
function anymore
so I was being super careful with them
so when you buy your replacement screen
most likely it will have adhesive
already attached to it I will link
replacement screens down in the video
description below
they will look exactly like this so
remove the protection off of the
adhesive from your new screen and then
just feed that ribbon cable into the
little slot in the frame of the phone
and press the screen into place make
sure that the frame of your phone isn't
bent at all otherwise the screen might
not line up correctly so make sure you
unbend your frame before trying to press
the screen into place now I'm going to
put the power button bracket back in
this also includes the
Raider motor and my fingerprint scanner
gotta line all that up and unclip it
into the side of the frame there's a
bunch of little clasps along the top
making sure my buttons work you will be
able to feel them compress and
decompress as the buttons line up
correctly putting that random plastic
bracket back into the bottom and then
setting the vibrator motor down inside
of that getting the metal latches back
on the vibrator motor in the loudspeaker
getting the charging port back into
place you can see it click in putting
this random plastic piece back into
place as well now this part was
interesting these are the heat pipes for
the Sony Xperia z5 you can see as I lift
up this flap there is liquid inside you
can get a better glance as it as I lift
up this second part it is a smash tube
of copper but the entire thing is filled
with liquid usually for applications of
this temperature distilled water is
ideal you can see it evaporate once that
metal flap is lifted up thermal rubber
stuff that sits on top of the heat pipe
and lay that back down then the earpiece
clicks into place as well and then we
could set the motherboard down into
place make sure there's no ribbon cables
underneath before you set it down I'm
going to go ahead and plug the headphone
jack into place and the front-facing
camera and then I'm going to set the
black plastic piece in top corner
rear-facing camera goes in plug that
into the mainboard with a little Lego
like ribbon cable another plastic piece
on the side of the mainboard there
clipping in the power buttons and the
other random plastic piece on top of the
signal wire clipping in the screen and
the charging port putting the plastic
piece over the charging port in the base
of the motherboard getting the battery
back into place clipping that down as
well turning it on just to make sure
everything works before I put the back
panel in place I want to make sure we do
the least amount of work possible there
are five screws in the back of the phone
make sure all those are in place they
are different sizes so make sure you get
the right ones and then I put
double-sided tapes inside and we're
using my same back if you're replacing
your back it will most likely come with
its own adhesive pushing that down in
the back of the phone and we are set if
you have any questions leave them down
in the comments I do appreciate it if
you subscribe and does mean a lot to me
and I post most behind the scenes stuff
on Instagram and Twitter thanks ton for
watching hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
