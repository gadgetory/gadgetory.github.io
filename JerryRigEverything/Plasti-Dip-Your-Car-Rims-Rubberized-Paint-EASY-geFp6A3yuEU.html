the chrome wheels on my Jeep in this
video I'll show you how to spray it on
as well as what it looks like when you
peel the plastic tip off of the tires
Plasti Dip is a pretty sweet little
product it is a sprayable rubber coating
that can be removed whenever you're done
with it so i'm gonna use it today to
change the colors of my wheels in a non
permanent way putting it on is just like
you would have any kind of spray paint
make sure you clean the surface first to
make sure there's no dust or grime or
dirt anywhere I also put some paper
towels behind the holes in the rim to
make sure that no spray got on my rotors
or brake pads then tape off everything
that you don't want to be covered in the
Plasti Dip in my case I want to have a
crisp line around the rim of the tire so
I taped that off as well as the lug nuts
I want to keep those chrome as well do a
light first coat and make sure that you
don't have any drips or runs in the pain
the light first coat also helps the
second coat bond better as well let it
air dry for about 15 to 20 minutes
between coats after it loses its
shininess you can come back and do
another coat I put two coats on my
wheels a light first coat in a heavier
second coat and I felt like that was
plenty I was almost able to finish all
four tires with one can of Plasti Dip
Plasti Dip is pretty cheap on Amazon you
can check the links in the video
description below for all the different
colors that are available they even have
clear so check that out now I want to
peel it off for you it feels kind of
like a cross between duct tape and saran
wrap it has gripped the reel very well
like duct tape but it can also be
stretched off and tare just like saran
wrap wood I'll be plasti to being my
whole Jeep red here in the next couple
weeks so subscribe to my youtube channel
to make sure not to miss that and I'll
have a few more pictures up on Instagram
as well so follow me there at Zach's
jerry-rigged anyway if you have any
questions be sure to leave them in the
comments below and like this video if
you found it interesting
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
