apart a galaxy s4
speed this part up a little bit to take
out the battery and then there are nine
screws around the backside of the phone
Amazon usually has some pretty cheap
parts so I'll try to list those in the
video description and I think like the
charging port the camera the screen
Amazon use with cells you know part by
part and once you get the screws out
this little bottom plastic piece comes
out just kind of pry it with a little
non marring tool and then that piece
itself also is River your speaker
then make sure you grab your SIM card
out to the back housing won't come apart
with the SIM card still in place remove
your SD card as well if you have one and
then the screen comes loose from the
back housing around the edge you'll see
a small groove between the back of the
front panel and you can gotta just take
your non marring tool kind of slide it
between it through a bunch of little
clicks as it snaps apart
you
you
kind of pry really gently and then the
back housing will come away
here you have the inside of the galaxy
s4 there's one screw holding the
motherboard down it's different than all
the rest of screws it's black the other
nine screws are silver there are four
five ribbon cables around the backside
is that one the first one holds the
screen this one's going down to the
charging port
then there's this one right here the
camera and another one to the light
sensor and this one right here to the
audio port and there are two wire cables
also on be careful when you're
unequipping these if you bend a little
head on them that could make it so that
your phone doesn't get reception anymore
one of them's for the antenna anyway
wiggle the cameras a little bit to make
sure it's not stuck in a little square
groove underneath them but don't pull it
out because it isn't wired to the back
of the motherboard when you're pulling
the back when you put the motherboard
off just kind of wiggle it loose this is
the little camera slot that I was
talking about before to get rid of that
it's just like the other ribbon cables
just pop it out and then to put it back
in it's just like a little Lego you just
kind of like snap it in place super easy
just click that's it so the audio port
and the sensors can all be removed and
replaced just by taking apart those two
little screws now we're going to work on
getting the charging port removed so I'm
going to take these two wire cables and
kind of pull them down just a little bit
the part that goes up to the motherboard
comes up in two pieces so it's attached
and there's a little bit of glue and it
keeps kind of separating just like that
and you do need to separate them to be
able to remove the charging port the
charging port is glued down so very very
gently variety between the back of the
screen and the circuit board and it will
come apart is kind of you know give the
clue just a little bit away then there's
a little metal bracket that's sitting on
top of the charging board just like that
and so snap that off and then the whole
charging board should come away from the
dock housing and I'll put the part for
the charging board down in the video
description as well so if your charging
port goes out very easily replaced if
you don't have insurance
usually the parts line like 10 or 15
bucks it's not that done check the video
description for that anyway putting the
charging port back in just contact it in
place with the glue reposition itself if
you don't have glue that's fine two of
the rest those screws will hold it in
place the little metal bracket back on
as well feed them at the board
underneath the ribbon cables making sure
that all the ribbon cables are on top of
the motherboard so they can click down
into place
and the hard part about this is just
making sure all the cables line up again
so I'm snapping in this wire cable and
the wire cables fit down inside a little
groove you can kind of see me pushing it
in right there and clipping the wire
cable back onto the little hole that I
came from you can see how easy it is to
clip these wire cables back into place
so I did one right there another one
here you'll feel them click in just like
Legos another here here and the last one
the audio board right there
pretty simple make sure you get that
screw back into the motherboard the only
black screw just kind of screw routing I
guess
make sure the camera clicks into the
groove below it and there you'll put the
back housing back on and then you'll
hear a series of very small quick so you
kind of like you know click it all back
into place
going all the way around making sure
each part of it is a snug squeeze really
tight against each other
back speaker just clicks on and then all
the screws hold it all into place so
take the nine screws and screw them all
back in around the outside and that
remember I'll try to get all the parts
you know the back housing in the back
speaker always those in the video
description below as you can find those
on Amazon
put your SIM card in place off the
battery in there put the back on the
phone and there you go if you have any
questions make sure to leave them in the
