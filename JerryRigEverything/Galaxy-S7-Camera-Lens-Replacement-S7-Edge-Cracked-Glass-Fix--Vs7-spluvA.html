taken care of galaxy s7 the worst part
about it is that the camera lens is
correct so you can't take pictures the
rest of the phone still works fine but
with the correct camera lens you're
missing one of the most important
features of the phone today I'm going to
show you how to replace the camera glass
with the new lens so that you can take
clear pictures again the hardest part of
this project is making sure that no
glass dust gets inside the camera unit
and I'll show you why in just one second
it is really hard to find quality glass
lenses most replacements you'll find
online will be clear plastic that you
can bend or fold but taking a picture
through plastic isn't near as good as
taking a picture through glass I use
bonafide hardware glass lenses because
they are actually glass I got two so
that I could show you that the glass is
real this lens fits the galaxy s7 and
the galaxy s7 edge both of them are the
same size I will link the bonafide
hardware lenses in the video description
of this video you'll need a heat gun for
this project this is important because
you want to soften the adhesive under
the broken glass so it doesn't shatter
more as you remove it the more you're
old lynn chatters the more you risk
getting glass into the camera mechanism
and killing your focus abilities and
your o is the stabilization I'm also
going to use a clear piece of tape I'm
going to take my heat gun or you can use
your sister's hair dryer and heat up the
glass of the camera lens until it's too
hot to touch
then I will quickly put tape over the
correct lens and try to pull off any
loose bits of glass that I can find if
you end up with a hole in your lens this
project becomes a lot easier I got one
little piece of glass off but that'll be
enough to start now the glass is cooled
down I need to reheat it to soften the
adhesive again then holding the phone
sideways so no glass falls inside the
camera unit I can lift off each piece of
glass individually the warmer the
adhesive is the easier it will be to do
this you can warm up the phone as often
as you need just make sure not to
overheat and damage the camera only go
until it is barely too hot to touch as
you can see the lens is mechanical so it
has moving parts if the glass dust gets
inside of the camera it will stop
working the OIS will stop and worse the
focusing will stop sometimes it'll start
focusing again after a couple days when
the glass drops out but is better to
avoid
altogether and just be careful so now
I'm going to clean up the extra adhesive
and the glass bits inside of the frame
if there are any glass bits still in
there when I press my new lens into
place the new lens will crack because of
that pressure point so make sure all the
glass dust is off if there are gaps in
the adhesive from the new lens that you
put on then regular dust from your
pocket might seep into your camera lens
over time so make sure it's as clean as
possible and don't get anything on the
unprotected camera unit clean off both
sides of the new glass lens making sure
there are no smudges on the underside
since you won't have access to it once
the new glass is in place remember that
you are working with glass so if you
aren't super confident you might just
want to buy two lenses in case you break
one you shouldn't leave your camera
unprotected for very long
make sure the adhesive is still on the
glass side of the lens after remove the
adhesive protection then drop your new
lens into place and line it up inside of
the frame remember if you press too hard
you might crack the new glass so be
gentle as you can see I did retain all
of my focusing abilities with this
galaxy s7 being super careful with the
glass dust does pay off thanks ton for
watching I did link all of the parts and
tools need for this project down in the
video description below if you have any
questions leave them in the comments I
do respond fairly regularly and all of
my behind the scenes stuff can be found
on my Twitter Instagram and snapchat
thanks ton for watching hope to see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
