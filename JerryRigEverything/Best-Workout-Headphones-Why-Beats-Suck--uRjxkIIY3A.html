most popular exercising workout earbuds
from the inside the j-bird X threes and
the power beats three and I'll explain
why one is miles ahead of the other
let's get started now the power beats
three are pretty famous if you haven't
heard of Beats or seen the beats logo
before you might be living under a rock
beat spend some pretty major money on
mainstream advertising but that doesn't
always mean they have a good product
the jaybird X 3s retail for half of what
beats cost but aren't as heavily
advertised these are more of an inside
your ear design and I've been using my
pair for the last six months or so and
I'm happy with them I switched to the X
threes after three different sets of
Beats earbuds died on me over the course
of one year so let's analyze the
construction and build quality to find
out why all of my Beats headphones
couldn't last as long as one j-bird
breaking into the jaybird x trees is
rather difficult
everything is very securely molded shut
which is a good thing for workout
headphones
it will keep sweat rain and water from
destroying the internal circuitry after
shaving apart the headphones for a good
while it was able to separate the
speaker from the battery these have an
advertised eight hour battery life and I
would regularly get about six or so out
of mine more than enough to be
convenient I could charge them up every
few workouts and be just fine
the speaker itself is pretty small
surprisingly small which might be why
the battery is able to last so long the
volume and power controls are usually
where wireless headphones start failing
these headphones were fully functional
before I started taking them apart but
the one thing I did hate on these X
threes was the non-standard charging
method now I have plenty of micro USB
and USB C chargers lying around but if I
forgot this proprietary dock thingy for
my x3 earbuds I'm just out of luck it's
kind of annoying to be honest we should
USB see all the things once we are
inside I'll pop the rest of the circuits
out from the plastic housing and this is
where things start to get really
interesting and where we can start to
tell a quality built product from an
inferior product but to make the test
fair let's find the circuits of the
power beats first the beats were much
easier to get inside a simple stab to
the speaker housing and it would start
to separate so we can already start
to get an idea of how different the
water resistance is between the two
headphones and the speaker of the beats
it's about twice the size of the one on
the Jaybirds
but it does also not go as deep into
your ear as the Jaybirds do so it does
need to be larger to match the same
volume level because of that added
distance from your ear drum beats
advertises a 12 hour battery life on
these things and I would regularly get
about four or five hours out of it not
good at all the speaker cones of both
headphones are made from the plastic
rubber combination so that's good
it's the same style that we saw inside
of the Apple earpods but we still need
to find the circuitry inside the volume
controls of the beats we find the first
fatal flaw and one of the reasons why my
first sets of Beats died this section
isn't water-resistant Moisture can
easily seep inside of these little holes
in the housing and corrode the
connections my volume up just stopped
working on one of my sets entirely and
that's kind of an important button the
rest of the circuits are inside the
earbud housing next to the microUSB
charging port easy enough to open up
there is no rubber ring around the
charging port hole like we see on
cellphones which means that moisture
could very easily get inside from
multiple locations I'll show you why
that's a bad thing popping the circuit
board completely out of the plastic
housing I'll drip a few drops of water
onto the board and you can see how the
droplets cling to the surface water and
electronics do not go well together this
is how things short out and get corroded
and then die water is clinging to all
that important stuff I could feel the
board heating up in my hands as the
leftover juice from the battery was
shorting out along those wires now the
reason I bought my X threes in the first
place was because on their website they
say there is a double hydrophobic
coating and you can see what that means
when I apply some water droplets to the
surface of the circuit board the board
has a coating that repels moisture and
won't let the droplets cling to the
surface keeping the electronics from
shorting out and it's just another added
layer of protection if moisture does
somehow manage to get inside of the
sealed plastics the extra protection is
a good thing beats on the other hand do
not have that hydrophobic coating nor is
the body well sealed it also has a
terrible battery life and is twice the
price so I would just stay away from
beats altogether j-bert has built a
quality water-resistant product and I
would almost go as far to say it's
waterproof
instead of spending millions on
advertising they just pass those savings
on to their customers and shockingly
enough even this pair is somehow still
alive you can tell by the overexcited
female voice announcing how much battery
percentage is left I do still need to
buy another pair for myself though these
are currently my favorite headphones
I'll link all the different color
variants in the video description right
below this video along with the current
pricing let me know if you have any
other headphones you want me to try out
or tear apart and thanks a ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
