iFixit I'm here with Kyle he's the CEO
of iFixit we're talking about cell
phones repair ability and durability so
Kyle have a question for you
all right we're pretty into the
repairing of cell phones what for you is
the ideal cell phone so we have
different materials they can be made out
of plastic glass or metal which one do
you prefer
well I like quality materials so if you
look at I mean the higher-end flagship
phones they're investing more in the
materials ah the iPhone is a very
durable phone in general so I think that
there's a lot to be said for what
Apple's done I've got I have an iPhone
so and it's in general like the metal
that they have done right it has a
pretty good build quality I have here
this is a 50 dollar Android phone that
they sell in India and I mean this is
reasonable it's more close to like an
old-school Nokia phone yeah um but I
definitely like you know robust durable
materials I don't really have any
problem with the metal I think you could
also build a plastic phone that that
stood the test of time but it would
probably need to be a higher quality
plastic than you see here it may be a
little bit thicker okay so in your ideal
smartphone would it be metal or plastic
you have to pick just have to pick yeah
yeah I could go either way I mean I
would want I just want a rugged case so
if it's metal that's taking the impact
if it's plastic I can go either way but
I think that you know in your been tests
you've shown that maybe if you go with
like like the plastic phone you've got
over there that's the extreme side of
flimsy plastic yeah
but I think you can do some things with
polycarbonate so I would say I'm more
about the functionality and I don't
really care how you get there okay and
so as far as like what about internals
go
so if with your when you go to buy a
smartphone you have the iPhone right now
what is the most important aspect for
you as far as repairability you know
battery life what do you look for yes so
the crazy thing about most phones these
days is it's gotten really commoditized
right like there isn't as big a
difference between all the phones on the
market as there was three four years ago
so everything has a camera the flagship
phones all have pretty good cameras so
we can sit here and we can really
nitpick the difference between an s7
camera the knife on
excess camera isn't huge right they're
both really good cameras within the form
factor well I would say is make
something bigger like actually don't
need a bigger screen I think this screen
could even be made a bit smaller but
like give me more room for that for the
camera or like the biggest design flaw
with the iPhone I have my own bump that
I added but the design flaw is the
camera bump right so they could have
made they could have given me 25 percent
better battery life if they just made
the entire phone that's thick as the
camera yeah ah so they're sitting here
and like it's funny when you when you
see interviews with with Johnny you know
Apple's famous designer and he say yeah
what do you think about the bump and
he's like well we had to do that well
you didn't have to do that you can make
the phone thicker mm-hmm so that would
be my like make the phone a bit thicker
give us a bit longer battery the phone
battery what is going to degrade like
after you've had it for a year or two
you're going that you know be get
dramatically less life out of the same
battery so we should design the phone to
have maybe a hundred and fifty percent
more battery than you need so that a
year from now when the capacity is
shrunk it's still functional yeah and
there's so it'll last more charge cycles
because there's more right life in there
exactly and we see that with the iPads
like an iPad has a battery that nobody
really burns through an iPad battery in
the day right yeah it takes a couple
days to work through it and so it's not
until you've had an iPad for three or
four years that you really need to
change the battery well phone you need
to swap the battery every year so if
we're in this constraint where we're
saying well we have the phones that we
have now I would like to see a battery
the easy to swap so my ideal phone like
my favorite phone out there on the
market right now is the fairphone and
unfortunately and I can't use one myself
because it's it's only works on the
European frequencies right now so I'm
hoping that the fairphone 3 comes to the
US but it's designed you don't need any
tools to swap the battery you don't even
need any tools to swap the screen it's
just plastic - absolutely and it comes
out really perfect that's because that
phone is pretty modular right it's
designed to be extremely modular for
repair ability not modular for
functionality okay so you can't swap out
a better camera on it but it is easy if
the camera fails to swap it out to just
put in the same component again that's
good so just to summarize the ideal
phone for the eye fix of CEO
would be a phone that has a rigid case
on it so like it won't bend or damage
easily and a bigger battery than what is
currently in most black ships and the
battery that you can swap yourself and
then the other things I would say is it
should have a repair manual that's
publicly available and there should be
parts available and what's crazy is that
the fairphone is the only phone in the
world that has a repair manual and parts
available from the manufacturer none of
the other companies do it even the
Indian smartphone companies even Samsung
Apple HTC while way none of them are
making repair information available it's
crazy so you and I have to figure it out
yeah instead of everybody else I don't
understand I think it's the most
consumer hostel market you go and you
look at power tools like you came from
construction right yeah every single
Power Tool Company has repair
information available in parts you get a
Makita you get a Dewalt
and you need a new clutch for your drill
and they will sell it to you because if
they don't the words going to get out in
the construction community right if the
Walt's top-selling repair parts no one
would buy the Walt's anymore
exactly so how do they get away with
this in the smartphone world I don't
understand I don't know but it's good
for us as the two largest cell phone
repair channels on YouTube they're gonna
keep making these fragile things near
the glass right you got Samsung has
glass on the front in the back yeah so
as long as everybody's out there making
very fragile devices that are thin
we're gonna keep teaching you how to
swap batteries how to fix the glass how
to fix the lenses on the cameras yeah
it's a it's a it's a target rich
environment for people that are looking
to teach people how to fix their broken
stuff well good well now we know what
the ideal smartphone is for the CEO of
iFixit I agree 100%
even mkbhd mentioned something about
having a thicker battery in his phones
so I think you know from a consumer
standpoint having a bigger battery is
just better all-around it's time to end
this design anorexia making things
stutter and thinner and thinner to the
point we cave and play pokeball on your
phone
exactly you can't play Pokemon go on
your phone there's no point even having
there's no point in living really this
is what we come to what level are you at
um I actually I haven't downloaded
haven't you got to get going I'm working
on that after this I'll do it well
thanks for having me here at the studio
of iFixit I really enjoy
this time if you haven't subscribed to
their channel yet I fix it they have
fantastic repaired guys even pitchers in
a blog format it is fantastic our goal
is to teach people how to fix everything
that they have there we go
