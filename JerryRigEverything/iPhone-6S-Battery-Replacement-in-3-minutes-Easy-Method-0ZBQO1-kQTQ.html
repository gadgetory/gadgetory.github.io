replace the battery in the iPhone 6s
there are two ways to replace the
battery there's an easy way and there's
a hard way I will be showing you both
ways the actual battery replacement will
be starting at the minute 15 mark I will
link tools and replacement batteries
down in the video description so check
those out if you need them to get out
the battery you do have to open up the
phone so go ahead and take your PIN
elopes screwdriver remove the bottom two
screws from the phone and then you can
lift up on the screen with a suction cup
and slide a tool between the metal frame
of the screen and the metal frame of the
phone and pry up very gently there is
adhesive surrounding the screen and the
frame so I'm going to go ahead and slide
my plastic pry tool between the two and
separate them and that makes it easier
to lift off the screen from the frame
pretty straightforward once the phone is
open you can see the four screws holding
down this metal plate I remove those
four screws lift off the metal plate and
then disconnect each of these little
ribbon cables you definitely don't want
to let the screen bend past 90 degrees
or will damage the cables once the
screen is removed you can see the
battery down here in the little
connection for it so unscrew those two
screws and remove the metal plate so
here's the wrong way to remove the
battery there's these two little pull
tabs down here at the bottom you can see
that I'm unsticking it from the battery
right now they're kind of hard to grab
because they shrink up as soon as you
remove them and here's where I went
wrong
I took the pull tab once I got a hang of
it and pulled it through the side of the
phone and that makes the pull tab break
which makes it a much harder repair if
you actually grab the pull tab and pull
straight out the bottom of the phone
don't try to wrap it around the battery
like I'm doing right now just pull
straight out the bottom
and you can see it pull entirely away
from the battery so easy and now that's
one whole half of the battery that I
don't have to unstick from the back but
since I messed up the first time around
with the first pull tab I have to do the
pry of shame to pull the battery out
from the back of the housing the sticky
tape is pretty strong stuff the best way
to do is just pull the little tab out
from the bottom of the battery and yank
it right out to put the battery back
into place you can buy new pull tabs or
you can just take double-sided tape and
stick it down underneath the battery so
it doesn't jiggle around inside of the
housing take the battery plug it back
into place take the two screws screw
them into the metal plate over the
connection then you can take the screen
and plug in the connectors you have one
for the front-facing camera you have the
LCD and you have the digitizer once
they're all plugged into place they're
like little Legos you can just kind of
plug them in before putting the metal
plate down I am going to test to see if
the screen is working if you have lines
or a white screen there's a good chance
that one of your connections isn't quite
right so disconnect it and replug in the
ribbon cable and then to line up the
screen I usually take it and push it
into the top of the housing first and
then I can slide my hands down the sides
of the screen to lock it into place get
the two screws in at the bottom and you
are good to go if you have any questions
