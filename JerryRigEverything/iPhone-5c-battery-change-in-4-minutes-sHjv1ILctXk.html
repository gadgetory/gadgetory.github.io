replace the battery on the iPhone 5c
it's pretty a simple operation basically
you just take out these two bottom
screws here they're called a pentalobe
screw and as the same size a screwdriver
that you would use with the iPhone 4 or
the iPhone 5 would be a little suction
cup place it onto the screen and kind of
pull up with your finger at the same
time using your non-marking pry tool to
pry the screen away from the body itself
and then lift up gently being very
careful with the screen not to bend it
or anything and it will pop away from
the rest of the body at this point there
is a small little bracket holding on the
battery connector so I'm going to take
that bracket take off the two little
screws and remove it just like that and
then technically you don't have to
remove the screen this is the little
cable that holds the battery to the
phone this kind of takes away the power
from the rest of the phone you don't
have to remove the screen if you don't
want to but the battery is glued tight
enough to the phone that I felt it would
be less dangerous to the phone if I
remove the screen so I'm going to show
you how to do that really quick just
take off the four screws that are
holding this metal plate down remove the
metal plate and then you can take your
pry tool and just snap these little
latches these are the exact same it's a
little battery connector that we just
removed they're really similar to Legos
so you can just kind of pop them up and
off and there are three latches that
hold the screen on and so once you get
those lifted up the screen just comes
away and then the battery so the battery
itself is glued really really tightly to
the back of the phone more tightly than
the four or the iPhone 5 so it takes a
little bit of time you know prying with
your little tool just kind of slide it
up underneath to separate it from the
back you can use a heat gun if you would
like just kind of you know heat up the
back of the phone not so hot that you
can't touch it anymore but it will help
the groove the glue not be so you know
it wouldn't hold so tight anymore once
you heat it up
so after pulling a little bit with the
battery make sure that the battery that
you're not touching any of the black
ribbon cables that go to the rest of the
phone you can see me right here kind of
separating the ribbon cable from the
battery not making to make sure that
it's not going to break anything as I
pull the battery up and away from the
phone
anyway the lithium-ion batteries are a
little bit flexible as you can see it
was kind of bending a little bit there
just make sure you don't break it then
you can take your new battery I will put
batteries batteries can be found in the
video description below I usually link
to Amazon at the cheapest these
batteries are not replaceable with the
iPhone 5 so you have to get a separate
battery that's specifically made for the
iPhone 5c once you get the battery
connector clipped back again just get
the metal bracket screw it in with the
two little screws these ones are little
Phillips heads so they're not the same
pentalobe screwdriver they use to get
the two screws out of the bottom anyway
to get the screen back on take the
little latches little ribbon cables and
clip them back into place just like
Legos there's those three important ones
and make sure that it's in the right
spot before you click it because if you
bend one of these connectors it could be
a very bad thing anyway get the metal
plate screw back into place remember
this is a pretty straightforward
operation but at the same time you know
if you do something wrong it could mess
up your phone entirely so you got to be
careful while you're doing it anyway
then you can take the screen line up the
top first and then you can just clip the
screen back into place going all the way
down you'll hear it click all the way in
just like that
there you go you can see that it's flush
with the body of the phone again
make sure you put those two screws back
in the bottom and you're good do you
know if you have any questions make sure
