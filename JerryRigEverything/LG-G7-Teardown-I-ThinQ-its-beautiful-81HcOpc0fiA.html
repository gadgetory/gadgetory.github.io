then Q has told me not to remove the
battery several times for my phone's own
safety or something which means it's
time to remove the battery and review
this LG g7 from the inside let's get
started the funny thing is that removing
the battery of a sealed shut phone is
near impossible as you'll see in a
second I'll link all the tools and stuff
I'm using in the video description but
the average Joe will never just pop the
battery out on a whim once the adhesive
is warmed up I'll slip my metal pry tool
between the edge of the glass and the
metal frame and cut through that
adhesive all around the outside of the
phone I keep warming up the adhesive
about every 30 seconds or so since it'll
harden up and not move as it gets colder
metal can damage the underside coloring
on the glass but I imagine if you're
opening up your phone there are bigger
hardware problems to worry about than
just the aesthetics finally the back
glass panel pulls away from the phone
and there's a lot going on in here
this is gonna be a fun one there's the
thin rivet and along the bottom of the
battery that we've never seen before
it's taking my metal tool in too far
would have damaged this or torn it so we
got lucky
we have the large wireless charging coil
here in the center of the phone and over
off on the back panel we have the
fingerprint scanner without any ribbon
cables all of its communication is going
through these Colton contact pads which
is super smart one less ribbon cable to
worry about when opening up the phone
speaking of which it's time to get under
the plastics 7 Phillips head screws
along the top of the motherboard and
another 7 screws holding down the bottom
black plastic segment then the plastics
can start to come away the whole top
including the wireless charging comes
off as one piece it's got the same gold
contact pads that rest against the
motherboard just like that fingerprint
scanner and now I'll unplug the battery
that the phone was so adamant that I
don't remove well mosey on down and pop
off the bottom plastics to see what this
extra ribbon cable over the batteries
all about the loudspeaker is built into
the plastics LG is calling this a
boombox speaker with extra bass and I'd
have to agree on this one when this
thing is pounding it vibrates the entire
frame of the phone with its power it's
still a cell phone speaker of course but
it is big and louder than normal
under that speaker we get our first look
at the wired gold cables lying on top
the battery they unsnap from the
motherboard but now with a Lego
connector these are the wire cables we
normally see convert it into a ribbon
cable instead I'll unclip the screen
from the motherboard and the eight
megapixel front camera up at the top
these are the normal Lego style ribbon
connectors and also the SIM card tray
comes out removing the motherboard is
incredibly similar to the Galaxy S nine
at this point with the board folding out
and the charging port plugged into the
underside of the board with a little
ribbon I'll unclip that plug releasing
the motherboard and exposing the dual
dollops of thermal paste on the back
along with the dual camera units I'll
unplug the cameras one cool thing I want
to point out with the SIM card tray
housing is that this SIM card tray can
handle a sim and SD card at the same
time which is pretty normal but if you
leave out the SD card and orient a
second sim perpendicularly in its slot
it becomes a dual SIM card tray pretty
smart three different card orientations
in one little slot back to the camera
lenses LG has given us two lenses that
accomplish different things the bottom
camera is super wide angle 16 megapixels
kind of like a GoPro with no optical
stabilization the top camera is the
normal non wide-angle 16 megapixel lens
with optical image stabilization I'll
plug those back into the motherboard
and since the motherboard is out of the
frame we can finally get a look at the
charging port and get that you know
battery out the headphone jack is its
own little unit with red rubber
waterproofing around the tip I'll set
that off to the side and finally the
charging port comes away from the phone
with its little plastic supports to keep
it elevated from the middle this time we
have blue rubber around the tip to help
keep water out of this hole it's USBC
and now we can get a closer look at
what's normally those wire antennas that
are now turned into ribbon cables I'd be
interested to know what sparked that
decision and how different these perform
over the original wires the inside of
this phone looks amazing the aluminum is
all anodized at the same time so the
inside of the phone is uniformly the
same color as the outside thumbs up for
that you can see the mill markings from
the machine that carved this shape out
of a solid metal block the buttons are
the normal clicky little guys which are
easily replaceable the volume button
flex for last year's LG g6 currently
costs only six dollars which is a
refreshing change from HTC's
non-replaceable buttons on the u 12 we
have the front camera and
the earpiece at the top and a few
water-resistant microphone holes and of
course the circular coin style vibration
motor and over here we have the copper
heat pipe for thermal dissipation it's
not quite as big as the raiser phone but
every little bit counts now the battery
the thing our phone begged us not to
remove from the moment we turned it on
is the last thing to come out from
inside this phone it was tucked up
underneath those charging ports signal
ribbons and it doesn't have any magical
pull tabs
I did try warming it up since warm
adhesive separates better than cold
adhesive but eventually with a
combination of metal and plastic pry
tools I was able to get it out of the
phone the screen ribbon cable is tucked
up under the bottom half of the battery
so avoid that area if you need to reuse
your screen one rip on that cable and
your screen will stop functioning LG
still says no dogs allowed which is cool
everyone's entitled to their own opinion
the screen is glued into the frame of
the phone like we've seen on most other
glass pack phones these days heat and
prying is used to pull the display away
from the metal frame the old screen
won't survive the removal I'll link
replacement parts in the description
when they become available let's get
this thing put back together see if it
still works it's nice that everything in
here is pretty modular but it's
unfortunate that some of the most common
repairs like a battery and screen
replacement require every component to
come out to get the motherboard back
into place I'll clip the charging port
board into the bottom first and then
gently lay it down into the frame making
sure no wires like the battery and front
camera are caught underneath I do feel
like as phones get harder to repair less
people attempt the project
I think the moment a heat gun is
required a lot of people will give up
what do you think at what point would
you give up on repair I got the bottom
loudspeaker in place then lastly I'll
plug in the 3000 milliamp hour battery
before putting on the top plastics with
that attached wireless charger I think
the LG G 7 is one of the most
feature-rich phones of 2018 and is
definitely a phone worth taking a look
at I'll get the 14 screws back into
place to hold everything tight and read
here the back glass panel to the phone
with double sided tape and check that
out everything still works
I love that the don't remove the battery
warning still pops up sure ain't gonna
fall out on its own I'll tell you that
much hit that subscribe button if you
haven't already and coming out with me
on Twitter and Instagram thanks ton for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
