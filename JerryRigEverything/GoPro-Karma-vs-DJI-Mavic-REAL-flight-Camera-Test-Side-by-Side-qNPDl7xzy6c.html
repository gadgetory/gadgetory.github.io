Mavic and we have the GoPro Karma I'm
here with Jared Meachem we just barely
unbox these drones on Jared's Channel
yeah I'll leave a link for that down the
video description Jerry what are we
doing right now we are gonna go take a
quick camera comparison right after
unboxing these see how they stack up
against each other cameras side by side
God tell me which camera you think is
best in the comments below let's get
started
you
you
alright that was way fun I loved it it
was sweet what did you think your first
time flying the drones well I only have
the Phantom 4
well DJI drones to compare from and my
initial thought was the GoPro Karma is a
lot more gradual it's smooth and it's
turning and it's a little bit slower and
a little bit more wobbly when it's a
hovering okay yeah I didn't notice that
the Mavic was a little bit more stable
yes and they're just like while we were
taking off here like it was solid as a
rock
the Karma was a little bit teeter-totter
II but while you're turning am I getting
like shots the the Karma was just smooth
as butter yeah I also noticed that your
Lin's so on the cuz you were flying the
GoPro I was flying the nav ik on the
GoPro Linds it was actually like a much
wider angle so you get much more like a
lot more things in your shot absolutely
yeah and just in the display
you used your iPhone display to look at
I use the GoPro Cromer controller your
color gamut was way bigger I mean you
could see a lot more rich colors but
ultimately it'll come down to what you
guys see on the screen so he was using
the screen that came with the GoPro
Karma if you want to see all of the
other accessories that come with the
karma and the Mavic go check out Jared's
channel jared Meachem on youtube I'll do
a link down in the video description and
you can see us unboxing both of the
drones
now that we've done the side by side
comparison let me know what camera you
think looks best go off with the
stabilization the color and the
definition of the footage I'll leave a
poll in the upper corner that you can
answer there and answer down in the
comments thanks ton for watching we'll
see you around
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
