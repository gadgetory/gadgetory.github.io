steering stabilizer basically we're
underneath the Jeep Grand Cherokee now
the steering stabilizer is this guy
right here I'm just kind of attaches to
mill this bar and then on the on the
frame right here as well I'm it's right
above the track bar so mine is a it's
one of the death wobble fixes you can
say usually is the track bar
I'm also the steering stabilizer
sometimes an alignment can cause it
basically anything that has play in it's
like you see the track bar sometimes has
some play here in this bushing in my
case this was not the cause sometimes
play here in these arms can cause it
over here with the pitman arm that could
cause it sometimes the steering steering
gears can do it so we're just kind of
narrowing it down with the options with
the most common options I guess you
should say anyway so to take off the
steering stabilizer this bolt right here
is a fifteen millimeter and the one
right here is a 19 millimeter and now he
took out the cotter pin so this pull
right here is completely stuck on the
wrist bar right here the only place with
threads so it's not threaded inside of
this so I'm going to do right now is I'm
going to take a torch and heat it up a
little bit the w4t wouldn't do anything
to it one more reason it makes me
suspect that this is going bad up here
is that it's starting to leak while it's
been leaking the fluid that's been
inside of it so once that happens you
know that the shock is selfish shot so
hopefully anyone who fixed the death
wobble
okay so the heat was pretty much useless
so what I have right now are the tip
Mountain puller so I'm going to do is I
have it tightened around the edges of
this right here and then this bolt right
here pushes against that one and
hopefully we can get the bolt out of
there it's bound pretty tight anyway so
this one is a 17 millimeter is basically
tighten it down until that one pops off
okay so that's what the bowl looks like
what it's tucked down in there like I
mentioned before it doesn't have threads
on this part of it so it was just
basically bound inside of that I also
forgot to mention I did use a couple
squirts of that TV blaster stuff stuff
is amazing
I was using w4t before that and I don't
know if it was the Tippmann arm of the
PB Blaster but hey we got it out so you
can see where it's been leaking all that
hydraulic fluid or whatever else they
put inside these things
so with the new warm I'm pretty much
just plug-and-play you just slide it in
there and then I believe this bolt on
this end is a 15 millimeter then the
other one is an 18 and then with this
end right here I went ahead and put the
top on um first of all I'm just so I
wouldn't have to deal with it all up
inside the car and then I just slid this
in down into it and it's pretty easy you
know it's all now that I got the other
bolt out this one just slides in and out
pretty simply so and then I just need to
put the bolt on this in with the cotter
pin and you see the bowl has the little
ridges on it's the cotter pin can slide
inside bolt just goes on like that there
you believe that this nut needs to be
tightened to 35 pounds of torque and
then the top one as well so that's how
you install steering stabilizer I
usually throw up videos probably every
week or so so if you're interested in
Jeep repair automotive or anything you
know taking apart cellphones I do a do a
large variety of stuff anyway feel free
to like if this helped you and subscribe
