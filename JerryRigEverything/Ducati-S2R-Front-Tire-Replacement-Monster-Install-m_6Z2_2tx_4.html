front tire on a Ducati yes to our right
now was it back - I already off and I
have this stand I took a normal car jack
and I was jacked up one side of the
front all the way to the top and I put a
cinder block underneath the other side
and that's what's keeping the tire off
the ground though so that one stand a
lot of time working on this bike we're
gonna do right now is we're gonna loosen
up these two bolts here and these two
bolts here on this side which kind of
release the grip on the axle
then we're gonna remove this nut this
nut here is a 28 millimeter and these
nuts right here are 12 millimeter so
I'll take off the CalPERS right here to
do it takes a size 8 allen wrench on
these two bolts right there I'm taking
this off
this one does have the steel braided
brake lines so it should be fine just
hang in here but if you're really
nervous about it you can zip tie it up
so I'm on the outside just to kind of
help support its own weight and not hurt
anything good idea because when you're
pulling a tire out it's gonna hit it up
anyway I just want to go ahead and
zip-tie mine right outside of here
so the axle was taken out a little bit
just took a rubber mallet and let it
Bend from this side and then this side
you can lift the wheel up a little bit
it should be able to pull it out whether
it by hand or by some pliers or
something you just really don't want to
damage this edge we'll do this I'll grab
like a wooden dowel or like a broom
handle and like stick it right here
and just kind of pound away at it at the
end of it to push it all the way through
really helps if you have two people some
pull the axle out make sure not to like
let it lay completely on the ground you
don't want to get like dust and grime
and stuff up on you here and I'll show
you how to put a new axle grease looks
like this one hardly any grease on there
at all
I'll fit the new axle grease on there
before we put it back yet
there's the tires get to come out and
depending on your shop you might need to
take off these rotors my shop says find
leave them on when they're replacing the
rubber part of the tire Sam we're good
to go
axle get it all brushed off so all the
dirt and stuff and all the old grease is
off of it and the tire actually only
rotates from about here to here I'm so
I'm just gonna put grease in that area
on the part where it's sitting inside of
the front forks doesn't need to be
greased just give it a bit of grease on
there like that
even they've spread it all over the
place it needs to be about that pick all
the way around so you just barely on
there when you stick it all the way
through the bike I'm just gonna a lot I
was gonna scrape off anyway it's also
right here on the tire it tell us what
direction is rotating you want to make
sure that it's you know obviously and
are the right direction nice pike also
has a spacer between a wheel or the axle
just goes through in the outside fork so
make sure you get the spacer back in
there and then in half pretty much it
back in with a rubber mallet or
something soft make sure it's all the
way I'll post a link in the video
description for the tires they're really
cheap on Amazon best place to get them
just look in the video description for
that there you go we're back on the
ground everything's tightened down
these are let's super important kind of
pinch the axle in place and make sure
those are tight you have to only
questions my sure leave them in the
comments I put everything you need in
the description I'm like the back Jack
you know different parts that you'll
need for it so just go ahead and search
through everything it's on amazon amazon
the cheapest place to buy all the stuff
so anyway if you have any comments leave
them in the comments yes do you like
