fruit themed phone market next to Apple
and Blackberry it's time to see if this
newcomer can hold its own during a
durability test the box says talk more
smile more and save the gorillas I
wasn't planning on saving any gorillas
this morning but this phone just talked
me into it
let's get started inside the box we get
some instruction booklets the banana
phone itself and a micro USB charging
cable pretty simple design so far my
banana has three buttons and is about
the same size as a real banana which
I've included here for scale apparently
by buying this phone one percent of the
sales are donated to gearing up for
gorillas an organization working out of
the Congo so that's kind of cool
grabbing my most picks there is no
screen on this contraption mostly
because it works exclusively through
bluetooth and acts as a wireless
bluetooth headset for your current phone
the whole thing appears to be made from
yellow plastic up here by the earpiece
as well as the stim is all plastic the
yellow buttons are also made from
plastic and the rest of the shaft down
here next to the microphone is plastic
it's literally now possible to pair a
banana with an Apple via bluetooth and
if that's not the future I don't know
what is peeling the banana down at the
bottom near the micro USB charging port
reveals more plastic I can see why the
Box said do not eat you'd have to be
bananas to eat this banana because going
bananas means yeah alright but if the
banana is structural that is what we've
all come here to find out
gripping the tropical fruit with both
hands and flexing the construction
reveals a solid build quality there is
some creaking along the outer plastic
peel but the banana remains solid and
intact I would not worry about keeping
this banana in your pocket unlike a real
banana which would definitely not be
safe in your pants here in the United
States bananas are usually eaten raw but
in other parts of the world there is a
member of the banana family called
planten's that is fried and is
surprisingly delicious my lighter
doesn't cook this banana real good but
I'll include a recipe in the description
if you want to
make some real planten's for yourself
you're currently watching a grown-man
play with a banana let that sink in for
a second and figure out what life
decisions got you to this point and then
let's keep going it's time to take the
banana apart and review it from the
inside the banana has no visible
exterior screws but does have a nice
seam along the outside that allows the
banana to peel in half getting our first
look inside and I'll be honest there's
quite a lot of wasted space in here
there is plenty of room for wireless
charging or even a headphone jack this
is not an efficient banana at all
curious enough though there are two
Phillips head screws holding down a
large block of solid metal people
generally associate weight with quality
so adding a metal banana core while
decreasing nutritional value would
indeed provide a false sense of quality
and substance a nice little trick there
banana maker there are four screws
holding down the motherboard to the
banana peel
there is no waterproofing inside the
banana but there is a lot of hot glue
holding in all the components it's a
very inexpensive yet effective
construction technique up top we have
the largest ear piece I've ever seen
inside of a phone held in place by the
same hot glue we see everywhere else
it's hardwired to the motherboard just
like the microphone down at the bottom
of the banana repairability
wasn't high on the priority list during
the banana design process
no Lego connections anywhere I was
finally able to pop the charging port
out of the device but not before it
snapped in half rendering my banana
uncharged Abul in the future but at
least we got to see the insides the
battery is a 450 milliamp power which
gives this banana about 10 hours of
talktime Apple's usually have closer to
14 hours of talk time and finally app
will beat another phone as something
thumbs up for that the three buttons are
all injection molded into one piece
overall I'd have to say that the banana
shape is a great form factor for a cell
phone it has a nice curve to it way
better than something round like an
orange or this carrot I love carrots do
you like carrots what's your favourite
fruit do you think the banana phones are
gonna be the next big thing let me know
in the comments if you want a banana
phone of your own I'll put a link down
in the video description and thanks a
ton for watching I will see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
