tested cleared and now it's time to
review the flagship killer from the
inside I'll be focusing on water
resistance this time around
oneplus doesn't have an official IP
rating on this phone like other
flagships have and it's time to find out
why let's get started the back glass is
our first defense against water when I
remove the back panel during the clear
one plus six video there was plenty of
adhesive all around the back side of the
phone effectively sealing off the
largest hole against water some phones
have more adhesive than others
I'd say the oneplus has more adhesive
than an LG phone but less than a samsung
I'll use my red pry tool to unclip the
long fingerprint scanner from the
motherboard releasing the back glass
panel then I'll unplug the red custom
battery I still have my fingers crossed
that oneplus will go back to making red
batteries on their own someday but we'll
see what happens
normally there's a green pull tab to
release the 3300 milliamp power square
I'll just leverage my now since it's
already been removed once now for the
brains of the phone to get at the
motherboard we have nine screws holding
down the top plastics the interesting
thing about these screws is that they
have red thread Locker on them normally
the thread Locker is blue but I'm always
down for the little red details I can
pop off the top plastic from the frame
once the screws are out giving us our
first look at the NFC coil this does all
of its communication through the gold
contact pads that rest up against the
motherboard on the underside of the
plastic
I'll unclip the displayed ribbon cables
and the charging port ribbon the mute
sliding switch looks pretty cool and
then I'll remove the one screw holding
down the motherboard right there in the
center the next ingress point is the SIM
card tray know normally when we look at
an iPhone or a Samsung there's a little
bit more substantial rubber ring around
the end of the SIM card tray this one
plus dual SIM slot does have rubber but
it seems to be pretty minimal at the
opening we'll come back to this later
I'll unclip two wire cables down at the
side of the phone and then one last
little Lego style connector up there by
the earpiece and the whole one plus six
motherboard can pull away from the frame
of the phone there's no heat pipes or a
thermal paste on the one plus six which
you would normally find in flagships
time will tell if that's important or
not if the phone starts lagging from
heat down the road we'll know it
probably needed some extra heat
dissipation for the processor
up at the top of the phone is a
microphone hole usually this helps with
noise cancelling and the inner side of
that hole is protected by a
water-resistant mesh which I just
punctured so far oneplus has done a good
job of keeping water out another big
hole to worry about is the earpiece the
earpiece speaker pulls out easy enough
and between the speaker and the outside
grille is another large piece of that
same mesh this little guy is sealed
around the edges and you can see from
this water droplet it keeps water from
leaking inside of the phone granted
there is no pressure right now on that
droplet so if the phone was submerged or
there was a jet of water on the grill
from like a shower head it would have
more pressure and possibly penetrate
that mesh but at least there's
resistance in place I'll get the speaker
back in and move on to something else
unique about this phone the button
housing it's got its own little capsule
inside of the frame where the metal
button touches the electronic switch
which then transfers the signal to the
golden contact pads that rest against
the motherboard and this masive metal
probably also helps keep water out the
motherboard is next with its dual rear
camera units remember the main camera is
in the center with 16 megapixels and oh
is that Hardware stabilization but the
top camera is a 20 megapixel sensor
without oh is still seems a little
redundant to me
I think they should swap it out for
telephoto or wide-angle but it can shoot
4k at 60 frames per second so I'm not
complaining too much the front camera is
another 16 megapixel sensor with no
optical stabilization just electronic
let's jump into the bottom of the phone
it's actually pretty cool down here and
there are eight screws holding down the
loudspeaker plastics and the whole thing
can pull away from the bottom of the
phone it's got its own water-resistant
mesh on the opening of the speaker and
also inside the speaker under this
little circular sticker we find a foam
ball pit for ants this probably also
helps with sound dampening I'll do a
little more research and figure it out
for sure but until then it's a party pit
for ants there are a few more ribbon
cables under the plastic the screen
ribbon unsnaps like a little Lego along
with the white wire cable the middle
ribbon and the headphone jack has its
own Lego connector as well this little
guy has a rim of red rubber around the
opening just like we've seen with the
water-resistant LG and Samsung phones
rubber matches the little latch we took
off from the fingerprint scanner earlier
thumbs up for aesthetics I'll remove the
circuit board and we get our
a little circular vibration motor with
its gold contacts and then we have two
screws holding down the USBC charging
port I'll pop that out and get some more
red rubber around in the opening so far
the water resistance of this one plus
six is on par with other flagships that
actually do have an IP rating every hole
seems to be protected there is even an
additional screen over the loudspeaker
holes so there are some ingress points
that have even doubled up on water
protection
I'll get the charging port screwed back
into place I personally would never risk
my electronics around water and I'm not
exactly sure why oneplus didn't get an
official IP rating for the phone but
from the inside it looks like this one
plus six has all of the same protections
that other ip67 phones have extra
protection is always a good thing and
accidents happen so it's nice of
one-plus to add it all for us I got the
loudspeaker back into place with its
eight screws and I'll tuck the
motherboard into place making sure none
of the ribbons are pinched under the
board screen replacements are pretty
standard by the way everything has to
come out of the phone then heats used to
separate the screen from the frame and
then the old metal frame is reused with
the new screen pretty similar to other
glass back phones there are a few water
damage indicators inside the phone just
in case water does get in oneplus will
be able to tell the white box has bleed
red when they get wet there's one down
by the charging port and another one
here by the SIM card tray once again
it's always a smart idea to keep your
phone away from water the back plastics
are all in place and screwed down tight
I'll slide my custom red battery in and
clip the fingerprint scanner back into
place after getting all of the adhesive
ready for the glass overall it's a
pretty straightforward design much more
water resistant than I anticipated and
everything still works do you think
oneplus should make a foam ball pit for
regular-sized people let me know down in
the comments come hang out with me on
Twitter and Instagram and thanks a ton
for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
