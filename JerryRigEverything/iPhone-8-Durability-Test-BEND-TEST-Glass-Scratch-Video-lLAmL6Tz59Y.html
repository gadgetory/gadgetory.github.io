and feel as last year's iPhone 7 but
with the huge physical difference of
adding a glass back instead of metal
this is my first time touching the
iPhone 8 since Apple didn't invite me
out to their launch event not really
sure why and the glass makes it
surprisingly heavy which I actually
really like will this new glass iPhone
have the same structural integrity that
the metal iPhones had previously there's
literally only one way to find out let's
get started
apple claims that this is the most
durable glass ever on a smartphone
pretty bold claim I've tested over 75
different phones now and I think we
should start with the scratch test first
I have a set of Mohs hardness picks that
differentiate between different minerals
plastic screen phones with scratch at
level three glass is usually around a 5
or a 6 on Mohs scale and real sapphire
scratches at level 8 or 9 as far as
scratching goes this glass scratched at
level 6 with a deeper groove at a level
7 which is the exact same score that the
iPhone 7 got last year as well as the
note 8 and most other tempered glass
flagships these days when Apple says
most durable they might be talking about
impacts and drops instead of scratch
resistance let me know in the comments
if you think I should drop test a couple
of these phones even though the screen
is impervious to my razor blade coins
and keys I would still recommend a
screen protector plenty of other dust
minerals and pockets and are harder than
a level 6 and can cause micro operations
speaking of sapphire Apple does claim to
use some sapphire on their phones namely
the camera lenses so we'll have to put
that to the test again the home button
is not affected by my razor blade so it
won't get damaged or scratched up while
sliding around in your pocket or purse
and that's good for durability up at the
top of the phone we have these 7
megapixel front-facing camera tucked
under that same slab of front glass so
it is protected against major scratches
and damage as well with previous
versions of the iPhone Apple used a
flimsy metal screen to cover the
earpiece which sometimes could jostle
and fall out but nowadays they use a
more permanent solid metal screen which
will not fall out or dislodge bonus
points for that one the gold glass
iPhone 8 has a solid slab covering the
entire rear surface of the phone still
undamaged by
razorblade it's also good to see the
Apple logo and the iPhone text are
layered under the glass and not exposed
on the surface this means they won't rub
or wear away with use or time it's
pretty cool how the dual tone LED flash
blends so perfectly with the pink and
gold color of this phone protected under
the glass surface things are still
looking sleek and aesthetic
one cool thing is that right next to the
camera lens there's a little microphone
hole that has a metal grille in it
Apple's attention to small detail and
aesthetics is amazing
most phones just leave it as a hole with
no protection and now for the camera
lens apple claims that this is made from
sapphire sapphire is a super premium and
expensive and durable material that
resists scratching until level 8 or 9 on
most scale testing out this claim with
my razor blade which is about a five and
a half on Mohs scale leaves no scratches
which is great and that means that this
camera lens is just as durable as
regular glass so far but when I test
Apple's sapphire with my most picks I
see visible marks at level six and a
level seven and a deep catching groove
at a level eight it looks like Apple's
still using their own proprietary blend
of sapphire I dealt pretty deep into
this subject during a previous video and
it is indeed aluminum oxide which is the
ingredients of sapphire but my most pics
and an electron microscope indicate that
it is a lower grade material than the
actual pure sapphire that's used in T so
spree Miam high-end watches or the full
sapphire display on the HTC u ultra
sapphire edition both of which didn't
scratch until level eight Apple might
have extreme attention to detail but
it's my opinion that they cut some
corners with this sapphire stuff I did
buy one of their overpriced sapphire
Apple watches to test and that should
arrive today sometime so make sure
you're subscribed so you don't miss that
durability test there is a metal ring
around the camera lens but the weird
part is that the camera lint sticks up
even farther than the metal ring does so
there's no protection for that lens and
since it scratches at a level 6 instead
of a level 8 it still needs that
protection now the sides of the phone
are real metal so Apple did a good job
there this handles keys and coins very
well
but my razor blade manages to remove
some color exposing that silver 7000
series aluminum underneath so it's
probably best to not keep your razor and
phone in the same pocket the SIM card
tray and power buttons are both metal
along with the buttonless and port lists
top of the phone the volume buttons and
mute switch are also metal bonus points
for that I'm still definitely a huge fan
of that mute switch by the way I wish
more Android phones had that feature but
singular proprietary lightning port is
at the bottom of the phone still metal
down here as well and still no headphone
jack but Apple has been kind enough to
include a dongle in the box if you don't
happen to have one of your own now I do
like to roast Apple every now and then
physically and verbally and one cool
thing about the IPS Retina display is
that after about 10 seconds in extreme
heat the pixels go black and turn off
but after the heat is removed and the
pixels cooled down they recover
completely the phone is cool to the
touch within seconds it's still
important to not try this on your own
phone because the flame does burn off
the oleophobic exterior coating on the
glass I have been contacted by several
angry mothers whose kids have burned
phones so please don't try this at home
speaking of things to not try at home
it's time for the ultimate test of
durability nothing stresses the
construction of a phone like a bin test
and whether you're an Android fan or an
Apple user everyone can appreciate a
well-built phone and this is indeed a
well-built phone there is ZERO flex to
this device if you remember on my iPhone
7 bin test last year the waterproofing
adhesive was ruined by the bend but this
has since been corrected with the iPhone
8 I'm very impressed
there is no glass separation on the
front or the back no matter how you bend
it this phone is definitely skinny jean
approved the last thing I want to point
out as a bonus and thumbs up to Apple's
build quality is the rear glass panel it
has a lip of plastic around the edge as
a cushion to protect the glass during
drops so the plastic helps out smart
design choice the front screen also has
a plastic cushion around the glass as
well most people wouldn't notice this
subtle detail but Apple does put an
extraordinary amount of thought and
design into their phones well except for
the sapphire camera lens anyway hit that
subscribe button if you want to see that
Sapphire Apple watch tested and come
hang out with me on Instagram and
Twitter I think we should try and make a
clear iPhone 8 bang stuff for watching
and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
