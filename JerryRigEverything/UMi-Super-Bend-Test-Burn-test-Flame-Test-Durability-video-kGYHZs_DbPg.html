I've tested on my channel has been
purchased by me and I like it that way
it lets me be totally unbiased my
durability reviews don't get me wrong I
won't turn down a free phone to test it
just hasn't happened yet until today
today a company called Umi sent me a
phone they call super the Yumi super
phone when they first sent me an email I
was pretty shocked I asked them if they
even know what I do with phones but they
said that they wanted an unbiased test
of their device so I told them to send
it over I totally respect that the
presentation is pretty awesome it comes
in a foam filled metal container the
container is real metal I did check it
is interesting to compare the huge price
difference between the yumi super and
the galaxy s7 edge when they have
relatively similar specs i'll list the
full specs in the video description but
let's find out if the super phone is as
super as it seems the phone feels pretty
solid the metal body and the huge
battery adds some serious weight to the
device like usual let's start with the
screen I have a set of pics that tell me
where the screen falls on Mohs scale of
hardness this phone is using Gorilla
Glass 3 so when I start to scratch the
glass with my picks
I can see faint marks that don't rub off
at a level 4 as well as a level 5 but
the scratch on the screen doesn't get
super noticeable until level 6 and 7 but
it still scratched early on the scale
the glass on this phone is much softer
than usual normally a phone won't
scratch at all until level 6 I check to
see if my keys we leave any notes will
mark but they didn't so you're mostly
safe keep in mind that I have scratched
all 27 other phones with the level 7
pick as well that'll be important later
on in this video
humne says the phone is a solid metal
design and judging by the sound my razor
is making with the little metal
curlicues that are coming off the back
I'd have to say they're telling the
truth which is now is the case the
fingerprint scanner is coated with
plastic just like the galaxy s7 even
after heavy scratching on the coating it
would still accept my fingerprint and
unlock the phone without any hesitation
so a thumbs up for the resilient
fingerprint scanner all the side buttons
as well as the SIM card tray are made of
metal it is easy to cheap out as a
manufacturer and use plastic buttons but
I'm glad they stuck with the quality
metal feel for the entire phone even
down by the USB type-c charging port the
frame is metal
now the top and bottom rear of the phone
do have a plastic shield I imagine this
is where the screws are located to open
up the phone
we'll find out more during my teardown
video tomorrow the rear Panasonic 13
megapixel camera lens is made of glass
and is slightly recessed into the middle
housing but it is still pretty close to
flush
either way sensitive glass it won't be
as prone to scratches as a plastic lens
would the front camera lens is
incorporated into the glass screen so
that is protected as well and down by
the home button we have a notification
circle where the home button is this
blinks different colors depending on the
notification you have which is actually
pretty unique much more interesting than
just the tiny little LED at the top onto
the flame test the youmu super has a
1080p IPS LCD display noticed a little
scratch that my level 7 pick left on the
glass don't forget about that we'll be
back to it when the extreme heat is
applied to the screen it will stand its
ground for 15 seconds before the pixels
go black and turn off but the pixels
fully recover and are cool to the touch
again within seconds now we're on to the
bin test I've tested over 27 phones now
and only four have failed
catastrophically this umyou super does
flex a little when I try to bend the
phone from the back but it does not
break so it does not fail the bin test
but when I rotate the phone to see the
front I notice that the softer glass has
cracked from the scratch that I
previously made on the screen it is
rather unfortunate that the glass
cracked from the Flex but this
particular failing point the cracking is
also very easily prevented even the
cheapest of screen protectors would have
kept the screen free from scratches thus
protecting it from cracking during the
bin test
even when flexing the phone from the
other direction it will not bend or
break it is very sturdy there is a small
ripple in the metal near the SIM card
tray that is easy to fix the most
unfortunate part of this test is the
edge to edge crack the digitizer is
broken for everything below that line so
the top half of the phone will respond
to touches but the bottom half of the
phone the part below the crack will not
so the phone is effectively inoperable
at this point I understand that my tests
are rough but they do give a solid idea
of what to watch out for when you own
your own device with a solid tempered
glass screen protector on this super
phone it will be the king of all budget
devices and even hold its own against
most flagships in summary get a screen
Tector and this phone will last a long
time I will still tear down this phone
to analyze the build quality from the
inside because that's just what I do
with all phones I've opened up all the
popular phones from the last four years
on my channel just search the name of
your phone and the word jerry-rigged
everything on YouTube and there will be
a good chance that you can see the guts
of your phone open for display I always
post behind the scenes stuff on my
Twitter and Instagram as well as
snapchat and subscribe if you want to
see your next phone durability tested
before you purchase it thanks for
