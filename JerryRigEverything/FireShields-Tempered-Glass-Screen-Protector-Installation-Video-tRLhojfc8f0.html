can ever buy for your phone is a tempered
glass screen protector.
The ones I sell are called Fire Shields.
They have a lifetime warranty and are thin
enough to work with any case.
You can click the link in the lower left hand
corner or check the video description for
my website.
Not only does a tempered glass screen protector
protect your screen from scratches, it also
helps your phone be more shatter resistant.
A small investment now will extend the life
of your device.
Here’s the protector itself.
You can see how thin it is.
And I’m going to walk you through the super
easy installation process.
Here’s the little tab for a little protector
that’s on the bottom side of the glass.
Before you take that off, position the glass
on top of your phone so you can see exactly
where it needs to be for the final installation.
You can take one of the cleaning pads, the
dry or the wet, and make sure that there’s
no dust on top of your screen, or smudges
or fingerprints.
I find that quick motions along the top will
get rid of the smudges and fingerprints.
And then long swipes from the top and the
bottom will get rid of any of the dust specks
on top of the screen; just like so.
You can check with the glare of the light
to make sure that there are no dust specks
on top.
Dust specks will be your worst enemy during
the installation process.
Take off the bottom glass protector.
Then you can line the protector up with the
top of your phone, judging the distance between
the glass and the earpiece, as well as the
sides of the device.
You want to make sure that there’s an equal
distance between the screen protector and
each edge of the device.
You can drop the protector down into place,
and you can see that it will magically adhere
to your screen.
The nice thing about these protectors is that
they will never leave any residue on your
device.
So if you ever need a warrantee replacement,
you just lift it off and plop the new one
on and you’re good to go.
Take your finger and you can press it around
the edge of the screen just to make sure that
all of the edges are adhered to the device.
Then you can clean it off with the remaining
pad from your kit.
Now, there is no dust under this protector
but let’s pretend like I did get a dust
speck underneath my screen.
Now I’m going to teach you how to remove
a dust speck after your screen has been installed.
Here’s the little speck removing sticker.
You can also use just a piece of clear tape
if you would like as well.
Grab a razor blade and slip it underneath
one of the corners closest to the dust speck
and you can see that it will lift up the screen
protector a little bit.
And slide your sticker, or piece of tape,
in between the glass and the screen.
If your dust speck is stuck to the protector,
make sure the sticky side is up.
If your dust speck is stuck to the screen,
make sure that your sticky side is down.
Basically you’re going to lift up the protector
a little bit and grab the dust speck with
the sticky side of the tape or sticker.
Pretty straight forward.
And then once you pull that dust speck out,
remove the razor blade and the screen should
magically adhere back to the phone again.
Pretty sweet.
