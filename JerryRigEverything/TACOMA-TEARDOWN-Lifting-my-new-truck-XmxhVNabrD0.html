truck I'm super excited about this
normally I don't tear down things this
size or this you know expensive but this
should be really fun I have an icon
stage 9 lift kit and we're gonna remove
a huge chunk of the factory suspension
and replace it with these aftermarket
components let's get started so the
reason people add lists to their truck I
guess my reason why I'm lifting my truck
is just to get a little bit more
performance than the stock vehicle so
most vehicles are designed so they can
be used on the freeway because that's
where it's gonna spend you know 99% of
its life I like things that are
practical and useful in a more broad
spectrum so having a lift on my truck
allows me to go off-road and have more
performance if I ever do need to go off
of like you know a paved road so we have
the truck lifted up off the ground a
little bit so we can get those tires off
and start working on the suspension if
you're when I first started my youtube
channel I was doing more automotive and
car repairs and the reason my whole
channel exists is because of this guy
Bryan's mobile one we're in his shop
today and he's gonna be helping me out a
little bit all right step one get rid of
the wheel so a sitting that I've had
this truck for about 6,000 miles and
there's already some rust on some of the
bolts inside and rust is not a good
thing when it comes to cars it makes
things seize up inside so we're gonna
wire brush that off really quick and
that'll give us easier access to remove
some of the components so we're
replacing the suspension on the truck
and we're gonna show the majority of the
passenger side right now the passenger
and the driver's side are pretty similar
I'll kind of explain a little bit what
each component does as we're going
through the lift so that sway bar that
we just disconnected it wraps up and
goes all the way through the front of
the truck and attaches to the other tire
basically what that does is it connects
the wheels and the frame and everything
in such a way that you don't get body
roll this is what body roll looks like
if you go around the corner it would lay
to the side and that's fine for an
off-road vehicle but on the highway you
don't want to be doing this on the
freeway on-ramp
so the sway bar keeps the body of the
truck from swaying side to side keeps
everything stable ER so this is a
tapered bolt and it goes through this in
such a way that it really gets stuck
to get them undone what I like to do is
just put some shock through it
so you know they're not so obviously
with a project like this there are a lot
of dangers so the truck is supported in
multiple locations and we're taking
special precautions not to damage the
brake lines because if the brake lines
break during this process it adds
another level of complexity that we
don't want to deal with right now so to
keep stress off of this brake line right
here this brake hose we have a jack
stand supported up underneath here on
this knuckle and that's keeping the
weight from breaking that hose up there
my truck is brand new only had it for
three months and there's already rust on
some of the bolts inside the last time I
did this was on like a 95 Jeep Wrangler
and that was that was a nightmare some
of the bolts had seized up so much that
I had to just sawzall through them and
remove the part you know what the bolts
still intact with the metal joined
together if we were to just hit this
with a hammer it might damage the
threads and so we put the castle nut
over the top like this and then it gave
us a flat surface to hit the hammer on
without damaging the actual threads
themselves little trick of the trade and
like always it's a really good idea to
keep your screws organized during the
whole process so up at the top of the
shock there are three bolts with a 14
millimeter with a 14 millimeter nut
attached to it so we're gonna pop those
out and that allows the whole shock
assembly to drop out from the housing
that it's in so at the tie rod off we
can manipulate it to turn right or left
with ease so if you turn it like this
I can lift it up and out and turn it
back the other way
slide it out alright so this is the
shock we just took out you can kind of
see this housing inside that has like
you know a bunch of gas and oil inside
of it and that's kind of what makes a
smooth ride when you're driving your car
or your truck whatever vehicle you have
it also it has this huge spring on it
now icon was nice enough to send me out
one of their lift kits this is a stage 9
from my truck and you can see that the
inside reservoir first of all is super
beefy and it has an external reservoir
as well so when you're going off-road
and there's
bumps and stuff in the road and your
shock is fully extended it still has
enough dampening oil and fluid inside of
this to give you a smooth ride now the
vast majority of people will never ever
need that because their most cars spend
99% of their lives on paved roads but
since my truck is useful and has
features I wanted to be able to go
off-road and that extra fluid and stuff
in the shocks gives a smoother ride off
road when you're crawling or just you
know going on roads that aren't paved so
that reserve reservoir is going to mount
to this bracket so with this out of the
way we can get this into place just like
that alright so this is the upper
control arm it's kind of like this
u-shaped thing right here and we're
replacing that to give you know more
travel to the shock so that what we were
working on inside with the upper control
arm that needs to come out through like
underneath the hood so we've got an air
conditioning line that's in the way and
a little wire harness so we got to
unmount this so that it can flex out of
the way with the bolt out of the way now
we can get a little bit of movement on
it you don't want to crease it but you
can certainly move it to clear the path
through the bolt now this ball right
here we're making progress
perfect got it but to make enough room
for that bolt to come out we had to bend
on that little side wall right there
this flex it on the body mounts a little
bit of aggressive persuasion in order to
get the reservoir bracket in there you
have to take out this plastic tab if you
push on it you can see that it's not
steel it all looks like it's part of the
stamping of the frame but it's no there
we go
the irony is there's already tape right
there so we just complete it those
plastic slips gone the reserve reservoir
brackets gonna fit nice and flush
against the frame all right so this one
is for the passenger side which is the
side of the vehicle we are working on
get it up in the top as far as you can
and then just use a pry bar to get the
rest of the
I would recommend leaving this undone
and bolting the top first it makes it a
lot easier to get those three bolts in
the top blue holds things in place
through vibration without being too
aggressive and it also coats this this
is steel and it has some kind of
anodized coating on it but anytime you
put steel into aluminum it's good to
have something on it so once you get the
first one in you can let it hang by that
and it will help to line the other ones
up so I don't tighten it all the way
until I've got all three bolts in place
if you get a bunch on one side as you
twist it in it'll get around the other
sides too and the beauty of doing it
this way is you can fit a pry bar
underneath it here and get your up and
down and forward and back pretty easy
but these are tough otherwise then go
back through by hand and snug them up
good alright so the bolt goes from the
back side towards the front you support
the shock it goes in really easy I like
to have this side straight and then have
this one angled up just a little bit and
you put this straight side on first
where the bolts gonna go so the best way
to get this in from underneath the hood
was we had to put the washer and then
this metal bit right here on top of the
bolt first and then that allowed the
angle to get through this other hole and
then feed through the entire control arm
out the other side we had to get a
little creative with tapping the end of
the bolt from underneath the hood after
that washer and metal bit we're on and
then it's sink all the way through the
rest of control arm alright so the upper
control arm is here we're gonna attach
this bottom part with this massive nut
do you remember the sway bar right below
that is something called the tie rod and
this is what it's that's your steering
wheel and it moves the steering knuckle
it what's makes your wheels go back and
forth as you're driving your car so
we're gonna take that pop it up back
into this hole it came from put the
castle nut over top
so the reason they call it a castle
notice because it has these little
pillars you know like a castle looks
like so we're gonna stick this pin all
the way through this hole once that pin
is in and make sure that the nut is not
ever gonna spin because when you're
moving your steering wheel back and
forth everything is constantly moving
and that will keep things secure so this
bracket right there the sway arm needs
to be offset a little bit from where it
was before so included it with the icon
stage 9 kit is one of these offset
brackets so we're gonna go ahead plop
this into place basically this uses the
original bolt holes inside of the frame
and then gives us new bolt holes to
mount the sway bar to and that reservoir
bracket is between the spacer and the
frame you'll notice we've got the rubber
splash guard between the bracket and
this that helps to reduce any potential
for noise so in order to mount the
reserve reservoir we had to cut a few
slits inside a splash guard for the
clamps and then we can slide the
reserved reservoir through the clamps
and then tighten them down this part
right here is attached to the sway bar
it's called a sway bar link we're gonna
toss it through here and then we're
pretty much done once I get this
tightened in we have the reservoir we
have the top control arm we have the
shock in place not too bad take a look
at the hardware I think that looks sick
one thing about these lift kits is that
they're adjustable so I can go all the
way down and have it basically build
like the stock height or I can raise it
up along all of these threads and giving
more clearance as the spring gets more
and more compressed down the shaft the
higher we go lift wise like the more you
can press that spring the stiffer the
ride is gonna be but the more clearance
you'll have from the ground which
depending on what you're doing if you're
doing a lot of freeway riding you don't
need a whole lot of clearance but if
you're off-road most of the time I need
to clear like boulders or Hills or
whatever give yourself a higher point of
gravity higher center of gravity then
it's nice to have a higher truck alright
everything is mounted and in place all
of the bolts are snug and tight we have
the skid plate stuck back on along with
the sway bar underneath that so we'll
get the tire put back
in and we'll be good to go all right so
the front tires are done but believe it
or not there are four tires on a truck
and so now we're doing view rear which
are actually leaf springs instead of
like the coil shocks we saw earlier so
they should go a little quicker there is
less parts to replace the leaf springs
are actually super heavy I'll show them
to over here these things probably weigh
over a hundred pounds and there's quite
a few more Springs and the ones we have
underneath so this is called an impact
gun and it's probably been my favorite
tool of the entire day all right so
these are drum brakes the emergency
brake line comes up through here sort of
remove these lines this is the emergency
brake cable we're gonna move that which
will give us more room to mess around
with like the axle and the shocks and
the leaf springs and stuff like that so
this is the shock itself which we're
gonna be replacing should come out
perfect now let's get the better ones in
all right so we're dropping the rear
tire down got just want to point out
that we have the truck support on a lift
and a secondary support underneath the
axle so I'm safe in more than one regard
along with eye protection and right now
we are taking off the bolts these
u-bolts right here that hold the axle to
the leaf springs front bolts out of the
leaf springs these aren't the hardest
part but they're the heaviest we have
the two old leaf springs here working
with late springs it's kind of tricky
because they're under pressure when
they're all pinched together with this
Center bolt on keeping them all lined up
at the same time while they're pinched
together under pressure it's kind of
tricky all right so I have a seat clamp
on this and we've released all of the
bolts holding this sandwich together
this big metal sandwich and as I slowly
loosen up this C clamp it's gonna expand
all the way out and allow us to switch
out some of the leaves inside the leaf
spring so with this big metal sandwich
of a leaf spring there's this one Center
guiding pin and so that's what we are
see clamping together as we lined up all
the way
and there's little metal plates in
between which minimized the sound and
the squeak egde between the layers as
they flex together so you got these
little barrels that spaced out in the
middle part that's it yeah
yeah be careful of your threads but if
you're lined up you can just knock it
through like that in this case according
to instructions this goes to the rear
with the one and then to go to the front
all right well tighten everything down
and then get it back on the truck so as
brian is setting this back into the axle
there's this little pin at the bottom
which sits inside of the axle and what
does that do it keys it up set your
axles axle stays a fixed distance now
that we have a slack in the brake hoses
we can put the brackets back on so this
little guy right here is called a bump
stop which is a little bit different
than another video I made recently it
sits right on top of this and that's so
when the truck bottoms out it doesn't
hit the leaf springs it hits this rubber
on top of the the bump stop okay so the
u-bolts are what hold the axle to the
leaf spring and essentially the rest of
the truck so there's a great big cup
that goes on the bottom side it's like a
giant washer that helps to Center it on
the axle so the thing with these is that
they all have to be even like they have
to be evenly spaced and have an even
number of threads sticking out through
the bottom so right now I'm not gonna go
up all the way I'm just gonna snuggle up
till they're about even all right so
this shock right here we're gonna put it
up through this hole in the top section
and then the bottom section it goes into
that little slot there we are almost
done and my truck is almost put back
together pretty heavy-duty stuff so even
though this truck is the off-road TRD
Tacoma so it's built for off-roading
this shock right here you know it's
still you know mainly gonna be driven on
the freeway so these shocks are quite a
bit smaller than the icon stage 9 shocks
or putting on so you can see the
off-road freeway shocks versus the
off-road off-road shocks pretty big
difference for this next step we have
the bottom of the shocks secured and
then for the top it's hard because you
got to squish these bushings so to
accomplish this part you can either Jack
the axle up with it or you can let the
lift down once you crush it down a
little bit on the bushing then you can
get your nut started
just stack it with a bushing like this
washer on top and then you should have
just enough thread now to where you can
get this started these nuts hold the top
of the shock on it to do it right you
want to tighten it down to where when
you put the second one on it's flush so
put the first one on till you wind it up
like this and spin on the second one
lock it down if you look at it it's got
some texture on one side this mechanic
trick put the texture down all right
it's better put this in the middle and
doing it now that'll help locate the
drill bit so it doesn't creep one of the
things I really like to use when I'm
drill and stuff like this is a bow Lube
boeing company came up with this for
drilling it comes out like margarine
when it gets hot it gets more runny and
you get your bit hot you just dip it
again all right so this is the bracket
that holds the reservoir so we're gonna
stick that in place now to work so the
rear shocks and reservoir are in
everything is tightened down remember we
have the bottom of the u-bolts we have
these bolts right here on top of the
leaf springs and these leaf springs have
to be loaded meaning that the weight has
to be down on the axle and all the way
to the truck is on the leaf springs
before you can tighten these bolts down
in at the end because of the bushings
that's sweet I'm super excited about
this the truck is back on the ground and
look at all that space for extra tires I
am super excited about that that's like
real suspension you've done the
suspensions on trucks and stuff works so
what would you change what did you like
about this one and what would you change
if you had to change anything really
like the reservoirs on this one as far
as changing things I do something with
the mounting of the reservoirs in the
rear I'd well bolts on it's way easier
and it keeps it up off the frame I like
it where the lift comes from the
steering knuckle having a little bit of
change but they're a lot harder and more
expensive to make so with this with the
icon stage nine we started about 10
o'clock in the morning it's nine o'clock
now so it took us I would say about 10
10 hours or so if we had to do it again
we could probably do it a little bit
quicker but you know
it's not too bad there's some learning
curve we cheated we looked at the
instructions a few times yeah so right
now with the truck that does have the
stock tires on it still which are pretty
like you know hidden inside of the truck
and leave plenty of space around the
outside so inside of the wheel will so I
will be getting new tires and rims but I
will save that for a new video this is
just how to install the lift on the
truck and huge thanks to Bryan for
helping me out with this process I don't
have all the tools to do it myself you
can do it with hand tools but with the
right tools it's a lot easier if you
have not seen Bryan's channel definitely
go check it out I'll leave a link right
here somewhere on Bryan for his channel
check me out I've got all kinds of stuff
that show how carves work how to
diagnose things I got some hard-hit and
heavy duty stuff and I got some easy
stuff too huge thanks to icon for
hooking us up with this stage 9 lift if
you have any questions leave them down
in the comments and Bryan will be here
to answer them all thanks its own thanks
a ton for watching and I will see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
