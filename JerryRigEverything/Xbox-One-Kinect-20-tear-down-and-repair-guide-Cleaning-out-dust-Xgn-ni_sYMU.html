2.0 for the Xbox one
this is Microsoft's camera and first we
have to find the screws so underneath
this void black tape that actually says
Microsoft on it when you pill it up
we're going to find a screws that line
the bottom once you get those screws out
the black plastic piece pops up and out
which shows a bunch more screws that we
have to remove and if you're just taking
this apart to clean out the lenses you
don't have to take these screws out so
don't worry about that right now once
you get the screws out you can take
apart the back grille for the fan and
then the side grilles also pop out you
have to remove the side grilles because
there's two more screws one on either
side holding the front faceplate or lens
cover to the actual device itself so
once you take out those two screws the
top will lift up and the front will pop
off the actual connect of ice it's all
nice and shiny and you can see the
little lenses that cover the infrared
and the other sensors on the front we
have the actual device right here and
you can see the main camera here and the
emotion camera and then the other
sensors and lenses right there now with
the top motherboard is held on by these
screws and the fan connector is here
it's just your normal 5 volt DC fan and
there's one more screw that holds on the
little circuit board on the front they
have to remove and then that exposes the
little white ribbon that you can unclip
from the main board and that separates
the motherboard and heatsink from the
actual device itself it's just the
bottom plastic
and then you have the two big wire
cables holding the cameras onto the
motherboard so I've unclipped both of
those and you can see it also unclip
down there at the bottom from the the
other diodes in the center there and I
found it interesting that they had like
a foam covering over the processor so
instead of using thermal paste they had
like a thermal foam that connects the
motherboard to the heatsink
the key sink is massive so right here
you're going to see much more screws
that hold each individual component onto
the heatsink itself and each one of
those so here's the main camera with its
own little thermal foam attached to it
now we have the motion camera and then
we have the rest of the the diodes and
each of them has their own little
processor that also has its own little
foam attached to the massive heatsink
anyway if you have any questions leave
in the comments if you like this video
don't forget to like it and don't forget
to subscribe I put up videos fairly
often hope to see you in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
