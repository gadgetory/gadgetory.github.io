explaining most of the components inside
of the smartphone LG v10 remove the back
cover
pop out the battery and then you'll see
14 screws that are all along the back
plastic housing I will link tools and
parts down in the video description
below
once those 14 screws are removed you can
take your plastic pry tool and pry
between the back plastic housing and the
frame of the phone make sure you don't
actually pry on the motherboard because
it's right underneath that housing you
don't want to damage any of the
components on the board itself once it's
all unclip from the side you can lift
off the back plastic panel to replace
the camera lens it's actually pretty
easy you can just press against the
backside of it from the outside and
it'll push through the frame I will link
these down the description as well
pretty easy to replace the camera lens
if it ever gets cracked or broken and
then here you can see the fingerprint
scanner as well as the actual buttons
themselves you can see the gold contact
points that just rest up against the
motherboard as well and that's how it
receives its communication from the
phone to reinstall the camera lens just
put it back in the frame and snap it
down and then press the buttons down
into the frame of the lens as well
make sure it all clicks and then you're
good to start working on the inside of
the phone so the front-facing camera is
actually pretty interesting it's two
lenses it's a five megapixel camera and
it looks suspiciously like the skull of
a medical Star Wars droid the reason has
two cameras is because if you use one
cameras gives you a close-up shot and if
you use both cameras it's the same size
the same amount of pixels but it gives
you more of a perspective that lets you
see more things around you to stab back
into place just press it down like a
little Lego the headphone jack is also
replaceable then you can unsnap the
ribbon cable that connects the screen to
the motherboard then you can lift the
motherboard out away from the phone you
can see the back of the front camera the
rear camera is attached in the same way
with a little Lego type connector just
going to unsnap that from the mainboard
this is a 16 megapixel camera with
optical image stabilization and go ahead
and snap that back into place just like
a little Lego making sure it clicks in
here's the charging port it is not
replaceable unless you know how to
solder here is one of the three
microphones down at the bottom here's
the other one
both of those are visible from the
outside of the phone the one that is not
visible is the one right above the
camera you can tell that they are
microphones by the grilles that are
underneath on the
side of the motherboard and this is what
allows the phone to do its
three-dimensional sound recording the SD
card and SIM card tray is not removable
it is soldered on to the mainboard as
well to remove these sidebars there are
three more screws on each side remove
those and you can see here that the bar
will slide up and down a little bit is
locked in place by the bottom plastic
piece so I'm going to take my pry tool
and remove the adhesive between the
plastic and the frame of the screen and
then I can pop that off away from the
phone same thing with the other side
just slide it down and pull it out these
are pretty high quality they feel very
nice in your hands then I'm going to
remove the top plastic piece as well
from the phone now this is your screen
it is an IPS LCD display what you have
here this particular component is the
glass on the front the LCD in the middle
and then the frame on the back and if
you can buy it like this that will make
your life so much easier now if you can
only buy the glass and the LCD without
the frame you're going to have to use a
bunch of heat to separate the glass and
the LCD from the frame itself and then
re-adhere the LCD and the glass to the
frame it is a significantly longer
process and the old LCD will not survive
so it is much easier if you can buy the
component just like this I will link
parts and tools down in the video
description so check that out see if I
can save you some time by linking the
whole unit instead of just the glass in
the LCD now that that's installed again
we can go ahead and put back on the top
plastic piece as well as the side bars
left and right make sure you get those
screws back in there the screws line up
with the top of the phone then the
bottom plastic piece goes in then you
can set the motherboard down into the
frame making sure that the ribbon cables
aren't pinched underneath you got the
headphone jack the LCD ribbon cable and
then the motherboard will sit down
pretty snugly you can snap on the back
plastic piece and get those 14 screws
screwed into place and then you can snap
the back plastic piece back in turn the
phone on everything is good if any
questions leave them down in the
