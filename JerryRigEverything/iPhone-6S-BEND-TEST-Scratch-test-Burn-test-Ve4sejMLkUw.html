of the iPhone 6s the latest phone from
Apple they have made a few minor
improvements from the regular iPhone 6
so let's see what happens on my youtube
channel I do practical durability tests
scratch tests Bend tests I put the
phones through real-life situations
we'll start with the scratch test for
the iPhone 6s you can see that the
screen is flexing a little bit with the
amount of pressure that I am applying to
the phone now Apple is still using the
same ion strengths and glass that they
used for the iPhone 6 and 6-plus so
there's really no surprise that the
razor blade easily scratches the heck
out of this phone a reference the
samsung galaxy s6 was unscathed by my
razor blade the good news is is that
when I take my keys and try to scratch
the front screen nothing happens now the
sandpaper test one solid swipe and the
sandpaper basically ruins the screen if
you're the type of person who takes a
meticulous care of your cell phone but
still has a random little scratches on
your screen after a few days it's from
super tiny rocks or grains of sand in
your pocket so it really just depends on
what is touching your screen sharp metal
rocks and sandpaper kill it softer
metals like keys and coins do nothing
hit that subscribe button if you're glad
my phone is damaged and not yours now
the iPhone can find the record in 4k
it's important that the camera lens is
scratch resistant we'll see if it holds
up better than the screen did the iPhone
6 lens was supposedly sapphire glass and
did not scratch there were rumors that
they were going to stop using the
sapphire glass for the success because
of how brittle it is but since the 6s
lens is not scratching either it looks
like they stuck with the Sapphire now
for the back of the iPhone 6s with my
razor blade I was able to make these
cute little curlicue aluminum filings
I've never seen that happen before
Apple decided to use a 7000 series
aluminium alloy this Allies supposedly
combines zinc magnesium and aluminum
Apple says it's 60% stronger than
regular aluminum and one-third the
density of steel but we'll see if that
helps with the whole bin gate fiasco as
you can see pretty much anything that
touches the back aluminum will leave a
mark razors keys and coins so keep it
out of your purse unless it's in a case
flame test always one of my favorites
let's see if this 3d touchscreen can
handle the heat as you can see after a
few seconds of my lighter burning the
phone the pics will start to shut off
but just like with the regular Apple IPS
LCD displays the screen fully recovers
and the pixels function like normal
after they've cooled down onto the bin
test let's see if the 7000 series holds
up the phone survives the first round of
bending you can see that the screen pops
up a bit out of the frame but when bent
back the other direction there's no flex
whatsoever that screen keeps the phone
very rigid after putting everything I
have into bending the phone I was able
to get it to kink a little bit but
honestly as long as you don't do
anything stupid you should be just fine
no high end phone is entirely
indestructible moral of the story get a
case in a screen protector in your phone
will live a long happy life check out
some of my other videos I do durability
tests on all of the new phones iPhones
Samsung's HTC LG I've done them all
thanks for subscribing I'll see you
