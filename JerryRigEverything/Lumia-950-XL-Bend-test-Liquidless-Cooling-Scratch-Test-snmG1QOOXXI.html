durability testing the lumia 950xl one
of the newest phones from Microsoft like
always let's jump into the scratch test
I can take my hardness pics and find out
where the phone falls on Mohs scale of
hardness the lumia 950xl is rockin
Gorilla Glass 4 like most other flagship
smartphones these days so it's no
surprise when my pics don't leave a mark
until level 6 and then a deeper groove
on a level 7 you won't have to worry
about car keys or coins scratching the
screen at all testing the camera lenses
next having a durable camera lens is
important to photographers and
videographers like myself luckily this
lens is just as hard as the front screen
so you won't have to worry about keys or
coins scratching the back camera glass
either now the back cover the phone is
made of plastic it is totally removable
and replaceable which is nice my keys do
leave a bit of a mark and when the razor
blade comes out well plastic does with
plastic does and it scratches a bit it
looks like the windows logo is inlaid
into the plastic layer similar to how
the older nexus sixes used to be
hopefully there aren't any issues with
these bits popping out with use later on
on to the burn test now this is where
things get interesting I've done tests
on more than 10 flagship devices now and
each time the phone will react within a
couple seconds to the lighter flame
whether the pixels will go black and
turn off only to come back on unaffected
like the iPhone 6s and the BlackBerry
Prive other phones will turn white and
never come back on like the Nexus 6p or
the oneplus X but this phone has no
impact
I left the lighter in the same spot for
over a minute with no reaction from the
screen very impressive when compared to
all of the other smart phones hit that
thumbs up button for the most impressive
burn screen yet now onto the bin test
I'll be 100% honest when I unbox this
thing I thought for sure was going to be
a casualty I was all ready to stick it
on my shelf next to the bent HTC m9 and
my twin Nexus 6p s but surprisingly
enough this thing survived it has an
overall inexpensive or cheap feel to it
but it can stand up to the pressure it
flexes more than any other phone though
if you look inside the device you can
see the removable super rigid battery I
imagine that this is the main component
giving the phone at strength similar to
the LG g4 well there's not near enough
carnage
this video so let's jump inside the
device and tear down that water cooling
copper bit and see what's inside now
this has intrigued me more than any
other aspect of the phone liquid cooling
in a smartphone so theoretically the box
looking component at the bottom is the
evaporator where the liquid heats up and
moves up the condenser pipe to cool down
then moves back to the evaporator again
to repeat the process effectively
cooling down the device and his
processor so in microsoft lumia 950xl
announcement video they clearly state
that the phone has liquid cooling and
the 950xl which uses the octa-core we
use the latest Qualcomm technology and
we push that technology to every limit
possible we push it by using tablet
class liquid cooling but in the
Microsoft Store they don't list it as
one of the specifications of the phone
it's just not there you would think they
would want to brag about it if it was a
real thing so I decided to see if it was
indeed a real thing turns out there
isn't any liquid inside don't get me
wrong having a huge copper heatsink is
great for this phone but it's definitely
not liquid cooling don't trust
everything you read on the internet kids
here on Microsoft support page they have
answered my same question with this the
heat pipe design that is based off of a
traditional liquid cooling system it
seems like a semi evasive answer to the
question either way there is clearly no
liquid inside the device I'd love to
hear your thoughts on the subject let me
know down in the comments what you think
thanks dumb for watching hit that

hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
