well I happen to have one laying around
so let's take a look Samsung says that
the phone is ip68 water resistant water
resistance is different than waterproof
remember that if your phone does get
damaged by water it is not covered under
the normal warranty and Samsung will not
replace it so how in the world would
Samsung be able to tell if your phone
has been wet in the first place let me
show you up here by the SIM card tray is
a water damage indicator this little
sticker with red X's on it will stay
white until it comes in contact with
moisture sweat steam or water and it
will make the indicator bleed out and
turn a pinkish color and this indicator
can be seen from outside the phone if
you take out the SIM card tray and just
look in there's another water damage
indicator on top of the loudspeaker it
is a smaller sticker but if we ask if it
bleeds then yes yes it does
so how does the galaxy s7 keep water out
of the device well the glass panels on
the front and the back do most of the
work the super sticky glue around the
edges of the glass keep out the majority
of the water but there are plenty of
other holes to analyze so let's take a
look at the charging port first the
charging port has its own little slot
down in the bottom of the phone and the
screws keep it pressed up tight against
the frame the port itself has a little
rubber seal around the edge to keep
water out but only if it is less than
one and a half meters of water about
five feet any more than that and the
weight of the water or the water
pressure will be too great and will
force itself past the rubber seal and
into the phone
apparently the Galaxy s7 will pop a
warning and won't charge if it detects
water in the charging port it does this
to protect the phone similar to how a
GFCI outlet works in your bathroom which
is a good thing it will protect your
device here you can see some of the
super sticky residue from the tape
around the back side of the phone this
keeps liquid out as well so how does the
loudspeaker stay waterproof air needs to
reach the speaker in order for us to
hear it
Samsung solved this issue by placing a
small screen behind the holes for the
speaker this screen allows sound to pass
through but keeps water out the water
would rather stick to itself through
cohesion than be pushed through the
speaker screen but just like with the
charging port if the water pressure
becomes too great it will force itself
through the screen like rated cheese and
damage your phone the headphone jack
also has a rubber seal around the
opening and is
shut along the back the little screw
also holds it firmly in place against
the frame of the phone to keep water out
the power button is another weak point
in the frame where there is a
possibility for water to enter but it
looks like Samsung has put the same
rubber seal around the inside of the
button to keep water out up here by the
SIM card tray there is a little rubber
ring around the tray itself that will
seal it tight against the phone frame
now a few people have speculated that
Samsung has made the board
water-resistant which is a possibility
the technology exists and there are
companies out there that have
hydrophobic electronics safe sprays that
will seal the boards but when a PCB is
covered with hydrophobic spray any water
droplets that touch the board will beat
up and roll right off and little balls
with zero adhesion but as you can see
from the motherboard here the water
droplet is very much adhere to the board
which proves that the board itself is
not coated and is not water resistant
just the phone body so what does this
mean for the customer I would use the
galaxy s7 s water resistance as a very
useful protection and safeguard against
water but I would not trust it with a
