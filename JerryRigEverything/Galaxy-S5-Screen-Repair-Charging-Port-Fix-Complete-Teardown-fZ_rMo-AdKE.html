on one of the brand new Galaxy s5 so
this particular model is for Sprint I'm
going to show you how to take it apart
fix the screen fix the charging port and
a couple of things inside the phone so
to get the screen off of the phone you
do have to heat it up I have a heat gun
you can also use a blow dryer as long as
it gets the phone hot enough that you
don't want to touch it anymore when it's
too hot to touch it means that the glue
that's holding the screen down is more
pliable and it will allow the screen to
lift up from the device itself so I have
a little pry tool and then once I lift
the screen up I can slip a little piece
of plastic whether it's a guitar pick or
a piece of plastic it'll hold the screen
in place and not let it read here back
to the base of the phone so I'm going to
keep on heating it up as I put my little
tools in around the sides make sure that
you don't pry out from the bottom of the
phone because that's where all of the
cables are for the buttons the home
button and the back button and the menu
buttons also there is one cable that
I'll show you here that is actually
controlling the LCD and the digitizer so
make sure you don't touch that either
once you unclip that from the phone you
can lift the screen up and then pry the
bottom buttons off of the front glass as
a side note I just recently started
using Instagram and I think we should
all be friends so feel free to add me at
Zach's jerry-rigged I am just pulling
the home button off prying very gently
because if you rip one of these cables
then you're gonna have to buy the new
replacement part for it the whole screen
removal process took me about 15 minutes
I don't think you can do it any faster
than that and still be safe and there's
the screen super impressed with how thin
it is hopefully Samsung makes this part
relatively cheap for how difficult it is
to go off the phone and then here's the
connector for it so this is the whole
screen I'll put a link in the video
description below for the screen any
tools that you'll need to finish this
project there are 10 screws holding
the mid frame into the rear frame and
then there's also three screws from the
back as well that you'll have to get
undone once you get all the screws
undone you can see the frame kind of
pull away from the mid frame if you
unclasp
the little latches around the battery
case you'll be able to pull the back
frame away from the mid frame start up
at the top unclip the top of it and then
the base of it will slide out of the
little grooves that are built for that
charging port to hold it in place and
then here are all of the buttons and the
little connections that attach them to
the motherboard you can see that each
button has its own little connections
which is something that you know Samsung
has really taken advantage of that this
time around
usually the buttons plug into the
motherboard somewhere so the more they
have the iPhones do it there's also the
rear speaker there here is the 3G and 4G
antennas that connect the charging port
to the mainboard just unclip those and
there's two screws holding down the
board's to the frame and right here the
charging port connects underneath the
main boards I'm just going to unclip
that like a little Lego and then the
fingerprint sensor also is sitting right
there on the top so I'm going to clip
that as well there you have the
motherboard where the cameras are
attached you can also see the heart rate
monitor on the other side I'm going to
go ahead and unclip the camera so if
your cameras ever get blurry or get dust
specks or just you know stop working if
they get cracked you can replace them
pretty easily I'll put links in the
video description below for replacement
parts as well and then the charging port
so this is the thing that you'll be
replacing most often on this phone
mostly because the charging port suffers
the most abuse besides obviously
cracking the screen so this charging
port has the menu buttons the back
button the fingerprint scanner and is
the charging port itself as well Samsung
is usually pretty good about making
these pretty cheap as they have with the
galaxy s4 the galaxy s3 and all of their
the notes in the past anyway here's the
mid frame we're going to go ahead and
reinstall all the components on the
phone now there are little grooves that
are built-in for the charging ports just
make sure that it sits back exactly
inside of those little grooves and then
I'm going to go ahead and start a
clipping the antennas back on as well
make sure you line it directly above the
little nub that it sits on top of
because if you bend these little
antennas than you you can only have one
shot at it
go ahead and clip the cameras back on
like I mentioned before it's a lot like
Legos really expensive Legos you can
just clip on to the main board again
position it directly above and then
you'll feel feel it snap into place I'm
going to go ahead and drop the
motherboard into place now I do still
have to clip that charging port onto the
back as well as the fingerprint scanner
and the 3g and 4g antennas
there's those two screws that hold the
mainboard and charging port into place
and then when you're slipping the mid
frame into the rear frame start with the
charging port because there's a little
groove that's built in to hold it steady
once that's wiggled into place it does
take a second then you can snap the rest
of the mid frame into place
remember those 10 screws that hold the
mid frame to the rear frame and then the
three screws that go in directly from
the back of the phone as well and then
you just want to take the the menu
buttons and kind of retake them I'm just
using the same tape that they came with
it's actually pretty sticky still and
now just put those back into place as
well as clipping the digitizer slash LCD
cable into place same Lego style
connector and then I am pushing the
screen back down replacement screens
should come with their own adhesive
whether it's a you know super glue or
some kind of crazy glue or just you know
double-sided stick 3m sticky tape you
can just reapply that and stick it back
down I'm just going to reuse the
adhesive that came with the phone it's
actually you know still pretty strong
anyway that's it if you have any
questions make sure leave in the
comments below I will put in your
replacement parts and tools also in the
video description below and don't forget
to hit me up on Instagram as well as
subscribe to my youtube channel thanks
