camera lens on the Galaxy Note 4 it's
actually super easy and super cheap if
you need to replacement part check the
video description below
grab a razor or a tool and pop it up
underneath that little groove along the
plastic edge of that frame and lift it
up away from the lens there's just a
little bit of adhesive behind it it
should be relatively easy to pop up and
then you can take that same tool and
there's also a little groove underneath
the glass that you can slide it in
between and you can lift off the glass
whether it's just great or cracked or
completely obliterated
you just got to clean it off and lift it
away from the camera itself make sure
that there's no glue or residue inside
of this frame and make sure that there's
no glass dust or glass shards on the
camera lens itself or else it will have
problems focusing later on if everything
makes sense so far go ahead get that
subscribe button it does help me out a
lot take the adhesive protection off of
your new lens and make sure that it's
completely clean on the inside before
you put it down otherwise your camera
might have problems focusing as well
make sure it's completely flush along
the inside of that plastic you can use
either color both the black and the
white or the same exact size remove the
adhesive protection from your new piece
and then press that down into place
evenly all the way around the outside
you want to make sure that no dust or
anything else is able to seep inside of
your camera later on that's kind of what
that outside frame is for as you can see
it focuses pretty well on my knife that
I've put down in front of me if your
camera lens won't focus make sure that
the glass is clean from smudges on the
inside and the outside also make sure
that there's no glass shards or dust
underneath the lens like I mentioned
before or if you're in a humid area you
might need to wait for the moisture to
dissipate from underneath your new glass
before it'll start focusing well this
one looks like it's focusing just fine
and everything is good if your any
questions leave in the comments below
