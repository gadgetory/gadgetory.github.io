about three years now started back with
the old galaxy s7 lately we've had a few
manufacturers jump on the transparent
phone bandwagon with me which is totally
awesome I think it's super cool
HTC made one and now Shelby's released
the me8 Explorer edition this one caught
my eye because it's transparency might
not be the real deal it might all be a
facade the only way to find out for sure
was to get one for myself
huge thanks to Nord VPN for sponsoring
this video let's get started show me
circuits back here on the me eight seem
to perfectly aesthetic components don't
match up to where they should be and
each circuit has its own logo with
quotes and specs don't get me wrong
it still looks super cool and I'd
totally still rock this phone but it
might just be a sticker under the glass
back and not the real components we'll
have to find out starting the durability
test like I've done with the last 100
phones I've tested we begin with the
scratch test not all displays are made
equally some phones have plastic screens
that scratch at level 3
while HTC has made a sapphire screen
that scratches at level 8
Xiaomi has been using the very much
standardized Gorilla Glass 5 on this
phone so we'll see the normal hardness
level of 6 with the deeper groove at a
level 7 it'll resist keys coins and
razor blades
but pocket sand and other minerals
harder than at most six can still cause
damage the me 8 top notch contains the
face scanner and 20 megapixels selfie
camera along with a wire mesh earpiece
grille
that's very solidly attached to the
frame it won't be falling out the bottom
of the phone has no physical buttons
which is also the norm these days let's
get a closer look at that back panel
seriously one of the coolest looking
phones I've seen in a while even if it
does just end up being a sticker
none of the printed words or logos are
on the exterior of the glass and
therefore can't be scratched off
everything is underneath the Xiaomi me8
does have dual cameras and they're doing
it right with both a normal lens and a
two x optical zoom lens combo the dual
LED flash is plastic the sides of the
phone are made from aluminum a tad bit
softer than the stainless steel sides we
saw in the iPhone
in us they are covered in a thin layer
of paint so the silver will start
showing through if it ever gets dropped
or accidentally scratched the power
button is painted red and still made
from metal nice little accent to an
already good looking phone the volume
rocker is also metal if we accidentally
scratched the top of the phone we get
more metal Xiaomi has had plastic end
caps on their phone in the past for
signal transfer but it looks like they
avoided that this time around with the
glass back design allowing for the
all-metal side rails there is a dual SIM
card tray but no rubber waterproofing
around the opening this me eight has no
water resistance so keep that in mind
down here at the bottom we find a USB C
charging port more metal but no
headphone jack it's interesting that
companies yelling innovation the loudest
usually have the least amount of
features Xiaomi has plopped a 6.2 inch
1080p HD R 10 notched AMOLED display on
the meet eight meaning that if we add a
little heat it'll turn white now lately
with the note 9 and the iPhone 10 we
have had AMOLED screens recover after
the flame is removed but after 15
seconds this mean eight remains burned
and the pixels do not recover even when
the screen is turned off one thing I
forgot to mention is that this phone
does have an N screen fingerprint
scanner which is pretty awesome so far
we've only seen this tech on vivo phones
so it's good to see the in screen
fingerprint Hardware expanding to other
manufacturers thumbs up for that Apple
is gonna be pretty pumped when they
invent this tech in a few years now for
the bin test sometimes bending a
smartphone is the quickest way inside
like with the me 5 back in the day
shattering completely in half this time
around though even with a hefty amount
of force applied from both the back and
the front of the phone the Explorer
edition remains solid and intact it has
a slight flex to the frame but nothing
permanent remains when the pressure is
released we still need to get inside
though
lucky for us with no IP rating the glass
should pop off relatively easily which
needs to happen if we're going to
investigate
circuits a little bit of heat to soften
the adhesive and a slight bit of
persuasion with my razor knife and metal
pry tools and the back glass starts
coming off the adhesive is only around
the edge of the transparent glass so
whatever material lies underneath is not
stuck to the glass directly you can see
the way to glass fades from transparent
to black around the edges to kind of
mask the adhesive holding the glass down
this looks awesome
and hopefully we see more of it in the
future now for the guts from the outside
it looks like this Explorer edition had
a carbon-fiber layer over the 3000
milliamp hour battery but in reality is
just a final sticker now I'm not gonna
say I invented putting stickers on
batteries but we kind of did do it first
with the 1 plus 6 before the me 8 was
even announced either way it still looks
cool
now let's dig into this motherboard
thing whatever it is is held down with
nine pentalobe screws the same style we
see holding iPhones closed kind of
interesting and then the whole
decorative plastic top just pops off the
actual motherboard underneath the whole
thing is a decoration all made from
plastic the quotes the Qualcomm logo are
all superficial garnish covering up the
real circuits below I'm definitely not
complaining I think it's pretty cool
that Xiaomi is leaning towards a more
techie design but I do think that we
shouldn't succumb to the unrealistic
standards and expectations of what the
world thinks circuit board should look
like all circuit boards are beautiful
just the way they are and we shouldn't
have to cover them up huge thanks to
