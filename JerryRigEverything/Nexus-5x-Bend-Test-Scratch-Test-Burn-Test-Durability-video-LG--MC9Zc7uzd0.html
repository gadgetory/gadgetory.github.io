for a durability test when I first
bought the 5x and the 6p I skipped doing
the durability test on the 5x because I
figured it wouldn't be fair a plastic
budget phone versus a premium metal
phone common sense says the plastic one
would fail every time the phone even
feels lightweight but since then I have
tested many other budget devices and
cheap phones that have all survived like
the honor 5x so it's time to put the new
ice coloured Nexus 5x to the test let's
bust out Mo's picks these let us know
where the screen falls on Mohs scale of
hardness picks 1 through 5 leave no mark
and a slight scratch begins at level 6 a
regular scratch begins at a level 7 so
the scratch resistant screen on this
device holds up just as well as the
premium phones good job so far LG let's
keep going flip it on over and scratch
up the back logo with the old Nexus 6
phone sometimes that logo would pop off
it looks like that won't be a problem
with the 5x though since the logo is
better integrated into the back panel it
scratches equally with the rest of the
phone so it won't pop off individually
the fingerprint scanner does scratch but
if you remember from my LG g5 video it
still functions even with major
scratches all over it so it's not that
big of a deal the camera lens is made of
glass which is fantastic especially
since it's it's very flush with the top
of the protrusion on the back panel zero
protection for this lens I was happily
scratching away at the ice colored baby
blue plastic back panel when it reminded
me of another phone I worked on recently
let's slide over the LG g5 for a little
plastic reunion crazy how eerily similar
the two are did you know that metal
primer is 30% synthetic resin synthetic
resin is the same stuff that's used in
ABS acrylics polyethylene you know
plastics let's scrape a real metal phone
here for a quick reference listen close
my friends
I feel like I've gotten a little
sidetracked
oh yeah the Nexus 5x I feel like Sid
from Toy Story the frame of the screen
is black plastic as well don't get me
wrong there's nothing wrong with plastic
or even metal phones covered in plastic
I haven't had a plastic phone Bend on me
yet
so in some ways plastic is better my
only issue with LG g5 was that they said
the phone was metal and well I shouldn't
have to dig through Narnia to find it
the power and volume buttons on the
Nexus 5x are made of metal which is a
great thing plastic ones can warp a bit
and pop out like they did with the old
Evo phones the metal will be much more
durable the dual grilles on the top and
bottom of the screen are made of the
metal as well onto the flame test the
Nexus 6p made it eight seconds before
the pixels turned permanently white and
failed the Nexus 5x made it six seconds
before the pixels turn black but they
also recovered after the flame was
removed the phone is cool to the touch
within seconds after the heat being gone
on to the ultimate stress test I put
phones through torture so you can see
what your phone will look like in a few
years without having to wait a few years
to see it the Nexus 5x flexes
considerably you can see it flex the
most right along that top battery line
where the phones tend to be the weakest
I'll also bend it back from the other
direction look at the SIM card tray a
metal phone would be permanently damaged
in some way if it flexed this much but
the plastic phone does not break it
locks out and does not snap in half
slightly out of shape yes but easily
straightened out this phone passes the
bin test bonus footage time a level-3
pick scratches the back plastic on both
the Nexus 5x and the LG g5 but leaves no
mark on the metal back of the Nexus 6p
science check out this camera comparison
video I did with the iPhone SC in the
Nexus 5x and the Nexus 5x teardown I did
when the phone was first released thanks
a ton for watching and subscribing you
guys are the best bonus points if you
check out my Instagram and Twitter for
the behind the scenes stuff thanks for
