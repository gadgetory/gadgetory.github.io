iPhone 8 like I've done with some of my
Android phones but unfortunately I
failed and I'll explain why as we tear
this phone down
this video will show how to replace the
screen and the battery on the iPhone 8
I'll have all the replacement parts and
tools linked in the video description
like always let's get started
the screen removal for this phone is
very similar to the iPhone 7 with two
proprietary pentalobe screws at the
bottom of the phone once those are out
I'll grab my suction cup and lift up on
the edge of the screen to release some
of the tension with the frame then slip
my thin metal pry tool between the
plastic edge of the screen and the metal
frame of the phone now the iPhone 8 is
ip67 water-resistant just one step
behind the LGV 30 and the galaxy s 8 but
that means there's some adhesive holding
the screen down to the frame so I found
that easier to slip in just the tip of
my tool and slice through that adhesive
it's excruciatingly ly important to not
touch any of the fragile ribbon cables
along the right side of the phone they
damage extremely easily also your phone
will not be water resistant after this
repair but it's also not water resistant
with a cracked screen before the screen
comes completely away there's a series
of clasp at the top of the screen so
I'll wiggle the display down just a
smidgen to clear those and then I'll
fold it open like a book now that the
screen has lifted away we want to
disconnect the battery will find that
connector under this metal plate with
the four normal Phillips head screws
holding it down using my plastic pry
tool to not short anything out I'll
unclip the battery connector like a
little Lego and then pop off the screen
and home-button ribbons they unsnap like
Legos as well there's one more ribbon at
the top of the phone for the front
camera and sensor array I'll unscrew
these three Phillips head screws making
sure to keep them organized all the
screws are different sizes so it's
important that they go back in the same
hole they came from and then the top
ribbon cable can disconnect like the
others then the whole screen can pull
away from the phone there's quite a bit
of black waterproofing adhesive around
the whole edge of the screen now the
screen is out of a way let's take a look
at this battery it looks a bit different
than usual instead of two magical pull
tabs we have four which is a good thing
in my opinion if you fail on one it's
not that big of a deal basically with
the magic pull tab you grab the lip of
the little black tab and then pull it
out from underneath the battery as the
adhesive stretches it loses its
stickiness just repeat the process three
more times with each of the little pull
tabs these are seriously the best way to
adhere a battery no heat or violence
required for removal the four tab method
also keeps the adhesive from sticking to
the top of the wireless charging which
you'll see here in a second now the
battery is out you can see why a glass
back
was impossible and the entire back is
actually metal except for the wireless
charging pad in the center so it would
be nothing to look at anyway even if the
glass could become clear this metal
frame is also probably what keeps the
phone so rigid during my durability test
the adhesive that holds the rear glass
panel against this metal does not soften
with heat like the Samsung phones do
it's a pretty permanent situation I'll
dive deeper into the wireless charging
and waterproofing of the iPhone eight in
another video this is just the battery
and screen replacement I'll add some
adhesive to keep the battery from
rattling around inside the phone and if
a battery replacement is all you needed
to do just reattach the screen and
you're good to go but if you have a
cracked or damaged screen or you're
bored and just want to watch the rest of
this video the iPhone 8 screen
replacement portion starts now
up at the top lies the earpiece which is
also one of the dual stereo speakers
this needs to be transferred over to the
new display there's a metal bracket with
three Phillips head screws holding it
down remember to keep all those screws
organized in a way that they can go back
in the holes they came from pulling that
front 7 megapixel camera out of the way
reveals two more Phillips head screws
that hold down the speaker after the
speaker's out there's nothing left with
some adhesive holding down that upper
sensor array it's important not to put
too much pressure on the ribbons as you
lift them up these are about as fragile
as paper and can tear so if you want to
keep things functional go slow and be
careful now the only thing between us
and the new screen is a large metal
plate covering the back of the LCD that
we will most likely have to transfer
over to the replacement display this has
apple's usual proprietary white
triple-zero screws also sometimes called
the y 0.6 tri wing it's funny that no
matter how hard Apple tries to keep
people from repairing their phones the
same people develop new tools to get
around these barriers speaking of
barriers remember that part where I said
to keep their screws organized that's
especially important with the home
button this thing is finicky there are
three screws holding the bracket in
place and one screw going down directly
into the button itself all of these are
the same try wing screws we've been
working with after that bracket comes
off I'll pull up the fragile as paper
ribbon cable from the frame of the
screen and then drop the home button out
through the front glass the large metal
backplate can lift up from the screen at
this point except for the part that is
adhered to the paper thin ribbon cables
at the bottom taking special care not to
tear the ribbon cables I'll pry them off
the metal plate with a plastic pry tool
this is probably a replacement screen
it's going to look like just make sure
your new screen has everything that your
old screen used to have on it now at
this point you're either exhausted and
stressed out from opening up your
expensive phone or maybe asleep from
listening to me talk as long as you kept
your screws organized and haven't
sneezed them off the table yet the
assembly process is pretty simple
tuck the screen and home-button ribbon
cables back up underneath that metal
plate and screw it down with the three
screws on the left side and three screws
on the right side after that grab the
finicky home button and push it through
the front side of the screen aligning
the ribbon up with the screw holes and
the pin on the frame the metal plate
goes on top of the home button and the
three screws around the edge are fine
but it's important not to torque down
the center home button screw too far
don't even make it tight it needs to be
snug and firm of course but screw it in
too tight and the home button might not
work anymore so be careful once the home
button is in place we go up to the top
for the accordion-like sensor array
ribbon I'll start with the rightmost box
sensor plop it into the square hole and
then fold the whole thing over to the
left lining everything back up with the
grooves that came from the golden
circular pads at the bottom that gives
signal to the speaker line up with the
two pins to keep them in the correct
location the top speaker gets put down
before the camera and screwed in with
the bottom two screws then the camera
itself gets folded over the top of the
speaker and set down into the circular
hole ax came from then the middle
bracket with its three screws holds
everything down tight it should fit
naturally at this point they won't need
to be forced into place if you origami
to everything into the correct position
now the screen is assembled it's
probably easiest to plug in the top
ribbon into the motherboard first since
it's at a weird angle and the bottom LCD
and home button ribbons clip in after
that just like little Legos the battery
is the last thing you want to plug in I
usually test the phone at this point to
make sure the new screen functions if
there are lines going through your
screen or it doesn't turn on or look
right it might be a bad connection with
the motherboard or it could just be a
bad replacement screen double check the
connection first if that still doesn't
work maybe you screwed something up
during the repair things can always go
wrong with the phone as complex as this
the metal brackets that cover the
connections keep everything down tight
just in case you ever drop your phone
nothing will come loose three screws on
the top metal bracket and four screws on
the bottom metal bracket all different
sizes so make sure the screws get back
in the right hole after all the screws
are back into place the phone fault shut
like a book on the top of the screen
is up with the metal frame first and
then the sides clamp in all the way down
to the base of the phone which clamps in
last and has the bottom two screws and
everything works I'm kind of surprised
myself I'm going to do a complete
wireless charging teardown and
waterproofing analysis in my next video
so subscribe for that and come hang out
with me on Twitter I'll have replacement
parts and tools linked in the video
description of this video if you're
gonna attempt this yourself and thanks a
ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
