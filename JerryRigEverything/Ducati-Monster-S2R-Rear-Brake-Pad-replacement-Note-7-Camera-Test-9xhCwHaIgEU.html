little bit different I'm filming this
entire video with the Galaxy Note seven
right now we're on the front facing
camera and I'll be filming in 4k on the
rear facing camera we're gonna be doing
a brake pad replacement on the Ducati
Monster s2r 800 so if you're into cell
phones watch the video quality of this
video and if you actually need your
brake pads replaced on the Ducati
Monster watch the video itself let's get
started alright so we've got the 2006 s
2 R and we're gonna take off the back
brakes and replace them this right here
is the caliper and there are two Allen
bolts right here on either side there's
one up there on the other side as well
and to remove that you need a six other
little allen wrench things once you've
got all up in the business of the
caliper and loosen it up is a pretty
tight fit to get in there and I'm just
gonna unscrew these by hand and that
should let the caliper drop off and
expose the brake pads to us and I will
link all the brake pads and tools that
you need down in the video description
below
looks like there's a couple of washers
on this don't know if that's factory or
not then hopefully this will just come
out
man barely not enough room that sucks
work with me buddy nice okay
got it out brake pads are here so on
this side of the caliper right here in
the center there's a little cotter pin
that we're gonna remove and that'll let
the center pin slide out so we can drop
the brake pads out of the caliper so
there's a little cotter pin that just
got removed and that should allow us to
press on that little niblet
I got that pin out the extra bracket
falls out and the brake pads we should
have been replaced a long time ago fall
out as well that's pretty good so here
are the replacement brake pads I will
link these down the video description as
well these ones are the high performance
low brake dust so you won't see any of
this you know brake dust stuff on the
new rim once I get these installed you
can see the difference here in brake pad
thickness so here next the rear of the
bike is the brake fluid for the rear
caliper and so we're just gonna pop this
off because we're gonna compress the
caliper right now in order to fit the
new brake pads inside so that should
allow for some ventilation before we
compress it so since the new brake pads
are wider than the old ones we have to
compress this piston down inside of the
caliper a little bit so I'm just gonna
reach my clamps up in there you can use
a big C clamp as well and then just kind
of pinch it shut and then you'll see it
compressed CIN and the brake fluid in
the reservoir is rising right now
because we're compressing that back in
so it might be overflowing a little bit
that should give us enough room both
sides compress it just took the right
clamp to get it to go down still using
my channel locks I was able to just grab
on that other piston and press it down
into place
that's in
that little metal bracket holds them up
in a place all right got the little
cotter pin back into place and got the
center pin through the caliper and now
there should be enough gap here to fit
it over the rotor as I put it back into
place perfect get these two bolts into
place screw them in by hand and then
I'll tighten them with the wrench after
that
remember how we had to compress the
calipers so that the new brake pads
would fit inside so now we're gonna
press on the back brake and that's gonna
push the two brake pads into the rotor
again so we'll make sure that's good and
tight then make sure to screw back on
your cap for your rear brake fluid as
well so you don't leak any out just keep
in mind that the new brake pads you just
put on the surface isn't quite level so
they're not going to be completely
broken until you know 100 miles or so so
don't do any extreme stopping unless
you're an emergency obviously and make
sure that this is good and tight just
like it normally would be before you
start writing so that the brake pads are
completely compressed against the
caliper as always with any repair cell
phone car or motorcycle you tent this
project at your own risk make sure that
your brakes are fully functional before
you actually take it out onto the road
and it's good practice to just check
them every now and then anyway you have
any questions leave them down in the
comments hit that thumbs up if you like
this video or if you like the camera on
the galaxy note 7 and don't forget to
