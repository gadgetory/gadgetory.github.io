go ahead and replace the cable on a
Dewalt
drill this cable is coming apart here at
the bottom so I bought a replacement
this one was about 10 bucks just make
sure you get the right chords um this
one's a 2 prong and this one is this 2
prong as well go ahead and remove the
screws that hold the drill together I've
already done that pull it apart and you
can see on the inside of this this is a
little protective part that we need to
slip on the new cable and then right
here there's no way of taking this apart
so we're just going to go ahead and cut
these two wires and splice it into the
same we just got to make sure to get the
black and the white splice into the same
wire otherwise we'll have problems and
here we go to plug it in anyway we'll go
from there alright so strip the wires
just a little bit so you can have enough
room to to put on the connectors and
then also make sure you put on your
drill has one of these to protect the
cable make sure you put that on first
before you connect the two wires all
right so I've taken each one of these
connectors already place it on each of
the wires and it's pretty simple all I
have to do is take the crimps and crimp
it on the end so that it has a tight
hold make sure you just do one solid
crimp instead of multiple little ones
I'm going to have a stronger connection
than that alright you can see I have
both the white wires mashed up and the
black wires I have the protector on the
cable and I'm ready to I'm going to go
ahead and double wrap it in electrical
tape just as an insulator and a
protector from water as well
you
all right bolt the wires are known
electrical tape and then you just go
ahead and snake this that just helps put
some it helps relieve the stress when
you're pulling on the cord and when it's
pressed down in between these little
notches go ahead and mount the protector
again and then just put the drill back
together and screw in you're good to go
and there we go
you got the finished product the new
cables installed which is much better
than the old frayed one that one was
definitely a safety hazard and it works
look at that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
