Galaxy Note 9 and take an inside look at
that water carbon fortnight ready heat
dissipation system normally I'd suggest
removing the S Pen first but we already
took that apart in my last video huge
thanks to audible for sponsoring this
video let's get started getting inside
watertight bones is never super fun but
heat is our best friend softening the
adhesive holding the back glass layer to
the metal frame of the phone this is
much harder than it looks
the phone is trying to hold itself
together while simultaneously melting my
fingers off I'll use a bit of card stock
around the curved glass corners to avoid
the pressure a metal tool would inflict
once the adhesive is completely cuffed
from around the edges of the glass the
whole thing pulls away from the foam
body still attached is the fingerprint
scanner ribbon but it looks like I
didn't Nick it with any of my tools so
we should be okay it's the same solid
slab of black glass we've come to expect
from Samsung so a clear phone is
definitely an option but we'll save that
for another day the teardown gets easier
at this point with eleven normal
Phillips head screws surrounding the top
plastics and that wireless charging pad
once those screws are out and set off to
the side in an organized fashion of
course I can pull away the wireless
charging from the phone and we get a
close-up look at the golden contact pads
it uses to transfer power and
communicate with the motherboard as well
as what I believe is the battery
temperature sensing Niblett in the top
right corner I'll unplug the battery
from the motherboard so we don't have to
worry about anything shorting out and
then we can mosey on down to the seven
screws holding the bottom plastics over
the charging port pulling that off
reveals a large loudspeaker along with
this gold contact pads the water damage
indicator and another foam ball pit for
ants like we saw inside of the oneplus
six these foam balls realistically have
something to do with sound dampening but
I honestly still have no idea this time
around the note 9s motherboard has three
screws holding it to the frame two
screws down at the bottom and one screw
up at the top left then it can start
unplugging the ribbons like little Legos
the front sensor ribbon the iris scanner
ribbon up at the top and the charging
port ribbon down at the bottom of the
motherboard along with the larger screen
ribbons on the right side and of course
the sim and SD card tray is also holding
the mother
in place then still needs to be removed
pulling the motherboard out of the frame
is easy enough just navigating around
all the ribbons we unplugged and finally
we got our first look at the incredibly
large copper heatsink
we'll commence the autopsy on that guy
in just a second but first we'll remove
the front-facing 8 megapixel camera no
image stabilizing on this guy the dual
rear cameras though should both have it
the whole unit is very well adhered to
the motherboard Samsung definitely
doesn't want these moving around but
once it's off each lens does indeed have
its own Hardware stabilizing built-in
the 12 megapixel variable aperture
camera which you can see opening and
closing here has a physical aperture
mechanism which changes automatically to
let in more or less light as the camera
needs it it's also Hardware stabilized
the 2 x telephoto zoom lens camera on
the left is also optically stabilized
this is probably the most high-tech
complex system of cameras in any
smartphone on the market right now I'll
plug all three cameras back into place
so that they'll still function if the
phone survives the rest of this teardown
the charging port has changed a bit this
year with the note 9 it's quite a bit
smaller than the previous note 8 all
that's included on the itty bitty board
is the quick charging USB C docking port
with its water resistant rubber ring
around the tip as well as a tiny little
microphone replacement charging ports
for last year's Note 8 are only about 12
dollars right now so it definitely pays
to know how to fix your phone down at
the bottom of the phone we have our
normal water-resistant mesh for the
loudspeaker the headphone jack and our
circular vibration motor with its golden
contact pads there is one more water
damage indicator up at the top of the
phone visible through the sim and SD
card tray when it's pulled out and of
course we have the gigantic earpiece
speaker one question I get surprisingly
often is what happens if I stick my SIM
card tool in the wrong hole the answer
to that is nothing happens as you can
see from inside the phone the
water-resistant mesh and corresponding
microphone hardware are off at an angle
to the hole itself so no matter how far
you stick your tool inside it won't
damage or puncture anything important
thumbs up for that the only things
inside the phone we have left to remove
are the large 4000 milliamp hour battery
and the large water carbon heat
dissipation system once again Samsung
has added enough adhesive under this
battery to glue an elephant to the
ceiling it's a ridiculous amount even
bending my metal
right tools during the removal there's
no magical pull-tabs either like we've
seen in some of the iPhones the battery
does finally come out though if you
remember the note seven battery the one
that kept exploding it was thirty 500
milliamp hours last year's note it
dropped down to 3300 milliamp hours but
this year Samsung has regained its
confidence and is rocking a massive 4000
milliamp hour battery hopefully it works
out for him now for that water carbon
heat dissipation system it's definitely
one of the larger heat pipes that we've
seen inside of a cell phone way bigger
than last year's Note 8 and looks to be
about the same size as the massive heat
pipe we found inside the gaming razor
phone the only way we can truly
understand this thing is with an autopsy
which means it needs to come out of the
phone under the copper heatsink is the
same adhesive Samsung slathered under
the battery once it's out we see that
the cylindrical heat pipe itself has a
large rectangular copper pad over the
top of it remember copper itself is a
fantastic thermally efficient conductor
so a solid copper plate is useful next
to a superhot processor but that doesn't
give us any insight into the water
carbon stuff Samsung was mentioning
supposedly inside this vacuum sealed
tube is liquid usually a super small
amount and realistically because of that
minut amount the moment it's opened up
any liquid or vapor will evaporate
instantly the tube itself is hollow and
slicing it open reveals a copper wick
inside the mesh screen inside this tube
acts as a wick to help transport the
small amount of liquid from the hot end
of the pipe to the cool end of the pipe
during high temperature loads like
gaming or texting an angry girlfriend
it's a capillary weave of copper you
could say the whole thing looks very
much like a normal heat pipe just like
we've seen in other smartphones so I'm
not sure where the carbon part comes
into play but at this point it would
just be nitpicking the advertising
jargon
either way this thing is massive and
it's copper so it's pretty safe to
assume that it's going to do its job of
cooling down the phone during long
fortnight gaming sessions speaking of
video games you've probably heard of the
movie ready player one it sounds cliche
but the book is really so much better
and more detailed the tasks that Wade
Watts needs to complete for the contest
are entirely different in the book and
it just expounds on the universe as a
whole huge thanks to audible for
sponsoring this video if you enjoyed the
movie ready play
one you can grab the book version for
free with a 30-day trial using the code
jerry-rigged that'll link in the
description or go to audible.com slash
jerry-rigged texting the word
jerry-rigged to five hundred five
hundred works to je r ry RI g ready
player one is definitely one of my
current favorites obviously i won't be
able to reuse this cut up copper
contraption when i reassemble the phone
but everything should still function
just fine without it i won't be winning
any of those fortnight chicken dinners
or whatever because it might throttle a
bit but let's see if the phone still
turns on the battery is back into place
along with the small charging port and
its two screws and then of course the
motherboard can settle down taking
special care enough to pinch any the
ribbon cables underneath the board every
Lego connection is on top this time
around and surprisingly has no wire
cables I'll plug the screen ribbons
along the right side and the charging
port ribbon down at the bottom along
with the front sensors I'll put the
three motherboard screws back into place
before plugging in the battery and then
the loudspeaker plastics and the
wireless charging plastics can be set
into place with the eight pin screws
holding everything together
the back glass with a short fingerprint
scanner is kind of tricky but after
that's plugged in the whole thing turns
on and we're good to go
Samsung has been doing some pretty
innovative stuff with the note 9 this
was definitely a fun tear down the
cameras and heat pipe were incredibly
interesting from the inside do you think
mobile gaming is the way of the future
