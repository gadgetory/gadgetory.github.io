apart the ZTE force from Sprint pretty
solid little phone make sure you take
out the battery and then the sticker on
the inside all that needs to come out as
well as well as the screw in underneath
this little sticker make sure to check
the video description for a bunch of
replacement parts speakers screens I'll
try to find the cheapest ones off of
Amazon and put those on there for you
there are eight screws around the
outside of the phone that I'm taking out
right now as soon as those screws are
out the outside of the frame almost
falls apart with just your fingers
there's a few small little clips that
holds the screen onto the back end of
the frame and you can just see me I'm
not even using a tool just to pull this
apart there you go and these little
black hooks or what I'm talking about
that hold that sticker in place that's
why the sticker has to come off
there's the vibrator and here we have a
ribbon cable attaching the digitizer to
the motherboard so just pick up that
little flap right there and then the
ribbon cable slides right out and then
the motherboard itself is glued on to
the screen it's not very tight though
this one screw holding down the top
circuit board of the camera doesn't need
to come out and you can kind of see I'm
just kind of loosening up around the
motherboard right now and if I slide my
pry tool all the way through it kind of
pops the motherboard away from the
screen you can see it loosen up right
there and then the motherboard is
released it's not too hard but just make
sure to loosen it up enough that you
don't apply too much force otherwise
you'll crack and damage things so now
we're moving the circuit board from
around the camera it's also glued on so
it's a little bit of prying here in
there pulls it away
there we go there is a on the right side
of that that's with a clip that kind of
snaps it all in place I'll show you when
I install it there's another ribbon
cable right here that I just loosened up
and then this part of it was glued on as
well so that'll snap off and pull away
from the motherboard to replace the
earpiece you just pry this little black
box out it's glued on as well makers of
this phone love the glue
that's it leave the screen in place any
way to reinstall it just kind of tap it
back into place you can reuse the same
glue there's enough of it there slip the
motherboard back in and then all you
have to do is slide the little ribbon
cable into the slot that it came out of
and make sure to latch the the ribbon
cable docking point back down so it
doesn't slip out just like this
so latch it down press it back into
place using the same tape and then
here's that Lego piece I was talking
about right on there on that right side
just make sure that clicks into place
and then get that screw back on there as
well now hold it tight this last ribbon
cable from the screen and then make sure
you latch that back into place as well
back housing
and then there's that nice little pile
of eight screws right there that also
need to be screwed back into the the
foam I kind of forgot to battery back
and everything works anyway if you have
any questions leave them in the comments
