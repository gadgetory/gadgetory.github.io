youtube-channel
but today I'm going to make an exception
it's not that I don't like breaking
phones quite the opposite in fact I love
breaking phones
it's just with drop tests they're so
unpredictable and it really just depends
on how the phone drops but since this me
mix is made of ceramic an entirely new
material that I haven't tested before
I'm curious to see how it holds up
against the drop as we saw from my
previous durability test this ceramic is
a level 8 on Mohs scale of hardness
almost impossible to scratch with
everyday objects but let's see how it
holds up to a drop in front of me I have
the me mix and completely 100% working
condition I have the Google pixel right
here and the iPhone 7 plus and I'm going
to drop the phone right there in the
middle I'm going to start with the drop
test just a couple inches above the
ground probably about six inches and
just drop it straight back down onto the
ceramic so three two one
and there is not even a mark on the back
of this phone or the front right now
we're about a foot above the ground I'm
going to drop it in three two one
so even with the foot drop on the
concrete we're still at no scratches on
the front or the back
so I'm gonna try something new I'm gonna
sit here on this bench and
absent-mindedly put my phone on my knee
and then I'm going to stand up and let
the phone fall off onto the ground
that one hit hard right on the corner
since it was resting on my knee let's
see what happens
oh that corner looks bad so you can see
the corner right there there's pieces
completely missing out of it because of
that ceramic it's so hard and so brittle
that the chunk flew right out of it and
then we have two cracks going all the
way through the length of the screen
from corner to corner pretty much so
from that top right all the way down to
the bottom left so the phone is still
working but the corner of the phone is
definitely destroyed purely because the
brittleness of the ceramic there are
also two huge cracks running diagonally
along the length of the screen but even
if I can replace the screen the frame of
the phone is a goner
it's kind of a bad idea on show Me's
part to put two super brittle objects
glass and ceramic right next to each
other with no buffer between them if
they would have even put a thin layer of
rubber or some kind of cushion between
the two at least the screen wouldn't
have cracked just the frame would have
damaged so today we learned that the
phone can be permanently damaged and is
figured from a super small two foot fall
the easiest way to prevent this kind of
damage is either to never drop your
phone or put your phone inside of the
case yeah a case will cover up the
beautiful ceramic but your phone will be
a little bit safer my Instagram
followers got to see a preview of this
drop test before the video went live on
YouTube so if you want to stay ahead of
the curve follow me there and hit that

thanks for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
