tearing down the Huawei p9 I've done a
camera comparison the durability test
and now it's time to review the internal
build quality let's turn the phone off
and remove the SIM card tray from the
side using your SIM card removal tool
now before we even open the phone things
get interesting the two screws on the
bottom are the exact same size as the
iPhone screws this is the first phone
I've ever seen with that same sized
pentalobe screw in it to remove the
frame from the metal body we're going to
use my thin metal pry tool and slip it
between the bottom edge of the phone and
the screen but don't lift it up too far
we have one ribbon cable that's
attaching the fingerprint scanner to the
phone unsnap that and then the back
housing will come free from the screen
here's the back housing we can see the
metal aluminum frame along with the
antenna bands that are plastic on the
bottom side and then here's another look
at that slinky ribbon cable that's
attached to the fingerprint scanner
fairly interesting design notice the
camera lens is here we'll come back to
those in a second here is the
motherboard there are two screws that
hold down the battery connection we're
going to pop off this signal wire and
then remove the little metal bracket
that holds the plugs in place unplugging
the battery first to disconnect the
electricity that's coursing through the
board it'll make it safer overall then
we're going to disconnect the extension
ribbon cable as well as remove the one
screw on this other side next to the
volume and power ribbons we'll
disconnect the screen ribbon and then
there are four screws holding down the
motherboard to the main frame there's
lots of little metal brackets on this
phone so make sure you set them right
next to the screws so they'll stay
organized so here's the dual like a
camera set up for the Huawei p9 the
cameras are mounted in the same metal
housing which is good because if they
were separate and the phone was dropped
that would mess up the image combining
feature that I talked about in my camera
comparison video that happens with all
still images but not video I still
debate on whether that actually works or
not but Huawei says it does so we'll
roll with it now like a that expensive
camera company that Huawei paid to use
their name didn't actually build this
camera neither did Huawei Chinese
company called sunny optical technology
of China did but under the direction of
Huawei with Leica's name stamped on it
it all gets very confusing and if you
watch my camera comparison video
Stan why it's all sketchy creative
wording the thing that bugs me the most
as a hardware guy is this image that I
pulled from huawei's website first off
we have image covering text brilliant
but that's beside the point
look at all the thick glass in this
image it looks almost like a real
professional DSLR camera lens doesn't it
but in all honesty this is straight-up
false advertising as you can see from me
holding the camera it is non-existent in
the actual phone and the exterior lens
on the back housing is just a flat piece
of glass just like every other
smartphone manufacturer like Samsung and
the Apple iPhone Huawei is straight up
lying about the glass in this phone
anyway let's continue the teardown we're
going to remove the sticky tape that
holds the front camera into place
this is an 8 megapixel camera and does
720p video the rear cameras do 1080p
video there is no 4k in this camera will
pop out the motherboard and while that
may look like bubblegum or frosting it
is just thermal paste to transfer the
heat from the processors into the metal
frame of the phone to cool it down so
don't eat this the SIM card tray is
soldered onto the mainboard so is not
removable there is a dual color LED
flash which I really like when the flash
goes off it brings out the color in the
picture so it's not washed out since
there's two colors flashing at the same
time now if you are going to remove your
screen you will need to transfer over
this proximity sensor earpiece and power
and volume ribbon buttons to your next
screen I'll talk about that more in a
second just keep in mind that there are
little components you'll have to deal
with now see these black tabs these
things are magical and we'll make the
removing of the batteries so much easier
just grab the top of the tab and pull
the adhesive out from underneath the
battery as the adhesive stretches it
loses its stickiness and the battery
will pop out relatively easy after both
adhesive strips are pulled out it is
very important to pull the adhesive
horizontally away from the phone if you
lift up the adhesive will break and then
you'll be stuck using the old pry away
from the metal frame method which is a
lot harder so be careful there is a
little bit of adhesive on the bottom
left side of the battery that you'll
need to pry out but it's a lot softer
than the actual pull tab adhesive and be
careful with those extension ribbons as
you're prying it out here's the battery
I will link replacement parts down in
the video
description there are three screws
holding charging port components into
place we're going to unplug the
loudspeaker first and then the headphone
jack pops off with that metal bracket in
place don't try to remove the metal
bracket from the little ribbon cable
that attaches to the headphone jack
because it might rip off we're going to
unplug the extension ribbon cable from
the charging port and disconnect that
wire cable here is the USB type-c
charging port it does have a little
rubber hat along the bottom I think this
is less for waterproofing and more for
just shock absorbing the loudspeaker is
held very firmly in place the nice thing
about all of these components down here
is that the metal frame is exactly fit
each component so they're very very
sturdy inside of the housing so this is
the screen it has the glass layer the
screen layer underneath that which shows
the image and the metal frame
luckily Huawei does sell this component
as one the metal frame the glass and the
screen all together and is actually
relatively cheap I will link the
replacement parts down in the video
description replacing the screen on this
Huawei p9 is actually easier than most
Samsung and iPhones time to reassemble
the phone we're going to take the
loudspeaker and tuck that into place set
the charging port into place and clip on
that wire cable and the extension ribbon
cable once those are secured you can
take that little metal plate that's
attached to the headphone jack and snap
that into place as well as little ribbon
cable for the loudspeaker it'll snap in
like a little Lego get the three screws
into place and then grab that
motherboard and we'll tack that down
into the top it does clip in there's a
little guiding pin down in the bottom
left corner to help you situate it
correctly there's arrows as well on the
board which is Huawei's signature move
that we've seen on all the rest of their
phones as well clipping the volume and
power button or your phone will not work
as well as the extension ribbon for the
screen and for the charging port and
then we'll get the battery back into
place but we're not going to plug it in
just yet because we don't want
electricity coursing through the board
while we're working on it get the dual
Leica camera lens
plugged in as well as the eight
megapixel front camera snap that into
place like a little Lego and now that
everything's connected we can plug in
the battery just make sure not to turn
on the phone yet
because we'll still be screwing things
in the signal wire clips into place one
more camera check this phone does not
have oh is stabilization but it does
have the mechanical focus so the lens
moves just slightly in and out of
focus light onto the sensor kind of fun
get those three metal brackets back into
place and these seven screws that hold
that motherboard down then stick one
side of the phone into the back metal
housing so you can grab that slinky
ribbon and clip that into place like a
little Lego once it's attached you can
line up the top edge of the screen with
the top edge of the frame tuck that into
place just like with the iphone repairs
and then press the sides into place SIM
card slot goes back in and now we can
make sure the phone is working
make sure your the two bottom screws
back into place and you are set if you
have any questions leave them down in
the comments I do respond fairly
regularly like always my
behind-the-scenes and snap story can be
found at Zach's jerry-rigged I do use
Twitter and Instagram quite a bit as
well thanks ton for watching I hope to
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
