to judge a book only by its cover the
same thing applies towards smartphones
today will be taken apart one of the
most unique looking metal and glass
combination smartphones and reviewing it
from the inside this teardown has been
sponsored by audible let's get started
the ROG Gaming phone from Asus is
actually a pretty over engineered and
complex phone to disassemble the oddly
shaped back glass panel makes things a
bit more complicated but it looks pretty
awesome he it is as always our best
friend while softening adhesive and a
little persuasion from my razor blade
and metal pry tools can help quite a bit
heating up the glass when the adhesive
cools down and gets hard and then
shimmying my razor blade around the
edges just slice through the sticky
stuff the weird metallic growth on the
side of the phone makes for some pretty
awkward angles but I still managed to
get the glass off in one piece
lifting the rear glass upwards has to
not put any pressure on the fingerprint
scanner ribbon it's a little Lego style
connector that's hidden under a tiny
rubber pad I'll let snap that connector
and release the back glass after dealing
with so many boring rectangle phones
it's nice to see something different
Asus is definitely pushing the aesthetic
limits of this smartphone design it
stands out for sure especially with the
transparent light-up logo before we get
any farther we have 13 normal Phillips
head screws holding in the back plastics
11 of which are visible and two of which
are hidden under this what should we
call it this metal protrusion the thing
is it's not exactly metal it's more of a
thin shell about as thick as the
sidewalls of an aluminum top can meaning
that it's really more for aesthetics
than anything else the three little
black circles you see are vents leading
directly down to the motherboard but the
visible exterior copper portion is only
for decoration I'll explain more in a
second first let's look at this white
pad that fits underneath the transparent
logo remember I said the logo was really
dim during the durability test that's
because there is no backlit LED lighting
things up this is a piece of plastic so
when light shines through it at an angle
like it did with my wall-mounted PC I
built a few years ago it catches the
logo in the plastic Center and reflects
out the two side LEDs shining at
different angles to illuminate the whole
piece of plastic it works but it's
a far less bright method than the
backlit LED like we saw inside the razor
phone - let's take another look at the
mid plate the underside of the black
plastic is hiding a pretty massive slab
of solid copper it's not a vapor chamber
nor is it connected with the motherboard
with any kind of thermal paste but it is
here existing and weirdly enough
surrounds the entirety of the circular
vibrator motor you know just in case
that overheats the copper slab has
nothing to do with the copper looking
Vince on the outside of the phone though
the thin copper vent things on the
outside are just for decoration there is
a layer of plastic between the slab of
copper and the outer copper Vinh's
they're not connected you might be
thinking to yourself hey Jerry did you
just break the whole phone and nope I
did not the phone actually works just
fine even without the copper plate or a
decorative exterior metal I mean look at
how good this audible app is opening
right now see what I did there
huge thanks to audible for sponsoring
this teardown the book I'm currently
listening to is called Ender's Game a
best-selling classic about leadership
while fighting space aliens you know the
good stuff normal narration always seems
a bit slow so I bump it up a tiny bit
and listen to audible while I'm driving
or running outside audible has something
new called originals originals are

you decide to cancel audible is an app I
use quite a bit so I'm glad I get to
share it with you guys I'll get the
phone turned back off you know safety
first we still have a lot of things to
check out all unplug the battery and
then find three silver Phillips head
screws holding the rather massive
motherboard in place the board wraps
around the entire edge of the phone I'll
pop out the dual SIM card tray and then
start on clipping the little ribbon
cables I found eight of them before
removing the large black sticker over
the battery unclipping that last ribbon
cable for the screen and then the whole
motherboard was able to lift up and away
from the phone body one tiny dollop of
silver thermal paste connects the
processor to the copper pad on the frame
below supposedly this copper pad is
connected to a vapor chamber but it's
hidden below the rest of the frame or
sandwiched under the screen so there's
no way of telling how big it is
the two side USB seaports are built into
the motherboard these are for connecting
all the
additional accessories like the external
fan the rear facing camera is
uncharacteristically secured to the
frame of the phone with three screws
Asus is rocking a 12 megapixel main lens
with optical image stabilization thumbs
up for that and an 8 megapixel secondary
wide-angle camera that can fit more
scenery into a shot but does not have
optical image stabilization the
front-facing camera is an 8 megapixel
little guy with no OIS fun fact though
the optical image stabilization is done
with little magnets inside the cameras
metal housing you can see how it
attracts my screw as I try putting it
back together the bottom of the phone
has one silver screw holding the
loudspeaker in place it projects the
sound forward and out of the front
facing speaker grille it's got the gold
contact pads on the back that
communicate with the motherboard we also
have a headphone jack with a super long
ribbon cable tail that reaches
underneath the loudspeaker over to the
motherboard the charging port is a cute
little guy
USB see with the rubber water-resistant
ring around the outside the rog phone
has no official IP rating but it's nice
to see some steps were taken towards
keeping water out the little coin style
vibrator motor is tucked to your next
the gold battery which looks like it has
some pull tabs down at the bottom but
they do break at first pull and are also
unsatisfying ly silent during the
removal process the second pull tab
snapped off twice
resulting in a prime to remove the rest
of the battery it's a rather large 4,000
milliamp hours we also get to see the
ribbon cables for the air triggers on
the side of the phone a su says there's
still a vapor chamber hidden in here
somewhere but it's impossible to see
without sacrificing the phone entirely I
try to keep my phones in one piece if it
does exist is glued between the screen
and the underside of the frame which
also means it's probably nothing in
comparison to the size of the razor
phone two's water bed style vapor
chamber I got the headphone jack the
loudspeaker and charging port all
situated back into the frame then comes
the motherboard with its blue wire cable
the tricky part with a circuit board
this big is lining up all the ribbon
cables so they don't get pinched
underneath the board when I set it in
place there's a lot of ribbon cables to
plug back in including the battery the
little LED ribbon plug that lights up
the back logo is a bit different
that guy plugs in and gets lashed down
with a little plastic lever and some
tape on top to secure it then the whole
back plastic panel can plop in place
with its decorative copper the thin
plastic strip to the left of the battery
tucked between the buttons and the
battery itself to provide something for
the power button to push against
I'll get the 13 screws back in place get
the fingerprint scanner plugged in and
the white plastic LED reflector
positioned back in front of the LEDs and
now it's time to see if the ROG phone
can handle being dissected and
reassemble I imagine a teardown is
rather stressful for these pocket
computers totally nailed it with that
back metal cover you can hardly tell the
phone's been opened up everything still
works even the accessories not too bad
the ROG gaming phone is a feature-rich
device with all kinds of interesting
perks and quirks I'm glad we got to
review it from the inside it's a good
one don't forget to grab your free audio
book with the link in the description
audible.com slash jerry-rigged or text
the word jerry-rigged to 500 500 je r ry
RI g all lowercase I recommend Ender's
Game now that you've seen the insides of
both gaming phones which one do you
prefer the razor phone 2 or the ROG
thanks ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
