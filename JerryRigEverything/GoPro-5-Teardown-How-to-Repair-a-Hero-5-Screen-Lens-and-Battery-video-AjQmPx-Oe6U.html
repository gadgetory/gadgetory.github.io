GoPro doesn't normally sell parts for
their cameras most likely if you're
trying to repair one you'll need to find
another GoPro that is broken in a
different way than yours and
Frankenstein the working parts together
any GoPro that has been opened up won't
be water-resistant anymore but you can
always get one of those waterproof
housings if you end up doing liquid
photography take out the battery and
then the rubber faceplate of the camera
can be pried away there is an excessive
amount of adhesive holding it down to
the frame that has to do with the
waterproofing the outer lens of the
GoPro camera can be removed there are
two straight bars holding it down to the
camera body I slip one of my thin pry
tools underneath and push the bar away
from the little lip that holds it in
place and then the lens will pop away it
is a lot more difficult than it looks on
screen it is very secure the little
rubber ring is part of the waterproofing
that keeps this camera watertight and
I'll explain more about the
waterproofing of the GoPro 5 in another
video luckily these lenses are fairly
easy to replace I will link any
replacement parts and tools down in the
video description right below this video
so if you need to replace anything on
yours the links will be there now that
that outer lens is off the rubber
housing can come loose
remember this is extremely difficult it
is held very very securely in place the
most dangerous spot is right here down
at the bottom you don't want to damage
that LCD screen so be very careful with
that there are six screws holding down
the plastic plate to the main frame this
is a t4 screw remember the tools are in
the video description once those screws
are out you can gently pry away this
part of the body from the back part of
the frame just wiggle it loose and
shimmy it out of the housing but be
careful because there are still wires
attached to the motherboard these little
ribbon cable connectors pop off like
little Legos and then down here this
little white connector is the power from
the battery housing just pop that off
from the mainboard
here on the bottom part of the back
housing is the loudspeaker and then I
thought this was extremely interesting
along that top part of the housing there
is a little LED attached to the
mainboard this LED shines into the
plastic and then shines through the back
of the LCD so the LED that you're seeing
is that a 90 degree angle from the
actual LED itself kind of how I use LEDs
to shine through the Plexiglas in my
wall-mounted computer check out that
video if you're interested in seeing how
those were
the battery housing can't pop out from
the back frame as well you just got to
line up those little half oval grooves
and pull that out and so if your battery
ever stops working and replacement
batteries don't work either
maybe swapping the battery housing a
work this little door can be removed
fairly easily
and you can just clip it back into place
when you're done this is great if you're
going to plug in your GoPro for long
periods of time and don't want that door
getting in the way now the rear screen
attached to the rear housing is non
removable normally with cell phones when
you heat up the adhesive holding the
screen in place it'll soften allowing
you to pull away the screen from the
rest of the body but with this
particular GoPro they use a type of glue
that is not softened by heat so if you
try to remove this screen it will
shatter so the best idea is just to swap
housings or you have to break out the
old screen if GoPro does end up selling
replacement screens either way check the
video description I will link all the
possibilities down there just remember
that there is no way the screen will
survive the removal process trying to
get it out of that frame so it's better
to put the internal components into a
housing that has a working screen there
are four Phillips head screws holding
down the motherboard remove those then
you can unclip the front LCD from the
mainboard with that same little ribbon
cable connector then we have the sensor
ribbon cable connector and then the
charging port ribbon cable connector
down here all of them snap in like
little Legos
I'm using my plastic pry tool to not
short anything out here on the
motherboard then there's one other
connector underneath this black plastic
plate this just unplugs just pull it
straight out there are no latches you'll
see what happens when you try to unlatch
this piece of plastic later there are
two screws holding the charging port
into place these are super long so pull
those out and set those off to the side
make sure you keep all your screws
organized and then the charging port can
be pulled away from the housing then
there's one more screw that holds the
plastic housing in place remove that and
set that off to the side and then the
motherboard can be removed from the
GoPro 5 you can see a little bit of the
thermal paste on the plastic housing one
more screw holds the actual lens in
place now this is the lens and the
sensor it has that same super heavy-duty
glue that is not affected by heat it's
kind of like superglue it doesn't look
like this camera has any type of optical
image stabilizing it's all internal or
electronic this digital image
stabilization is all done in software
and not Hardware normally I'm not a big
fan of the digital image stabilization
I'll have to do a camera test
- you know get a full opinion of it
hopefully the images don't have that
jello effect that the Nexus 6p does I'm
hoping it's more like the electronic
image stabilization of the iPhone now
here is the front LCD attached the
plastic housing
remember if you try to remove this LCD
it will break because there is no soft
adhesive underneath it so just replace
the whole LCD and plastic housing if you
need to swap those between your
Frankenstein two GoPros putting the lens
back into place there's a little
Phillips head screw that goes along the
bottom and then you can slide the
motherboard in place making sure to keep
that LCD ribbon cable along the top part
before you pinch it down plugging in the
sensor ribbon cable putting the plastic
housing for the charging port back into
place screwing it in and then setting
the USB charging port into place as well
taking the two freakishly long screws
and setting those down and then plug in
that little tiny ribbon I did check to
see if there was a latch ended up
breaking the plastic that does not break
the connector but you know since there's
no latch you don't need to do it
yourself making sure everything's
plugged in and that protective flap down
into place four screws along the
motherboard plug in the front LCD to the
motherboard and inside the battery
compartment there is one more screw that
holds the little wires in place that can
be removed as well but in this case
we're just going to leave it in place
line up the two little grooves along
with the half circles on the frame it's
kind of like one of those puzzle games
as a kid I knew playing with that would
come in handy someday
plug in the white battery cable
connector and then the three ribbon
cables along that side and then tuck the
motherboard and lens back into that back
housing you'll feel it kind of gently
push into place because it does have
that thick rubber ring around the
motherboard there are six screws holding
this into the back frame and then you
can take your front rubber piece and
place that over the top remember since
this was using adhesive to hold it in
place it's not going to go back on as
perfect as it was when it was new
you're gonna have to get some
double-sided tape to stick that down or
just use some of that gel super glue to
hold it down as well make sure your
camera works before you do anything
super permanent with it though like use
super glue to get the front lens back
into place I'm taking one of the little
metal bars and tucking it in on one side
and then gently pressing down on the
other side while I lift the other metal
bar over the v-shaped clip once the
metal bar is bent over the clip it'll
grab the clip and hold itself firmly in
place
once again the rubber housing can be
held down with super glue or
double-sided tape or you
you can just leave it and stick it in
one of those waterproof housings either
way now you have a working GoPro instead
of a non-working GoPro I'm going to
stick that little door back on and then
test the camera and it looks like
everything is good to go
if you have any questions them down in
the comments hopefully this video helped
you out and you could save some money
splicing some GoPros together thanks ton
for watching hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
