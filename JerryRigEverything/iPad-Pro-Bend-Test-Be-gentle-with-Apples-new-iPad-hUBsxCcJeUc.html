design changes thinner bezels and no
home button or headphone jack it's time
to see if this massive tablet is durable
the iPad pro is basically the same price
as the iPhone 10 arm and appears to
actually be one of the more reasonably
priced Apple products it even comes with
a standard USB C charging board Apple's
moving in the right direction let's get
started this is the smaller of the two
iPads the 11 inch version perfect size
for a backpack or book bag Apple has
also released an updated version of the
Apple pencil which is good last year's
design included plenty of stupid poking
out the bottom of the iPad while
charging like an elephant trunk just
waiting to snap off this year it's held
onto the side of the iPad with magnets
and charges wirelessly not quite as
smooth as the integrated note 9 s-pen
which charges internally in seconds with
a super capacitor Apple doesn't include
this pencil in the box probably out of
respect to Steve Jobs who wants a stylus
you have to get them and put them away
and you lose him yeah nobody wants a
stylus but let's be honest they mostly
just want you to pay extra for it the
tip of the pristine clean white pencil
does not appear to be replaceable like
they are on samsung's s-pen so if you
want to find our tip you'll just have to
sharpen it manually we all know it's
what's inside the Apple pencil that
matters most though dead center is the
weakest point probably a tad stronger
than your average wooden pencil this
immediately gives us unrepairable access
to the wireless charging component these
copper coils absorb energy wirelessly
through the induction field on the side
of the iPad I'll skin the rest of the
pencil it has a pressure-sensitive tip
and a row of strong magnets along the
flat side of the writing utensil the
upper half is a bit harder to get inside
the super white plastic coating is not
meant to come off inside of the upper
half of the stiff metal frame is where
the battery resides I tried opening up
the metal to get a better look at the
battery size and information but after
it squirted battery acid at me I decided
it was not a fun activity let's start
with the scratch test we know glass is
glass
at this point but we still got a check
and make sure Apple isn't pulling a fast
one on anyone and using less durable
materials than what we're used to it is
interesting to see how thin the glasses
though
each scratch of my picks leaves major
temporary impressions on the pixels we
get the standard scratching at level six
with deeper grooves at a level seven so
the screen is still made from glass and
not plastic but it's super thin there is
a front facing camera does the whole
face ID thing now that the home button
is gone the volume buttons up on the
right hand corner are made from metal
along with the whole right side of the
iPad except for this little patch of
plastic in the middle for the wireless
charging induction can happen through
metal so Apple cut out the metal and
added this little plastic layer that
allows the power to flow through to the
pencil hopefully the plastic doesn't
compromise any structural integrity
later on down to the bottom we get our
two large speaker grilles we'll have to
see if these are decoration or not
during the teardown video and we also
have our USB C port which can be used to
charge other devices pretty cool
hopefully Apple makes this port the
standard across all their devices in the
future that would be an awesomely
beneficial move for the customer the
left side of the iPad is blank except
for one little microphone hole right
smack dab in the center you know how
easy it is to rip your jeans after a
hole has already been started the same
thing applies to metal that hole is a
weak point and I can see this probably
being a problem in the future there are
two more microphone holes up at the top
of the iPad and between the two
ginormous speaker grilles there's also
the power button all metal the back of
the iPad pro is
also metal Apple focused quite a bit on
how well people can draw on the new iPad
pro but they never really specified on
which side of the iPad the drawings need
to occur this is the biggest art class
with Jerry canvas I've ever had and the
anodized aluminum makes a perfect
surface as an artist I definitely have
to agree with that one this one the iPad
is really good for drawing yeah the
front has liquid retina with a hundred
and twenty Hertz touch sensitivity but
the back has a hundred and twenty Hertz
your ear sensitivity and you can't beat
that
if you guessed I was drawing spider-man
I'm impressed with your creative
thinking or maybe the iPad pro just
makes me look better at drawing than I
actually am hopefully Stan Lee approves
the Apple logo does kind of distract
from the overall appearance though so
it's good to know if you ever want to
get rid of the Apple logo or hide any
accidental scratches debrand has you
covered
quite literally this textured black
matrix feels more professional than just
the bare aluminum but the best news is
that with D brand the Apple pencil now
looks like an actual pencil and still
connects and charges wirelessly that
doesn't get any better than that I'll
leave a link down in the description if
you want to customize your own phone or
iPad and thanks addy brand for
sponsoring this video we already know
the result of our next test Apple is
once again touting sapphire camera lens
covers on their iPad pro and as we know
sapphire should scratch at level 8
making it a very premium durable scratch
resistant product more so than glass
glass scratches at level 6 but Apple
sapphire is not the same quality we've
seen in other places like HTC zorty so's
Apple sapphire scratches like glass at
level 6 super annoying when Apple is
bragging about premium materials that
don't actually perform like they should
it makes real sapphire look bad
you would think Apple would be able to
afford real sapphire but maybe next time
the massive 11 inch display is using
Apple's liquid retina technology which
is just an LCD and lasted 10 seconds
under the heat from my lighter before
turning off I'm still impressed that I
can buy this whole iPad pro for
basically the same price as a 10 R
which is probably just another example
of that phone being incredibly
overpriced like always with my
durability test it's time for the bin
test I doubt this tablet will ever end
up in a back pocket but it will be in
backpacks and book bags or laying around
unnoticed on a couch cushion chair or
bed before someone sits down structural
integrity is still important and the
iPad pro just doesn't have any of that
structural integrity stuff at tablet the
size of a piece of paper folds like a
piece of paper I do feel bad for
spider-man though I'll try to straighten
him out perfect it looks like the two
weakest points are right dead center on
either side of the iPad pro the correct
frame happened right at the poorly
placed microphone hole and again over
here on the poorly supported wireless
charging dock for the pencil the thin
glass screen isn't helping out
structurally and neither are the loose
on compare to meant alized pouch style
lithium ion batteries the iPad pro is a
thin Ridge 'less aluminum sack with no
structure holding things together like
tin foil wrapped around mashed potatoes
there are four massive speakers inside
which is pretty impressive
at least now I don't have to make a
teardown video Apple focused on making
the thinnest iPad they could without
putting much thought into structure or
weak points in the frame so make sure if
it's ever in a backpack you don't lean
up against a chair or a wall and make
sure grandma doesn't accidentally sit on
it because it won't survive poor
spider-man customize your own phone or
protect your tablet with a deep brand

see constructively durability tested in
