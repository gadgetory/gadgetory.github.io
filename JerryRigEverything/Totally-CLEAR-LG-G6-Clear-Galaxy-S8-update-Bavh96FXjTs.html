clear LG g6 I'll show you how I made
these in just a second if I want to talk
to you about the Galaxy s8 I ran into an
issue while I tried to charge it the day
after I made my video turns out
everything was working just fine the
phone calls the service the Wi-Fi
everything except for that it wouldn't
charge I would get a battery temperature
too low a warning sign even though the
battery obviously wasn't cold this is
not ideal for people who want to use
their phone longer than a day turns out
there is a small temperature sensing
Niblett on the side of the wireless
charging pad that has its own little
metal contact points with the
motherboard I used some scissors to cut
through the hard plastic around those
contact pads and I also cut through the
wireless charging loops leaving just two
plastic screw holes the golden contact
pads and the niblet itself once I
screwed this small segment back into the
motherboard I was able to charge and
function like normal again so if you do
mess this part up you can sometimes get
replacement wireless charging coils on
eBay for about ten or twenty dollars or
just harvest one from a broken galaxy si
to test on first or maybe you can just
leave your whole wireless charging
connected under the glass but either way
that nibblet does need to be there for
your phone to charge not the ideal
design choice
I feel like normally that battery
temperature sensor is inside the battery
itself but on the SI it is outside the
battery and inside the wireless charging
coil luckily with the LG G 6 we don't
have that issue the phone will charge
just fine even without the wireless
coils inside now let me show you what
the LG G 6 looks like when you strip off
that outer color just like with every
glued shut glass back phone we have to
use some heat to soften the adhesive
under the glass I don't personally have
a hairdryer so I just use my heat gun
then I split my thin metal pry tool
between the glass and the frame I talked
more about this in my LG g6 tear down
the long story short just go slow and be
gentle as you slice through that glue
once the back glass is off I'll pull off
the excess adhesive and then I'll get
that camera lens out of the frame I
thought about making the lens clear
since you can see it still has that
silver coloring on it but I don't have
any spare lenses yet and I don't want to
risk cracking this one so I just pulled
the whole frame out
the fingerprint scanner came out a
little easier just make sure not to
damage that little ribbon cable along
the side now as far as the back panel
goes the color is on the underside of
the glass just like it was with the s8
they took a second to find the starting
point digging through the color until I
could get a grip on it and pull it off
in one massive chunk slightly easier to
remove than the Galaxy sa it feels a lot
like aluminum foil and luckily it didn't
leave any residue behind on the glass
the back of the phone still is Gorilla
Glass 5 so it should be pretty shadow
resistant now I could just put the glass
back on the phone and call it good it
still looks pretty high-tech at this
point but I think we should take it all
the way there are 11 screws holding down
that wireless charging and back plastics
I'll pop off the wireless charging it
doesn't look like this one has any
temperature sensing niblets attached to
it so we should be just fine without it
I'll check in a second the loudspeaker
plastics can be popped off as well and
just like with the SI we don't need all
of it just the speaker section with its
golden contact pads I did leave two
screw holes intact so it will still be
tight against the phone body and now for
the moment of truth it still charges
without the wireless charging in place
so it looks like the temperature sensor
for the LG G 6 since it does have one
somewhere is either built into the
battery or into the motherboard which i
think is definitely a better design
choice than having it in the wireless
charging pad I'll add some of my clear
double-sided tape to the camera lens and
then press it back into the glass the
fingerprint scanner and power buttons
are all one unit on the g6 you have to
be super careful with this if that
ribbon rips the power button will stop
working and well you know there's always
the chance that your phone will never
work again if you attempt this so keep
that in mind I'll lay that clear
double-sided tape all around the outside
of the phone this will help keep dust
and lint from your pocket from entering
under the glass and getting inside those
components so make sure it's fully
sealed around that edge I'll clean off
the inside of that back glass because
once it gets set down into place it's
pretty permanent the double-sided tape
is pretty strong stuff
gently setting the glass panel down into
place and pressing it securely
all along the edges and there you have
it
that is one pretty good-looking phone
I'll turn it on the phone is still fully
functional - the wireless charging Wi-Fi
and cell phone signals still function it
would be way cool to add one of those
old-school rotating mass vibrators
inside so we could see a spin but this
phone doesn't have one of those
unfortunately it's still pretty fun to
see all the components though if you
notice I did screw all of my screws back
into the holes that came from even
without that back plastic just be
careful not to go too far because they
do push through into the back of the LCD
and can create pressure points I think
both phones look pretty awesome so if
you had to pick between the galaxy s 8
and the LG G 6 which one do you think
looks cooler on the inside my Instagram
followers got a sneak preview of this
project before the video actually went
live on YouTube so come follow me over
there if you're into that kind of stuff
and let me know if there's any other
phones you want to see clearer versions
of down in the comments thanks ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
