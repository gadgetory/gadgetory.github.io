of these.
It's a question and answer session.
I asked over on Twitter a couple days ago,
what questions you have for me, and here are
a couple of them.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
So the first question is kind of a weird one...unique
I should say.
'What is your parents' daily driver?'
My dad is currently using the Galaxy Note
9.
And then my mom is using the LG G7.
I come from kind of a large family.
My older sister is using a One Plus 6T.
My brother is using a LG V30.
And my younger two sisters are both using
iPhones.
Right.
I'm currently using my two year old Galaxy
S8.
It's still running like a champ.
I'm probably going to keep on using it for
a while, I don't really see a need to upgrade.
But that might change.
Who knows.
Two years into the phone...might be time for
another one.
We'll see what happens.
'What is a recent tech product you regret
buying?'
So I have a good one.
It happened relatively recently.
So I ride motorcycles.
I've had a bike ever since I was 16.
I've been riding for a very long time.
And recently I saw an ad for a smart helmet
that costs $1,800.00.
I was like, alright, the commercial looks
good, I'm going to buy it.
$1,800.00n later it finally gets here, and
it is a complete piece of junk.
I am planning on making a full review video
about it as soon as the snow melts.
But it is an absolute terrible product, and
it costs $1,800.00.
So I have quite a few things I want to say
about it.
It's kind of like, you know, just to understand
the concept, it's kind of like Google Glass
back in 2013....but worse.
So buckle up for that video.
It's a waste of $1,800.00.
'What phones are you most looking forward
to tearing apart in 2019?'
And I think we all know the answer to this.
Samsung just announced a foldable phone with
a very unique hinge system between the two
halves.
So I'm excited to see how that works.
The jury is still out on whether we'll see
the insides of the phone during the durability
test or during the teardown, but either way,
we're going to see the insides of it.
'What is your viewership distribution with
different countries?'
I think I've gotten this question before,
but it's always interesting to see, you know,
where traffic is coming from all over YouTube.
You know, it's a worldwide platform.
And my audience currently is 24% from the
United States, 14% from India, and then we
have 7% from the UK.
And then Indonesia, Philippines, and Canada
are right behind them.
I do have 10 views from someone over in Liechtenstein
in the last 30 days.
So...I see you over there!
Hope you enjoyed.
Thanks for watching!
And my female demographics have improved slightly.
I'm now at 8%.
Probably a little thanks to Cambry on that
one.
I think most people interested in tech or
repairing things usually happen to be males.
'How many times has someone recognized you
in public as Zack, the YouTuber?'
So I don't get recognized very often as Zack.
Usually people think my name is Jerry.
I did a different question and answer video
about why I chose the name JerryRigEverything
for my channel, so I'll link that so you can
see what happens there.
But usually people are like, 'Oh hey, you're
that Jerry...Jerry...You're Jerry!'
And I'm like, yeah, I am, and we just kind
of roll with it.
But I would say, usually when I'm out in public,
like maybe 30% of the time, whether I'm at
the movies or eating out, someone will stop
by and say hi, which I super appreciate.
It's always fun to meet someone who likes
watching my stuff.
'Do you like pineapple on pizza?'
Yes, it's probably my favorite topping.
You know, the Hawaiian pizza when you get
Canadian bacon and pineapple on there.
So good.
'I found your Tacoma videos pretty good.
Will you make more in the future?'
And yes, I will.
Vehicles and, you know, electric vehicles
I feel like are the future and I plan on doing
more in-depth videos about those, including
electric trucks in the future.
But I have done a lot of modifications done
to the Tacoma that I bought last year.
And those are on my second YouTube channel
called ZacksJerryRig.
Things are quite a bit more chill over there,
and that's how we like it.
So if you want to see, you know, some of the
side projects and things that I've done to
my truck...ZacksJerryRig.
'Have you pre-ordered an electric car?'
And yes, I have.
I have given my refundable thousand dollar
deposit on the Rivian electric truck, which
should be shipping in 2020.
And the specs on this thing and the price
are pretty incredible, you know, for what
you....you get a lot for what you pay for.
Amazon as well just dropped seven hundred
million dollars into Rivian, which kind of
gives it a little bit of a boost.
So I'm pretty confident that they're going
to hit the 2020 or 2021 delivery date with
their trucks.
I'm also following a company named Bollinger,
which they have a kind of boxy looking electric
truck.
A little bit slower.
Almost the same price, but they're quite a
bit behind schedule with their development.
So I think it's pretty much just between Tesla
and their unannounced electric truck, versus
Rivian.
And so we'll see which one comes out on top
and which one's better.
But I probably will be buying whichever first
electric truck comes to market, whether it's
Rivian or Tesla, it's probably going to be
one of those two.
Tesla does have the upper hand with their
super charging network, but they haven't announced
their truck yet.
I might make a video more in-depth on the
electric trucks that are in production right
now, or are planning on being, you know, in
production, but that's where we're at right
now.
We'll see what happens.
'What is the thing that makes you get up in
the morning?
Elon Musk has Mars.
What about you?'
So for context, Elon Musk is the guy who kind
of started Tesla.
He also has his own rocket company, you know,
with the main goal of putting people on Mars.
And Elon says he does want to die on Mars
someday, just not on impact.
That's kind of his life goal.
So for me though, what gets me up in the mornings...it's
kind of always been I like being productive.
I like accomplishing things and helping people.
And that's kind of like the theme of my YouTube
channel for the last 7 years has been tutorials
and like projects I'm doing, and ways that
I can help people out, you know, through the
internet.
Lately, ever since I've made that off-road
wheelchair video, I've noticed that, you know,
the pricing on accessories and off-road chairs
for people who are in wheelchairs is ridiculous.
Like, you know, for an off-road wheelchair,
it can cost anywhere from $10,000, $20,000,
$30,000 and that's just like not sustainable
or obtainable to anyone.
Whether you're in a chair or not, like that
is a lot of money to spend on, you know, something
that's not a car.
So ever since I built the first off-road for,
you know, about $3,000 by combining 2 electric
bikes, that's always just kind of been in
my mind, and I want to make something on a
larger scale that's easier to get in and out
of, that's accessible to everyone.
So that's been something I've been working
on a lot lately.
Mass producing something in large quantities
takes quite a bit of time, but I think we'll
have a complete version by this summer in
2019.
So I'm pretty excited about that, and I have
a couple other projects in the works as well.
[Construction sounds]
This is like a proof of concept... ha ha,
this is sweet!
So that's...that's what's getting me out of
bed in the mornings lately.
'Would you ever consider using an iPhone as
your daily driver?'
So, yeah, the last time that I used an iPhone
as my daily driver was back in 2011 I think,
with the iPhone 4.
I used it for a couple months, and then made
a huge long list of things that I didn't like
about the iPhone, and then switched back to
Android.
Then in 2016 I decided to give it another
chance.
I tried it out for a couple months and it
wasn't bad.
I didn't die, but it also was not my favorite.
It kind of had the exact same list of problems
that I had with the iPhone 4 back in the day.
To like summarize the experience, I feel like
I'm paying a lot of money and not getting
the return on my investment when I'm using
an iPhone.
Granted, I was not using the Apple ecosystem.
I didn't have, you know, the watch or the
AirPods, or the computers.
I was just using the phone.
And I think the benefit that comes with the
Apple ecosystem is when you're using all of
it, but also you're paying a lot of money
for that, you know, convenience, which just
isn't really worth it to me.
You know, my two year old Android phone still
has more features than some of the recent
iPhones and it's just not worth it.
You know, whether you pay $500 or $1,000 for
your, you know, smartphone that you're using,
the majority of people are just going to run,
you know, Facebook, Instagram, and you know,
browse the Internet.
It's still going to make calls and text messages...it
doesn't need to cost as much as it's costing.
And I think Apple's wallet has been hit with
that for the last year or so, and hopefully
we see some changes in the future.
But yes, I would consider using an iPhone
as my daily driver again, but probably for
a short period of time before I go right back
to Android for the third time.
'How much did it cost you to start your YouTube
channel?
And what kind of equipment did you use?'
So my first hundred videos or so were all
shot with a smartphone.
I think the smartphone I had back in the day
was the Evo 4G.
I don't even think you could film in 1080p,
but it was enough to film all the projects
I was working on, mostly automotive stuff
at that point, you know, doing engine swaps
and suspensions and stuff in Jeeps.
And then I started to delve more into the
cellphone side of things, like repairing smartphones
because more people own a smartphone than
own a Jeep.
And I would just prop the cellphone I was
recording with up on a little ledge and film
straight down onto the table, do my repair,
edit the video and post it.
So my first 100 videos were all shot in the
first year or so, and I got about 2,000 subscribers
that first year.
It was fun for me.
It was kind of like a side project and more
of like a video journal of all my different
projects.
My current setup is I'm filming with the GH5
in front of me right now.
And then I also have a GH5 right here that's
kind of mounted to the ceiling with some barn
door rails.
I have a video on Twitter that's kind of more
of a brief tour of my shop that shows like
the lights and stuff inside of this room,
and how it all works.
But yeah, so I'll link that.
You can come over and hang out with me on
Twitter.
If you have any more questions, leave them
down in the comments.
I'll be hanging down there for about an hour
or so and I can just, you know, respond to
you right there.
And I appreciate it.
So yeah, that's kind of a brief summary on
where I'm at, and you know, behind the scenes
on what I'm doing in, you know, my personal
life, and what phones my parents use.
Thank you for hitting that subscribe button.
Come hang out with me on Twitter and Instagram,
and thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
