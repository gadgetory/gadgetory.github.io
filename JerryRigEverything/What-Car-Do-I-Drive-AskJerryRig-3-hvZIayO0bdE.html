video the last one is about a year ago
so it's high time for another one I
asked on Twitter a couple days ago what
questions you guys have for me and today
I'm gonna answer some of them here on
camera the first one is from my buddy
super staff and he says do you even lift
bro I actually do enjoy going to the gym
I go pretty much every single day since
I'm self-employed doing this whole
YouTube thing it's kind of like my only
social interaction throughout the day
and so it's kind of important more than
lifting though I like running I've done
two marathons I've done quite a few
Spartan races I think like eight or nine
and then a ton of Ragnar races as well
it's kind of like a relay race where you
have 12 people and you run for like you
know a day and a half straight but yet
answer your question I think the gym and
exercising is a very important part of a
well-rounded life and I try to have a
well-rounded life and as many areas as
possible the next question is from
Candice Navarro and it says is it true
that Apple took the headphone jack off
because they ran out of screws over the
years they've been screwing people I
think you and I would get along very
well
speaking of Apple philosophies we have
deke asking will you ever start buying
phones without a headphone jack is it
really a must-have for you to ask that
question I would say that everything I
have in my life
is useful in one way or another I you I
picked the most useful things for me one
example would be that I've carried a
pocket knife with me every day fight the
last ten years give or take and is this
pocket knife right here and I choose
that this one's the most useful for me
because it has swappable razor blades so
when one gets stole I can just swap it
out really easily pop it back in my
knife and it's good to go
and so for me personally this knife is
the most useful it's cheap efficient and
effective and in my daily driver like my
vehicle my truck I have a toolbox in the
back that is constantly prepared with a
bunch of different tools that I could
use in any kind of situation now a cell
phone is the exact same way I want my
cell phone to be equipped with all the
tools that I might need even if I don't
actually need to use them that same day
like I personally own a ton of wireless
Bluetooth headphones and I love them
like running on a treadmill with a cable
attached to your ears is kind of
dangerous
I've seen people whack that cable and
their cell phone goes flying across the
room I've even done that a couple
time's so wireless headphones are a must
at the gym but I have left my headphones
at home a couple times and I'm not gonna
buy a brand new 70 $100 pair of
headphones at the gym I would much
rather buy a $10 corded pair of
headphones that I can leave in my truck
or leave in a car leaving your backpack
just to have whenever you might forget
your more expensive pair of headphones a
headphone jack is also useful when
you're driving around in someone's car
and they have an aux cable that you can
just plug into your phone to listen to
music
don't have a headphone jack can't plug
your phone in or if you're an
entrepreneur in you one of those square
readers to plug in I can take credit
cards with your phone you need a
headphone jack for that or if you're on
a long flight 10 or 15 hours and your
battery dies and your wireless
headphones it's nice to have a cable to
plug into your phone and use so for me
personally right now while they're still
phones out there with the headphone jack
installed like the LGV 30 or the samsung
galaxy note or the Galaxy s8 I'm gonna
pick one of those phones because it's
useful more often than not my daily
driver is gonna have a headphone jack
because I like useful things all right
we have another question from Zach good
name by the way if it wasn't for YouTube
what would you be doing I would say if
it wasn't for YouTube right now I would
probably still be fixing stuff and
working on things when I first started
my youtube channel I was actually
working on jeeps like my first 50 or so
videos was me doing you know CV axle
swaps I did an engine swap and a Grand
Cherokee working on big tangible objects
I mean don't get me wrong cell phones
are great but they're really small and I
would prefer to work on something bigger
so if it wasn't for YouTube I was
probably either doing construction
somewhere or being you know an auto
mechanic but still focusing on the
business aspect of it and not just being
a technician I'd probably own my own
little shop somewhere and also I
probably wouldn't be that big into
social media and my phone would probably
be 2 or 3 years old and broken several
times over not sure how to say this one
cava jus says do you put D brand skins
on your phone or do they come
pre-installed because they are pretty
hard to install so actually my job right
before I started YouTube was working at
a cell phone sales rep for one of the
major carriers here in the United States
and so I've put on over thousands and
thousands of screen protectors on
customers phones so putting on a D brand
skin is actually pretty easy for me and
I've installed all the ones you've seen
on my channel myself but it does take a
little bit of practice
and patience to get it right one trick
if you're installing a screen protector
and you get like a little piece of dust
or something underneath lift it up I
know a razor place probably not the tool
of choice for most everybody but lift it
up with something sharp like a toothpick
or a needle or something like that and
then you can stick a piece of clear
scotch tape underneath grab that dust
back pull it out and let the screen
protector fold back down it's over the
screen again a little trick of the trade
Eliot Cardwell asks how frequently you
change your daily driver and what's been
your most used phone ever switching my
daily driver
I hate switching my phone actually even
though I have a lot of phones available
to me that have all been damaged
slightly I don't switch my phone that
often I use my test at galaxy s7 edge
for about a full year before I switch to
the galaxy s 8 plus and that's the phone
I'm using right now the galaxy s 8 plus
I do have the note but I haven't
switched to that I don't feel like
there's that much of a benefit from me
switching from this phone which is about
the same size all the way to the note I
would like that second camera having
that telephoto lens on there would be
pretty cool it's not worth the effort
for me to switch over to that phone for
just that one small increment of
improvement so I'm gonna stick with the
Galaxy S a for a while if I wasn't a
youtuber though like I mentioned before
I would probably keep my phone for two
or three years before switching but to
answer your question I switch about once
a year so there was actually a couple of
these questions Diamond guy asks do you
have a car if yes what type is it let me
show you so I Drive a 1998 Toyota Tacoma
this thing has two hundred and forty two
thousand miles on it it's held together
with a little bit of duct tape over here
on this light I hit a fence a couple
years ago in this light I've never been
able to get back in the right spot so I
just have some tape holding it in place
scratched a little bit of the back side
right there added the light bar a couple
years ago so one of the bad things with
Toyota's is that they never die this
thing has two hundred and forty two
thousand miles on it
I replaced the muffler actually a couple
days ago because it was wearing a hole
through the center of my bed so you can
actually see down into the ground below
my truck as that toolbox I was talking
about there's actually a hole right
there in the bed as well and this has
worked out really well for me for a
really long time I'll probably get a new
one here in the future probably another
tacoma I've had good luck with
in the past but this one's doing just
fine the next question is from run
stairs and he says why is your Tacoma so
old and beat up I'm sure your YouTube
money could buy you a new one I think
she's beautiful what was your favorite
video on your channel so far so I had to
think about this one for a second I have
over 500 videos on my channel and I
enjoyed every single one of them but if
I had to pick my favorite videos they
would be my drone history series I only
have four of them right now but I would
choose them because one I get to travel
to I get to learn something which is
kind of like the whole point of life and
three I get to show something from a
unique perspective that hasn't been seen
before from an aerial shot of a drone
I've done Hitler's anti-aircraft tower
in Germany I've done an illegal stairway
to heaven hike in Hawaii which is pretty
intense as well denne another castle in
Germany and I've done the world's
largest waterfall in Africa I've done
another one that doesn't quite count
it's an underwater drone that didn't
Cancun at the underwater museum a bunch
of statues that are buried underwater to
help facilitate the plant and animal
life below the ocean so it's not quite
like an aerial drone review but it's
still pretty sweet only got five of
those videos down in the video
description of this video if you want to
check those out they're my favorite alan
porter says what is the most common
rookie mistake people make when trying
to fix a phone I would say so I get a
lot of comments on my videos a lot of
people who have been successful with
repairs and some who have not and I
would say the consistent factor in those
people who haven't been successful with
their repair is that they weren't gentle
enough they use too much force or they
put their screws back in the wrong hole
so go slow and be gentle and make sure
you put your screws back where you found
them remember that these phones are
incredibly fragile and expensive and if
it's your first time repairing a phone
it's a pretty difficult project the good
thing though is that once you've
repaired one phone that same skill set
applies to all the phones and it gets
easier as you go along Dennis says
what's the best tip you could give for
someone just starting out with YouTube
videos doing tech reviews or similar I
would say the biggest tip I could give
is to just get started that seems to be
the biggest hurdle with everyone I've
talked to and I've talked to hundreds of
people I think most people are surprised
at how much work it is after uploading
one
to videos but the biggest thing is just
people not starting you don't need to
wait for the perfect moment that'll
never arrive and you don't need to wait
till you have expensive camera or tools
or setup I think my first hundred or so
videos were all shot with the cell phone
and this was back five years ago when
cell phones weren't even shooting in
1080p
I think 720 was some of my first videos
that was the maximum resolution that
phones could shoot at and cell phones
nowadays are pretty incredible
so it's important not to let your dreams
just be dreams and actually do something
about I'll do a new set up tour here in
a couple weeks I am in a new space so my
set up tour from 2016 is incredibly
outdated I'll make sure to have that up
before the end of the year for sure
and the last question is do you have a
website and yes I do actually I have a
website it talks about some of the
conference's that I've spoken at it also
has a little bit more about meme and I
also sell some of these shirts mo is my
bro I can pretty much guarantee that no
one who doesn't watch this channel is
gonna know what this shirt even means so
it's kind of fun to wear it around I'll
have these shirts and everything else I
talked about in this video linked in the
video description and I'll be hanging
around in the comment section for about
an hour after this video has been posted
so if you have any more questions let me
know and I'll answer them down there for
you once again thank you so much for
watching I could not do this channel
without you I really do appreciate it
every time you come back and watch
something else that I've made thanks ton
for watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
