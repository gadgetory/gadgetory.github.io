BlackBerry Prive I do durability tests
on all the major flagship devices
scratch tests burn tests Bend tests it's
nice knowing beforehand what you were
getting into when you buy a smartphone
let's start off with a scratch test the
BlackBerry probe is rocking the Gorilla
Glass 4 same as the Nexus 6p so it
should end up pretty close on the Mohs
scale of hardness as anticipated a level
6 pick leaves a mark and a very visible
scratch can be seen to level 7 this
means that the screen won't be scuffed
up by car keys or coins but will be
scuffed by a razor blade sand or other
hard objects you can see my keys did
nothing to the screen I plan on making
another video here in the near future
where I catch up on my previously tested
devices with this new Mo's test I
imagine that most phones will be around
at five or six but it will be
interesting to see where the outliers
are and who they are let's jump to the
back of the proof the back has a nice
soft rubbery feel to it when I take my
keys to the back they leave almost no
mark until here when some sharp edge of
my key tore at the back but you can see
that normally keys or coins would do
absolutely nothing the sharp edge of my
key was just a fluke
I think this material has some major
longevity to it it doesn't peel off when
I tried scraping it with my razor either
now here's the part of the phone that
I'm most disappointed in I'm a camera
guy I love when my smartphone has a
solid camera and solid lens as you can
see this lens is very easily scratched I
wish we could pretend like it didn't
happen but it did even car keys can
scratch it it is weaker than a level-3
on the Mohs scale why would you not have
tempered glass on your camera lens
that's like putting plastic rims on your
Ferrari let's check out the keyboard
Before we jump into the burn test it
scratches just like normal plastic would
but I imagine that the phone will be
closed most of the time so scratching on
the keyboard isn't a big issue
I was curious to see if any dirt or
grime could get under the keys but it's
completely sealed by a solid piece of
rubber so you don't need to worry about
getting junk caught under there let's
check out the burn test the BlackBerry
Prive does have an AMOLED screen with a
bear flame resting on the screen the
pixels shut off and turn white which is
interesting because most phones turned
black the only other phone to go white
was the Nexus 6p and those pixels never
recovered but this phone the BlackBerry
Prive come fully back to life you can't
even tell that the pixels are ever
burned
get the BlackBerry a thumbs up for
surviving the heat I think it's
interesting test now I debated a lot
about doing a bin test on this phone
doing a bin test on a slider phone is
about as fair as entering Michael Jordan
into a first grade dunk contest so
instead let me show you what I can do
with just my two fingers and you guys
can decide if it bends or not even when
the phone is closed that little lip at
the bottom of the screen wants to lift
off from the bottom half so I wouldn't
trust this phone at all in a bin to
situation keep in mind that it is a
slider phone though so it can't be
directly compared to the rest of the
flagships I will analyze the
construction of this phone more during
my teardown repair video which I will
post in a couple days
