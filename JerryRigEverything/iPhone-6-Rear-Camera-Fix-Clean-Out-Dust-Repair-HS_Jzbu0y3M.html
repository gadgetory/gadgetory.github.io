replace the camera on the iPhone 6 if
you want to check out the other repair
videos go ahead and click those links
here's the iPhone 6 we'll go over first
we're going to go ahead and take off the
screen to do that we have to take out
the two pentalobe screws down at the
bottom of the phone if you are looking
for replacement tools or replacement
parts go ahead and look in the video
description and I will link some of them
for you there I'm going to take my
suction cup and pull up on the screen
just a little bit so it will leave
enough room for me to wedge my pry tool
between the screen and the frame you can
use a plastic tool or a metal tool just
make sure you pry up on the metal part
of the screen instead of the middle of
the screen or else you're going to crack
it there's five screws along this metal
plate take all of that out and then
there's four ribbon cables that you have
to unlatch from the phone they're kind
of like little Lego pieces so just lift
them up and away and then that's the
only thing holding the screen on the
phone so once that's off your screen is
off and you're good to go
now we have two screws holding on the
rear camera the first one is easy to see
you can just unscrew that and lift it
out the second one is hidden underneath
black tape so just kind of put your
screwdriver there and just pull it out
and then you can pull it out with your
tweezers after that the camera bracket
comes off and then the camera itself
comes out of the little holster that
it's in this is the 8 megapixel iPhone 6
camera it's actually pretty awesome then
here you can see the little hole so if
you get like dust or dirt or anything
down there you can blow it out pretty
easily then there's these little
brackets along the side that kind of
pinch the camera into place as you push
it back in the camera can do 720p at 240
frames a second which is pretty
phenomenal for a cell phone camera get
those 2 screws back in and then you just
want to clip each of these little ribbon
cables back into place make sure not to
be too aggressive with them because you
can bend pins and then you'd have to get
a new screen after that which would be
pretty annoying just go ahead and be
gentle with those clip men kind of like
little LEGO pieces
and then take your little metal bracket
and those five screws get them back
together and then you can pinch down
your screen again make sure to align the
top of it first it'll slide in these
little grooves it'll be completely flush
along the top and you can pinch along
the edges all the way down the phone and
then don't forget those two bottom
screws the pentalobe ones and if you
were looking for parts or anything else
go ahead and look in the video
