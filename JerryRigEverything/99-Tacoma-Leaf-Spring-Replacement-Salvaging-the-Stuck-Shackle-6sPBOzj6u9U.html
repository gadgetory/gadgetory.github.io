Tacoma this one we're replacing the back
leaf springs kind of see on the leaf
spring right here how it bends up and
endures a truck instead of you know
given the truck the support it needs
normally this wouldn't be a huge issue
but it has started to break his back
shocks so you come around at this side
you can see that this leaf spring is
doing the exact same thing but it is
also snapping it shocks off so the truck
is completely not even attached to the
truck anymore so we got the tire off it
is a 21 millimeter bolt for these to get
the lug nuts off of the tire and then I
put the tire underneath the axle right
there just so if anything does happen
with the truck
you know the axle won't drop or damage
the drum or anything like that and then
I have a jack underneath the back part
of the frame another jack here and then
just put the cinder block under there
for fun I'm just cause you know if the
car ever does fall they could cause a
lot of damage to the car as well as
yourself so having a few points of
contact underneath the truck would be
beneficial to everybody anyway
the nuts underneath this our 19
millimeter same with this guy right here
and the one on the back and then right
now this is pretty stuck just because
the truck is probably never you know had
this bolt taken off and so sometimes
they fuse together I'm so I'm gonna try
right now is I have the jack underneath
the end of this wrench and sometimes
just jack up the jack and see if I can
get it to just bend a little bit so on
the frame end of the leaf spring the
bolt is actually seized inside of the
leaf spring so I had to cut right here
on both sides to get rid of the bolt so
the inside the bolt is still inside the
spring and I used to drill with a
cut-off blade is about one charge per
side here
you can see right here where I had to
cut off the bolt so the bolt is still
inside of the leaf spring and I had to
chop it off on both sides with that
little cutter bit on my drill it's pain
rough sucks if the nut ever gets stuck
inside of this your little ratchet head
I'm the easiest way to get it out let's
just stick it right back on the boat
where it came from
they do now Panera unscrews just like
that those are the rear shackle right
here and on the rear shackle there's a 1
19 millimeter bolt on this end it's
actually coming off pretty easy probably
cuz there's a lock nut lock washer on
this side so once you this 19 millimeter
nut off there's one up here as well 19
millimeter and then this little bracket
just kind of pops away and lets the leaf
spring slide out so this is the rear
shackle right here and the rear shackle
is normally supposed to just slide out
but this one just like the front of the
leaf spring is seized inside so no
matter how I turn this thing mom it's
just stuck you can see that there's a
metal ring inside in between the rubber
and that is just fused together with the
bolt and I've looked around you know in
a couple different internet forums and
really the only way to get this apart is
just either cutting it with the plasma
torch or if you're a poor college
student I'm grab a drill and a and a
cutting tool kind of hack away at it so
once I got that cut off the head of it
is still fused inside and so what I'm
doing right now is I'm just taking a
drill to it and just really now the same
sized hole that would have been if this
bolt wasn't retarded there we go
got the bolt in there I mean I'll put a
washer on the other side and that is how
you resurrect your old stuck shackles
now that's in I'll be able to put them
back in with the leaf spring and get
everything undone I'll stall my unclip
this brake line from the brake so I
could lift the leaf spring up and out of
this so this little stopper was on top
of the old leaf spring I'm just going to
take it and pump it on top of the newest
release spring after I kind of clean it
out a little bit so when you're putting
the new hardware into the shackles make
sure that you grease it up just a little
bit on the inside this keeps it from
binding with the new leaf springs
basically this is just being nice to the
next guy it means to take apart your rig
as a side note make sure to put this in
your toolbox that the lid is not upside
down on a hot day okay so I got the dew
bolt washer and then I got a locking
washer and then the other nut on the
other side and this right here there's a
little nub on the bottom of this that
fits inside this little hole so when I
line everything again I got to make sure
that hole goes into place but I'm going
to put the back shackle on first so I'll
know exactly where to put the axle when
I load that back on
I'll so as you raise the axle up into
place the little hole will also shift
this direction as well
all right so stars putting everything on
when I first started I left the nut out
here just so I could position everything
while I was still loose and then I came
here and attached the u-bolts again I'm
tightened them all evenly around the
edge you know doing a turn here turn
here turn here turn there until they're
all tight
I'm reattach the shock I'll touch I'll
link another video right here video
shows how to remove and install the rear
shocks on a toyota tacoma let's go ahead
and click that if you want to watch it
and you can see I put this stopper back
into place and pinch that down with you
so now that everything is tight and work
back down I can go ahead and throw the
tire back on and that is it I'll put a
link in the video description for the
leaf springs on Amazon they're pretty
cheap I'll try to find some hardware as
well and then as far as the rear shackle
goes back there you know if you if you
have the time to wait for a rear shackle
go ahead and buy one of those if not the
way I showed you how to resurrect the
things works just fine as well this side
that I'm done with is one inch taller
than the other side so the other shocks
were worn down to the point where it has
one inch of sagging and compared to
brand-new sog shocks and leaf springs to
get to the driver's side back with
spring you need to take down the back
tire on the spare and so you take the
part of the hardware that you get from
the where you drop the tire down you
stick it through that little hole in the
top of the license plate right above the
bumper and stick it in and you just
ratchet down the tire that's where that
connects and that will give you room to
work with the bolts on the other side of
the this thing and you might if you have
any questions be sure to leave them in
