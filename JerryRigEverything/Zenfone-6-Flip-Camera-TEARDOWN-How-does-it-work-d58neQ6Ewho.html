You might not remember the name, but you'll
definitely remember the flip up camera.
It's the one that swivels out of the phone
like some kind R2D2 accessory.
We've done the durability test and we know
the camera hinge is secure and the motor is
rated for 100,000 flips.
But in order to see how it's all put together
and learn how it works, we're going to have
to review it from the inside.
It's time to teardown the Zenfone 6.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
The Zenfone 6 is built like most other glass
and metal smart phones with a large glass
panel on the back held on with adhesive.
There's no water resistance rating on the
Zenfone 6, so I assumed it would be easier
to take apart, but I was wrong.
The adhesive holding the thing together is
incredibly goopy and strong, and really hard
to slice through.
But I eventually managed to make it happen,
and I removed the glass.
There is one long fingerprint scanner ribbon
attaching the back panel to the phone still.
I'll pop off that fingerprint scanner from
the glass and set it off to the side.
You'll also want to watch out for the fragile
Google Assistant ribbon cable that's super
close to the edge of the phone.
I went ahead and accidentally on purpose sliced
mine in half as an example of what not to
do and what you should avoid.
The phone should still work though, even if
I did kill the assistant.
There are 7 Philips head screws holding down
the black plastic plate, then I can unsnap
the fingerprint scanner ribbon and lift off
those plastics.
The NFC coil comes off as well.
I thought at first this might make a cool
looking transparent phone, but then I changed
my mind, mostly because the majority of the
flippy camera is hidden underneath the metal
camera housing and would not be visible in
a clear phone.
Let's take a closer look.
I'll unplug the battery from the motherboard
for safety since we do want this phone to
turn on again someday.
And I'll grab the singular battery pull tab
down here at the bottom.
But then, without even pulling, the battery
falls away from the phone basically all on
it's own.
That's a pleasant flaw in the assembly process
for me.
Thumbs up for an accidentally too easy battery
removal.
The Zenfone 6 has a massive 5000 milliamp
hour battery, which is twice the capacity
of the iPhone XS.
You can see the two pretty worthless battery
adhesive strips down here pretending to do
their jobs.
I'll unclip the two extension ribbons like
little Legos, then the metal camera housing
up here at the top is held in place by 4 more
screws.
Two additional screws already got removed
with the back plastics.
Once those are out, I can gently lift away
part of the metal structure from around the
top of the camera and I can slide the little
edge of the bracket out from underneath the
motherboard.
Even with that support bracket now gone, the
camera is still solidly in position.
We can see a bit more of the motor and gear
as the camera flips back and forth.
No long stepper motor shaft this time around
like we've seen in some of the pop up camera
phones.
The Zenfone 6 has just one gear going straight
from the motor to the camera.
The camera control ribbon connector is also
very different.
It's not like the little Lego style this time
around.
I'll remove the one motherboard screw and
disconnect the 3 additional ribbon cables,
and two more wire cables, and then lift the
motherboard out and away from the frame, revealing
yet another motherboard like some kind of
high tech Oreo cookie with pink frosting inside.
There are two different motherboards.
I'm not sure what the overall goal with that
thermal paste is though.
Each motherboard is heating up and transferring
the heat right back into the other motherboard.
I'm no expert, but using functional motherboards
as heat sinks seems counter intuitive.
There are two more screws holding down that
flippy metal camera unit bringing the total
up to 8 screws.
Then I'll detach another one of those strange
connectors, and after a bit of shimmying and
unplugging the motor connector, the whole
camera contraption can come out of the Zenfone
6.
It looks like these odd connectors can be
unplugged, but the appear to be a bit more
fragile and require more finesse.
Not a huge fan.
Either way, the camera is out now and we can
get a close up look at the attached motor.
Positioned off to the side, it has a direct
connection with the hinge of the camera.
The brackets that secure the camera require
8 different screws, which I imagine is what
kept the camera so structurally solid during
my durability test.
Let's take a quick look at the bottom motherboard.
The dual SIM and SD card slot is on the lower
motherboard, with a circular white water damage
indicator next to the opening.
The loudspeaker is down at the bottom of the
phone and has 6 screws holding it in place
over the lower electronics.
And once it's removed we see another water
damage indicator on top of the headphone jack.
There is one screw holding down the charging
port board, along with one more large Lego
style ribbon connector.
Then the charging port can lift up and out
of the phone.
The USB-C charging port does have a black
rubber ring around the tip to help cushion
the port and provide some water resistance,
but as a whole, the phone is not water resistant
at all.
The front screen is permanently glued to the
metal housing like we've seen in a lot of
other glass and metal phones.
It can be replaced, it's just difficult.
It's time we get everything situated back
inside of the Zenfone 6 so I can clean up
the mess I made with all the internal guts
spread out everywhere on my desk.
Before putting the motherboard sandwich back
together, I do need to clip in the strange
camera cables that Asus is using.
Still not a huge fan.
They don't slide in easily like the Lego style
ribbons, and it makes the whole repair much
more difficult.
Finally, after hopefully getting it clicked
in, I can put the Oreo motherboard halves
together with the strawberry frosting in the
middle.
Then I'll get the black camera cable plugged
in, along with all the other more normal Lego
style connectors for the top motherboard.
The metal camera bracket gets secured onto
the camera housing with it's 4 remaining screws
holding it in place.
Then the battery can get set into the phone
and plugged in, along with the fingerprint
scanner and back plastics.
The fingerprint scanner gets placed directly
back into the rear glass panel, and I can
set the whole thing back down onto the phone.
And luckily everything still turns on.
Overall I'm a fan of the Zenfone 6.
I like seeing phones do new and unique stuff.
Yeah, the motherboard sandwich is kind of
strange.
We should watch that for overheating, but
the internal camera and bracket both look
pretty solid.
I'm not a fan of those camera connectors though,
as it appears my camera is malfunctioning
at the moment, but at least the phone itself
still works.
You win some, you lose some.
It was still worth it to see the insides.
Would you rather have a phone with a flip
up camera, or a pop up camera?
