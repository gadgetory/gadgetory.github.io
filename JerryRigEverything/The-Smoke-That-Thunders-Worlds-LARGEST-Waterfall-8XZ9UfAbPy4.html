of seven most beautiful natural wonders
in the world nestled between the borders
of Zambia and Zimbabwe Victoria Falls is
twice as tall as Niagara Falls in the
USA and is the largest sheet of falling
water on earth the water you see now is
during dry season imagine the curtain of
water after it starts raining
I'm currently flying my DJ eyes spot
while standing and angels pool it's
similar to Devil's pool and is the
safest of the unsafe places to go for a
swim before the water falls 350 feet
into the den bt river below
dr. david livingstone was the first
european person that eyes on this world
wonder he was led there by the natives
in a wooden canoe the natives called the
Falls the smoke that thunders and then
in typical white explorer fashion David
immediately took upon himself to
boringly renamed Falls after Queen
Victoria personally I think the smoke
that thunders is much more accurate dr.
Livingstone do tend to have rhodol
brownie point didn't work out too well
though since Queen Victoria never
actually came to visit the Falls her
daughter Princess Victoria did visit
though in 1904 about 16 years later none
of them had the aerial view that you
currently have on your screen right now
though technology is amazing
visit the fourth video in madrone
history series I'll have the other three
videos linked in the video description
would you ever hike to the edge of
default let me know in the comments this
entire video was shot with the DJI spark
and controller I'll add that link in the
description as well and hit that
subscribe button if you want to see more
videos like this in the future thanks a
ton for watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
