day and it's not quite over yet it's
time for a teardown and a review from
the inside let's see how repairable the
pixel really is the pixel to screen
repair is very similar to the original
pixel from last year and refreshingly
easy compared to other flagships these
days a large suction cup is always
helpful with phones that are glued shut
there's not a whole lot of glue under
this glass this time around I was able
to lift up and slide my pry tool under
the glass without any heat but it still
felt incredibly tight and I was nervous
about using too much force a heat gun
softens the adhesive under the screen
making it easier to lift off sliding my
pry tool around the edge of the glass
taking special care not to touch the
display under that glass layer which is
more fragile than a potato chip and it
will crack if the metal touches it now
if your screen is already cracked you
won't have to be as careful as I am I
just want mine to stay in one piece I
use a thin little business card to keep
the screen from reott hearing back down
to the frame the waterproofing around
the dual speakers is pretty thick now
that the screen is off we can see that
there's only one ribbon cable holding a
screen to the body of the phone I would
say the two most important things to
remember during a screen removal process
is to not bend or put too much pressure
on the glass and to not damage the
ribbon cable along that bottom of the
display as you're cutting through the
adhesive it's as fragile as paper I'll
fold the screen over gently and unscrew
the two t5 screws holding the silver
bracket over the screen plug it's a
pretty tight connection but it will
unsnap just like a little Lego allowing
us to remove the screen and get a look
at the 12 screws holding the mid frame
to the phone keep these screws organized
and put them back in the holes they come
from all of them are normal Phillips
head screws except for the little guy up
in the top corner that's another t5 I'll
have the tool kits and parts linked in
the video description there's also one
little sliver of silver grounding the
top under that camera remember this
little guy for later join the reassembly
and now we can lift the whole mid frame
up and away from the phone exposing all
of the internal components first thing
we always do is unsnap the battery the
battery replacement itself is
surprisingly easy I'll unplug the
charging port ribbon cable and the
volume ribbon so won't get caught as I
pull up the battery taking special care
not to puncture the battery I can take
the flat end of my metal pry tool and
pop it out gently on both sides there is
some adhesive
but it doesn't have a death grip on the
battery like we've seen inside some
other phones it's a nice change and I
prefer it this way
thumbs up to Google for the easy screen
and battery replacements this is a
repair guys dream the batteries of 2700
milliamp and I'll leave the replacements
linked in the description the phone does
have the same squeezing functions that
we saw in the HTC u 11 grip the size and
activate the Google Assistant kind of a
cool feature if you plan on using it the
grip sensors are down along the bottom
half of the phone so gripping down here
will achieve the best results you can
check out the HTC u 11 video for a more
detailed look at these grip sensors I'm
going to leave them intact on the phone
this time around it's time for the
charging port the port has one screw
holding the board in place with two
circular connected signal wires that
need to be unplugged and detangled and
then the whole thing can pop up away
from the phone body revealing something
surprisingly cool Google took an extra
step towards water resistance that I've
never seen before
they added some kind of dielectric
grease to the rubber ring around the
charging port this is the same stuff
used to waterproof the electronic
connections and a Jeep or other
off-roading vehicle and the same thing
we saw in the underwater drone that I
reviewed a few weeks ago
pretty interesting stuff and surprising
to see inside of a cell phone
I'm impressed the rectangular vibration
motor has some adhesive holding it to
the frame which is smart the bottom
loudspeaker is different than the top
loudspeaker and has the same style of
connection that we saw inside my clear
Nintendo switch video the little
microphone on the other side has a
rubber boot around the edge that sets up
tight against the white water-resistant
screen sitting over the hole next to the
charging port that helps keep water out
jumping up here to the top of the phone
we have the motherboard and the SIM card
tray that needs to come out no
expandable memory on the pixel too but
Google does offer unlimited storage
until the year 2020
after that you'll still get to keep what
you uploaded but anything new you'll
either have to pay for or it gets
compressed into a lower format I took
out one screw along the right side of
the motherboard and another screw by the
metal tape that I told you to remember
earlier and then the whole motherboard
can lift up and away from the frame
still held in place by the fingerprint
scanner ribbon with some yellow tape
over the top I'll remove that tape and
unsnap the ribbon then the motherboard
is free for us to explore the 8
megapixel front-facing camera does not
have oh is and that's fine most
smartphones don't on the front
but the back camera on the other side of
the phone does you can see how it moves
around inside of its housing to
stabilize the image this can also be
replaced and unsnaps just like a little
Lego it reconnects in the same way just
making sure that little tap thing on the
left side of the lens is under the
motherboard
otherwise it won't sit back down at the
right angle pulling down the copper
shielding from the fingerprint scanner
the scanner itself is glued very
securely to the back housing it has its
own layer of water resistance but I
can't push it through from the backside
so replacements are an option if the
software allows it also keep in mind
that opening up your phone even for a
basic screen replacement ruins any water
resistance that might have had before
I'll fold the copper shielding back over
the home button so it doesn't interfere
with the motherboard and I'll set the
motherboard down into the frame so I can
plug in the fingerprint scanner to the
back and then I'll lay it down into the
phone taking special care not to get any
ribbons caught underneath there are two
screws on the right and left sides of
the motherboard and then I'll snap in
the bottom to squeeze sensing ribbons
each of them have their own Lego style
connector that plugs into the
motherboard the charging port is next
with his dielectric grease going back
into the charging port slot and getting
the vibration motor and loudspeaker back
in their own correct positions on the
frame the one little screw next to the
vibration motor on the board will hold
it all in place for now the white signal
wire needs to be plugged in and then
reroute it through the plastics that
hold it in place the black signal wire
as well plug it in first and then tuck
it in the lines where it belongs
the battery goes in place next I'm just
reusing the same gentle adhesive that
was holding it in place the first time
around then I'll plug in the volume and
power buttons as well as the charging
port extension ribbon that comes up from
the bottom of the phone over the battery
and lastly the battery itself gets
plugged into the motherboard
there's one little sensor array attached
to the mid frame that needs to come off
I'll push that off the frame with my
tweezers and then plug it into the
motherboard first leaving the little
niblets standing straight up and down so
it can adhere to the mid frame again
after I set it down into the phone now
the mid frame is in place I will snap it
into the lower frame there will be 12
additional screws sandwiching everything
together in one solid piece there are
also two metallic grounding tape straps
at the top and top left of the phone the
phone's probably fine without it
if you don't wrap them around and touch
the frame but if you're actually going
to use your phone or doing this for a
customer make sure you get those back in
place just in case the replacement
screens will probably come with your own
adhesive
if not simple double-sided tape will do
just fine I'll have some linked in the
video description along with some of the
other replacement parts the screen with
its silver bracket and two screws is
back into place and it's good as new
mostly okay not really but at least it
still works let me know if you have any
questions down in the comments and come
hang out with me on Twitter we have a
pretty good time thanks a ton for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
