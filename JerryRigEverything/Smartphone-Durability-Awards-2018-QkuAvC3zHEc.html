smartphone durability Awards I've tested
quite a few phones this year and most
phones survived my durability test there
are a few that didn't like this iPad pro
it didn't quite make it
now you might correlate jerry-rigged
everything with cell phone destruction
probably because the sound of my razor
blade is that in your brain but in
reality pretty much every single one of
these smartphones survived my durability
test most of these phones are alive even
after the durability test and the
teardown in fact about 40 million people
watch my teardown videos the repair
videos to learn how their phone works
from the inside to see if they can be
repaired and lasts as long as possible
because that's the goal this year we
only had one phone failed completely and
one tablet but were just talking about
phones this time around last year we had
two phones fail and the year before we
had three so smartphone build quality is
improving and I hope my videos have a
little something to do with that the
manufacturers are paying attention
constructing their phones better and
it's a win-win for everyone
people ask what phone is my daily driver
or what phone I use the most often and
currently I'm using the Galaxy S 8 plus
a phone that's about two years old as
the phone that I carry around every day
I legitimately think that smartphones
have been so good for so long that it's
100% not necessary to upgrade every year
every time something new and shiny comes
out because each new upgrade is just
marginal over the previous one but when
it is time to upgrade it's good to
choose a phone that can stand the test
of time and survive as long as you need
it to which brings us to this year's
durability Awards let's start with the
most repairable phone of 2018 to be
totally honest with your 2018 was a
terrible year for smartphone repair
ability pretty much every single one of
the smart phones on this table is glued
shut which is a win and a loss glued
shut usually means that there's water
resistance which helps the phone last
longer which is our goal but it also
means it's harder to repair when that
time comes because screens do crack
glass backs do crack phones get damaged
or batteries wear out and need to be
replaced if I had to pick the
screen replacements of 2018 it would
have to go to the Nokia phones the Nokia
seven-plus and the Nokia 6.1 are
constructed in basically the same way I
ran out of time to make the full
teardown of these phones but basically
the screen lifts off first and there's
just two screws and is done the screen
replacement is finished there's a metal
plate under the screen that stops damage
from happening to the internal
components or puncturing batteries and a
screen replacement can be done in ten
fifteen minutes it's pretty simple
generally speaking with most glass back
sandwich phones like the majority we see
here on the table the screen comes off
last which makes it a little bit harder
but Nokia has a very good design and
kept repairability in mind so the most
repairable smart phones of 2018 go to
Nokia no manufacturer wants their
consumers to get in and repair their
smart phones the longer a customer keeps
their phone means the longer the
manufacturer has to wait before they
come back and buy another one
manufacturer loses money when consumers
repair their phones but there's only one
company that goes above and beyond to
keep the consumer out of their device
and that's Apple which brings us to the
least repairable smartphone of 2018 the
iPhone 10's max yeah the screen can be
replaced which is nice but there's four
different kinds of specialized screws
you need a special tool kit in order to
repair the screen on the 10 s max that's
fine definitely not ideal but survivable
the problem with the 10 s Max and all of
the recent iPhones from this year and
last year is the glass back is
impossible to replace Apple themselves
can't even do it they replace the whole
housing of the phone and charge people
who are out of warranty 599 dollars to
replace the back glass panel if it's
cracked
that's ridiculous with the iPhone 10
offer it is 399 dollars to replace the
back panel but still you can almost buy
a new phone for that this is an
intentional decision on Apple's part
just to get consumers to buy a new phone
instead of repairing the old one and
because of that decision it effectively
earns them the least repairable
smartphone of 2018 congratulations for
example just to prove my point you can
replace the back glass panel on the
Galaxy S 9 for about 17 dollars on
Amazon pretty simple with the LG G 7
it's a little bit more expensive you're
looking around twenty-five or thirty
dollars and with the pixel three your
and right around $100 to replace the
back glass panel all of these are normal
doable sustainable repair prices for
this back glass panel on all these
phones apples price of almost $600 is
downright outrages but you don't get to
be one of the richest companies in the
world by being nice to the consumers
personally I think the die-hard Apple
fans are gonna continue using the
iPhones until they get burned a couple
times and then hopefully apples you know
changes the way they construct their
phones because glass is glass and it
will break eventually which brings us to
the most musical phone of 2018 the
huawei mate 20 pro that's not a real
award I just want to do that again for
the most innovative phone of 2018 it was
a pretty tight race we had a lot of
unique phones coming out this year like
the gaming phones from the razor phone
to to the ROG phone and weird quirky
phones like the red hydrogen one with
its holographic display we even had some
dual screen phones one that folds in
half the acts on em and one with the
built-in screen on the back the new via
X but my favorite phones this year are
the motorized camera phones like the
find X with this camera that pops up out
of the back and my favorite the vivo NEX
s it's motorized camera system is one of
the most innovative things I've seen in
2018 I don't think motorized camera
phones are the way of the future I think
other solutions like under display
cameras or screens on the front of the
back are gonna take over but I'm gonna
enjoy the motorized components while
they're here and the vivo NEX s wins the
most innovative smartphone of 2018 so on
my channel we have a few different
things we do throughout these videos the
one of which is art class with Jerry and
another one as we make smart phones
transparent so the best-looking phone
from the inside this year is got to go
with the pixel 3 with literally no
modifications done to the internals of
the phone just removing the color on the
outside of the glass this is quite
possibly one of the best-looking
transparent phones of all time and
that's without Google even trying to
make a clear phone
yeah the vivo INXS with this motorized
camera looked cool but that one required
a bit more modification than the pixel 3
runners-up for the most beautiful phone
on the inside probably goes to the razor
phone too with its massive water bed
like vapor chamber inside of the phone
obviously the phone still works without
the vapor chamber inside it's just less
efficient
copper and the liquid help keep things
cool for the long-term and while it's
under heavy load from gaming another
runner-up for the most beautiful phone
from the inside would be the LG G 7 this
awesome color you see around the outside
and the frame continues all over the
inside of the device the teardown of
this one was pretty beautiful now let's
get to the most and least durable phones
of 2018 starting with some of the budget
phones the most durable budget phone of
2018 was a hard choice because most
smartphones are good these days and even
budget phones are behaving like
flagships when it comes to durability
personally I feel like a phone with
glass on both sides eliminates itself
from the most durable smartphone because
there's more things that can break so
even though the one plus 60 is an
absolute fantastic phone but because it
has glass on both sides it's not the
most durable phone we have phones like
the poco phone super cheap super
powerful but for the most durable budget
phone of 2018 I'm going back to the
Nokia Linna the nokia 7 plus it's a
pretty big phone not only is it one of
the most repairable phones of 2018 but
it's also one of the most durable with
metal on the back glass on the front but
a pretty much on flexing rigid design
nokia has yet to build a weak smart
phone remember that with budget phones
any smart phone is budget
if you just wait long enough with smart
phones as good as they are even last
year's phones can't compete with this
year's current lineup if you're tight on
cash buying a brand new 2018 flagship is
not a very smart decision it depreciates
very quickly and a phone from last year
or the year before can accomplish the
same thing so you don't feel like you
have to buy the latest and greatest one
thing you don't want to buy though is a
weak smartphone and that brings us to
the least durable phones of 2018
strangely enough huawei had two phones
that cracked during my durability test
they kept functioning so technically
they didn't fail or end up on my shelf
of shame but it's interesting that the
huawei mate 20 pro and the huawei P 20
pro were both phones that cracked during
my durability test no other phone
snapped during the bin test except for
these two the only phone that absolutely
failed though was the up affine 2x this
little guy is the motorized smartphone
with the camera you know that pops up
out of the top but could not hold its
own during the bin test yea the Aqua
find X was one of the most innovative
smart phones of
this year but with how abuse smartphones
are innovation doesn't count for a whole
lot if it can't survive the test of time
one phone that can survive the test of
time though is a newcomer one that I was
not expecting the Kyocera dura force pro
two is the most durable smartphone of
2018 and let me tell you why not only is
a thing feature-rich watertight housing
wireless charging headphone jack but it
also has an almost scratch proof screen
you know how most of these smartphones
basically all of them scratch at a level
six with deeper grooves at level seven
the Kyocera has a sapphire display
meaning that it won't scratch until a
level eight both on the screen and the
rear camera lens the Kyocera dura force
Pro is seriously one of the most premium
lis built rugged phones I've ever seen
and wins the most durable phone of 2018
Kyocera hasn't been a mainstream name up
until now but I'm excited to see what
they have in store for 2019 hopefully
this wasn't just a one-hit wonder 2018
was an awesome year for smart phones a
lot of these designs and features no one
saw coming there was a lot of surprises
and 2019 is gearing up to be the exact
same way we don't know what's in store
hit that subscribe button so you don't
miss any of it and give me a thumbs up
if you're glad that my phones are the
ones being tested and torn down so your
phone can be protected thanks ton for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
