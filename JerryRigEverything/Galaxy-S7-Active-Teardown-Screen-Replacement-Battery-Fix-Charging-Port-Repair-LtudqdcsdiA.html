tearing down the galaxy s7 active this
is the exact same phone that I did my
durability test on and the same phone
that we verified whether the screen was
plastic or glass that's why it's all
cracked up right now I'm gonna turn the
phone off remember that the top layer of
the screen is plastic we are going to
use heat to soften the adhesive between
the screen and the frame of the phone in
order to remove it so make sure not to
get your heat gun too close to the
screen because it'll melt and if you're
only doing a battery replacement and you
want to reuse the screen it's very
important to not damage it so I'm taking
a heat gun you can also use your
mother's hairdryer if it gets hot enough
and I'm heating up the screen until it's
too hot to touch it should only take
about 60 seconds or so you want the heat
to penetrate underneath the plastic
layer underneath the glass layer and
underneath the AMOLED layer now the
screen is warmed up I'm going to take a
thin metal pry tool and slide it between
the rubber edge of the phone and the
glass layer of the screen the screen
does cool down after a while so I'm
going to heat it up again about every 60
seconds good thing I have plenty of
these thin metal pry tools to keep the
screen from Riyadh hearing down to the
frame you can also use a business card
or a playing card this phone is very
similar to the waterproof Galaxy s5 the
screen lifts up the same way you have a
much lower chance of damaging the
buttons though with the galaxy s7 active
as you'll see in a second so now I'm
taking my playing card and slipping it
underneath the AMOLED screen taking very
special care not to hit that bottom edge
corner because that's where the AMOLED
screen is the weakest you can see as I
slide my pry tool down my screen is
already cracked so it's cracking more as
I lift it out of the frame I had zero
expectation that the screen was going to
survive this teardown because of how
little support the glass is giving the
AMOLED display underneath you can see
the glass crack because I was lifted up
out of the frame a little bit softening
the adhesive as I go I did drop the home
button out of the frame that does need
to stay on the frame of the phone as you
lift the screen after about five minutes
of heating and reheating and cutting the
adhesive the screen was ready to lift
out of the frame take very special care
not to damage the top end of the screen
because that's where the ribbon cables
are located that gives signal to the
screen
if you damage those you're just out of
luck there's a little plastic tab
holding down the screen ribbon connector
I'm going to pop that out remember that
the phone is off at this point that's
very very important so this is the
replacement screen I will link the
replacements down in the video
description below as soon as they become
available you probably will need to move
the buttons from your old screen to your
new screen the back end menu buttons
there's a plastic connector over the
home button scanner going to remove that
it is easily replaceable and then
there's one little screw over the
battery connector I'm going to set that
off to the side and then unplug the
battery very important for the rest of
steps then there are 12 screws holding
down this super thick mid frame to the
motherboard we're going to remove that
just popping it out of the plastic frame
and this is attached to the battery the
battery is a four thousand milliamp
battery it is super super thick and very
heavy there are no pull tabs or anything
underneath this where it's going to use
the blunt edge of my pry tool and pop it
out of the frame then you can set your
new battery back down into place if
you're replacing it let's give this
phone a thumbs up for having such a
beastly battery there's one screw
underneath the proximity sensor and then
I'm going to detach the front mic as
well
there's two ribbon cables down here at
the bottom I'm also going to remove the
SIM card tray and then the motherboard
can just pop out of the frame here's the
contact points for the wireless charger
we have the contact points for the
earpiece the headphone jack the side
power buttons down here is the vibrator
and the loudspeaker underneath the
charging port which we'll get to in a
second so here is the motherboard the
front-facing camera pops off like a
little Lego as well as the proximity
sensor has a little Lego connection and
the rear-facing camera also has the same
Lego type connection as the other
components which makes things easily
replaceable so on top here we have the
rear-facing 12 megapixel camera and on
bottom we have the front facing five
megapixel camera you can see that the
rear facing camera does have the OIS
image stabilization where the camera
actually compensates for the motion of
your hand during recording the
front-facing camera does not have OIS
it's pretty easy to attach the cameras
back to the frame again just set them
into place and you'll feel the little
connection clip in
exactly like a little Lego the SIM card
tray is not removable and you can kind
of see the discoloration from the
processor but that's pretty normal with
all smartphones the charging board has
two screws along the bottom then you can
pull it out of the little slot that's
sitting in there is a little rubber ring
around the end of the charging port I'll
show you how to install that on your new
one the loudspeaker is underneath the
charging port so here is the charging
port it also has the back button and
menu buttons built into the charging
port so if one of those buttons are
messed up you'll need to replace the
charging port to fix it it has a
built-in microphone and then the
microUSB charging port has a little
rubber ring around the end of it and
that helps with waterproofing as it
rests against the edge of the plastic
frame we're going to pop that back in
and then put the two black screws in
along the bottom to hold it tight now
the charging port connects to the bottom
of the motherboard but it's on the back
of the motherboard so it's important to
clip it in before you set the
motherboard into place it's the same
design as the Galaxy s6 and the note
phones we're going to set the
motherboard into place making sure that
there's nothing being pinched underneath
the bottom edge of it there's one screw
at the top underneath the proximity
sensor that we're going to screw in the
SIM card tray can set into place and
then we're going to connect these wire
cables just position them over the top a
little circle doohickey and then press
them down into place then the thick mid
frame and the battery gets set down into
place on top of the motherboard you can
hear it satisfyingly click in as you
press it into place I'm not going to
connect the battery yet I'm going to
make sure all of these 12 screws are
screwed in and then I'm going to connect
the home button cable and put a little
plastic connector over the top of this
so it doesn't come loose now I can
connect the battery take very very
special care not to turn on the phone as
you're connecting the screen having
power through that connection as you're
connecting it could be very bad for your
new screen taking care not to touch the
power button and clip your new screen
into place I'm just using my old screen
the same broken one as before because
the new screens are not available yet
and to my surprise the thing actually
still works I had zero expectations that
this thing was going to survive most
phones have a glass digitizer the part
that senses your touch and so if you
crack that it doesn't sense your touch
anymore in the screen breaks but this
phone could very well have a plastic
digitizer like the Droid turbo to your
new screen will probably have a
adhesive on the bottom of it so remove
the protection over the adhesive and set
it down into place and you should be
good to go make sure the home button
lines up through the hole in the screen
and pinch everything down into place if
you've liked what you've seen so far go
ahead and at that subscribe button that
does help me out a lot and helps me keep
making repair videos far into the future
if you haven't broken your current phone
you might break your next one and
hopefully I'll already have a video for
it if you have any questions make sure
to leave them in the comments below I do
respond fairly regularly thank you so
much for watching and hope to see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
