me 6
you might remember its predecessor that
Xiaomi me 5 from last year it ended up
on my shelf of shame with some other
weak smartphones that I've tested in the
past so let's hope that Xiaomi has
implemented my suggestions from last
year's video and designed a more solid
me 6 device this year let's get started
right out of the box I'm already a fan
of this phone's design incredibly glossy
and very very black it feels heavy and
cold in my hands which is something that
my mind instantly associates with
quality xiaomi calls this phone splash
resistant but they don't give it an IP
rating so if it survives my durability
test i'll open it up and see how
water-resistant it really is compared to
the samsung's or new iPhones as with all
of my durability tests let's start with
the scratch test my most picks help us
test the screen for plastic or for
screens with inferior glass that would
scratch at level three or four and be
damaged by keys and coins on some rare
occasions we'll get to see the ultra
premium materials like sapphire on the
HTC u ultra the scratched at level 8
normal phones with tempered or Gorilla
Glass will scratch at level 6 fun fact
my me 5 durability video from last year
has been viewed by 2 million people but
only 3 percent of those views are from
inside the United States the xiaomi
brand is much more popular outside the
US than inside the glass scratch at a
level 6 which means keys and coins will
have no effect on the display and it is
pretty durable this is on par with other
flagships and is actually pretty
impressive because the me 6 is about
half the price of a galaxy s 8 next
comes the fingerprint scanner
since cellphones are usually bumping
around in your pants pocket or jiggling
around inside of a purse sometimes the
home button can get scratched luckily
for the me 6 though the scanner is
hidden under a glass layer which means
it is scratch resistant to most objects
including my razor blade it does not
appear to be ceramic though like the me
mix since there are marks from my level
6 and 7 picks ceramic won't scratch
until level 8 the 8 megapixel front
facing camera is covered by the screen
glass so it is protected and the metal
earpiece it's completely flat with the
surface of the screen giving a flush
clean look to the phone hopefully this
will also help keep dirt out of the
speaker grille since there is no lip to
get caught in now xiaomi does have a
deluxe version of the me 6 that comes
with a ceramic back i just have the
regular version though with a rear glass
panel even with just the glass my razor
blade does no damage at all to the sleek
surface or the me logo the me 6 has 2 12
megapixel rear face
cameras similar to the iPhone 7 plus
setup one is a regular lens and the
other has a two times optical zoom so
you can take zoomed in pitchers with no
image quality loss this is actually a
pretty cool feature and I found myself
using it regularly on the iPhone 7 plus
when I was testing it out for a few
months I would like to see it on more
phones lucky for the me six everything
is covered with that glass even the
two-tone flash so that definitely gives
a thumbs up from me now one of the main
problems I had with me five was the
inferior metal alloy that was used for
the phone body the lightweight cheap
metal and lack of internal mid frame
allowed the phone to snap in half
completely during my bend test
but within me six my razor blade is able
to scratch the surface of the metal but
unable to carve out any shavings on the
metal itself it is much harder the phone
has an IR blaster at the top which can
be used as a remote control that's
pretty cool it almost makes up for the
lack of upgradable storage the dual SIM
card tray is metal but the phone does
not allow SD card memory expansion kind
of a bummer physically I was pretty
impressed with this phone right up until
I realized there are not enough holes it
is missing the headphone jack entirely
I'm definitely not a fan of removing
still relevant and useful features from
cell phones like I said earlier Xiaomi
does claim the phone as flat proof and
I'm sure removing the headphone jack
made sealing the phone much easier for
them while keeping the price low it does
have a USB C port though so that's good
Femi 6 has a 5.1 inch 1080p IPS LCD
display this means that the flame from
my lighter kills the pixels after about
10 seconds the me 5 had a reaction after
4 seconds so show me more than doubled
their apocalyptic response time in all
seriousness though this phone might just
have thicker glass or a more durable LCD
it's hard to say for sure but
considering this phone has a 31% weight
increase over the me 5 it's probably
using better materials
let's admire the design for just a
second in case is the last time we get
to see this phone in one piece the me
six has four-sided curved glass the
glass doesn't just wrap around and fold
on one side like on the s8 it literally
curves in every direction top bottom
and right which does make for a pretty
darn good looking phone and now for the
bin test applying pressure to the back
glass yields a small flex in the device
but nothing permanent and nothing
catastrophic the phone is still 100%
functional bending from the display side
of the phone has the same effect noting
the phone returns to its original shape
this device is an absolute winner when
it comes to build quality an incredibly
massive improvement over last year's me
five and it could very well be the new
king in the realm of inexpensive
flagships I'm definitely not a fan of
removing the headphone jack or the
sdcard slot but when it comes to
durability this thing is a champion if
you enjoyed watching the major quality
improvement from the me 5 to the me 6
hit that subscribe button subscribing is
totally free and helps me continue to
make videos like this in the future come
hang out with me on Instagram and
Twitter and together we'll make sure all
devices in the future have a solid build
quality thanks for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
