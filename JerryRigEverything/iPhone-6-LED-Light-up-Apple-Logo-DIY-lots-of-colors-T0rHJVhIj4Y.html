remove the old boring logo from your
iPhone 6 and replace it with a light-up
logo similar to an Apple laptop or
macbook here's the part itself I will
link the part and all of the tools down
in the video description so check that
out most of the instructions are in
Chinese so I'll try to translate as best
as I can and walk you through the
process
remember the iPhone 6 warranties have
mostly expired so only attempt this if
you have nothing to lose you are 100%
responsible for what you do with your
own phone here's the pentalobe
screwdriver there are two screws down at
the bottom I'm going to unscrew those
then lift up on the screen using a
suction cup and a plastic pry tool only
pry up on the edge of the screen and the
edge of the phone damaging your screen
is a real possibility with this so go as
slow as possible and be very careful
there's two screws down by the charging
port take off that metal plate and then
unplug the battery make sure not to bend
the screen past 90 degrees or you will
damage those ribbon cables once this
plate is off with those five screws you
are able to unsnap the four ribbon
cables from the motherboard these are
held on just like little Legos make sure
you only use a plastic pry tool like the
one I am using to remove these from the
phone the battery is held in with two
adhesive strips and we do need to remove
it so peel up the edge of these little
tabs and give them a little pull they
are pretty fragile mine broke once
luckily I was left with enough room to
grab it and pull it out the rest the way
if these tabs break on you you will need
to pry out the battery which is fairly
dangerous make sure you never ever ever
ever use any metal object while trying
to pry out your battery if you end up
puncturing it it will damage your phone
and maybe you too
you can see our rubbery the adhesive
strips are after they come out of the
device pull out that second pull tab the
iPhone six-plus will have three pull
tabs now the battery is out we have
access to this metal logo it is stuck
down pretty tightly I managed to use my
tweezers and leverage it out of that
back hole be very careful with the top
part of the logo because it's underneath
that wire cable and you need to leave
that intact as it is pretty vital to
your phone's function remove the logo
plate itself and you can see that now
there is nothing between the inside of
the phone and the outside here is the
light-up logo we're going to go ahead
and put that in place you'll feel it
kind of click in is the logo sticks
through the backside of the phone it
does sit completely flush and it has a
plastic feel to it to keep the battery
in place I am putting down two little
adhesive strips it's double-sided tape
set the battery down where it lines up
right with little plug where you
unplugged it from now here's the
important part
there's this little piece of tape over
these solder pads you want to scrape off
any tape residue but be very careful you
don't actually damage the solder itself
use a plastic pry tool you can also
clean it off with a little bit of
isopropyl alcohol don't use too much
though you don't want to get any liquid
down in the screen do not use any kind
of water or liquid cleaner because that
will damage it I'm going to plug in the
screen before I attach the LED light-up
logo make sure that all of these little
connections are very snug if you end up
with squares or lines or a black screen
it's because these connections aren't
tight so unplug them and reconnect them
I'm taking the little wire from the logo
and tucking it underneath the metal
plate and then using the black
electrical tape to put over the top of
the wire and hold it in place there's
two little foam pads there as well and
this will help use the pressure from the
battery to push the wire and hold it in
place while it's plugged in next thing
you're going to take that metal plate
and get those five screws back into
place along with the two screws next to
the battery that hold the battery
connector in and then line up the top of
the screen first with the edge of the
frame of the phone and then snap it down
into place using your fingers all the
way down along the side and there you go
any time you press the power button the
logo will light up and it will dim along
with the screen as well so whatever your
screen brightness is is how bright the
logo is going to be have any questions
leave down the comments don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and if you're super bored
follow me on Twitter and Instagram I'd
love to see you around thanks for
