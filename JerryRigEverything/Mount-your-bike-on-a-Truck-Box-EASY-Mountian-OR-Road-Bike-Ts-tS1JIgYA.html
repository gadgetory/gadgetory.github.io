a mountain bike onto the back of my
truck toolbox I have this little
mounting bracket right here that we're
going to screw in to the top of the box
I'm going to show you how to make it
secure and also how this guy works this
way I can have my mountain bike sitting
in the back of my truck and not worry
about laying it over it just could be
more secure for long rides as well so
what you're going to need for this
project is the mount itself I got this
guy off of Amazon I'm going to go ahead
and link that down in the video
description it's right below this video
so if you want to buy one of these go
ahead and check that link first then I
have some m6 bolts some m6 nuts and then
some locking washers that are going to
help you know keep it tight though nuts
to the bolts then I also have a sheet of
metal that I'm going to cut and then I'm
going to cut again lengthwise and this
is going to be bolted on underneath with
the mount so that if there's ever any
Rocky motion with the bike it's not just
going to have the thin top metal of the
truck box it's also going to have this
metal to help support it if it ever
rocks left and right we're going to get
some clear sealer and with this clear
sealer you're going to put it in between
the top of the mount and the truck box
that way water and stuff will never leak
inside your truck box and the fuch box
itself won't rust first thing you want
to do is line up your bike we're going
to want to mount it / mentally I like
having my wheel in between the wheel
well which is this guy right here on my
truck as well as the tailgate so I can
have the tailgate all the way closed and
have you know space to move the bike
around a little bit I also like having
this little space right here for the
extra wheel on the side so I can leave
my truck open to have you know carry
other things that I need so that is the
tentative place where I'm going to mount
my bike I don't have anything bolted in
yet so I'm going to go ahead and take a
pencil and just kind of mark the outline
where I want right here and where the
bolts are going to go once I drill down
through the top of my toolbox I also
chose farther up on the lid of the truck
box because when the lid is going to be
open they're still going to be room
between the mount and the window if I
were to do it farther down I wouldn't be
able to open my truck box
and have it not touch the window at the
same time so closer to the lip of the
toolbox is better so when choosing a
drill bit you want to make sure that the
drill bit is going to cover the entire
bolt so that there's no threads popping
up on either side that way the threads
won't catch when it goes inside of the
hole
and that is it just going to clean up
this edge around here and this stuff
will dry clear so there's not too big of
a worry about that and I'll scrape off
the excess that we don't need and fill
in the gaps of that you need the really
nice thing about this bike mount is that
not only does it fit my mountain bike
but it also fits my street bike do any
questions make sure to leave in the
comments down below don't create the
like of this video helped you and don't
forget to subscribe thanks for watching
to deter thieves a little bit you can
probably stick cable through here and
then up and around through the main part
of your frame and that would keep people
from stealing your bike a little bit but
at the same time you know they can still
unbolt this bottom part and walk away
with your bike so this isn't like a long
term you know storage solution but it is
really nice be able to transport your
bike
