Note 2 this particular version is from
Sprint so it's the L 900 resin has a
version as well I think it's the I 605
I'm not sure what other carriers carry
the the Galaxy Note 2 anyway ticket
parts pretty simple there's 11 screws on
the back all surrounding the outside
these are other screws
so my fast-forward me taking those out
save a little bit of time
to remove the screen itself just take
your non marring tool and kind of just
slide it around the outside of frame I
went around the whole frame first just
to kind of unclip everything you can
hear the little clip snapping out as you
go around and then once it's all
loosened up you can just kind of pry it
up with the with the pry tool there's no
tape or anything holding this down it's
just all about clips so it's not too bad
once you get the clips undone
there's two clips inside the battery
case as well one at the very bottom in
the middle so I just snap up right there
then the other one is a slightly harder
one up at the top kind of where the
battery connects in it's right there
next to my tool this one kind of gave me
a little bit of problems try pulling it
back with a pair of tweezers but I
didn't work either what I ended up doing
is kind of pushing down through where
the SD card was and getting it out from
that other angle I'll show you that here
in a second
just loosened up the top a little more
to be able to slide it out there's a
little bit
rubber like a rubber washer type thing
around the headphone jack
that kind of came into play later
anyways that's how I got to snap undone
for the right above the battery there's
these two little rubber washers it also
popped out they'll just snap onto the
back plastic pretty simple anyway here's
the guts of the phone there are two wire
cables and I believe there are six
ribbon cables and I'll show you what
those are all out I'm just making sure
the phone itself is pretty sturdy and
it's not like taking apart an iphone or
something where the cables really easily
I might actually like the design of this
phone a lot particularly what we're
taking part right now is just the the
speaker the loudspeaker for the back
that housing comes off pretty simply and
then right here you have the charging
port cable which i think is an awesome
idea because the charging port is one of
the things that goes out on the phone
the most and so with its own little
circuit board if your charging port goes
out it's a really simple fix that anyone
can do I just detached the ribbon cable
right there and then this one is stuck
down a little bit of the double-sided
tape at the bottom so you say I peel it
up and then if the ad ever breaks that's
all you got to replace for example part
so this wire cable right here drops down
to the charging port so there is one of
the ribbon cables there's two three
Northland is right there for the
headphone jack and then this is the
other ribbon cable that slides down to
the other circuit board on the left side
next to the stylus and there's one screw
holding your motherboard down that was
it
there's the fifth ribbon cable then the
motherboard itself just lifts right off
the camera sometimes kind of holds it in
place
just kind of jiggle the camera around
and then you can pull the whole assembly
out in one piece
and there is
table number six right next the top of
the stylus
so to reassemble the board I got to do
is take it slide it in make sure the
camera falls into the right spot and
make sure although the ribbon cables are
up and out of the way
and you press it down just kind of
lifting that ribbon cable up and over
the board
wire cable down on this side is down to
the board as well so I'm going to grab
that pull it up the top
then the wire cables they snap down you
know pretty easily just right over the
little little nub that they were
attached to before so kind of got to
clip them down into place then the
ribbon cables they also snap in um it
takes a little bit of pressure to it
it's kind of like a Lego piece and
you'll definitely feel it click in once
it goes down you just don't press too
hard if you know it's not going to click
into place it's only got one way to fit
so snap all those down remember there's
six of them all around the outside
pressing that cable down it helps if you
have a non marring tool with the pry
tool like I have right here just kind of
focuses the pressure onto it helps it
click in
so helping the last ribbon cable on cane
that one screw back onto the motherboard
charging cord
back into place just kind of stick it
down on top of the tape that was before
and there should still be enough you
know sticky stuff left on it if you're
replacing that part you can get the
double-sided sticky tape on Amazon like
five four or five bucks it's not too bad
let's get in place now the ribbon cable
down
reattaching over your speaker that it
kind of clips into place just a little
bit but then you gotta take that one
screw and screw it back in and that'll
hold it tight take the back cover snap
it into place and see this is where that
rubber washer or the rubber you know
covering around that headphone jack came
into play so everything snaps on really
easily exactly the way it was before
except for right around the headphone
jack because the rubber was kind of bent
up out of place so I eventually had to
do is I kind of just ran my non wiring
tool around the top of it and kind of
peeled the screen back up again just
like this and just kind of press the
rubber part back into place where it was
before then once I was done with that I
could snap the back cover on and it was
exactly like it was you couldn't even
tell it had been opened
take the two rubber washers from the
back and just pop those back into places
clip right in
then you have
eleven screws that go around the outside
fast-forward this again
there we go
pop batter in turn it on make sure it
works
I started take apart the Galaxy S no 2
pretty much all the Samsung phones are
relatively the same they'll have the
same you know setup with the motherboard
ribbon cables everything clips on easy
screws HTC F HTC phones and iPhones are
a lot harder to take apart they might
have any questions make sure leave in
