it's got the super high-pitched whiny
little horn we're gonna we're going to
fix that today so I got the front guru
off basically it's just some little tabs
up here at the front and every car is
going to be a little bit different no
screws were holding mine on just the
just the tabs anyway so here's the horn
a little high-pitched guy I'm I recently
just bought this it's the low tone horn
so hopefully it sounds a little bit
better than the high tone one does so
now let's just switch it out take off
that bolt up there at the top it looks
like that might be the only connection
on this one
we'll see you when I get it off so with
the on my truck there's only one wire
that comes out of it and it had this
connector right here on it there's the
one wire so with the horn what it says
to do is take one of the connections
because there's two connections on the
horn and ground it out so I attach it to
the bolt right underneath it which in
turn attaches to the car so that's the
ground and then the other one comes the
connector and attached one of the
supplied connectors with the with the
package to that and that just clips on
the extra horn so once it's attached and
grounded the horn should work just fine
so now we test it out there we go to
change the horn on a in any vehicle
pretty much those things are pretty
universal
