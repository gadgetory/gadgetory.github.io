guys this tree it's so fluffy so I was
really excited to take you guys to this
awesome Lake my truck ended up getting
stuck about a mile back on the super
snowy road I thought I could make it but
you can see the road here and the snow
is about four five feet deep on top of
the road so I've been hiking for the
last mile or so I think the lake is just
around this corner let's keep our
fingers crossed I did a poll on Twitter
a couple days ago asking which phones I
should test in my next video you guys
voted for the Galaxy s7 edge and the
lumia 950xl
we're gonna have a flagship Android
phone versus a flagship Windows Phone
both of these phones are completely
stock settings everything is on auto
because we're going to do a video test
between the two of them we're going to
start off with the 4k drop down to 1080p
do the front-facing cameras and then
finish off with some slow motion so the
things you always want to look out for
are the image stabilization and the
color quality both of these cameras the
galaxy s7 and the lumia 950xl
have the OIS image stabilizing on the
rear cameras so both of these 4k images
should be pretty stable the lumia 950xl
also let me enable some digital image
stabilization which is the same thing as
that E is that the Nexus 6p has it takes
that oh is the hardware image
stabilization and doubles up on it with
the EIS we're going to take this 4k
image and zoom in on those snowmobile
tracks up at the top of the mountain
that's pretty insane remember that both
of these cameras are mounted to the same
rig which will give us that same
stabilization on both of them here's
some close-up of the rocks one more
thing we can check the white balance as
we move up to the clouds
get a lens flare in there so now we're
in 1080p usually the phones have a
little bit better time stabilizing while
we're doing this which is perfect
because I'm walking in snow now again so
we'll check the image quality as I'm
walking we'll run for a second found a
cool rock for us to look at it seems
like the lumia 950xl tries to go in and
out of focus a lot more than the galaxy
s7 so now we're doing the front facing
camera the galaxy s7 is going to be a
little bit bigger of an image but the
lumia 950xl even though is shooting at
1080p does give me the option to do an
image stabilizing digitally so we'll see
the kind of quality between the two
because the galaxy s7 edge doesn't have
any image stabilization on the
front-facing camera so it might not be
as good as save the HTC 10 with the OIS
on the front facing camera but at least
it has something it'll be interesting to
compare these two when they're back on
my computer headphone quality I'm
probably the only person on this
mountain for literally 20 miles right
now I don't think there's anybody else
anywhere for the slow-motion test I was
gonna get in the lake and flip my hair
like you see all those girls do at the
swimming pool you know in those
Instagram pictures but then I realized
two things one the lake is frozen and
two I don't have any air so I got to
think of something else to do for that
slow motion test for the slow motion the
galaxy s7 shoots in 240 frames per
second while the Microsoft Lumia XL only
shoots in 120 frames per second so the
galaxy s7 is going to be twice as slow
as the Lumia so we double the frame rate
we're gonna have to give the slow motion
win
to the galaxy s7 but not everybody uses
flowmotion
like I mentioned in my last video beauty
is in the eye of the beholder and that's
where you guys come into play I'm going
to leave a poll up in the corner that
you guys can answer and say which phone
was better the microsoft lumia 950xl
or the galaxy s7 edge and then leave a
comment down below why you think that
camera did better take into effect the
color the stabilization and the overall
quality of the camera I'm going to go
ahead and hike back to my truck and hope
that I can wiggle it out of the
snowdrift that I'm stuck in so while I'm
getting my truck unstuck you guys should
check out my Nexus 5x verse the iPhone
se video and my HTC 10 verse the galaxy
s7 edge video and if you're super bored
and I'm still stuck you can check out
the durability video for the s7 edge and
the lumia 950xl
I've done durability tests on a bolt
thanks ton for watching see you again in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
