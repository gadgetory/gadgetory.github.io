phone and it's rather interesting
designed by Tesla of course this
normally costs about forty five US
dollars but it's completely sold out at
the moment it's interesting that inside
the box this Tesla charger comes with
very specific instruction to not
disassemble or repair it so I think it's
time to disassemble and repair it let's
get started this particular charger
comes with the Lightning port for
iPhones and a detachable microUSB for
all those Android phones from 2015
maybe Tesla will ship a USBC donal for
their next batch of chargers for the
more modern Android phones the black
surface is made from plastic and the
silver protrusion mimicking a
cylindrical battery is made from a thin
metals getting inside this thing is
rather difficult and actually involved a
breaking some of the plastics it's not
designed to be opened up once inside we
get our first glimpse of the 18 650
lithium-ion cell with a 3300 milliamp
capacity this is the same exact battery
found inside many of the Model S and
Model X Tesla vehicles except for you
know there's thousands of batteries
inside those cars and this phone charger
just has one two screws hold in place
both circuit boards on either side of
the battery and the whole contraption
can pull away from inside the plastic
housing the neon green battery itself is
soldered on to the main board with leads
headed to each of the terminals on each
side of the battery the copper wire
strung up the side is probably for the
temperature sensor these 18 650
batteries are actually extremely common
and can be purchased in bulk from Amazon
or Ebay for really cheap so from a
repairability standpoint if you can
solder this thing can be replaced I'll
plug it into a power source and we could
see the green LED at the end start
flashing indicating that the lithium-ion
battery is charging I'll plug that
microUSB port into one of my Nokia
phones and we have power it's definitely
not the biggest power bank and probably
more of a collector's item than anything
but it's still cool that the same
technology charging your cell phone is
powering some of the coolest
and fastest cars on the planet I'll go
ahead and plop the singular cell back
into the plastic housing to restore the
plastic housing back to the perfect
condition I'd need some glue since the
plastic tabs holding this closed weren't
meant to be opened and broke off during
my intrusion I'll toss a link in the
description for these Tesla power banks
when they become available again would
you ever get one or would you rather
save your money and just buy the whole
car I'm still trying to get my hands on
a real test letter teardown I'll keep
you updated on Twitter and thanks a ton
for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
