days and the violence isn't over just
yet it's time to take it apart and
review the switch from the inside
remember don't ever attempt this on your
own device unless it's totally broken
and you have no other options I'll be
linking all available repair parts in
the video description so let me know if
you need something specific let's get
started
for the past few consoles Nintendo has
been using their own proprietary try
point screw on the back panel and the
switch is no exception for try point
screws along the backside and five
Phillips head screws along the side rail
and then the metal joy conrail can
detach from the console but be careful
with it and don't pull it off completely
just yet I'll show you why in just a
second the bottom has two screws also
Phillips head and the two little circles
next to the screw is our Guiding post
for the USB C port inside of the dock
super smart because that will put less
stress on the charging port when it's
docked helping it last longer
now I accidentally snapped my other joy
Conrail off the console in my last video
but normally this would have five screws
holding it in place as well just pretend
they're there lastly one screw along the
top next to the heat bin the cooling
system on this thing is actually pretty
sweet I'll show you more of that once we
get inside the kickstand is covering the
last little screw and once that's
removed the whole back panel can be
pulled off the Nintendo switch console
interesting that this particular device
has never been open before yet there are
still fingerprints all over the place
really not that important but it is
interesting to see a human had to
assemble this at some point the SD card
tray that is hidden by the kickstand is
here and it's 100% modular with one
screw holding it in and the same Lego
light connection that we've seen on
pretty much every cell phone there are
six more normal Phillips head screws
along the inside of this back metal
panel then you can remove the metal
plate from the console now this metal
plate is interesting on two levels one
it's got a series of foam pads along the
back to keep the separation from the
circuits and icky vibrations to a
minimum and it's also got the largest
glob of thermal paste that I've ever
seen inside of a mobile unit but it
makes sense when we finally get a look
at the size of this heat pipe this heat
pipe is used to wick away heat from the
main processor which is the hottest and
hardest-working component inside any
computer or gaming system like this so
the heat goes in two directions the
first is due to large blob of thermal
paste right into the large silver metal
backing and the second is through the
copper heat pipe along the fan and
spitting out the top of the device I'll
remove that heat pipe and look at that
in just a second I'll disconnect the
battery first which is smart practice
any time you work on anything electronic
I did warm up the screen for a second to
try to soften it a super strong adhesive
under the battery since this will
probably be a repair people want to
attempt in a few years when their own
batteries start dying this is normally
not good for the battery and is actually
pretty dangerous if you use
metal tool I wish Nintendo would have
used the magic adhesive pull-tabs that
we see in most cell phones these days
these pull tabs cost pennies to
manufacture and make repairs so much
easier and safer for repair guys like
myself
maybe next time Nintendo the battery is
pretty large capacity at 4300 milliamp
hours remember how I said earlier to be
gentle with these side rails there's a
small ribbon cable that goes to the
mainboard and this is what will be
charging your joy cotton controller so
if this breaks so does the charger to
your controller and you know the
controllers are kind of important there
are dual speakers at the bottom of the
game system these fire out through the
holes below the front screen and the
USBC port is here in the center soldered
onto the mainboard
keeping your screw organized there are
three more here I'm pulling out the game
cartridge slot and the headphone jack
they are on the same circuit board
there's a large ribbon cable attached to
the top each ribbon connector has a
locking latch that lifts up to unlock
and then the ribbon cable can slide out
then the board also has a Lego type
connector under the heat pipe that
unsnaps
this thing looks pretty sweet and now
you know if multiple games stopped being
read player consoles this guy's probably
the culprit and needs to be replaced if
all else fails you might be able to
digitally download your games to the
console this is what I did with the
Zelda game that I'm currently playing
let's get rid of some more screws there
are three screws holding down the copper
heat pipe just over the processor try to
keep the thermal paste intact as long as
it's not dry and crusty you can probably
just reuse it if it's all dried up you
can probably just reapply some normal
thermal paste that we find on Amazon
I'll try to link some in the video
description there's a bunch more screws
on the main board into place remember to
keep these organized your life will be
easier if you do the other droidcon rail
is plugged into the side of the
motherboard unlatch the lock and the
ribbon can slide out the speakers can be
found in the bottom corners of the
Nintendo switch and the interesting
thing is is that the speaker con is made
from the same rubber material that we
saw inside the Apple earpods so while
the Nintendo switch itself is not
waterproof if any liquid accidentally
falls into the speaker slots the
speakers themselves can survive Nintendo
did use quality speaker material the
water damage indicator is right here
next the corner of the battery and then
we released the large ribbon that sits
right below where the cartridge used to
be and finally the beastly heat pipe can
be removed this helps wick heat away
from the processor without this the
system might overheat and turn off if
you remember I use a thermal imaging
camera on my LG g6 teardown to see if
the
to actually work and they do and this
heat pipe is even bigger than the ones
we've seen inside of other smartphones
it's even got fins up at the top to let
the air flow through and let it cool
down faster just a few more things to
unplug like the volume and power ribbon
and the sand ribbon I'll show you more
on these in just a second one more wire
cable on the left side and then this
little guy right here is extremely
interesting this is the built-in memory
for the device and it looks like it's
replaceable normally phones and tablets
have their memory soldered directly onto
the mainboard and it looks like this
system might be able to upgrade and hold
more memory in the future it will be
easy for a Nintendo to start selling
larger capacity switches because none of
the board schematics would have to
change if the memory is swappable like
this just plug the new memory in and
you're good to go
finally here is the mainboard the brains
of the device the charging port is
directly soldered in place and not
replaceable unfortunately but I imagine
that the dock is pretty sturdy so wear
and tear on the port should be minimal
but even then it would be nice to see
replaceable charging port like we have
on most cell phones these days the last
thing that come out of the frame is the
fan with its three screws this fan
coupled with the large copper heat pipe
and heatsink should do a pretty good job
of keeping the tablet cool especially
since it's only running at 720p when
it's not docked the super long ribbon
cable at the top is for the volume and
power button and then there is this last
joy conrail on the side that we
unplugged earlier now the screen the
exterior plastic layer and the LCD layer
are not glued to each other like we see
on most cell phones they are actually
independent components like on an iPad
but they are glued to the console itself
it has not been easy to find replacement
parts for a Nintendo products in the
past but if I do find replacement
screens they'll be linked in the video
description you'll need to use heat to
separate the screen from the frame and
then the new screen will have its own
adhesive I personally want to play zelda
later though so i'm going to leave my
screen intact for now it's time to
reassemble this thing and see if it
still works when I put it back together
putting it back together should be
easier than taking it apart if you kept
your screws organized fan goes in first
then the motherboard gets set into place
charging port in first making sure no
ribbons or wires are stuck onto the
board when you set it down into the
frame everything has its own slot to
slide into like the speakers
I'll get the fan ribbon cable tucked
into the slot and the volume ribbon
tucked into its slot and make sure that
they're both locked down at their little
latches the larger ribbon is the same
deal
flip it in
lock it down then the cartridge and
headphone jack board can get plugged in
with a little Lego light connector
you'll feel it click into place and the
heat pipe gets set down Grill side first
and the three screws hold it snug
against the processor remember if your
thermal paste is super crusty you might
want to glob some new stuff on if your
console is overheating or something
click on rails get put into place and
latch down make sure to have a good
connection before latching it in place
ribbon cable that plugs into the
cartridge gets flipped in and latch down
and then the other droidcon rail gets
lined up along the side and the two
ribbon cables at the bottom near the
speaker get tucked into place and latch
down like the rest of them set down the
black plastic bracket over the headphone
jack and then we can set the 4300
milliamp battery back into place and
plug it in
I'm just reusing the same adhesive as
before but if you buy a new battery it
will probably come with its own adhesive
get the rest of your motherboard screws
into place assuming you had them all
organized this should be relatively easy
another interesting thing is that this
black tape on the metal backing this is
a super cheap way to keep the silver
from shining through with the little
grill slots on the back of the console
pretty cost-effective way of keeping the
controller looking clean and blacked out
and a final screw next to the SD card
slot after you finish plugging that into
the mainboard like a little Lego and to
fixing the foam pad over the top of the
connector the foam pad will help it keep
from accidentally disconnecting if it's
ever dropped the back plastics can fall
into place at this point with one screw
at the top of the console two more
screws at the bottom and five screws on
either side of the Vice all these are
your normal Phillips head screws and
lastly four screws along the back with
the little guy underneath the kickstand
as well and it looks like everything
works I can keep playing Zelda now at
least until I take apart joy Kahn
controllers to see how they work this
poor system has been through quite a lot
and it keeps on chugging I'm pretty
impressed my name's Graham followers got
to watch me stream this teardown live on
Instagram we just hung out and talked
for about an hour as I took this thing
apart for the video follow me over there
if you want to jump in and chat during
the next teardown thanks ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
