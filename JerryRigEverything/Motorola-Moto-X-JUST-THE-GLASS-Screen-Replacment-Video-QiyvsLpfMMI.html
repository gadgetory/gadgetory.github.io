am replacing just the glass on it so
I've already gone through and I've taken
off the shattered screen just by heating
it up to ninety degrees Celsius and then
kind of just taking the a razor blade
and sliding it very very very gently
underneath the glass and pulling off
each little shard you can try to use a
wire piece if you want to slide
underneath the glass but the way the
frame sits it doesn't allow the wire to
come out through that back side so
basically what I've done now that the
glass is out glass is also to wide when
I set it over the top the glass is too
wide to fit inside of the frame because
the frame allows the glass to get tucked
up underneath each little side so
basically which is it's a little bit
different than all of the Galaxy series
which is what I'm used to fixing up to
this point anyway what I found out is if
you pop the back cover off you can take
each of these little there's little pins
inside of there that hold the white
plastic onto the phone itself so I'm
just going through and popping each of
those little pins out this one's my next
one right there and that'll will release
the plastic frame so that I can tuck the
glass up inside of it and then put it
back down on the phone again there are
also two screws down at the bottom that
hold it in it's a t4 kind of a pentalobe
type screw and then once those two
screws are out and all those little pins
are out then you can pop off that frame
as you can see the glass still the phone
still works without the glass in place
so you know the digitizer and the LCD
are still fine anyway so I'm going to
take that glass go ahead and pop it in
to the front side of this now that it's
a little more pliable since it's outside
of the phone and then once it's in I
should be able to pop it right back down
on top
the phone and have it work the glass
itself is just a little bit too big for
the frame so what I went ahead and did
is I broke this bottom corner right here
so that I would be able to fit inside
all of the edges so once I get it tacked
back onto the phone again as far as like
the white frame goes I'm going to put a
dab of super glue right there on the end
to hold it together and keep the dust
out of it so I'm go ahead and clean the
underside of the glass and clean the LCD
on the phone and then plop it right back
on top and I'm going to take some
double-sided sticky tape which is this
stuff right here and put it right here
to kind of help adhere the the glass
down to the phone there we go
screens work in way better than the
cracked one before I tried to put a
little dab of super glue right there on
that corner I mean it bled underneath
the screen just a little bit but that
doesn't affect any of the functionality
of it anyway so it's not perfect you
know it's not it's not like factory but
it definitely is a lot cheaper to
replace just the glass itself not bad
for a twenty dollar repair it's a lot
better than buying the whole LCD unit
for about 250 online anyway if you any
