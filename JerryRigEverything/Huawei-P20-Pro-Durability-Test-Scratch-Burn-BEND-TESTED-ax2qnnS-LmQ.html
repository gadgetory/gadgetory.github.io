with some pretty solidly constructed
phone since the Nexus 6p failure back in
the day the May 10 Pro I tested earlier
this year passed with flying colors it's
time to see if this newest phone from
Huawei the triple camera p20 Pro
flagship is a survivor let's get started
inside the box we get the charging cable
headphones with a USBC connector and the
international wall charger since this
particular phone isn't coming to USA
I'll update the video description if
that changes in the future initial
impressions are the phone is thick and
solid feeling right out of the box just
how it should be we'll start with the
scratch test laying out my Mohs hardness
scale if you remember this tells us what
hardness level the screen is plastic
would be a level-3 tempered glass is
level 6 and sapphire would be a level 8
diamonds of course would be a 10 while
we did include a plastic screen
protector on this p20 pro which is nice
of them but on the screen surface itself
we find scratches at level 6 and deeper
groove at a level 7 the p20 pro is
tempered glass Huawei doesn't advertise
having Gorilla Glass on their phone like
they did last year on the p10 remember
that it'll be important later in the
video first thing I noticed about this
phone besides the notch is the earpiece
it's a little circular thing just ogling
at you like some kind of second eyeball
right next to the 24 megapixel
front-facing camera most earpieces are
little slits for optimal sound transfer
from the rectangular speaker underneath
but this guy is a circle it'll be
interesting to see if the speaker is
circular as well during the teardown the
speaker grille won't fall out though
which is good not even with the razor
blade is still sitting completely flush
with the surface of the glass the
fingerprint scanner is down here at the
bottom of the phone and is unscratched
bore a big step up from the make 10
which we did end up scratching you never
know when you might end up in a freak
razor blade fight accident it's good to
know your button will survive any damage
speaking of buttons while we added a
little slit into the metal power button
and dab some reddish paint in there kind
of interesting in a unique design choice
the volume rockers also made from metal
and we can tell from the sound it's
making the sides are also metal up at
the top of the phone we are headphone
jack lists but while white did include
an IR blaster so you can change the
channel on your TV and stuff personally
I've never had a need for one of those
but I'm all about the features the more
the merrier
so bring it on we have a metal dual SIM
card tray but no expandable memory no
headphone jack on the bottom of the
phone either just the loudspeaker and
USB C charging port for the back of the
phone this one is a midnight blue
version we get our first look at the
triple camera setup super impressive by
the way I like what's happening here and
I'll say it again
the more features the phone has the
better and the extra camera options on
this guy is a good thing the logos and
like a branding are all under the glass
and won't be coming off from the outside
along with the dual tone dual LED flash
tucked safely under that back glass
panel if we doom in real tight on the
camera lenses down here at the bottom we
have the 20 mega pixel monochrome
censored covered with glass and a
circular metal lip around the sides and
then we have a beastly 40 megapixel
camera here in the center of the three
lenses and finally a three time zoom
telephoto lens up top it's a pretty
solid trio but I think the ideal
arrangement would be to toss out the
monochrome sensor and add in a wide
angle lens like a gopro fisheye effect
to capture a lot of things all at once
those are the three types of lenses I
carry from a professional camera
monochrome has just never appealed to me
quick side-by-side comparison with the
dual camera setup on the iPhone 10 I am
gonna try to replace the cracked glass
on the iPhone 10 with dry ice here in a
few days if you don't know what I'm
talking about go check out my iPhone
back glass liquid nitrogen video I
posted a couple days ago and now for at
the burn test no offence France I didn't
realize I was burning down the Eiffel
Tower until it was too late I apologize
this is a 1080p 6.1 inch AMOLED display
meaning it lasted for about 20 seconds
under my flame but then never recovered
the flame left a white spot on the
screen even when the screen is off once
again sorry France and thanks again for
the Statue of Liberty
was real nice of you and now the Ben
test this is where things go downhill
first of all with the initial flex it
bends way more than I anticipated
normally phones are much more solid than
this with that massive flex the glass
display is now shattered with multiple
fractures the damage is all contained in
the glass nothing transferred down to
the AMOLED display underneath but it is
still rather unfortunate I'll do a quick
Bend from the back of the phone before
we go into the structural analysis but
with that second Bend no extra damage is
done to the front or rear of the phone
it appears as if the cracks emanated
from the level-7 pick marks left on the
surface meaning that without the damage
I intentionally introduced to the
surface of the glass it might have
survived the first Bend but an important
thing to remember is that these
impurities or scratches introduced to
the surface of the glass can also occur
in real life in your pocket or with
minor drops dents and dings and even
more interesting to note is that I've
tested over 100 different phones now
over the past few years and most of them
don't shatter during the bend test even
with the level 6 and 7 scratches in the
glass so it's kind of safe to say that
this Huawei p20 pro is just weaker in
general my theory is that Huawei didn't
advertise Corning Gorilla Glass on this
particular phone and with the vast
majority of other phones that I test
some form of Gorilla Glass is installed
based off the sample size of tested
phones on my channel Corning holds up
better than generic cell phone glass
even after damage has been introduced
the Huawei p20 Pro still functions
though so it's not a catastrophic
failure I don't think that it deserves a
spot on my shelf of shame but it still
didn't exactly pass I need a new
category for phones that survived but
barely what should we call it remember a
case and a screen protector go a long
way to making your device last longer

already and come hang out with me on

thanks dumb for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
