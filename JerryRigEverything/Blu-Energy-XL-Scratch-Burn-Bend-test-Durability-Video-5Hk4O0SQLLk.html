released blue energy XL this is the
first phone that I have ever tested from
the company blue it's got a six inch
screen size and the reason I chose to
test it was the huge 5000 milliamp hour
battery which claims an incredible
30-day standby time
mid-range phones are giving flagships a
run for their money these days the note
5 which you see here only has a 3000
milliamp battery almost half of the
energy XL thickness wise is pretty
standard the note 5 is a seven point six
millimeter the energy exhales a bit
thicker at 8.4 and the world's thinnest
premium smartphone is the Moto Z at a
five point two millimeter thickness
since the battery on this phone is so
big you can use it to charge other
devices directly from your phone like a
power bank just plug the correct cable
and you can charge cameras like the gear
360 or GoPros and you can even charge
other phones using the energy XL like
you see here with my note 5 huge brownie
points with the ladies if you can charge
their dead iPhone with your Android
right now this phone is $300 but as with
all electronics that price will drop
with time I've put a link in the video
description of this video so you can
check the current pricing let's get on
with the test scratch test first this
phone is using Gorilla Glass 3 and
doesn't scratch until level 6 this is
normal and pretty much expected at this
point so it'll be interesting to see how
the Gorilla Glass 5 holds up on the note
7 when it comes out I'll be testing that
as well the front 5 megapixel camera is
covered by the same front Gorilla Glass
so it's protected against scratches I've
had a few people ask about the hardness
level of my razor blade it also
scratches at a level 6 but the level 5
mark rubs right off so it has an equal
hardness level as the screen glass and
that's why it does no damage the home
button and fingerprint scanner is not
made of glass and does scratch
relatively easily the bad part about
this is that after being heavily
scratched the fingerprint scanner stops
working altogether it will not recognize
my fingerprint anymore which is
unfortunate because the axon 7 and the
Moto Z continued to function after being
heavily scratched the home button part
works just fine just not the scanner
part so if you end up buying this phone
keep that in mind the sides of the phone
are
made of plastic which is surprising I
assume they were metal at first from the
weight of the phone but as you can see
from the color of the shavings and the
sound my razor makes it really is
plastic the power and volume buttons are
made of metal though the back of the
phone is made of metal which gives the
phone a quality feel to it
the single color flash is plastic just
like normal and the 13 megapixel rear
camera lens is made of glass which is
good it won't scratch very easily
unfortunately the top and bottom
segments of the phone are made of
plastic it brings down manufacturing
costs considerably when the phone isn't
made out of a solid block of metal so
this explains the mid-range price point
it's definitely not a solid metal design
but blue never advertised it as metal
either so all as well onto the burn test
the glass on this phone is pretty thick
when you press on it so you won't see
the AMOLED screen ripple or flex with
the pressure of your finger like you
would on the LG g5 I think the thicker
glass helps us survive my flame for an
impressive 37 seconds onto the bin test
if you haven't subscribed yet feel free
to do so it is free and it will keep you
up to date on all of my future
smartphone durability tests this phone
feels like a tank right out of the box
the huge battery gives it some solid
weight so I'm not surprised at all when
the phone is very sturdy I see some
minor flexing along the top which I
imagine is where the motherboard meets
the battery but the phone itself does
not get permanently kinked or
catastrophic we break either this phone
passes the bin test and it seems like a
solid mid-range device from a hardware
perspective
I do enjoy reviewing tech from the
inside so tell me what phone you want to
see next in the comments I'm always
looking for more devices to stick on my
shelf of shame thanks for watching I'll
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
