analyzed several water-resistant phones
here on my channel and now it's time to
see how a wireless bluetooth speaker can
survive against liquid this rugged
speaker claims an ipx7 rating same as
the new Apple watch it can be submerged
under water up to one meter for 30
minutes but let's see if we can actually
trust that the outer materials are a
combination of metal speaker grilles
plastic frames and a super thick rubber
layer around the outside the first
visible defense against water is the
incredibly thick charging port flap this
speaker has an internal battery that
powers itself as well as charges other
devices just like a power bank luckily
there is another layer of waterproofing
around the charging port on the inside
of the speaker and I'll show you that in
just a second four Phillips screws are
holding the decorative plastic faceplate
against the metal grille ice a
decorative because it has no structural
functionality the waterproofing starts
below this layer there are four more
screws that are offset to the original
four that we just removed and these
screws have a thick rubber layer over
the tip that was dripped in on top of
the screws to plug the screw holes
pretty ingenious way to block the water
entry after those screws are removed the
speaker can lift off from the body and
here we can see a rubber washer along
the lip the four screws we just removed
pull the plastic top tight against this
rubber ring on the inside to make a
watertight seal with the rest of the
body I'll disconnect the two speaker
wires and then I see three screws
holding the speaker into the grill there
is a shiny strip of black rubber like
materials sealing the edge of the
speaker to the plastic you can see it
stretch and pull with each screw that I
remove I have a feeling that the speaker
isn't going to be waterproof again when
I finally put it all back together after
the screws and black seal are gone the
speaker freely falls out from the
plastic frame the metal grille has
obvious holes in it so air and water can
freely enter so the speaker needs to do
all the work to keep the water out in
some speakers the cone or diaphragm is
made of thick paper cloth or other
permeable material some subwoofers use a
plastic cone and it looks like that is
the case with this particular speaker
the actual speaker component was the
part that I was most curious about
plastic will not allow
water to pass through it and the rubber
surround or suspension is also
impermeable water will never soak
through the plastic cone like it would
with a cloth or paper speaker so this
definitely gets a thumbs up for that
when I get a water-resistant piece of
tech to test I always see if the board
is coated with a hydrophobic spray and
this board is not so if by chance some
water does get inside your speaker it
would get roasted maybe not immediately
water damage sometimes takes a while for
the corrosion to set in and take over
h2o is the cancer of the electronic
world hopefully the rest of the water
barriers will do their job and you'll be
just fine now there are two more screws
that are holding down the shroud for the
charging port and the USB slot this has
the same rubber sealant around all the
edges that we saw on top of those screws
and it really is just a second layer of
waterproofing underneath that thick
rubber charging port flap that we saw
earlier dual layers of waterproofing is
always better than one under the circuit
board we find a fourteen hundred and
fifty milliamp hour battery that powers
the five watt speaker it is also a
portable power bank and can charge other
devices on the go but it looks like the
battery is soldered in to summarize this
portable speaker is waterproof because
of his beastly housing lots of glue and
rubber and plastic speaker cones so as
long as it doesn't go deeper than one
meter in water it should be fine
the waterproof reviews of the iPhone 7
and Galaxy phones can be found in my
ultimate waterproof test playlist I
would feel much safer using this
inexpensive portable speaker around
water than I would with my more
expensive iPhone or Samsung thanks a ton
for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
