g4 we're gonna do some durability tests
on it today the first of which is taking
my keys and seeing how the leather back
handles being scuffed up
it does permanently scuff the back even
with just a little bit of pressure so
you want to make sure not to keep your
phone around any metal objects I'm
curious as to what is underneath the
leather so I'm going to take my razor
blade and slice through the leather and
kind of scrape away from the back of the
phone it's pretty tough stuff as far as
the slicing is concerned you can see the
fibers of the leather here from the foam
back and then underneath the leather is
just some colored plastic it's the same
color as the outside leather kind of
interesting move on to the scratch test
first off I'm going to use a razor blade
the glass on the LG g4 is Gorilla Glass
3 so not quite on the same level as the
Galaxy s6 or the HTC m9 and if you look
close enough you can see that the razor
blade does scratch the glass which was
not the case with the galaxy s6 taking
my keys though and trying to scratch the
glass was a little bit better for the
phone the scratches from the keys did
not show up so the glass is still
scratch resistant just can't handle the
razor blade now we're going to move on
to the burn test you can see that the
plastic edge of the phone and the
leather back both start burning almost
immediately so if you're going to save a
bunch of kittens from a burning building
you might want to leave your phone
outside LG calls the screen and IPS
quantum display you can see the pixels
shutting off from the extreme heat of
the lighter on the front edge the quad
HD Super AMOLED screen from the galaxy
s6 had the same response which was
interesting the pixels mostly recovered
after the flame was removed the back
glass lens of the camera was not
scratched by my keys which is nice makes
me think that the back lens is also made
of Gorilla Glass or at least some kind
of scratch resistant glass the razor
blade did leave a mark though you can
see the mark in the reflection as I tilt
the phone from side to side so the back
lens is not on scratch well but it is
scratch resistant now onto the bin test
if you remember the HTC m9 failed
miserably while the galaxy s6 did
survive the bin test I am putting all of
my effort into
this phone it survived the first round
and I'm going to give it one more shot
still nothing
I think it's partially because a
removable battery which the LG g4 has is
more rigid than a permanent internal
battery
it adds structural integrity to the
phone I'd say that this phone takes
second place to the galaxy s6 as far as
durability goes it is hard to compete
with a metal body and Gorilla Glass 4
still a solid phone though I enjoyed
testing it I've linked the Galaxy s6 and
HTC m9 teardown videos as well as the
repair video for this LG g4 thanks ton
for watching and let me know what other
devices you want to see tested hope see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
