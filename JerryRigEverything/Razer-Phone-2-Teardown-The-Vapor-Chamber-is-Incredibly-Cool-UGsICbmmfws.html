phones have taken apart in a very long
time wait till you see this vapor
chamber it's incredibly impressive the
clear version I made was cosmetically
disappointing but the guts of this phone
more than make up for it it's time to
review the razor phone - from the inside
let's get started one good thing about
having the clear version is now you can
actually watch how deep my knife
penetrates every time I remove back
glass covers from phones all I ever uses
the tip any deeper and fragile stuff
might get damaged like the battery or
the power ribbons the razor phone too
has 10 screws holding the top plastic
plate over the motherboard the screws
are different so I'm keeping them
organized as I set them off to the side
then the plastic lifts up just enough
for me to unsnap the back LED panel lego
style ribbon connector and the whole
thing can be removed from the phone the
RGB pad is pretty interesting especially
since it only illuminates specifically
around the snake logo when the phone is
turned on app will really drop the ball
by not making their Apple logo glow on
the back of the iPhones
I'll pull off the metal bracket over the
battery and charging port plugs and set
that off to the side then I'll unclip
the battery the bottom half the phone
has another 10 screws once again all
different sizes and then amazingly the
whole battery and wireless charging
combo very easily unfolds out of the
phone exposing part of the massive
copper vapor chamber and Marquez will be
happy to see a larger and stronger
vibrator this year it's not taptic but
should still get the job done the
battery is a four thousand milliamp hour
monster and very much appreciated that
it's not strapped in next to the fragile
electronics with a ridiculous amount of
adhesive now let's finish unburying the
ginormous copper vapor chamber there's
two screws holding on the motherboard
all unsnap the charging port ribbon with
my plastic pry tool along with the side
button ribbon like a little Lego then
I'll unplug the three little wire cables
along the right side there's a lot of
those this year the SIM and expandable
memory card tray is next I'll pop that
out of the phone and get the little wire
cable on the left side unplugged as well
as the front-facing camera then the
motherboard can lift up and out of the
phone
still attached is the screen ribbon
cable plugged into the underside of the
motherboard it's got its own little
silver bracket holding the ribbon in
place I'll set that off to the side the
gob of thermal paste you see is right
over top of the processor room on this
phone the processor is the part that
generates the most heat the paste helps
transfer that heat to the top left
corner of the copper vapor chamber the
rear cameras are also plugged into the
motherboard we have our normal 12
megapixel lens with optical image
stabilization and an additional camera
with two times optical zoom the perfect
combo I'll let other reviewers handle
the comparisons and see whether the
pictures are good or not but hardware
wise this is the ideal setup the
front-facing camera has quite a lot of
adhesive holding it in place it's an 8
megapixel little guy and now for the top
stereo speaker the razor phone is known
for its iconic Lee large speaker grilles
but interestingly enough the speakers
inside aren't that much larger than
normal size wise the speakers are a bit
bigger than the pixel 3 but not by much
it does have its own waterproof mesh
over top with a rubber ring to help keep
a tight seal against the phone body but
the interesting thing is the tail end of
the speaker when you mount a large
speaker like a subwoofer it's usually
placed inside of a box so the speaker
has room to move a lot of cell phones
have speakers in such a tight box that
there's no room for movement so they
sound terrible that's not the case with
the razer phone the razer phones ear
piece has its own box with a large air
chamber off to the side that allows for
speaker movement it's pretty cool I'll
just put this back where it came from
the two little square watertight
microphone mesh slots have green rubber
on them it probably wasn't intentional
but it still looks cool the vapor
chamber still covered up by some ribbons
from down here on the charging port
there's two screws holding the board in
place and then an additional two screws
on the USBC port portion then the whole
thing pulls up and out of the phone it's
got a little black rubber ring around
the lip of the port which is good for
water resistance as well as minimizing
stress on the port itself when it gets
plugged in the bottom speaker still
smaller than you might think when
compared to the outer grille size also
has its own air compartment right next
to the speaker and it has his own
water-resistant mesh overtop and finally
we're here the vapor chamber covering
basically the whole area inside
the phone this copper heatsink is pretty
awesome having a copper plate this large
inside of a phone is already a huge
boost to thermal performance over
aluminum or steel but as I was removing
the plate you can tell how thick it is
basically as the processor heats up the
top left corner of the vapor chamber the
vapor inside also heats up and carries
the heat away to the far side of the
chamber where it cools down into liquid
and then flows back to repeat the
process it's kind of like a heat pipe on
steroids basically a whole radiator for
your phone pretty fascinating and you
know me we aren't going to let this pass
by without exploring the insider peeling
back the copper we actually see physical
liquid not just gas little droplets
covering the inside of the copper
envelope
I mean copper alone would probably have
been sufficient but copper combined with
liquid and channels for air flow is
seriously some next-level stuff it's
like a waterbed inside of your cell
phone Razer is taking smartphone cooling
to the next level if you like seeing
stuff like this make sure you're
subscribed you can see that the half
currently opened up is already
evaporated but this new flap has all the
liquid droplets still inside technology
is impressive and Razer definitely gets
a thumbs up for this one I don't think
I'll be able to reuse the chamber now
that it's been opened up I don't want
any sharp metal edges up against the
underside of my battery the phone will
still work without the copper it just
won't be as efficient under heavy
workloads the chamber is seriously
pretty cool the 120 Hertz screen can be
replaced if hated but it's glued into
the metal body of the phone so we'll
leave it alone for now since screens
don't normally survive the removal
process
I'll get the loudspeaker tucked back
into place and the charging port along
with all of its screws and associated
wire cables before I can set the
motherboard back down though it needs
the screen ribbon cable plugged into the
underside screwed in and secured with
its silver bracket then it's ready to be
set down into the phone I haven't turned
on this bone in a while pretty sure it's
dead from the LED flashing on the back
for a few days we'll find out in a
second I'll plug in the large charging
port ribbon cable clips in like a little
Lego as well as the power button ribbon
on the left side then the whole
cool-looking battery wireless charging
contraption can slide
back onto the phone now that I've seen
the insides I'm Way more impressed with
the razor phone too I'll plug in the led
RG B's add the metal bracket over the
battery connector and set down the
protective plastic sover the motherboard
we should be good to go I'll plug it in
while I get the new back glass into
place razor has outdone themselves this
year with the cooling system and there's
definitely a new standard in town for
gaming phones it's a super solid build

already come hang out with me on Twitter
and Instagram and let me know if you
have any questions down in the comments
thanks ton for watching and I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
