the galaxy s7 edge and talk about
repairability plus we're going to cut
open the heat pipe which they're calling
liquid cooling and at the end I have
some interesting stuff to show you with
the camera so buckle up the easiest part
of this whole project is been removing
the SIM card / SD card tray from the
phone so set that off to the side make
sure you keep all your stuff organized
then we are going to use a heat gun to
heat up the back glass panel of the
phone basically what we're trying to
accomplish here is to soften the
adhesive underneath the glass panel so
the glass panel will come off in one
piece without cracking I'm heating up
the phone to just hotter than I can
touch where I don't want to leave my
finger on there for more than a second
then I'm going to take a large suction
cup I'm using a car windshield mount
suctioning it to the back of the glass
and lifting up ever so slightly just
relieving some of the pressure on the
glass between the frame and the glass
itself so I can slide a thin metal pry
tool in between the two layers once I
have that pry tool in that is the
hardest part then I can take my heat gun
and heat up the glue again I can slice
away the glue a little bit with my pry
tool but I can't get along the edge of
the phone or else I'm going to crack the
glass this is where the business cards
or playing cards come in because they
can curve around the edge of the galaxy
s7 edge without cracking the glass must
be this part up a little bit you can see
I'm just cutting through the adhesive
with my playing cards all the way around
the outside and that's all there is to
it don't go too deep or you will cut
into the Qi charger and I imagine most
of you want to keep that remove the back
glass panel you can see here the camera
lens you can just push those through
that's how those are replaced then there
are 12 screws holding down the back
frame I will link all the parts and
tools down in the video description
right below that like button there's
this nifty little piece of gold tape I
have no idea what it does but it's
probably important so set that off to
the side where you can remember where it
is there's a bunch little plastic pieces
around the edge of the phone they lock
together like little puzzles so I'm
going to snap off this top piece and set
that off to the side next to the screws
then the Qi charger panel and plastic
will lift off from the back of the phone
as well
it just unsnaps from the bottom plastic
piece you can see here the contact
points about the Qi charger charges the
battery through the motherboard I'm
going to unplug the battery now so that
there is not any electricity coursing
through the board here is the power
button cable the screen ribbon cable and
then here's the volume rocker
the bottom loudspeaker pops off and then
here's the two contact points that rest
on the motherboard so it gets its signal
here's the fingerprint scanner and then
here's some signal wires I'm just going
to pop those off with my plastic pry
tool you can also lift them off with a
pair of tweezers here's the earpiece
ribbon just like a little Lego just
unsnap it then here is the five
megapixel front camera it's a cute
little guy set that off to the side
here's for the front sensors I'm going
to pull that off and then there's one
more ribbon cable down at the bottom of
the phone for the charging port I'm
going to unsnap that from the back of
the motherboard and then here is the
motherboard itself once I flip it over
you can already see some discoloration
where the processor has melted into the
back plastic the 820 is a pretty hot
running processor here is the 12
megapixel rear-facing camera I have some
cool stuff I'm going to show you with
this towards the end of this video I'm
going to put it back into place just
snapping it in like a little Lego for
the battery removal process it is fairly
difficult I'm going to use my heat gun
again to soften the adhesive between the
battery and the frame of the phone and
then using a metal pry tool very very
gently and very carefully prying it out
of the metal frame you want to make sure
not to slide or slice your metal pry
tool at all because if you puncture the
battery it could smoke or explode you
know and we try to avoid doing those
things now down by the charging port
there are three screws you can also
remove the headphone jack now here is
the disappointing part of this phone the
charging port has these two side ribbons
that go around to the back and the menu
buttons for the galaxy s7 edge and these
are attacked underneath the screen so in
order to remove the charging port you
will have to remove the screen and the
bad thing about that is that the Galaxy
s7 edge has the edge on the AMOLED and
that is near impossible to remove from
the frame with without damaging it
permanently so a charging port repair is
pretty impossible with this phone unless
you're doing a screen repair at the same
time to remove the screen from the frame
you're going to use the same process
that you use for the back of the phone
with playing cards and heat it will
destroy the old screen though so make
sure that you do have a working
replacement a glass only screen repair
for this phone would honestly be the
best option with this phone but those
liquid-nitrogen machines cost thousands
of dollars my dry ice trick only works
with iPhones and not Samsung devices
hopefully the screen on the regular
Galaxy S
seven is easier to replace we'll find
out when I do my teardown this week so
let's do something fun we're going to
jump in and take part that heat pipe
that sits on top of the Snapdragon 820
processor my take my razor blade and
slice into it and lift up the copper so
we can see the insides so a heat pipe
basically has some vapour inside this
particular heat pipe there isn't any
visible liquid like there was with the
sony xperia z5 premium we could see a
little bit of liquid inside of that one
this one is more similar to the lumia
950xl where there's no liquid inside so
here's a poll question for you there's
going to be a little icon that pops up
in the corner of this video should a
heat pipe inside a cell phone be called
liquid cooling when there isn't any
visible liquid go and respond to that
quiz and we'll see what the consensus is
inside the heat pythor a little copper
strands that essentially wick the vapor
inside of the tube from one end to the
other as it heats up so it does work as
a glorified heatsink I'm going to put it
all back together and it is good as new
hit that subscribe button if you've
enjoyed this video so far I'm going to
put the tape back on top with the little
foam heat transfer bits and we can start
putting the phone back together again
I'm going to put the headphone jack back
in by the charging port and then snap
the charging port ribbon cable back into
the bottom of the motherboard set that
back into place making sure to get all
the wires and stuff out from underneath
it that includes the two up by the
earpiece the volume rockers and the
power button connector as well I'm going
to snap all those back into place making
sure that I can feel and click in
underneath my finger just like a little
Lego snapping in same thing with the
fingerprint scanner and all three signal
wires battery goes into place and before
I connect that I want to make sure
everything's plugged in so I'm going to
get the charging port screwed back into
place with the loudspeaker sat down on
top of that five megapixel front camera
goes in and then I can plug the battery
in once the battery's plugged in I can
turn on the phone and I'm going to do
that to test the screen and to show you
guys the camera now this is pretty cool
it's called optical image stabilization
the camera itself is stabilizing while I
move it around and this is what's going
to keep your videos and images clear
while you're walking or holding your
phone there's two ways to stabilize
images there's optical image
stabilization and there's digital image
stabilization the digital is just a
software
where it takes the megapixels and kind
of cuts off the corners of it and can
stabilize it that way I prefer the
optical image stabilization where it's
actually a mechanical part of it with
the little gyros and magnets and little
rubber balls inside of the camera unit
pretty nifty stuff once all the screws
are back into place you can take your
double-sided tape and put it around the
edges that way your new back will sit in
place and stay on I will link all the
replacement parts and stuff down the

other videos if you have any questions
