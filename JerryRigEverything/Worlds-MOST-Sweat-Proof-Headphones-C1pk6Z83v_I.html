pairs of Bluetooth headphones in the
times and smartphones and Bluetooth
started being a thing and not all of the
headphones were winners I normally wear
a bluetooth headphones when I'm at the
gym or when I'm running I have run a
couple marathons in the past so go
through bluetooth headphones fairly
quickly when I'm purchasing a pair of
bluetooth headphones I look for two
things one sound quality obviously and
durability if it can survive my workouts
and long runs sweat is probably one of
the worst enemies of electronics not
just because it's liquid it's also salty
which is extra corrosive to the fragile
internal circuits and headphones that
stopped working are the worst kind of
headphones anchor reached out with two
of their brand new sound core headphones
for me to try out and saying these
things are sweat proof they have 700
headphones to give away to you guys
along with 10,000 discount codes so
stick around to the end of the video for
that information the best way headphones
can truly be sweat proof is with the
coating applied directly to the circuit
boards with the right coating it should
be able to survive all kinds of liquids
like soda sweat water and if that
coating exists it would definitely
support anchors claim that these are the
world's most sweat proof headphones the
only way to check out for sure is from
the inside let's get started
so I've had both of these headphones for
about two weeks now
Ankur says these are the world's most
sweat proof headphones which is a pretty
bold claim considering how inexpensive
they are we have the sound course
spirits over here and then we have the
sound course Spirit X's over here the
X's have that little ring around the
back so that wraps around your ear the
spirit headphones are just the buds a
long strap and magnets on the ends to
keep them from dangling around they come
with additional ear buds for different
sized ears but I just use the standard
ones and they stayed in just fine the
over ear spirit exit phones wrap around
your ear for the more heavy exercises
like sprinting but the ear wrap around
part is super soft and I've worn them
for a few hours at a time with no
problem the sound core spirits are the
smaller round in-ear headphones with
little bits of rubber that conform to
the insides of your ear taking this
review to the inside we find some sealed
plastic which is good for waterproofing
and then we see the internal
rechargeable battery taking special care
enough to puncture the little guy I'll
slice through the outer plastics to
reveal the blue 50 or 60 milliamp power
it's kind of hard to tell at this point
battery tucked up inside so we've seen
the earpiece plastics or sweat proof
let's jump down to the control circuit
the microUSB charging port flap is to
help keep liquid and dust out peeling
off the rubberish buttons that are
sealed to the controller we finally
exposed the circuit board and
immediately see there is a coating on
top of the board the whole thing shines
uniformly across the surface when I jump
in with the drop of water though we see
it's not hydrophobic the water still
clings to the board anchor calls they're
coating a sweat guard technology a
multi-layered nano coating spray that
keeps the metal contacts from corroding
or shorting out when liquid is present
it resists both sweat and seawater at
the same time pretty cool stuff
I'll pop out the earpiece speaker before
I move on to the spirit X's it's a tiny
little guy completely sealed inside of
the plastic housing I guess it depends
on what kind of exercise you're gonna be
doing with these headphones if you're
gonna be doing a lot of sprints you know
high mobility stuff the ones that wrap
around your ears are obviously going to
stay on better than the ones that just
go in your ear but I've been able to run
normal distances with these ones just
fine the spirit X's also have
interchangeable rubber tips depending on
the shape of your ear the speaker
housing is plastic
can sealed shut watertight but there is
a larger speaker inside when compared to
the regular spirits kind of interesting
probably just because there's more room
if I take my metal pry tool to the
battery housing hope we pop off the
anchor logo to find a 90 milliamp power
battery powering these headphones and if
we slide down to open up the watertight
controller housing which is rather
difficult considering the amount of
rubber and glue holding it all together
we see these headphones have the same
impermeable nano coating over the
circuits still not hydrophobic but thick
enough to keep liquid and more
importantly sweat from corroding the
internals are they really the world's
most sweat resistant headphones only
time will tell
but it looks like from the teardown that
there is a coating on the circuit boards
and they should be able to hold their
own unlike my Beats headphones which
died three times in one year because
they didn't have any coating at all on
that circuit board for the price fees
are pretty incredible remember Ankur is
giving away 700 of these headphones and
10,000 discount codes pretty sure the
giveaways valid in the UK the United
States Germany and Canada all the
official rules and details will be in
the video description right below this
video if you have any questions leave
them down in the comments and let me
know what your current favorite song is
I need some more music options thanks a
ton for watching and I will see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
