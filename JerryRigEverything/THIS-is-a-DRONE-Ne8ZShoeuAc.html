not know by name but you've probably
seen in some of your favorite movies
Kong was filmed here two Rasik Park was
filmed here lost was filmed here Jumanji
was filmed here so many movies were
filmed in this beautiful location called
Kualoa Ranch well you might not have
noticed is that there's some drones
behind me right here that film in 4k and
we're gonna be reviewing today so thanks
for Kualoa Ranch for having me out here
well let's get started so you might be
thinking to yourself that this looks
more like an egg than a drone it's
actually called the power egg and it's
made by a company called power vision
it's the same company that did the
underwater drone that we reviewed in
Cancun so they make some pretty sweet
stuff this particular drone does have
some propellers they pop out of the side
like this and today I haven't flown this
a whole lot and the winds cooperating
with us and we're in one of the most
beautiful places on the planet so this
should be pretty fun the camera is
mounted on the bottom it's a 4k and it
can spin in 360 degrees and it should
have
so Kualoa ranch is situated on the north
end of the island and if you remember
from World War two when Pearl Harbor was
attacked the planes came from the north
side of the island so during World War
two in order to defend the north side of
the island the army kind of commandeered
Kualoa ranch for a minute and built some
huge guns right here up by this bunker
from the martial law ended and the same
martial law that built both of the
turrets up here on the top of the
mountain also commandeered an airstrip
on Kualoa ranch where the plans could
take off and it was built out of this
metal grate wish that allowed the planes
to take off over like you know the dirt
even if it was muddy and stuff but it
was nice because after the war ended and
the martial law ended they were able to
pull that metal grate up pack up and
move out and give the land back to
Kualoa so inside the bunker there's a
whole lot of rooms and they have kind of
the rooms dedicated in different movies
so Jumanji was filmed here and I think
this guy has pretty good haircut before
Kualoa ranch was a place to fill epic
blockbuster movies they grew sugarcane
here and this was a sugar mill behind me
but it turned out not to be as
profitable as they wanted so they
switched to you know having cattle here
and stuff like that but then when movies
realized how beautiful Kualoa ranch is
that's when they started making the big
bucks and when the big-budget films
aren't actively shooting there's four
will arise there's horse rides there's
bus rides and you can see all the
different movie sets that are here on
Kualoa ranch including the scene from
Jurassic world where the indominus rex
escape from that enclosure that's here
on the island - and it's still here for
the people to come visit Kualoa last
year dan and I from what's inside came
out and filmed a video on his channel
inside of that enclosure
alright so there's actually a lot of
parts of this drone it looks like an egg
as it is right now what we're gonna do
is we're gonna pop the arms out there's
four of them with the four propellers
and then this base capsule pops off and
that's what protects the gimbal at the
bottom of the camera it's got a little
piece of foam here keeps the gimbal from
shaking around and then if we want the
legs to extend first we have to turn the
drone on then if you press the power
button three times the Leigh
eggs should extend all the way down to
the bottom now when you're flying the
drone the legs will automatically
retract up into the drone and tell
you're coming down to land and sometimes
they pop out automatically so you can
land otherwise there's a button on the
controller now the controller's a little
more complicated than if you were flying
with like a DJI or something I feel like
it's not as intuitive and the
responsiveness of the triggers aren't as
responsive as DG eyes controller we have
the Wi-Fi adapter right here which I'll
turn on and one annoying part is that
you need a 3.5 headphone jack in order
for this to work that's probably the
only time ever gonna say that on this
channel it's annoying that it has a
headphone jack to connect the Wi-Fi
adapter to the controller so there's
more of a possibility with all these
components that you'll forget something
and won't be able to fly when you
actually arrive on location it's kind of
a problem
and then to retract the legs back into
the drone I'm gonna press the button
three times and it should pull the legs
in tight kind of a lot of steps going on
but it looks sweet and then to collapse
the arms back in there's this little tab
right here at the bottom and I'll take
the propellers pinch them inside and it
keeps the whole thing in a tight compact
little compartment and it's an egg again
it's kind of you know it's the first of
its kind and it's hard to compete with
DGI but it's nice that power vision is
making something unique and bringing
some diversity to the drone marketplace
let me just think of the drone footage I
had some from the Power egg as well as
the Navajo and if you're ever out here
on Oahu in Hawaii Kualoa ranch is one of
the must-see locations that seriously is
one of my favorite places I will link
their YouTube channel here as well as
their Instagram account in the video
description it is worth it's worth going
to check out thanks a ton for watching
and I will see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
