to take apart and fix a couple things on
the LG g4 one of LG's newest smartphones
coming out in 2015 this one has the
leather back with the center stitching
go ahead and turn off the phone first
remove the back cover
pop out the battery and then you're left
with 11 screws to take off from the back
housing and then I found that it's
easier to grab along the center of the
battery hole and the edge of the phone
to start pulling away that back plastic
plate you can just unsnap it from the
edge of the phone and the whole thing
will just come loose once all those
screws are out pretty straightforward
this phone is actually pretty darn easy
to take apart nothing's glued down or
adhesive like the galaxy s6 you can see
these little gold contact pads that just
kind of rest on top of the motherboard
that's how the power button and the
volume buttons communicate with the
motherboard the bottom part of the
bracket also snaps off this is how you
replace the loudspeaker you can see the
loudspeaker segment in this bottom
section and the gold contact plates that
also just sit on top of the motherboard
LG is a pretty big fan of those they
always have been
here is the buttons of the volume
buttons and the camera lens pretty
straightforward and easy to replace if
your camera lens gets scratched or
broken it's pretty easy to pop out and
pop it a new one which is nice
considering that the camera lens is easy
to scratch here is the buttons ribbon
cables you can just pop those out and
replace them with the new one if needed
the ribbon cable for the screen just
snaps up like a little Lego piece off of
the mainboard
be careful with any connections or chips
down around on the mainboard you don't
want to pry up on those when you're
lifting off the ribbon cable connections
the motherboard just pulls away from the
plastic frame of the screen and you can
see here the contact points that I was
talking about earlier here's the SIM
card slot that is not replaceable
battery connections and the charging
port not replaceable either you can see
the back here as well you might be able
to do it if you had some micro soldering
tools but that's beyond the scope of a
normal person's capability so we're
going to skip over that
here is the front-facing camera and the
vibrator motor which is pretty small
in my opinion usually with phones and
even watches they're a lot bigger than
that here is the rear facing camera 16
megapixels capable of recording in 4k it
also has the image stabilization chips
that you can see on the side of it
here's the earpiece I'm going to lift
off the little ribbon cable first it has
some more of those contact points that
we were talking about earlier and
something else I found interesting is
there's these little contact points on
the side of the motherboard that just
clip in next to the headphone jack and
that's how the headphone jack
communicates with the motherboard so
here's the screen is the combination of
the glass digitizer LCD and plastic
frame if you are going to replace the
screen you have two options one is
suggested by the glass in LCD combo or
by it with the frame which usually ends
up costing about 10 or 15 more dollars
but will save you hours of work in
frustration so if you're going to do a
screen repair make sure you buy the
screen with the frame included you will
thank me later
but back in all the components got the
vibrator motor of the rear camera
front-facing camera and the earpiece all
placed back in making sure that it lines
up with the little pins on the side and
when you're placing the motherboard back
into place make sure you lift up the
ribbon cables of the camera so they
don't get caught underneath the
motherboard there's only three to worry
about so it's not too bad
and make sure the motherboard slips
inside of the plastic clasps at the top
and the bottom just kind of press it in
and you'll hear it click into place to
make sure that the motherboard is secure
then putting the button back together I
put the center button down first just
kind of eyeballing it and then the top
layer just clips down over the top of it
and then press it a couple times make
sure that everything's clicking and you
don't have anything stuck underneath
there and it's all cleaned out and dry
not to touch the inside of the camera
lens either if you go to replace that
that'll make it so your pictures are
blurred later on I'm going to clip the
back frame back together the loudspeaker
is connecting to the rest of the device
making sure that the ribbon cables for
the screen is clamped down to the
motherboard it's kind of like a little
tiny tiny Lego piece has a bunch of
little fins that just clamp down on to
the motherboard so you have to line it
up perfectly and then just clip it down
and you'll feel it snap underneath your
fingers as it clicks into place
getting the back housing
pressed into the frame of the screen
getting the battery back in there and
then I'm going to test it before I put
the screws back in now the back cover is
in place I'm going to go ahead and give
the phone and try and everything works
feel any questions leave them down in
