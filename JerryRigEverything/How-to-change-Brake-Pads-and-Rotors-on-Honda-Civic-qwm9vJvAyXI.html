while the tire was on the ground and now
we boosted the car up with the jack
where I take the tire off I'll go from
there all right everything you from this
project need the jack stands the two
rotors brake pads rubber mallet seat
clamp Jack and a wrench set I'm gonna
put a link in the video description
below for the brake pads and the
calipers they're cheapest on Amazon
that's where I get all my stuff from
okay so when you got the car up off the
ground make sure to support in two
places we have the jack right here on
the frame and then we have the jack
stand on the frame in the front that way
nothing will ever fall down and damage
the car or damage your face so right
here we have the rotor and we have the
caliper and the brake pads you're going
to be replacing our on the inside of the
caliper and take off the caliper there
are two bolts one right here which is a
seventeen millimeter and then one on the
bottom and the exact same place as this
one that's also seventeen so I'm taking
the caliper and I'm supporting it on a
jack stand just we don't have any weight
coming off of the brake line cables so
with the calipers on this the brake pads
themselves that is push out so I'm just
going to push them from the back
and the pad comes loose and you do that
with both sides all right so now we have
the brake pads out and when we put the
new brake pads in it's going to be
thicker than the old brake pads because
the old brake pads are worn down so this
piston right here this piston right here
needs to be compressed in order to make
room for the new brake pads so I'm going
to take a c-clamp and do that all right
as the c-clamp
got one end on the rear of the piston
and then this part on the inside of the
piston we're just going to kind of twist
this and compress it little by little
all the way around the piston until it
gives us enough room to put the brake
pads in and enough room to slide it over
the rotor wants to get rotors on we've
got the new rotor slipped into place got
the old caliper with the new brake pads
placed on to the rotor try not to touch
the surface of the rotor or the surface
of the brake pad just keep them as clean
as possible
and now we're just putting on the 17
millimeter bolts behind the caliper on
the top and the bottom and tighten those
down and you'll be ready to remount the
wheel anyway that's how you change the
brake pads and rotors on a Honda Civic
