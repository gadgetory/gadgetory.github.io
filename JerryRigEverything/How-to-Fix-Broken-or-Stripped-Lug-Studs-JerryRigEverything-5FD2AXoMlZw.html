the lug nut studs on this car you can
see that this one is just snapped
completely off so I'm going to do is I'm
going to move it up and pound it through
so to pop that guy out basically I just
took some Lube spread it on there kind
of round there really quick and then I
just took a normal hammer tap it on a
few sides and then he actually hit it
pretty hard I'm getting some pretty
solid swings at it and then it just pop
the broken stud out of there so now I
have it in the hole these little grooves
right here which kind of help it stay in
once it's in keep it from going in all
the way so if you have a clean shot at
it from the back you can tap it a couple
times with a hammer you just want to
make sure that it comes out you know
perpendicular to the metal part here
what I'm going to do right now see if I
can just pull it through using one of my
nuts right here if you get a washer and
stick it around the edge it'll makes it
so that the nut can pull it through all
the way instead of getting caught right
here where the threads stop because once
the nut gets to here it can't pull it
through anymore because there's no more
threads to grab onto so I'm going to
grab some washers put around there and
just pull it through so instead of
finding a washers I found this little
hook right here that has a big enough
circle on the end that as rotate this it
pulls the stud through instead so I'm
just going to keep on tightening this
down until it's all the way flush with
the back of the metal taking a wrench
that was slightly bigger than the lug
stud slipping it on plus a little metal
ring and also you know just remember
that the washers would do just as good
of a job as this I said want to run to
the store and it has it pulled flush
against the back just like these other
ones are and that is it now I can just
just pop this off
and the magical contraption worked so
you want to do this without the tire in
place because if you put the tire on and
then try to tighten it through here
you're going to end up damaging your rim
anyway that's it that's how you change
your luck study
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
