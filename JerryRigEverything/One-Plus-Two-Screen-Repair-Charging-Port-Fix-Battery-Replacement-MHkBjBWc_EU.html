oneplus to one of the newest phones from
the company oneplus the back is
removable easy enough
you just pop that off with your hands
then there are six rubber caps on top of
the screws remove those two remove the
double SIM card tray and then take your
screwdriver I will link parts and tools
down in the video description so take a
look at those there are 18 screws around
the back of this phone then you can just
lift up the backplate set it off to the
side and this is the best-looking phone
I have ever been inside hit that like
button if you like the giant red battery
then there's a piece of tape over the
battery connection and the charging port
connection so lift that off and then pop
up the two ribbon cable connections
they're like little Legos you can just
lift them up then you can lift the
battery up and out of the phone here is
the battery it is a 3300 milliamp but it
also says on here that it's a minimum of
at 3200 milliamps so I guess they have
some fluctuation in battery quality here
is a charging port ribbon cable you just
lift that up out of the phone that's one
of the best things about this phone is
that the charging port is replaceable
it's usually one of the first things to
go out on a phone besides the battery it
is a Type C charging port it's not the
normal USB once it's very similar to the
new Apple lightning charger where you
can take the charging cable and plug it
in either way whether it's upside down
or right side up there are two little
ribbon cables down here at the bottom
just lift those up off the board and
then there's a wire cable as well lift
that out then the board itself should
pop out from the phone you have the
vibrator motor right here and then
contact points for the loudspeaker here
the loudspeaker is just sitting on the
back of the back plate here is the rear
facing camera just unclip that from the
board and pull it up at an angle this
guy is a 13 megapixel camera capable of
recording in 4k does have video
stabilization as well here's the front
facing camera lift that up and out of
the phone 5 megapixels secure little guy
then there's another piece of tape
holding down these two ribbon cables as
well as a screw on the bottom right of
the motherboard so I'll connect those
ribbon cables as well as this little
wire cable be gentle with it you can pop
that connection off the board and break
it here's some grounding tape on top of
this ribbon cable I'm going to lift that
up gently and then unsnap the ribbon
cable from the board that releases the
motherboard from the frame gonna lift
that out here you can see the
motherboard it's got the dual LED flash
on it as
well as the headphone jack the headphone
jack is not replaceable it also has some
thermal paste on the back I'm assuming
this is for the processor or the memory
to help keep it cool and then here is
the earpiece you can just pop that out
from the main frame as well so here is
the screen it's got the screen itself
the glass the LCD as well as the frame
on the back that holds all the
components in the past one plus has sold
these screens as a unit fused together
with the plastic frame and the glass
hopefully they continue that in the
future now if they don't you're going to
have to heat up the front of the screen
and separate the screen from the frame
and put the frame on your new screen
later you can watch my note 5 screen
replacement video to see the same
process done but hopefully they sell the
screens as a unit because it's a much
easier repair that way go ahead and
reassemble the phone hit that subscribe
button if you'd like what you've seen so
far go ahead and snap those ribbon
cables down into place being careful
with this grounding sticker as well
don't want to rip that and then putting
the tape back on top of the ribbon
cables as well here's the front-facing
camera going to snap that down into
place and just line up a little waffle
connection over the mainboard and press
it down you'll hear it click into place
you'll know it's connected rear camera
goes in the bottom board snaps down into
place be careful with those wire cables
those are very easy to break snapping
the two ribbon cables down and then the
charging port goes back in just kind of
scooch that type-c charging plate down
at the bottom of the frame and the frame
will hold it in place
snap the waffle connector in and then
just set the whole ribbon cable down
into the phone so the battery won't
pinch it or tweak it anywhere when you
put the battery into place once you get
the battery in there snap it down as
well and take that tape that you took
off earlier and set it back down on top
of the two ribbon cable connectors then
the back of the phone snaps in as well
and I'm going to turn on the phone
really quick just to make sure
everything's connected and everything's
working before I put those 18 screws
back into place everything's looking
good so put your dual SIM card tray back
into the back and get those little
rubber circle pieces back on top of
there screw holes back of the phone gets
put on and you are good to go I did do a
durability test in this phone right took
a razor blade and scratch the screen and
tried to bend the phone in half go ahead
and check out that video if you're
interested and check out a couple of my
other teardown videos thanks ton for
watching hit that like button don't
forget to subscribe and I hope to see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
