little bit about the the cooling system
like the radiator and a thermostat on a
Jeep Grand Cherokee this applies towards
a lot of different vehicles though so
first of all we have the radiator cap
here what the radiator cap does is first
of all it allows you know it's a lid for
your radiator but it also is made up
with a few different parts we got the
the spring inside of there is it's
temperature sensitive like when it when
it gets really hot that the spring
contracts and allows this part of it the
lid of it to shrink down inside of it
just like that allowing more space to
pass through the reason it does that is
because you can see here on the radiator
there's a little hose right here so when
the cap is fully on and cool this is
expanded all the way but as soon as the
radiator starts to eat up this contracts
allowing the fluid to escape through
this line and go into the reservoir a
coolant reservoir over there then we
have the thermostat which is kind of the
same concept but this contracts to allow
the coolant to enter into the engine
itself so if you ever get to a point
where your engine or your radiator is
just boiling over with the with the
radiator fluid it's one of these two
parts either the radiator cap or the
thermostat so on the thermostat usually
goes you know towards the top of the
engine in this case it goes right here
inside of this little contraption so the
radiator fluid comes out through here
and goes down but only when the engine
is hot enough so you can get these at
varying degrees this one is the 195 you
can kind of see it right there I replace
mine with a with a lower 101-80
just so I can get the coolant in there
quicker so that's kind of how the the
cooling system works on a Jeep but like
I said it applies towards lots of
different vehicles anyway if you like
you know the information or if you want
to see more videos on that cheap repair
basically anything else go ahead and
feel free to subscribe and that like if
this helped you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
