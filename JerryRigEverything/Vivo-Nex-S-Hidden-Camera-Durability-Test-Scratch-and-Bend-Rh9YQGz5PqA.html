bezel-less Android smartphone with the
motorized pop-up front-facing camera and
in screen fingerprint scanner probably
the most futuristic smartphone we've
tested so far this year even though it
looks epic from the outside I'm honestly
more excited to take this one apart and
review it from the inside but like
always we got to test it first well it's
all in one piece let's get started
right off the bat this thing looks
incredible full screen design with no
not just looks good the colorful edge to
edge display is impressive all by itself
but we aren't really here to talk about
the screen there's so much other weird
tech inside of this phone to check out
starting with that camera
just pops out of the top like a daisy in
springtime it activates by poking out
like an accessory on r2d2 each time I
turn on the front facing camera and then
retracts as soon as I switch back to the
rear camera or exit the app the sound
you hear isn't the actual sound the
hardware is making it's an added effect
there's actually three sounds I'm going
to leave mine muted but if you're
looking to impress your friends or show
off the mechanical extremity of your
phone the extra sound is a nice effect
the extended camera niblet does feel
very solid
there is no wiggle to the block and when
I press down hard on that camera
it'll dip in for just a second and come
back up or retract all the way if I
press in too hard it's still very firm
though and feels like it can handle its
own the only way to know for sure will
be to see how solid those tracks are
from the inside and see how the lifting
mechanism is made but for now it seems
like it can handle normal abuse even
when I try to hold the camera out while
it's pulling itself inside the first
time the motor is strong enough to yank
the camera from my grip but the second
time the gears spin for a second and
then succeed in pulling it back it's
surprisingly strong thumbs up for that
we'll come back to the front camera in a
second but now let's see what else the
phone has to offer it's definitely nice
of evo to include a plastic screen
protector on both sides of the phone any
protection is good protection now we can
start with the scratch test
there is no mention of gorilla glass on
this nexus but since we've made it past
the level three pick we know the screen
is not plastic we start seeing scratches
at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a
level 7 meaning we're looking at
tempered glass sapphire would be a level
8 unless of course it's Apple sapphire
that's still level 6 you might have
noticed that there is no earpiece on
this phone it doesn't pop out with a
robotic camera on top either vevo says
it uses vibrations instead of a speaker
it's definitely a weird thing that
take some getting used to but it works
no matter where you put your ear on the
frame of the phone you can hear sound
emanating from the device kind of like
those bone conduction speakers for
example this is what a normal UPS sounds
like this is coming out of an iPhone 8
it's pretty standard across all smart
phones with a little speaker inside of
the earpiece you can't discern one
smartphone from together just by the
earpiece inside of the phone unless of
course there is no here P speaker inside
of the phone this is what it sounds like
from inside the vivo next s it's done
through vibrations instead of a speaker
and pretty much sounds the same no
matter where you're listening to from
the phone since the vibrations encompass
the whole frame it sounds a lot like a
speakerphone but contained in a much
smaller area another successfully hidden
component is the fingerprint scanner
hidden underneath the display I tested
this previously with the vivo x20 and
even with scratches on the glass the
vivo NEX s still functions hiding the
scanner under the screen is pretty
impressive technologically and
physically I made a super in-depth video
on what that particular component looks
like with the vivo x20 it's pretty
magical with a close-up look at this
next display you can't even see where
the scanner is hidden so they're doing a
pretty good job
besides the phone are made from metal
including the volume button and power
button at the top of the phone we have
our headphone jack which is incredible
vivo has a bezel is notch less phone and
still includes that headphone jack while
Apple's over there claiming there's no
room and dongles are the way to the
future last time I checked Apple's sold
23 different dongles so you know what
direction Apple's taking their
innovation taking a closer look at the
front facing 8 megapixel camera the
metal housing is solid with no loose
movements in any direction but camera
lens is made from glass which is
important because aluminum is lower on
the hardness scale than glasses which
means no matter how many times the lens
extrudes out of the phone it won't ever
get scratched up by the metal right next
to it even if it ends up rubbing a bit a
scratched up camera lens would be
annoying the back of the camera has more
metal and a little auto lifting logo on
the back I'm still excited to see it
from the inside but I'll be patient this
phone is not water-resistant by the way
the deboned X has a textured assistant
button on the
this guy's name is Jovi I don't know
what his competency level is compared to
Bixby Siri or Google but he is there
permanently the bottom of the phone has
our standard USB C charging port and the
dual SIM card tray fun fact if you ever
stick your little tool in the wrong hole
like this little microphone hole here
right off to the side of the tray
it probably won't cause any damage since
the microphones are placed off at an
angle inside the phone and the tool only
goes straight in the psychedelic back
panel is pretty intense
instead of evo just picking one color we
get all the colors it is glass which
makes me think that a clear phone might
be a real possibility I'll have to give
that a try
let me know in the comments if you want
to see that one one thing I would change
is that this camera setup is doing the
whole depth sensor blurred background
thing I still prefer an extra telephoto
or wide-angle camera lens over a blurred
background feature a blurred background
can basically be accomplished with just
one lens anyway the dual color LED flash
is also under the glass on this one and
now for the burn test this Walt wall 6.6
inch AMOLED display lasted quite a while
my burn test is basically a mandatory
yet semi pointless stepping stone to get
to the next event
kind of like what algebra is to
graduation the next lasted an impressive
16 seconds under the heat from my
lighter
which coincidentally is about how long I
lasted in math class hit that subscribe
button if you haven't yet the structural
bin test is next we'll see if the
motorized rails inside the frame
compromise the structural integrity of
the phone there is a little more Bend
than I'm comfortable seeing but still no
cracked glass or catastrophic failure no
matter what side the pressure is applied
from so I am very pleased to report that
this technologically advanced metal and
glass sandwich passes my durability test
even the protruding bits phones passing
my test is a very good thing it means
that manufacturers are putting thought
into the construction and the longevity
of our devices which is good for us as
consumers and our wallets but also the
planet phones are pretty hard to recycle
so the longer they last the better now
we just need vivo to bring their stuff
here to the United States only China
India Russia Malaysia Hong Kong and
Taiwan get the cool phones at the moment
no US or UK unfortunately I'll keep the
description updated if that changes and
coming out me on Twitter and Instagram
thanks dumb for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
