keep people out of their phones Steve
Jobs himself said he didn't want people
fiddling around inside the iPhone which
is why they've all been sealed shut and
hard to repair from day one but that's
never stopped us before it's time to
open up the brand new iPhone 10's max
and see what new obstacles Apple is
placed in our way this video has been
sponsored by audible let's get started
grab some popcorn this video might be a
long one turning the phone off is done
with a volume button and power button
combo press kind of exciting
then we encountered the proprietary
pentalobe screw Apple implemented back
with the iPhone 4s the inexpensive
toolkit I'll link in the description
includes all the bits you'll need for
this phone repair Apple uses four
different styles of screw this time
around and they're all different sizes
I'm keeping everything super organized
so hopefully it'll all go back together
in one piece and turn on when I'm done
opening up the phone is easy enough a
large suction cup helps Apple has
upgraded their water resistance to ip68
this year finally matching the rating
Samsung's had for the past two years you
can see the stringy black waterproofing
adhesive holding the screen to the metal
phone body it's kind of all over the
place remember there's a lot of things
that can be damaged inside an iPhone so
I'm taking special care to insert only
the tip of my tool inside the screen is
lashed up at the top and needs to be
pulled down ever so slightly before
folding open like a book the ribbon
cables along the right side are the main
thing to avoid while opening any stress
or Nick's on those cables would ruin the
display and we just don't want that to
remove the screen Apple added an
obstacle with seven uncommon flimsy try
point why triple zero screws
luckily my tool kit comes with all these
hard to find bits already included I'll
set the different size screws right next
to the bracket they came from that way
things stay organized before I unplug
that crazy dual cell l-shaped battery
though Dustin one of my buddies tweeted
that if you feel like the dumbest person
in a room then you're in the correct
room this was one of the reasons I chose
to read astrophysics for people in a
hurry by Neil deGrasse Tyson this week
huge thanks to audible for sponsoring
this video if you want an incredibly
detailed intellectual description of the
universe and how all the elements
exploded into a
distance like the lithium inside this
iPhone battery astrophysics for people
in a hurry is it worthwhile listen you
can get your free copy with a 30-day
trial of audible using the code
jerry-rigged I'll link it in the
description or just go to audible.com
slash jerry-rigged texting the word
jerry-rigged to 500 500 works to je r ry
RI g even if you cancel your audible
subscription you still get to keep all
your books
astrophysics might sound complicated but
it's an incredibly interesting summary
about our place in the cosmos and like I
said earlier if you feel like the
dumbest person in the room you're in the
right room don't forgive let's unplug
that battery and get the screen off one
Lego style connector for the battery and
each of the three ribbons attached to
the screen has their own Lego style
connectors as well then the whole screen
can pull away from the foam body super
simple Apple screens are much easier to
replace than they used to be with only
three more screws holding on to the
front earpiece there are no home buttons
or fragile fingerprint scanner cables
that we have to worry about now
everything just kind of folds out at the
top of the screen like some funky
origami a link replacement parts in the
video description as they become
available I'll get everything pressed
back into place and even though I did
need special screwdriver bits a screen
replacement is a pretty simple process
things only start getting super
complicated in the iPhone XS max when I
dig deeper into the phone I'll set the
screen off to the side it's time to
remove the battery Apple was nice enough
to include the magic pull tabs holding
in each half of the battery one massive
pull tab up top
and three other magic pull-tabs under
the bottom segment
once all the pull tabs are removed
there's nothing else holding the battery
in place so make sure it doesn't get
away from you
batteries can be super dangerous if
punctured the combined power of both
cells in this battery has 3,100 milliamp
hours about 22 percent smaller than the
Samsung Note 9 but who's keeping track
there's nothing else super easy to
replace inside of this phone which is
mostly fine since the screen and battery
are usually the first things that go out
or break on a smartphone we'll talk
about the back glass replacement in a
second first let's pull out the rear
camera units with two Phillips head
screws holding down the large rectangle
metal plate I'll set that off to the
side and unclip both camera units each
of these 12 megapixel cameras are placed
in the same metal housing for that fluid
transition from a normal perspective to
the 2 times optical zoom lens both
camera units have optical image
stabilization that physical oh is the
iPhone cameras are actually pretty
phenomenal I'm always impressed by their
image quality before I say too many nice
things though let me plug the cameras
back into the phone and show you how
hard a simple charging port replacement
is the charging port nowadays in an
iPhone is taking double duty as a
headphone jack and a place to charge the
phone so it's getting quite a bit of
traffic this means that it might
eventually stop working in order to
replace the charging port everything
else needs to come out of the phone
which is a super poor design a design
which could very easily be remedied by
moving the charging port connector from
the middle of the motherboard to the
bottom like Samsung and every other
phone manufacturer does why tangle
everything up if it doesn't need to be i
pulled five tripoint screws out of the
metal strip along the bottom and set
that off to the side next to each other
there's another tiny screw over the
small metal bracket protecting a Lego
style ribbon connector and then using a
flathead screwdriver I was able to take
out yet another style of screw called a
standoff where one screw screws into
another screw inception screw there's
another screw within a screw on the
right-hand side of the loudspeaker and a
regular Phillips head down at the bottom
and the whole loudspeaker can pull away
from the phone body with an exceptional
amount of adhesive holding the mouth to
the frame I definitely won't trust my
phone to be water-resistant after this
but it's still cool to see from the
inside
the taptic vibration motor has two
screws on the left and it'll pull out I
still haven't taken one of these apart
yet if there's any interest in me making
a vibrator teardown review video let me
know down in the comments the
motherboard removal isn't as complicated
as it looks it only has four screws
holding it in place and a whole highway
of Lego style ribbon connectors lining
the center I'm still keeping my screws
organized because there's no way this
phone is going back together if the
screws get all jumbled up each one is
different all of the motherboard
connections need to be unclip with my
plastic pry tool and the stupidly placed
massive one dead center on the
motherboard is the charging port ribbon
I'll remove the SIM card tray making
sure the tiny little extraction pin is
recessed back into the phone frame so it
doesn't block the motherboard then I'll
unclip the last two tiny ribbon cables
up at the top of the motherboard then
the whole thing can come free from the
phone this tiny little guy is the brains
and brawn of the entire iPhone 10s max
it's a double stack to sandwich PCB with
no heat dissipation but don't worry the
only time you'll ever get throttled is
when the next iPhone comes out and Apple
needs you to upgrade true story we're
almost to the charging port I bet you
forgot what we were even trying to do
since we had to remove literally
everything else to get here one screw
holds an obstructing ribbon to the side
wall and then we have three more stand
off screws one on either side of the
Lightning charging port and one next to
the plastic microphone support I'll peel
the microphones off the bottom sidewall
and you might think we're done but nope
two more screws hold the port itself
into the frame once those are removed
now the whole charging port contraption
can pull away from the phone apples
little proprietary money making port has
a little adhesive around the tip but no
rubber rings but with how tight the
screws are against that plastic adhesive
and metal phone frame there's definitely
no water getting inside that was an
extraordinary amount of work for such a
simple port the reason Apple charges 599
dollars to replace the back glass is
because the back glass is impossible to
replace Apple themselves swap out the
whole frame in housing instead of just
the back glass and you're right that
seems incredibly inefficient and an
incredible amount of work but that's how
they built it it doesn't bug Apple at
all though it's just their way of
coercing you into buying a new phone
instead of fixing the old one say
goodbye to your wallet for me I'll
snuggle the motherboard back into place
underneath
those ribbon connectors it's time to see
if we can get this thing turned on again
I feel like it's important to use and
fix your phone for as long as possible
especially now that the new phones
released every year only have very minor
upgrades over previous years upgrading
your phone every year is just dumb and a
waste of money I've got all the ribbon
cables plugged back into the motherboard
along with its four screws holding the
board itself into the phone then I'll
mosey on down past the large circular
wireless charging pad in the center of
the phone to the taptic engine vibrator
at the bottom the SIM card tray pops
into place and the loudspeaker with its
standoff screws the silver brackets get
screwed down in overall the bottom
components with those same try point
screws we kept organized earlier and the
rectangular rear metal camera bracket
get screwed in over the top of the
cameras finally we get the battery back
into place it's important to use new
adhesive it's starting to look like a
real phone again the screens three
ribbon cables get plugged into the
motherboard connector highway and I'll
plug in the battery to test the phone
and make sure everything is working
before setting the screen into place I
am pretty surprised it all still works
Apple has not made this process easy
lastly the metal brackets with the seven
tripoint screws holding everything tight
and finally the screen tucks into the
top of the frame first before snapping
into place all along the sides can't say
I'm a fan of this phone but I am glad
the screen and battery of placements are
relatively easy would you ever attempt
this project yourself don't forget to
grab your free copy of astrophysics for
people in a hurry from the link in the
description you'll enjoy it I sure did
hit that subscribe button and thanks a
ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
