inexpensive device that claims to be the
world's most secure Android smartphone
but is it durable that's what my youtube
channel is here to find out
I do durability tests on every new
smartphone that comes out I even tested
this phone's keyboard predecessor last
year the BlackBerry prif build quality
and durability are important aspects to
consider when picking a phone that
you'll be carrying around for the next
12 to 24 months so let's see how the D
Tech 50 holds up I'll start with the
scratch test I have a set of mineral
pics that tell me where the screen falls
on Mohs scale of hardness most flagships
use tempered glass or Gorilla Glass
which falls at a level 6 on the hardness
scale some phone screens are plastic
like the galaxy s7 active and scratch a
level 3 luckily this phone is using a
scratch resistant glass and scores a
level 6 with a deeper groove at a level
7 right on par with the more expensive
flagships keys and coins will do nothing
to this screen my razor blade won't even
leave a mark over this front-facing
camera here is the first strange thing
that I found with the BlackBerry I
anticipated that the speaker grills were
going to be plastic since that's what
they look like on the outside but in
reality it is just a thick sticker like
a piece of vinyl and it comes off pretty
easily
think about the sticker rubbing around
in your pocket for two years even if it
is slightly embedded in the frame there
is a good chance that it might come off
heat also effects stickers and vinyl so
leaving your phone in a car on a hot
sunny day you might come back to a grill
this earpiece the fun doesn't stop there
though the bottom grille is also made
from the same material but wait there's
more the back of the phone looks like it
has two speakers at the top and the
bottom but it's actually very solid
underneath both of the stickers the
holes are purely for decoration
I don't blame blackberry for this though
it is more cost-effective to order four
of the same sticker than it is to have
variations and this phone is a budget
mid-range device anyway what do you
think of the stickers let me know down
in the comments it is the first time
we've seen this approach to speaker
coverings now the back of this phone has
a thick rubber layer which feels
surprisingly good after reviewing so
many glass and metal phone
I'm definitely not opposed to the feel
of this material while the BlackBerry
Prive had a soft smooth rubber like a
bike inner tube the D Tech 50 feels more
like a super grippy basketball rubber
doesn't hold up very well against my
razor blades but it is incredibly
resilient to my keys which would be a
much more common nemesis now the camera
lens this lens is actually made of glass
there are benefits to both plastic
lenses and glass lenses a glass lens is
way more scratch resistant but it also
has the possibility of shattering when
dropped a plastic lens like the one on
the BlackBerry Prive would be much more
shatter resistant if dropped but it
scratches very easily I personally
prefer glass lenses on a cell phone but
I can see the benefits both ways which
one do you prefer glass or plastic the
frosted dual tone flash is covered in
plastic but that's totally normal and a
non-issue scratches don't matter as much
on an LED covering I was pleasantly
surprised that all the buttons were made
of metal along with the size of the
device it is metal all the way around
the phone which goes a long way for
durability there is plastic leading up
to the metal on either sides of the
bumper but the phone feels solid and we
still get to enjoy the beautiful
scratching noise now it's time to cook
the BlackBerry this phone has a 5.2 inch
1080p IPS LCD display if you understood
that sentence give a thumbs up and pat
yourself on the back
the older blackberry Prive had an AMOLED
display and while it's totally personal
preference which kind of screen you
prefer when it comes to fire an AMOLED
display will turn white and usually not
recover an LCD display like this one
turns off with the heat but then fully
recovers which is pretty cool I'd also
like to remind the viewers that I am a
professional phone burner and you should
not try this at home now for the bin
test for a device as inexpensive as this
I was expecting the bin test to be a
total catastrophe and but in reality the
device is super solid it has a very
minor flex to it but then the phone
locks out and doesn't let me bend it any
farther it remains fully functional even
when I pressed from the screen side the
phone does not snap in half so overall
this phone passes my durability test
from a durability perspective I would
recommend this phone its biggest flaw is
the speaker grille stickers but if you
can get over that the back rubber is
probably more resilient than metal or
glass and the metal frame will keep it
from bending in your back pocket if
you're a sit on your phone type of
person it is a solid phone
I plan on doing a year-end summary video
of every phone that I've tested so far
this year so hit the subscribe button
and make sure your notifications are
turned on so you don't miss that video
which phone do you think is the most
durable this year let me know in the
comments bonus points are follow me on
Instagram and Twitter I gave away a 1 +
3 T last week to one of my lucky Twitter
followers thanks a ton for watching I'll
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
