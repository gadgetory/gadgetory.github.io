Galaxy s7 active it costs $100 more than
the regular Galaxy s7 and is only
available on one carrier in the USA at
the moment so let's see how it survives
my tests I have a set of pics that let
me know where the scratch resistance of
the screen falls on Mohs scale of
hardness a level 1 would be the
equivalent of talc powder and a level 10
is a diamond each pick has a different
material on the tip to differentiate
between the levels of hardness the vast
majority of cell phones that I have
tested end up scratching at level 6
unfortunately this galaxy s7 active
scratched at a level 3 the screen is
made of plastic and that's how it gets
its shadow resistance plastic doesn't
crack and shatter like glass does I have
the droid turbo 2 here as well and it
has the same technology a plastic screen
that scratches at a level 3 the s7
definitely feels less like plastic than
the droid turbo 2 I didn't think the
screen was plastic the first time I
picked it up motorola does sell
replacement top layers for their phone
though and as far as I know Samsung does
not anything metal will scratch the new
s7 active keys do scratch the screen
scissors also scratch the screen and
basically anything but this plastic Lego
leg will scratch the screen so keep this
military-grade phone out of your purse
unless you want to damage it let's test
the scratch resistance of the
fingerprint scanner it is covered in
paint just like the other fingerprint
scanners that I've tested in the past it
does scratch a lot if I would have
stopped scratching after the paint layer
there is a good chance that the scanner
would have still functioned but my
scratches went into the cop brush layer
underneath the paint which killed any
chance of the scanner functioning later
on it would not even recognize my
fingerprint even after attempting with
multiple fingers the size of the s7
active are made of metal
there is a light coat of paint but no
thick plastic or primer covering so it
does feel nice in your hands the buttons
and SIM card tray are also metal the
back panel has a rubbery feel to it and
the sides are covered in an extremely
thick rubber coating before this test I
just assumed that the rubber would
surround an internal metal housing but I
was
wrong it is just solid rubber on the
sides when the rubber is broken which
was difficult to do even with my razor
blade the internal components of the
phone are exposed the camera lens is
made of real glass and won't be
scratched by metal objects like keys or
razor blades
it is also protected by a little lip
around the edge of the lens so setting
it on a table or dropping it wouldn't be
a big deal for the lens and probably
won't break on the regular s7 the lens
protrudes out of the back of the phone
let's give a thumbs up for the active
improving on the lens design onto the
burn test this phone lasted 13 seconds
with the flame directly applied to the
screen but listen close the plastic
screen melts and pops the thick plastic
kept the heat from getting to the screen
and discoloring anything like it did on
the s7 edge but the plastic is now
permanently melted kind of interesting
this is where it would be nice as
Samsung sold replacement top layers like
Motorola does either way just make sure
no hot coals or embers fall on your
screen while you're camping onto the bin
test I've tested over 24 high-end
smartphones now it is an expensive hobby
most every single phone survives the bin
test I've only had three phones
catastrophic we fail make sure your
subscribe so you won't miss any of my
future tests it is totally free the
galaxy s7 active is one of the strongest
phones that I've tested so far there is
no flex in the device not even when I
try and kink the top edge the iPhone 6
would always flex and kink along the top
but this phone is incredibly sturdy even
with that chunk of rubber missing from
the site it'll be interesting to see
during the teardown what makes this
phone so strong remember that Samsung
says the phone is ip68 water-resistant
pay attention to the word resistant just
like with the galaxy s7 it is not
waterproof and Samsung will not warranty
water damage or screen damage Samsung is
not guaranteeing anything
it is only resistant to that damage with
each phone you win some and you lose
some if you don't mind spending an extra
hundred bucks on an exclusive carrier
for a shatterproof very scratch able
phone this is the phone for you check
out the galaxy s7 edge durability test
video and the video where I explain more
about how exactly the galaxy s7 series
is water resistant
thanks a ton for watching hope to see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
