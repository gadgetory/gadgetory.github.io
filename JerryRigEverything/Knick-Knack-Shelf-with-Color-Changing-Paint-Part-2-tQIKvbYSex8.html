is that right there we pretty much use
the whole sheet of plywood anyway
now he's got to mark those slots the
instructions or the the plan say that
you got to measure out the distance
halfway and just cut it halfway every
time there's a slot so I believe the tin
the big ones are ten inches across so
the slot goes five inches deep at the
biggest part he's got to remeasure it
each time
all right now we're just taking the the
stencils and the boards themselves and
just make a little marks where the spots
are going to line up at so I just leave
my stencil on top of the board and I
slide it up a little bit to do the
bottom marks and I slide it down just a
bit do the top marks making sure it's
all even all the way around I worried on
the stack of small boards one of the
medium ones that is going to keep on
going so in right now is I'm marking the
cutouts you can see on that board the
lines that have been made so I can know
where I need to make each of the slots
so what I'm doing because I'm taking
each of these little marks that I made
with my stencil before and I'm lining
this board up that is one of the scrap
pieces with the lines with the marks was
one there and there's one there on the
other side that you can see and I had
the top end up as well and I just take a
pencil I'm going to right along the
bottom of that just like that and that's
what makes those marks all straight so
you cannot keep the slots you know where
they're supposed to be because this
whole thing has got to be pretty spot-on
with the measurements otherwise it's not
going to fit
okay so we're making progress so let me
tell you what I've been doing up to this
point and I've taken the boards
themselves and I've marked the midpoint
on each of the stripes where you're
putting the slot I did them if you take
the whole measurement you can see that
this one is eight a little over eight
and an eight so what I did is it doesn't
you want the slot to actually be a
little bit longer than normal so I just
did barely over four on that just
because it want the bigger end of the
half you know it only by like an eighth
of an inch but the bigger end of the
half to be here so when you cut it it
slides down easy like let's say with
each of the marks you're going to have
four with the over cuts no sorry so
there's four of each pieces the big the
medium into small so there's going to be
two with the slots on top and then two
with the slots on bottom so that they
kind of mesh together when you're
putting the whole thing together like
this the ones with the slots on the top
so you can see this one has a groove in
the top right here so that slides
underneath this one they're really hard
to get underneath if the angles aren't
perfect so you want to cut just a little
bit big like let's say you know how it
drew the lines on it you want to cut
right on those lines so you have a
little bit of space to wiggle you know
obviously it depends on you know how
good you are with us on everything you
can do it however you want so when I
take the skill saw well I guess jigsaw
how I cut them out let's say I was going
to do this one I would come along this
line here with the jigsaw now it hit
this spot right here and I'd back up and
then I'd curve in like this and cut that
and I curve in again and cut that curve
in again and cut that that way I have a
gap right here where I can put the
jigsaw in and cut straight across right
here and I have this kind of hole shape
cut out and then I come in on this side
that just drops the hole
don't go because what I've done right
here I came in straight and then I
backed up and then I cut right there all
the way the center line then I cut out
those chumps just like that and that
leaves it just big enough for my saw
blade to fit in just down there like
that and then I can cut straight across
like I mentioned before
all right we're making some serious
progress we've come a long way since we
came from that string tied to the drill
day so anyway everything's uh put
together right now well I'm probably
going to do is just get some sandpaper
and kind of smooth some edges um if you
look really closely sometimes there's
like little gaps and stuff right there
there's one um I bought some caulk and
stuff like that I'll probably go through
and kind of clean that up just fill the
gaps and stuff like that I think it
looks BRE darn good just make sure all
your cuts are pretty right on I thought
it would be you know harder to put the
pieces in the farther you got out from
the center but it's actually easier to
put the end pieces in
all right so I just went through
um just hit some of the bigger holes and
stuff with the bulk nothing too big I
guess you could go through and you know
hit every corner if you wanted to make
it all uniform to me it's not that big
of a deal my all my cuts are pretty
pretty tight anyway so yeah I was going
to go put a base coat on it right now
black and then I bought another paint
can that's kind of cools this colour
changing paint so it kind of goes from
black to green just kind of depends on
what type of light you're in anyway
yeah that's what you get when I you
don't have a girlfriend don't live with
your mom you can pick your own paint
colors alright so apparently you can't
paint this thing laying down very well
this gray paint doesn't go down in those
cracks so I came out here propped it up
with the hold curtain from a bath like a
little bastard and rod so now I have
access to both sides and I'll be able to
paint a little bit easier so one thing
when you're painting it make sure that
the back ends all line up like all these
little cross sections so that you're not
you don't have you're hitting all the
surface area that you're going to have
actually showing I'm when it's up
against your wall it's like let's say if
this board was like an inch this
direction then if you painted it when
you put it back into place there would
be extra showing on this side anyway so
I've got all the black paint on just the
base coat so I'm going to go ahead and
let it dry for a second and then put on
the next coat of the colored paint the
cool stuff so it took up a cans of spray
paint which is a lot more than I thought
it would be but we're finally finished
so this is what the shelves finally look
like hopefully you get kind of a idea
for how the color changing stuff works
so yeah so that's how you make the
shells a guy do now is just mount them
it's kind of a side profile of them so
yeah so if you have any questions or
anything else make sure to leave them in
the comments I do put up videos and
every week or so so if you like what you
see go ahead and subscribe and that's it
thanks do things that I would do
differently never have to do it over
again one is I would probably use a
different type of wood I would use the
same stencils
but dude out of a board that's more you
know that's supposed to be made into
shells these ones are really hard to fit
at a one piece of plywood if you're you
if you are going to do that a one piece
of plywood make sure that you cut as
close to the lines as possible I put
them like almost right on each other the
stencils so that you know one cut will
hit two stencils at some point if that
makes sense just because like if you
lead even a millimeter of gap between
the two even if you have I could super
fine pencil it'll it is almost don't
even fit so I you know made my word
fairy to just a little bit yeah let's
come onto the model piece of plywood I
heard the other guy who did this he
actually took off I believe a centimeter
at the bottom which made the entire
shelf smaller which is good the shells
are pretty huge by themselves yeah those
few things are done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
