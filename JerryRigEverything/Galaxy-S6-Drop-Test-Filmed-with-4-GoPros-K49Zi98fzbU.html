of the galaxy s6 yesterday I filmed a
video of the bin test scratch test and
flame tests you can go ahead and watch
that video here normally I'm much less
destructive much more constructive and I
film videos of how to repair cellphones
so if you want to see the inside of the
galaxy s6 go ahead and click this video
here and I will show you the teardown in
repair video to film this drop test I
have 4 GoPros GoPro 4 - GoPro three
blacks and a GoPro - on all of them are
filming in slow motion I figured the
drops that happen most often with cell
phones are when you're pulling it out of
your pocket and it slips out of your
hands and drops to the ground so that's
how I'm gonna film it today simulating
an out of pocket grab and then just
dropping it straight down onto the
ground in the middle of the GoPros
everything on this phone is working
perfectly fine got the dial pad I'm on
button top drop down everything is
recording so here we go so far no damage
nothing on the back nothing on the front
let's try it again
it's about waist height
still nothing to drops down this one's
about shoulder height
still nothing let's go again this one's
about head height still nothing
all right let's try a facedown drop from
head height
I finally got some crackage their back
is still fine front has those cracks all
along the side of the screen took a head
height face down drop to do that though
let's see if we can do the back from
waist high back is still fine head
height back drop and the back is still
good overall it survived the first four
drops which I'm pretty impressed with
even though the foam is probably a
little bit structurally compromised when
I was bending it with my hands it still
survived the first couple drops I will
put a link here for the bin test video
as well as the instructional repair
video on this side over here anyway if
you have any questions go and leave
those in the comments don't forget to
like this video if you found it
interesting and thanks for subscribing
that's helped me out a lot
