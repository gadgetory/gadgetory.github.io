happened is down there on my flywheel
the engine had ceased I wasn't able to
turn the flywheel at all to unscrew the
torque converter you slide under here
and show you what's going on right up in
here this big round thing is a torque
converter this is the flywheel I'm on
the flywheel there's little bolts so
those are the bolts they go out of the
flywheel
um they were sense that it sees it
wouldn't spin so I only get three of the
four out so I had to just pull the whole
torque converter out with the with the
flywheel um most people on the internet
said not to do it that way but we'll see
if it works
also to pull it straight out the motor
mount was getting in our way so we just
went ahead just deke detached the motor
mount to make it a easier I believe
those was a 15 millimeter bolt this came
right out and there's as we went we just
made sure to disconnect all the extra
wires and stuff there's another one down
here by the oil filter the fuel line was
also given us some issues what I did is
I came in up to the fuel line and I
undid this little screw I'll show you on
this other engine on the fuel line it's
a little bit different
you'd undo this and release all the
pressure inside and I disconnected these
and then I disconnected the hose I did
to left it connected as well because
it's pressurized and I didn't want to
deal with attaching a whole new hose to
it anyway as far as connecting the
engine to the hoist goes now I might
just use these big bolts right here a
little chain and then O'Reilly Auto
Parts was pretty cool I'll just do it
the deposit with them and then they give
me a lift
350 bucks and then when I return the
lift they give me back my tip
is it so kind of like renting for free
anyway other than that we're just about
to clear the whole thing so that's about
it all right so now that it's in the
back of my back we can work on taking
apart the torque converter as you can
see down inside that crack is the bolts
the torque converter still hasn't spin
it just because the ease engine is
seized up you can see this hole right
here and that would explain why it's not
turning same here hole on this side
anyway um I can get my wrench down in
there though and you can see that I'm
turning the bolts so hopefully I get
those turned enough to get the whole
torque converter off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
