SC's home button falls on Mohs scale of
hardness to let you know it does scratch
at a level eight if you're confused as
to what I'm talking about go ahead and
hit that link in the upper right corner
today we're gonna replace the screen on
the iPhone se it is the exact same
process as the iPhone 5s there's two
pentalobe screws down at the bottom
remove those and then using a suction
cup and a very thin pry tool pry up on
the edge of the screen and the edge of
the phone make sure not to put any
pressure on the glass only crack could
open a tiny bit and I'll show you why
first thing there's a little groove here
on the frame for your pry tool makes it
a little bit easier and then there's a
little silly ribbon cable attached to
the home button that plugs into the
board down by the charging port I'll
show you how to deal with that there's a
little metal flap down here at the
bottom that you lift up if you lose this
little metal flap I will link
replacement parts down in the video
description same thing with the tools
that you'll need then you can unsnap
that little ribbon from the mainboard
there are six screws you're going to
remove from the phone two down here by
the battery we're going to disconnect
that before we remove the screen just so
there's no power going through it we're
going to move the top metal plate and
then there's three ribbing cables that
we're going to unsnap from the main
board these are very similar to the
Legos we're just going to pop those off
with a plastic pry tool this top ribbon
cables for the camera so you don't need
to worry about that there's two screws
that hold down the earpiece there's a
little side latch that also holds it in
place set those off to the side and make
sure to keep your screws organized they
are different sizes and you don't want
to put them in the wrong spot down here
by the home button there is a little
metal doohickey make sure you don't lose
that there's two more screws by the
metal plate pull that away and set that
next to the screws I usually press the
home button out through the backside
making sure not to tear any of the
ribbon cables it is very fragile so be
careful separate the glue from the back
frame instead of just pulling up on the
wire itself there's two screws here at
the side one at the top and then another
two screws on the other side of the
screen that's going to remove the back
metal plate then there's the front
camera and sensors I'm going to leave
those taped to the back metal plates I'm
going to transfer this over to my new
replacement screen but if you need to
pull it off just be very careful if the
copper sticker rips you can just stick
it back together copper touching copper
and everything will be fine so this is
the screen component we have the LCD and
we have the glass and we have the frame
it's all sold as one unit and this is
the easiest way to replace the screen on
your iPhone now if you want to attempt a
I only repair I strongly suggest you do
not but it is possible go ahead and
click the link in the upper corner to
see how that is done let's reassemble
the screen we're going to put the back
metal plate into place set the front
sensors and camera into place and you
can see these little Springs that just
touch the contact points on the earpiece
we're going to rest those on top of each
other and then set the bracket over the
earpiece and screw it into place with
those two screws it should fit easily
and there should be nothing sticking up
one more screw at the top of the top
plate and then we're going to put the
home button back in has the back metal
bracket set that into place then this
tiny screw screws into the back plate
make sure little doohickey is facing up
you don't want that pinch down
underneath the little ribbon cable get
the back plate screw it in with the two
screws on either side and then we're
going to plug in the screen there's the
three ribbon cables once those three
ribbon cables are in we're going to plug
in the battery and before putting the
metal plates on we're going to test and
see if the screen works it should
function as normal right now if there
are lines or if your screen is gray
there's a good chance that the ribbon
cables do not have a good connection
with the main board so disconnect the
battery pop off those cables reseat them
and try again if it's still not working
there's a chance you got a bad
replacement screen mine is working vines
I'm going to go ahead and set those
metal plates back into place and screw
them in now I'm going to reseat the top
of the phone into the frame and this
will keep it stable while we're working
on the silly little ribbon cable down
here at the bottom you're going to hate
this thing what I show here in just a
few seconds is actually much more
difficult in real life I'm going to seat
the ribbon cable right above its
connector on the charging port and snap
it down just like a little Lego and then
this is a bad angle but you can see the
little metal part I put the top end
first towards the top of the phone and
then snap in the bottom part after after
I line it up with the edge of the groove
remember if you lose these I will put
replacement parts screens and itty bitty
metal bits down in the video description
make sure the top of the screen is
seated and then you can press each side
down into the frame body turn it on and
everything works now I have heard that
the iPhone 5s screens are entirely
compatible with the iPhone se it's
pretty much the same phone just with the
faster processor and better camera if
you have any questions leave them in the
comments get those bottom two screws in
