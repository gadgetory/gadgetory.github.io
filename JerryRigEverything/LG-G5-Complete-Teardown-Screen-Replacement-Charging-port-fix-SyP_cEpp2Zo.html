build quality from inside the LG g5 I
will show you how all the components
replace like the charging port in the
screen when I picked up the LG g5 for
the first time I just assumed it was
plastic by the pure feel and weight of
the phone it felt like plastic it was
not until later when I checked LG's
advertising and they said it was metal
so let's see what's going on pop out the
battery holster there's two screws that
you can see visibly from inside the
phone and then the rest of this is very
similar to HTC m9 if you've ever taken
apart that phone it's going to be almost
the exact same the screen is held in by
pure friction and force to the inside of
this frame luckily I have quite a few
pry tools to help me out along with the
process when I pry between the frame of
the screen and the frame of the phone
I'm making sure not to put any pressure
on the glass or the LCD because that's
how it will break now if you are
replacing your own screen it doesn't
matter as much but you still don't want
to damage anything inside the phone so
be careful when you're prying the screen
now now that we've lifted away the
screen from the metal body we can check
to see what this thing is really made of
so I'm taking my razor blade and shaving
away the back and it's pure plastic up
to this point there is no metal until
you get very deep inside the phone and
now you can see a glint of silver this
is aluminum down there inside the body
so when you're touching the phone you're
touching plastic a thick layer of
plastic here on the underside of the
phone the inside is metal but you can
see along the edges down at the bottom
that is plastic as well I'm not sure
what the thought process here was
because it definitely doesn't feel
premium and I don't feel like it should
be advertised as a pure metal phone
here's a spring-loaded sensor to tell
the batteries in place also the sensors
for the fingerprint scanner the
headphone jack the vibrator and the
power button those all rest against
contacts on the motherboard there are
six screws they need to take out on the
backside Phillips head then we're going
to move the screen ribbon cable and
snaps like a little Lego the
front-facing camera is eight megapixel
and snap that ribbon cable as well as
the rear camera both of those just
unsnap like Legos the other rear camera
the 16 megapixel also Ensign app from
the motherboard here you can see the OIS
the image stabilization inside of the
eight megapixel rear camera and this is
the 16 megapixel camera with the
wide-angle lens
you can see the GoPro effect it has
there on the glass now this is the
screen LG usually sells their screens
with the frame intact which makes it
really easy and their screens are
relatively cheap LG is one of the most
cost-effective phones to repair so when
you're going to buy the replacement part
which I will link in the video
description you want to get the one with
the frame attached to it it makes the
whole repair process a lot easier
you don't need heat or extra glue or
anything weird like that putting the
cameras back into place snapping them
back onto the motherboard you'll feel it
connect just like a little Lego right
onto the board putting the eight
megapixel front camera back into place
there are six screws around that
backside snapping the eight megapixel
rear camera in place and the screen
ribbon cable onto the mainboard
I'm going to line up the top and press
that in and then be very careful when
you're placing your new screen down into
the phone because you can crack it
during this process I'm going to set it
in gently and then I'm going to use my
pry tool put a little pressure against
the frame of the screen and the frame of
the phone to set that down into the
little groove where it belongs once both
sides are flush you can put the SIM card
tray and SD card tray back in and put
those two screws in down at the bottom
now if your charging port is fine just
put the thing back together again you're
good to go I'm going to show you how to
replace the charging port though there's
two screws down here at the bottom with
the batteries unsnap from that bottom
part and it's kind of the same concept
as the rest of the phone you pull away
the metal shell housing from the bottom
once that's off there's one more screw
remove the top plastic housing and then
the charging port can just slip out away
from the plastic that it's in and this
is the part that plugs into the wall and
then that little white part of the top
plugs into the phone itself pretty
straightforward putting it all back
together again one last screw put in the
housing back into place get those two
screws in at the bottom and then clip
the battery back into place and then you
can press it into the phone this phone
definitely does not feel premium whether
it's a metal housing covered in plastic
or not it definitely does not feel like
metal especially with that thick of a
plastic coating if you have any
questions leave them down in the
