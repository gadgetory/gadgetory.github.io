new truck is more fun than the actual
getting of the new truck I've driven the
same truck for about six or seven years
now this is a 98 Tacoma and I've loved
it and it's still running like a
champion has about two hundred and fifty
thousand miles on it it's been a really
good truck but today it's time to get
something new I'm getting a 2018 Toyota
Tacoma a truck 20 years newer than what
this one is the reason why I've waited
so long though to get a new truck is
because this truck is still running just
fine and does ninety percent of what a
brand new truck would be so I haven't
been able to justify the cost of a new
truck yet because i 100% believe that
buying a brand new truck off the lot is
a terrible financial decision I'm gonna
do it anyway but I'll explain why I
tried to buy a truck here locally in
Utah but it didn't quite work out with
the dealership here car dealers aren't
my favorite but I did find the exact
truck I want in Boulder Colorado so come
check it out with me as we fly over to
Colorado and drive the truck back let's
get started so let me introduce you to
what I've been driving for the last
eight years I've been through a lot with
this little guy I've put about a hundred
thousand miles on it I bought it when it
had 160,000 and now it has 250,000 so
starting back here this is where a fence
jumped out into the road and hit me I
fixed up most of it it did kind of
damage this part right above the wheel
defender I haven't done anything to the
suspension of this truck but it does
have a little bit of damage along the
back I did replace this quarter panel
from that same fence and I never did
quite get this light fixed all the way
it's kind of got a little gap used to be
held on with duct tape eventually I get
that bottom section attached the bumper
is also kind of falling apart you know
the truck's kind of been held together
with duct tape mostly if that duct tape
was gone the bumper would be hanging
halfway down not the safest thing over
here on this side no damage do you have
a truck box full of tools you never know
when you might need them the exhaust was
wearing out a little while ago and so
there's a huge hole in the center of the
bed you can see the exhaust there and
you can see all the way to the ground I
did replace the exhaust myself and now
everything is working fine give you a
little tour of the inside so we can
compare it to the 2018 Toyota Tacomas
here we have the inside of the door
we have the windows up and down a little
bit dirty in here door lock window lock
center consoles here inside of the truck
we have the almost 250,000 miles on it
the check engine light never does go off
hopefully the new truck doesn't have
that same issue the deck I did replace
myself I did install a ten inch sub
woofer in the back got a have you tunes
going so yeah basically pretty low key
there's not a whole lot of technology
going on in a truck back from 1998 it is
a manual transmission it's a 5-speed it
does have the four-wheel drive in it as
well this is the off-road package which
is exactly what I'm looking for in the
new truck as well and one change I am
excited about is the new truck is a
four-door where this is just a two-door
and it just has that you know half a
person spot in the back you can see the
subwoofer here that I've wired up it's
kind of fun
so the anticipation has been there for
about two years now I told myself when I
hit a hundred thousand subscribers two
years ago that I would buy myself a
truck as like a reward but I could never
justify it because this thing is just
working so well all of the time Toyota
has never died I was actually looking
into some statistics of how much it
costs to keep trucks going and keep
vehicles going and Toyota was like
number thirty on the list you all put
the list right here so you could see it
BMW is like number one with the highest
repair cost and Toyota was the lowest so
that's one of the reasons why I can
justify buying a new one as well as I
looked into buying a used one and the
prices even three or four years old were
almost the same as a brand new one
because they hold their value so well I
bought this truck seven years ago for
about seven thousand dollars and even
now if I was to turn around and sell on
the classifieds I could get about four
or five out of it even with all the
miles that it has Toyota's last forever
they hold their value forever it's a
good deal needless to say I am very
happy with this Tacoma I've had no
problems with it for the entire time
I've owned it I've only had to replace
the starter motor except for these last
couple months at 250,000 miles things
are starting to disintegrate on a
regular basis I did have to replace the
clutch a little bit ago which was about
a thousand dollars and took a couple
days out of my time and that's another
reason why I need a new truck is because
as soon as it stops becoming a tool and
more of a hindrance and it eats into my
productivity then something else needs
to happen now buying a brand new thirty
seven thousand dollar truck is a bit on
the extreme end of solving that problem
but I'll explain the justification to
you
as we grab the new truck let's go to the
airport
so the plane has landed we've gotten all
the way over to Boulder Colorado and I
see the truck it's right here
brand-new 2018 Toyota Tacoma four-door
this is the cement color this is awesome
it's got the sunroof up top it's got the
short bed in the back I'll run you
through the whole thing in just a minute
but this thing is awesome it's got the
tow package it's got rear lockers
four-wheel drive testing it's sick and
the best part is that this truck does
not have the massive rust hole in the
bed of the truck like my previous truck
does so that's a step in the right
direction so after years of waiting the
truck is finally here I'm gonna go grab
the keys from inside it's already paid
for and everything just need to take off
give you guys a tour of the inside just
second so normally when you buy a
brand-new truck and you're the first
person to drive it off a lot you
instantly lose thousands of dollars as
you pull out of the lot like I just did
but that's not the case with me I bought
this truck and I'm gonna use it as a
tool you know it's a business expense
plus what I'm gonna do to this truck is
gonna increase the value of it over what
I just lost by pulling out of the
parking lot yeah now the truck is off
the lot and mine I'm gonna walk you
through some of the features so we
started off with 10 miles on the
odometer now we're at like 78 or
something like that I think we're in the
middle of Colorado somewhere it's
Colorado's much flatter than I
anticipated but I'm gonna walk you
through some of the features of the
truck and why I chose it as my daily
driver so first of all I chose the
cement color because as unique to the
Tacoma and it is also unique to the 2008
teens now you can get the off-road it's
not limited to just the TRD package and
so here we have the front grille we have
the headlights this is like the
projection bulbs and stuff like that
it's a four-door so I can fit five
people in it and then here we have the
interior I did choose the black leather
leather was not my first choice but it
also it was part of like some kind of
tech package or something and I did want
the sunroof in it so that was fine
I think the tech package was mandatory
with the leather so I'll survive here we
have the
we're outlets for the back of the truck
there's an outlet in the bed of the
truck which I thought was pretty cool
has a clutch start cancel with helps you
when you're off-roading and stuff trying
to get up a hill so you're inside the
truck we have the dash for the leather
steering wheel we have the center
console here and parts that I think are
pretty cool is that there's a wireless
charger down here at the bottom so I can
take my Galaxy s8 which has the wireless
charging enabled same as the iPhone 8
and the iPhone 10 and I can set it down
on this pad down here at the bottom and
then it'll automatically start charging
that light turns on here and I can turn
on and off the wireless charging it has
a bunch of safety features like this is
a blind spot manager so if I press that
if someone comes up in my blind spot in
that mirror there's a light on the side
and the light will blink letting me know
that someone's in my blind spot so one
safety feature there and that is one
difference between this truck and my old
truck so this one has like side airbags
and you can't really put a price on
safety like where I was talking about
earlier that my old truck does 90% of
what a new truck can do the old truck
does not have the side airbags and as
many safety features as this truck has
so this truck has one of those like
radar management systems when you're
driving on the freeway it'll track the
car in front of you in the car in front
of you stuff the truck will stop
automatically it also has the lane
divergence systems where if you start to
drift over one of the lines on the side
of the road like if you're drowsy or
something like that it'll start beeping
at you and wait and wake you up and make
sure that you know that you're drifting
off the road old truck definitely
doesn't have those features and if the
features save your life there's no way
you can put a monetary value on that so
kind of cool that this truck has it we
also have the heated seats for the
driver and the passenger kind of fun and
the climate control on both sides so
this truck is also a manual tacoma
meaning that i shift all the gears
myself as I'm driving the representative
that I talked to said that only 5% of
trucks that are sold are sold with
manual transmissions but I like having
that kind of control when I drive and go
off-roading and now let's check out the
back seats kind of same thing here
there's a ton of storage behind these
things so I can lift those up and stick
like tools and stuff remember with my
old truck I had the truck box in the
back and that's not the case with this
one since the bed is shorter I'm gonna
leave the truck box out and just use the
space underneath the seats to store
stuff also the whole thing lays down
flat I can pull the headrest out and
then
stuff and tools and boards and
construction equipment down inside of
here with more storage space behind the
scenes coming back to the bed of the
truck drop this down this has a power
outlet you can plug in power tools you
can plug in lights if you're working
like a construction project out in the
middle of nowhere having a power outlet
is handy especially in a truck because
the truck is built to be useful and then
you know have more storage compartments
for you know tow straps and jumper
cables and things like that as well I
mentioned before that it has lockers on
the rear tires I am gonna add a lift kit
to this truck which are all kind of
things that I had on my old truck also
right here there is a headphone jack and
a USB port so you can plug in you know
the artillery cables and stuff
definitely useful to the phones that
have extra features so I'm gonna go
drive the 450 miles back to Salt Lake
Utah where I'm from was it worth the
wait time will tell I don't have buyer's
remorse yet I'm pretty excited to have
this new truck it's a huge step above
the 20 year old truck that I've been
driving around for the last seven years
a lot of people buy cars for better gas
mileage and stuff but for me my
personality and what I do I need
something with a lot of features and
having a truck with all of those bells
and whistles helps me accomplish the
things that I want to in my daily life
and Tacoma after looking at a bunch of
other brands is what I want to use I was
talking with the friend one time about
the usefulness of trucks in general and
he said that a truck can win a race
against any vehicle as long as the truck
can pick the route or the payload we can
put my truck up against the Tesla if the
payloads a piano or I can pick the route
because there's no way a Tesla can
follow me up a mountain I'll be doing a
couple more videos on this truck on my
channel just showing the lift and
showing the light bar installation if
you have any questions obviously leave
them down in the comments let me know
what you think of my truck and let me
know what your dream car is down in the
comments thanks stump for watching and
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
