I accidentally locked my keys in my
truck and so I had to take a chisel and
put it right here and just kind of tap
through and snap off this lock for the
for the back window so this is what that
looks like this is the broken one so you
can kind of see that it just snapped
right through here and it just broke the
two screws loose so you can see that the
screws are kind of the tamper resistant
the hex ones um it doesn't really matter
though because the screws are always
gonna be on the inside so here's the new
lock that I got off of Amazon um cost me
20 bucks there's a couple different ones
on there so basically this is gonna snap
on the inside of the window like that
this rubber washer is gonna come like
this on the side of the window because
you can see there's a thinner part near
the bead right here then the thicker
parts away from the outside then this
kind of just snaps in over the top of
that and then I have the screws here and
I'll just screw in from this side screw
in from the inside of the cap once I
have this in place yeah it's pretty
straightforward you can kind of see the
washer and the back clip right here and
so it's all in place and it lacks it
latches on securely with the other one
as well with the old one so I'm just
going to keep these extra parts just in
case you know you know hopefully no just
in case they were need to do this again
like even this piece is still good if
once I pulled those screws out so I'll
be able to put all those together anyway
if you have any questions make sure to
leave them in the comments and yeah
subscribe for anymore fixes for the
Tacoma that I have later on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
