lumia 950xl it's the same size as my
no.5 it's actually one of the more
interesting phones that I've taken apart
recently and I'll show you why in just
one second
first things first turn off the phone
the back of the phone is removable so
just put your fingernail underneath the
back cover and pop it off and this
exposes the Qi charger and the battery
the battery is at 3300 milliamp which is
quite a bit bigger than the note 5s 3000
milliamp battery now there are twelve
Torx screws and the back cover they are
a size t5 it might be a t4 as well just
depending on what screwdriver set you
have there are some variances from the
Chinese manufacturers that remove the
back panel you put your tweezers
underneath by the charging port then you
lift up their little clasp underneath
the camera as you can see from this
angle here now here's the interesting
part it's got some normal stuff under
there like the earpiece in the
loudspeaker and the flash of the camera
and then we have this beautiful copper
snake light component right here this is
actually the water cooling we got the
evaporator and then we have the
condenser pipe so the water heats up
inside of the evaporator as it rests
next to the processor and either
evaporates or gets hot and goes up the
pipe and then as it cools down from the
copper it will travel back down the pipe
into the evaporator again to recycle the
process even if the water cooling itself
isn't super efficient having a copper
heatsink that large has to be helping
the heat transfer just a little bit you
can see here where it rests on the
motherboard on the opposite side of the
processor one other cool aspect of this
phone is that the SD card reader is
removable similar to some of the older
no phones you can just unsnap it with
this little Lego light connector from
the motherboard and it's easy to put
back on as well since this phone isn't
super popular parts are hard to find but
I will link the parts that I do find
down in the video description below
here is the vibrator motor it's got the
dual sizes on it so it gives a more full
vibration go down snap this little tiny
ribbon cable from the side and then here
is the five megapixel front camera it's
got the same Lego light connection that
all of the other connectors do on this
board we're going to remove that it's
semi attached to the infrared retina
scanner I'll talk about that in just a
second there's two ribbon cables for the
screen that are on the motherboard gonna
unsnap those here's the headphone jack
also removable
then the motherboard is clipped into the
plastic frame there's a series of Clips
around the outside so just undo those
and in the motherboard will pop
of the frame before you get too far
though you do have to remove this
sticker that sits behind the battery
because there's one ribbon cable that
sits on the back of the motherboard
right here once that snapped off the
motherboard is free from the phone and
we have access to the rear camera here
is a 20 megapixel rear camera and here's
where that heatsink sits on the back of
the processor here is the charging port
it is a Type C charging port it is not
removable it is soldered very securely
onto the mainboard so unless you know
how to solder it's not going anywhere
now here is the infrared iris scanner so
the phone itself can just scan your eye
and then unlock the phone it's used for
Windows hello now here's the screen
component itself now the ideal situation
would be to find the screen which is the
glass and the LCD and the frame sold as
one unit but if you cannot find it sold
as one unit it'll probably just be the
glass in the LCD in which case you have
to harvest your old frame of the screen
and use it with your new one you just
use heat to separate the glass and LCD
from the old frame and then use the
adhesive to apply it to the new LCD and
glass it does take a bit longer and your
old LCD will not survive the process so
make sure your new one works before
doing it going to reattach the rear
camera and that one small ribbon cable
on the back of the motherboard and then
set the motherboard down into place
pressing it down into the series of
clasp along around the outside here's
the headphone jack and clip that down
into place you'll feel it snap down like
a little Lego here's the five megapixel
front camera going to clip that in first
and then you can just fold it over the
top and press it down into the frame
where it belongs going to clip the
screen ribbon cables down into place as
well and the small ribbon cable on the
side of the board next to the vibrator
motor and the sticker goes back into
place resting right over the top of
those ribbon cables then the back panel
along with those 12 torques screws
battery goes into place and the back
cover if you have any questions leave
