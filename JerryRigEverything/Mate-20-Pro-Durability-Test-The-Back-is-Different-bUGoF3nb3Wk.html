from Huawei with the iconic matrix
triple camera setup in the back this is
the emerald green color and oh boy does
this back panel have a surprise in store
for us it's time to see if huawei's new
psychedelic blue green colored ultimate
camera phone can survive a durability
test huge thanks to nord VPN for
sponsoring this video watch to the end
to get a 75% discount plus a free month
let's get started I like phones with
features and one of the unique features
of this phone is that it can wirelessly
charge other phones I just jump into the
settings and enable reverse wireless
charging and it'll use its massive 4200
milliamp hour internal battery as a
power bank to charge other devices
wirelessly it even works through my
bulletproof banana and while that's cool
and everything the coolest part of this
phone is the triple camera setup on the
back we'll check on that in a second
let's start with the scratch test Huawei
has taken a page out of Samsung's book
this time around wrapping the glass
slightly around the edges of the phone
from a durability standpoint I think
it's kind of dumb because it's just more
glass surface area that the frame can't
protect during a drop but it looks cool
so here we are
like most displays this tempered glass
covered May 20 Pro is scratching at
level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7
there is a notch up top which contains a
small speaker grille this is very
solidly tucked in place along with the
face ID sensors and a 24 megapixel HDR
selfie camera all hidden under the same
glass as the screen inside the knotch
and are protected against normal
scratches the anodized metal sides of
the may 20 pro have a more bluish tint
to them and are metal along with the
volume button and red anodized metal
power button down at the bottom we have
one tiny loudspeaker hole our USB C port
and a dual sided SIM card tray one side
for the SIM card and the other for
huawei's new proprietary nano memory
card which is 45 percent smaller than
your standard SD card slot it's not
super useful though to buy a memory card
that can only be used in one place so
we'll
see what happens with that up at the top
of the may 20 pro is an IR blaster one
of the very few phones to include it
this year and IR blaster allows you to
change the channels on your TV with one
of those you don't have to care where
the remote actually is hidden now for
the back the Tribble camera setup is
covered with glass Huawei has gone above
and beyond the normal dual camera setup
this time
providing us with a 40 megapixel normal
camera a 20 megapixel wide-angle GoPro
style camera and a third 8 megapixel
telephoto zoom camera I'm a huge fan of
all the options while ways also done
something new with the back glass panel
this time around it's texture this hyper
optical pattern is supposedly non-slip
and anti fingerprint and it's scratch
proof this is pretty cool I'm definitely
probably gonna be a claim on more phones
in the future
all right I'm done absolutely zero marks
were left on the back glass panel wall
waste textured glass holds up much
better than the frosted pixel 3 now I'm
done the mate 20 pro has a very bright
six point four inch 1440p AMOLED display
meaning that as the screen heats up the
pixels physically burn and never recover
it's almost like taking a lighter to
your phone is a bad idea the screen did
last for an impressive 25 seconds though
but then never recovered like an LCD
would the mark is still visible even
with the display turned off and now for
the bin test it's time to see if that
textured back glass panel helps or
hinders the overall structure on the
very first Bend we get a loud popping
noise which is the front glass
shattering across the entire display
this is rather unusual for my bin test
because most phones survived keep in
mind the May 10 Pro from last year
passed this test just fine
I believe the May 20 pro glass cracked
for a few reasons one because I bent it
and but physically stressing hardware is
kind of the point of my channel the
second reason it cracked is because of
the level 7 scratches I left on the
surface of the glass now you're probably
like but Jerry you scratch every phone
with the same picks and most of them
don't obliterate
you're right the matin pro from last
year had a flat screen this time around
huawei curved a glass of their screen
around the corners right up against the
metal and might not have their tolerance
quite right yet meaning that the metal
frame might be more snug on the glass
than say a Samsung phone which has the
same style of curve but still survives
my tests
either way the mate 20 Pro is still
alive the frame itself has incredibly
solid only the glass is shattered
unfortunately for me though the cracks
are right over top of the in screen
fingerprint scanner I'll check to see if
that functions really quick it looks
like the phone can still read my
fingerprint even though it's complaining
about the sensor being dirty the sensor
allowed my fingerprint to be said but
then never actually lets my finger
unlock the phone so it's safe to say
that my fingerprint sensor does not work
with a crack screen there's multiple
levels of security that can be utilized
if the fingerprint scanner stops working
I usually reserve my shelf of shame for
the completely destroyed devices my
question is should we start including
phones that partially fail what do you
think does the may 20 Pro deserve the
Shelf of shame let me know down in the
comments speaking of security another
layer of security for your phone or PC
could be Nord VPN a VPN or a virtual
private network is something you can use
to securely and privately browse the
internet just download the app and it
connects to one of over 5,000 different
servers located in 62 different
countries instantly it makes your
personal information untrackable when
using public Wi-Fi and one subscription
of Nord VPN can secure six devices
simultaneously get a free month and 75%
off a three year plan with the link in
the description or go to Nord VPN
dot-com slash jerry-rigged that 75%
jerry-rigged discount code brings the
price down to just $2.99 per month which
could be a great gift idea huge thanks
to Nord VPN for sponsoring this video
this durability testing thing is quite
an expensive hobby especially lately the
May 20 pro is still a good phone just
seems that this time around the curved
glass does make it a bit weaker than its
predecessor
either way I'm hit that subscribe button
if you haven't already thanks stuff for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
