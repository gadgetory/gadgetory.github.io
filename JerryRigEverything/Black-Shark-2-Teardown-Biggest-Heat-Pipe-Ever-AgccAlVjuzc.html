by Rovio Entertainment with their Angry Birds
2 smart phone game.
Angry Birds 2 is the updated version of the
classic Angry Birds.
It still has the same normal slingshot bird
flying projectiles that you used to enjoy.
But now it has more variables and ways to
make the bird stronger, like special hats.
When you go to play the map and compete with
other players worldwide, you can level up
your birds by collecting hats and special
feathers, or play in the Tower pf Fortune
to get special awards quickly.
I remember playing the original version of
this game back in the day for hours on end,
so it's pretty nostalgic to have it back...and
it's still free.
Angry Birds 2 is one of those games that you
can just chill with for a few minutes for
a quick level or two, or get sucked in and
play for hours as well.
I'll leave a link in the description you can
download and get Angry Birds 2 a try.
And thanks to Rovio Entertainment for sponsoring
this portion of the video.
The Black Shark 2 is one of the cheaper gaming
phones on the market right now, but still
boasts some pretty impressive specs and eye-catching
glass and metal exterior design.
Today we'll get a close up look at how the
LED sidebars integrate, and check out the
internal direct touch liquid cooling that
Black Shark has been raving about.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
Taking apart the Black Shark 2 is pretty rough.
Instead of a non-essential rear glass panel
coming off, this phone starts with a screen
removal, which is both good and bad.
Good – if the screen is the only thing you
need to replace, but bad if you're trying
to fix basically anything else.
The screen is set down inside the subtle green
and black metal frame.
But once the initial penetration is made down
near the lower stereo speaker, the adhesive
lets the screen pull up and away fairly easily
since there's no super strong water proofing
around the edges.
The only safe place to insert a tool around
the edge is under the black colored paint.
If anything touches the display portion of
the panel, it's instant kablooey for the screen.
The display can be replaced by someone who
knows what they're doing in about 10 minutes,
which is pretty awesome.
Flipping open the screen like a book, we get
our first glace at the massive amounts of
copper under the glass, and the quite prominent
optical fingerprint scanning camera placed
under the glass screen.
You can see how the light from my S8 Plus
shines through the hole in the display that
the fingerprint scanner works through.
One screw allows the silver screen connector
bracket to remove, and then the screen can
unplug like a little Lego.
The display on the Black Shark 2 is an AMOLED,
meaning that there's no back light.
This allows the whole thing to be super thin
– exactly like what we saw on the Apple
Watch 4.
I wish more phones had a screen removal that
was as easy as this.
Unfortunately for us though, the rest of this
phone is a complete chaotic unorganized nightmare
inside...so buckle up.
There are 21 Phillips head screws holding
the mid plate to the rear body.
Other phones we've seen with a mid-plate like
this, like on the Nokia's or the HTC 10, are
super incredibly rigid, which explains why
the Black Shark 2 performed so well in my
durability test.
Finally shimmying out that massive mid-plate
full of copper, we see why Black Shark calls
this Direct Touch.
Most smart phones don't have their processors
exposed, but here, the main Qualcomm 855 processor
has the thermal paste directly applied to
the top, which rests right up against the
copper metal heat sink – exactly like we
see on computers.
I'll peel back the covering over the copper
so we can see more of the thermal dissipation
system.
There is a ton of metal in here.
The Black Shark 2 probably has just as much
copper as the Razer Phone 2 – just not all
combined into one waterbed style heat pipe.
There are multiple layers to the coolant.
The main bulk of it is a thick copper pad
that's directly above the processor.
There is a smaller normal heat pipe, like
something we've seen inside of the Galaxy
Phones.
It's down over the lower circuit board and
charging port, and has it's own thermal paste.
It's also connected to that same larger phone
size piece of thin copper on the top.
It's a pretty ingenious design – especially
for the price.
As we go deeper, the rest of the phone looks
like it was designed and put together by a
caffeinated rabbit, with wires and ribbons
all over the place.
Nothing's really in the right spot – not
even the battery connector, which should be
unplugged first, it's hidden underneath other
ribbon cables.
It's a pretty similar design to the old HTC
10, which won the Least Repairable Smart Phone
Award a few years ago.
After unplugging a bunch of stuff, we finally
get to the camera units.
Both are housed in the same metal block.
A 48 megapixel main camera with a 12 megapixel
2x optical zoom telephoto camera.
Neither of which have optical image stabilization.
The top motherboard has two screws holding
it in place, and then it can kind of lift
out, but still has yet another ribbon connection
and two wire cables attached to the underside
of the board.
Pretty complex.
Here's an up-close look at the thermal paste
over the processor.
You might be thinking to yourself, 'Hey, that
battery's upside down.'
And yep, it is.
There are two magical pull tabs down at the
bottom under the battery.
The first pull tab broke, but the second pull
tab was...[stretching sounds]...very successful.
One out of two ain't bad.
I'll commence the Pry of Shame and lift the
battery out of the cavity.
It's a large 4000 milliamp hour capacity that
says 'do not remove'.
Oops.
The pull tabs under the battery are a pretty
fantastic invention by the way.
As the adhesive stretches out, it loses it's
stickiness and allows the battery to basically
fall out of the phone without any force, as
long as the pull tabs don't break of course...which
is pretty common.
Each side of the metal black Shark 2 has it's
own LED battery level indicator light as it's
charging.
But even with the large cutouts in the metal
frame for the LEDs, the phone is not structurally
compromised.
The LEDs themselves are on a thin little strip
of ribbon that shines the light into a super
thick, cloudy, plastic diffuser.
Since the LEDs are pointing inwards, it's
probably why the light seems a little dim
at times, but it's still a very interesting
concept, and I'm glad that Black Shark is
over here doing cool stuff to stand out.
The bottom circuit board has two screws along
with some wire cables, and then the circuit
board can be removed, exposing the ultra large
loudspeaker housing.
I'll cut this guy open to see if the whole
thing is hollow to help sound resonate...but
it's not.
Just the bulky part is the speaker component.
The charging port comes out next.
It's the last thing to come out of the phone.
It's right next to the headphone jack that
doesn't exist.
I still think it's pretty crazy that a gaming
phone can be built without a headphone jack.
But yeah, there it is.
Even though the Black Shark 2 is a super complicated
intricate piece of hardware, I am a fan.
I'll slide the battery into place between
the side rail LEDs.
And even though the whole thing isn't easy
to repair and there's no water resistance,
it does have a really easy to replace screen,
which luckily, is the main thing people usually
want to fix.
If anything else breaks or stops working inside
the phone though...good luck.
I'll plug the ribbons and wires into the bottom
of the motherboard, and then gently set that
into place in the phone frame while connecting
the plethora of other extension ribbons and
wires.
Do I even want to take the Black Shark 2 apart
again?
No.
But for the price and the amount of internal
copper cooling, I think they've done pretty
well and it's pretty fair.
Everything still works, so I'll screw in the
21 screws and seal it up for the last time.
Gaming phones seem to be the frontrunners
in design and cooling, and just doing awesome
things in general.
So I want to check more of them out.
Are there any other gaming phones out there
that I haven't reviewed yet that you want
to see the insides of?
Let me know down in the comments.
Come hang out with me on Twitter and Instagram.
And thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
