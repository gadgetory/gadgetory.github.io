sweet I try to stay as productive as
possible when I'm traveling the one
thing I've done to help me stay
productive is I built a triple screen
laptop you might have heard a project
Valerie made by Razer there triple
screen laptop the side screens don't
actually fold in the laptop I've built
is glassful let me show you so this here
is my mobile battle station it's got two
extending monitors on either side and
I'll show you how to build these in just
a second I just want to show you that
this screen is fully functional I can
take Windows and drag it across and drop
it on either side and the laptop is 100%
portable it's got some interesting
construction practices but these hinges
right here allow each of the monitors to
fold completely flat
each of these hinges was about 2 bucks
and the side monitors were around 100 so
it's a pretty inexpensive project
comparatively I was inspired when I saw
project Valerie at CES this year so let
me show you how I built my own so this
is the beginning of my triple monitor
setup right now I'm using one of my old
laptop these monitors on the side here
are entirely powered and receive all of
their information from a USB cable so
there's no power adapters or anything
like that these monitors aren't super
awesome for gaming they have an 8
millisecond response time but they are
super portable because they only have
that USB power connector and display
connector they also do this weird thing
where if you tip them sideways they will
turn back on and the orientation of the
screen will be this direction instead
which would be awesome for browsing
Reddit or you know working on something
on this computer and having information
on this screen as well whether you're
like editing videos are working on a
project and that's where the triple
screen laptop comes into play
they do have the visa mount on the back
so you can put these on like a monitor
extension arm but since I have limited
space on the back of my laptop we're
going to have to use something else and
I'm going to use these door hinges to
hold the monitors in place and allow
them to flip out these glues right here
these are called epoxy a few brands that
have Loctite and jb weld I'm probably
going to use the JB well just because it
has a higher psi which means it has more
strength and holding power so right now
I have some tape wrapping around the
side of the monitor just holding it in
place and trying to get an idea of where
the hinges should be placed it box these
two different chemicals that mix
together and when they're mixed together
they form a chemical reaction that make
them hard in about five minutes this
thing will fully cure in about 24 hours
that's why there's still liquid inside
of the tubes but once they're outside of
the tubes and exposed with air and mixed
together they'll get really hard really
fast
right now both hinges are good and
actually it's only been carrying for
about two hours but the weight of one
hinge can hold the whole laptop so this
epoxy is pretty strong I'm going to clip
on the first screen right now and by
clip on I mean epoxy and so I'm going to
put some tape down so I don't get any
glue stuck to the hinges I'm going to
flip them over and I'm going to set the
monitor down in place right after I
finish gluing it
so right now how to stack on top of a
book and you can see that the second
monitor which is this guy right here is
resting on top of the hinges and engines
are glued it's not going to stick to the
laptop because there's a piece of tape
underneath and then I added some more
weight on top of that to kind of add
pressure to the glue is help it dry
better I made sure there's an even
amount of room between the edge of the
laptop and the top monitor right here so
when it folds out they're still going to
be even with each other all right so
I've taken off all the weight and it
looks like it's been probably about an
hour and the instructions say that this
stuff gets tacky in about five minutes
it actually holds pretty pretty strong
even after just an hour of sitting there
let's see if it stands up on its own got
the door hinges on the back here so this
second screen that I'm going to add
right here I guess you can call it the
third screen is a little more tricky
because it needs to open up and it needs
to sit on top of the second screen not
added there so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to stick this hinge just like
that so that part is stuck to the laptop
and then this part is going to fold up
and attach to the side of the third
monitor there and I'll probably do two
of them just so there's more support and
this one will actually have a flat
surface for the inch to attach to so it
should be just as secure as the other
one since it had the curved area of the
back
so this time around I'm making sure that
the hinges are also straight with each
other because if the hinges are kinked
or co-op it they're not going to fold in
the same direction one my fault this way
and the other one might fold slightly
that way which wouldn't give a direct
swing to the monitor so this one I'm
using the edge is a laptop and just
pressing this bulge up the hinge right
up against it the same on both sides and
that will make them both equal
one of my favorite things about having a
triple screen laptop is on long flights
like this I can get three times as much
work done as I would normally
claims but if you met
broken heart episode
oh yeah
so when I was at CES I did see the real
project Valerie on display but
apparently it was misplaced or stolen so
a razor if you need a working prototype
I'm your guy thanks Don for watching a
few
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
