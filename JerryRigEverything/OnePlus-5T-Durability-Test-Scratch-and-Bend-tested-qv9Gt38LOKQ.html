its name might induce cold sweat
flashbacks to your algebra days it's
actually a pretty powerful and
inexpensive phone with a few new
physical changes from the one plus five
earlier this year
including smaller screen bezels and
moving the home button to the back of
the phone it warrants a new durability
test so let's get started
oneplus had the guts to send a sealed
retail version of the phone to me I've
never had a one plus phone failed my
test yet but there's a first time for
everything
the scratch test is first and sneaky
enough this phone comes with a
pre-installed high quality plastic
screen protector but for the sake of the
scratch test I'll pull that off it is
nice of oneplus to include it though
this most scratch test tells us what the
screen is made out of plastic screen
phones would scratch at level three
tempered glass starts scratching at a
five or six and sapphire and ceramic
starts scratching at level eight the one
plus five T is using 2.5 D Gorilla Glass
5 and naturally scratches at a level 6
with a deeper groove at a level 7 that
sentence did have a lot of numbers going
on but the funny part is you still
understood it there is no home button at
the bottom of the screen anymore
it's been relocated to make room for the
much larger screen which I'm a fan of at
the top of the phone we have a 16
megapixel front facing camera that
records in 1080p it's under the same
glass as the screen we also have a metal
grill covering the earpiece it sits
pretty flush with the glass so there
won't be much dirt or metal shavings
getting caught inside the slot the back
of the phone is where the fingerprint
scanner is located right in the center
away from the camera initially I thought
I was going to be made out of plastic
but it turns out oneplus has kept the
basically invincible ceramic material
from previous phones and used it on this
5t this scanner is unscratched while
thumbs up for that physical damage will
not be a problem for this thing keys on
the other hand
just kidding those don't leave a mark
either anodized aluminum like this is
coated with super hard aluminium oxide
which is acting as an abrasive to the
softer metal on my keys the anodizing is
pretty thin though so drops and razors
might tell a different story against the
1 plus 5t personally I was real good at
math up until they started mixing the
alphabet all over there but don't even
get me started on the number 8 it is one
of the hardest numbers to divide in half
if you divide 8 horizontally you get 0
and if you divide 8 vertically you get 3
but according to my report card in
school neither of these were the right
answer razor blade marks don't rub off
though so try to avoid doing your
homework on the phone the dual led
single tone flash is plastic but that's
fine the important part is the lens of
the camera and that does remain scratch
resistant my razor blade leaves no mark
on the 16 or 20 megapixel cameras these
are not super wide angle or telephoto
unfortunately just doing that portrait
mode thing I personally would prefer
having one different lens included
instead of having two of the same but at
least this whole phone is cheaper than
one back glass replacement on the iPhone
10 that really shows which company puts
their customers first the volume button
is made from metal and this guy up here
which I feel every phone should have is
a mute switch also made from metal the
dual SIM card tray does not have an SD
card slot but it's also made the metal
the top of the phone doesn't have much
to look at but there's still plenty of
metal up here and the bottom of the
phone is where the party starts we have
a USB see - charge enabled charging port
along with our good buddy jack
recently neglected with both the Google
pixel and iPhones it's good to see he's
still around the glass layer of the
screen does have a plastic cushion
between the metal frame of the phone and
the glass this helps keep the pressure
off the glass if the phone has ever
dropped or bent and finally it's time to
burn test this six inch AMOLED display
this 18 by 9 aspect ratio is pretty
similar to what we're seeing on the
Galaxy s8 at the moment I got about 20
seconds out of the display before it
turned white
and never recovered and now for the bin
test oneplus has never failed my test
before and it's time to see if these new
design upgrades messed with the build
quality there is a slight flex to the
phone but then it locks out not allowing
the phone to flex any further there is
no crinkling near the power button or
separation of the display from the body
even though separation wouldn't
technically be a bad thing for this
phone since one-plus isn't bragging
about any water resistance but the 1 + 5
t does pass the bin test from both sides
other than the lack of water resistance
and the lack of wireless charging this
is an incredibly full-featured and
useful phone with a price point low
enough to benefit the customer I'd be
proud to have this phone in my pocket
the only thing left to find out now is
if the red battery is back inside the
phone yet we'll find out during the
teardown hit that subscribe button if
you haven't already and come hang out
with me on Twitter I'll have that
teardown posted soon thanks a ton for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
