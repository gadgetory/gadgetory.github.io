before needing to be recharged this
electronic bike can do 20 miles before
needing to be recharged 40 miles if you
help the motor by pedaling now rad bike
told me that this bike can do 20 miles
an hour which is incredibly fast legally
it can't go faster than that in order to
stay on the roads you know street-legal
so today we're going to try this bike
out in the snow because of these super
huge tires I'm going to check the top
speed with my drone which has a GPS in
it and then afterward even though rad
bike didn't actually tell me I could
take this thing apart I'm going to show
you what's inside of this battery
compartment to see how similar it is to
Tesla let's get started
this thing seriously takes all of the
hard work out of mountain biking and
leaves just the fun stuff let's see
what's inside of this battery this is
probably the biggest battery that I've
ever taken apart on my channel you can
see the power button and locking key
latch along with the lifting handle that
pulls it out of the holster both the
Tesla Model S and this rad power bike
are using Panasonic cells in their
batteries so it'll be interesting to see
what it looks like on the inside over
here we have a battery level indicator
the charging port and a USB slot and
over on the left-hand side we have a 30
amp fuse which you normally see on cars
so it's interesting to see here on my
bike opening up batteries like this is
actually kind of dangerous lithium is
hazardous and should never be punctured
saw hammer
you get the idea the average person will
never need to open up their battery the
power connector has your normal positive
and negative leads and then six long
screws hold the plastic halves together
I did end up checking the top speed of
this bike with my drone and it was
twenty miles per hour which is also what
it says on the bike speedometer so not
too much of a surprise there are two
warranty void stickers on either side of
the battery housing I usually eat these
for breakfast and now we can see what
powers this thing inside the plastic
housing is a 48 volt 11.6 amp hour
battery for reference and iPhone 7 is a
three point eight volt one point one amp
hour battery you can see that the giant
blue chunk is actually made up of little
cylinders all wired together exactly the
same way that the Tesla car batteries
are manufactured tons of little
batteries all wired together to make one
big battery there are a bunch of wires
and circuit board up at the top i
imagine that these are all part of the
battery protection circuit that prevents
overcharging I also like how everything
has the white caulk around the
connectors while this housing is in no
way waterproof that white rubber stuff
will help keep the water out and the
connectors in place while you're riding
the bottom plug also has a rubber ring
probably to minimize vibration and to
keep water out of the battery shell well
if you can't afford a Tesla this bike
could very well be a good back-up plan
I did talk to rad power bikes and they
said they would drop their price 50
dollars for my subscribers
so I'll leave a link in the video
description right below this video if
you're into that kind of thing if anyone
has a test load that I can take apart
feel free to send it over you know for
science thanks ton for watching I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
