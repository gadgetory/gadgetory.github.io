all-round best bang for your buck
smartphones you can buy these days but
it only comes in two colors both of
which are black it's time to spice
things up a bit and see what a clear one
plus sixty would look like let's get
started
one plus in the past has been the phone
for tech minded individuals who want a
lot of functionality and power at a
realistic price and with an outspoken
oneplus community that actually gets
listened to one plus has pumped out some
pretty solid phones this year one plus
is added water resistance but it's not
IP specific and has no official rating
the glue around the back panel is pretty
similar to the pixels and the Samsung's
I've taken apart previously though
requiring quite a bit of heat and gentle
persuasion from my pry tool each of the
four sides on the oneplus 60 are curved
which present an additional challenge
when removing the back panel because too
much pressure at any point from my metal
pry tool will cause the whole panel to
break and we don't want that one plus
used to include an iconic bright red
battery in their phones but stopped with
the oneplus three if you want a blast
from the past go check out my old one
plus two teardown finally lifting open
d1 plus 60 reveals no red battery but
they did add a red pull tab instead of a
green one this year that's got to add at
least three horsepower thumbs up for
that I'll take what I can get
other than that though with no wireless
charging or external fingerprint scanner
and with all the circuit boards covered
in black plastic this phone has a more
simple minimalist vibe I'll remove the
bottom plastics to see if we can modify
it at all oneplus has included red
loctite on their screws not sure if
that's on purpose or not but we can
pretend they did it for aesthetics even
though you guys here on my channel are
the only ones who ever get to see it
underneath the charging port plastics we
find that the allowed speaker and
vibrator are both molded into the
plastic itself making any trimming or
modifying to reveal the circuit boards
unrealistic so I'll close it back up and
replace the screws it is what it is I'm
going to make the battery red again
though unscrewing the one screw holding
down the metal bracket and unplugging
the battery like a little Lego
and then the whole 3700 milliamp hour
battery can come away from the phone
another one of the waterproofing
barriers one pluses added is a secondary
plastic layer beneath the battery since
my phone has been opened up and isn't
really water-resistant anymore I can
just get rid of it I have got a spare
red carbon fiber skin left over from a
previous project so I'll just plop it
down over the top half of the battery
making sure to keep the plugin free and
I'll wrap the skin around the sides and
bottom of the battery without any copper
wireless charging like we saw in the
clear pixel three hopefully this red
will spice things up a bit
once we get the back glass cleared with
the silver bracket back in place now we
can start removing the camera lens a
little bit of heat goes a long way with
this black adhesive heat makes it easier
to loosen up and remove the metal dual
lens bracket from the glass the plastic
flash also comes away with the bracket
so oneplus comes in black and black and
both black should have the same color
removal process this is the midnight
black so when the colour is peeled off
we should be left with a slightly matte
or a frosted finish on the glass
luckily the colour removal is pretty
easy this time around and the whole
panel is coming off in one piece this
doesn't leave me much time for any super
good cell phone jokes though but I do
have one what kind of music do phones
like to listen to
since the names I say it's looking
pretty good one last strip of laminate
at the bottom and we can start putting
the whole thing back together I'll lay
down some clear double-sided tape along
the sides of the phone I'll link this in
the description and I'll put a bit more
clear adhesive on the camera lens then I
can set the camera lens into the glass
along with your little plastic flash
diffuser and the whole frosty
transparent piece of glass can be set
down gently over the phone which kind of
takes the normal black one +60 to a
whole new level I think it turned out
pretty sweet I didn't think I would like
the carbon as much but it's growing on
me the way it reflects in the light is
strangely appealing especially with the
simple black NFC and the minimalist
black plastic it has going on even if
the circuits aren't showing I think this
one's a win what do you think the
oneplus 6 earlier this year had the
unique golden fingerprint cable which
added some sass along with the silver
metal over the loudspeaker so it's a
tough choice you
either way oneplus should start
implementing this themselves especially
once they get the wireless charging add
it into their phone I'll be completely
tearing down the oneplus 60 in my next
video so hit the subscribe button
we'll get an inside look at that
in-display fingerprint scanner thanks
ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
