the iPhone 2g was the start of it all
about 10 years ago with 8 gigabytes of
capacity I'm holding the moore's deluxe
of the two versions initially launched
the other having a whopping 4 gigabytes
of internal storage
Apple sold about 6 million of these
original iPhones so let's throw back and
analyze how the build quality was back
in 2007
now obviously with the phone that's old
it is fairly difficult to find a brand
new one like I always do with my regular
durability tests this phone does appear
to be an original condition no well at
least it was before I got my hands on it
we'll start with a scratch test the
original iPhone is using the first
iteration of Gorilla Glass this is
basically tempered glass used on cell
phone screens and as we know most
tempered glass is a six on most skill of
hardness but we are seeing some Nicks on
this phone at a level five which never
happens on the more recent Gorilla Glass
versions like gorilla glass 4 or 5 so
some things have improved in the glass
Department since this phone was released
it's also interesting that you can
almost see the individual pixels on the
screen the home button does not contain
a fingerprint scanner and is made of
plastic but it does still have that
satisfying physical click that has been
removed on the newer versions of the
iPhone appear on the front facing camera
just kidding there's no front-facing
camera that feature was not implemented
into the iPhone line up until the iPhone
4 the earpiece is buried pretty deep
under that thick front glass it appears
to be at the nylon variety but does not
pull out easily like we've seen on some
of the other phones
I still think metal makes for the most
ideal earpiece on a cell phone and
luckily that's what we've been seeing in
the later editions of the iPhone the
back of the phone is pretty curious
instead of antenna bands at the top and
bottom of the phone we have more of an
antenna chunk this black plastic section
of the phone makes it a pretty large
portion of the device body and it's
definitely not the most aesthetic
looking piece of tech but it did get the
job done way back in the day lucky for
us that silver collection the phone is
indeed real metal solid cold and quality
feeling in the hand and look it's an
apple tree you can tell it's an apple
tree from the Apple there in the center
it's pretty neat it's incredibly small
circle up here in the top corner is the
2 megapixel camera lens for picture
taking video capabilities were not
introduced until the iPhone 3GS 2 years
later in 2009 the interesting thing is
that this camera lens is made from
plastic the little lip along the edge
probably doesn't offer much protection
either I am glad that Apple has improved
on this with later versions of the
iPhone delving into their own
special blend of sapphire there is no
flash so good luck with your low-light
shots and no flashlight either the side
volume buttons are made from plastic and
even this mute switch is plastic now
normally I'm an Android guy but this new
switch is actually a really good idea I
find myself wishing that my Galaxy s8
had one I'd be more than happy to trade
Bixby for a mute switch take a look at
that headphone jack there is nine years
of innovation between the release of
these two phones and I think it's a bit
funny that the smaller iPhone has plenty
of room for the headphone jack but Apple
claims that the bigger phone which is
almost twice the size did not have room
I think that there's always room for
Jack if you make room the power button
is made from plastic and the bottom of
the phone near the 30-pin charging port
is also plastic there are a lot of
different materials used in the build of
this phone the chrome looking metal
around the screen is much harder than
the soft aluminum on the back it is much
more scratch resistant as well and this
is good if you ever were to set your
phone facedown on something or drop it
the lip around the screen would not be
damaged or flake away like what happened
with the plastic lip of the Galaxy s5
the original iPhone has a 3.5 inch TFT
LCD display with a 320 by 480 pixel
screen resolution proportionally
compared to this 4k video you are
watching the original iPhone screen
resolution would look a lot like this
utilizing about 2% of the total
available pixels on screen the iPhone 7
currently has a bit better resolution at
750 by 1334 and the galaxy s 8 is one of
the higher resolution phones in the
industry with a 2 960 by 1440 display
remember all of these sizes are just
relative to the 4k viewing window that
YouTube offers the phone lasted about 20
seconds under that flame test I think
that the heavier and thicker front glass
panel helped keep the heat off the
pixels for longer luckily it did recover
like the IPS screens that Apple uses now
and the screen was totally functional a
few seconds after the heat was removed
and now for the bin test with all of the
different materials used in this phone
it will be interesting to see if there
are any failure points the phone is so
small there's almost not even enough
room to grab a hold of it with both
hands
even after flexing the phone the plastic
to metal joint along the back is still
holding very
I'm sure the small form-factor along
with the thicker body style is helping
considerably with the rigidness
personally I'd be totally fine if
smartphones started trending thicker I'd
much rather have a larger battery that
could last a day or two over some
aerodynamic dainty piece of fluff I use
my phone as a tool and not a fashion
accessory so the more features it has
and how long the battery lasts our big
selling points for me Apple did do a
good job with this phone though - the
plastic camera lens this phone
definitely passes my durability tests
I'm excited to tear this thing down and
see what it looks like on the inside
now that the phone is so old I'm sure
there are plenty of old broken phones or
phones with dead batteries laying around
just waiting to be brought back to life
what other old phones would you like to
see tested or torn down on my channel I
think these throwbacks are kind of fun
thanks a ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
