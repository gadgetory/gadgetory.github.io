here i'm about to replace the back
shocks you can see it's been kind of
wearing down on that side there and
people say that you should replace your
shocks are a fifty thousand miles you
know it's always up for debate well this
truck has about a hundred and sixty
thousand miles on it though i figured
it's about time you can see on this
other shock as well it's been kind of
wearing down anyway docks here the
longer one goes on the left short one
goes on the right it's a you know bound
up right now just what makes it easier
to put it on it's relatively
straightforward comes all the bushings
and stuff beginning and to put it in
this on this truck i'm it's a seventeen
millimeter bolt on the bottom at the top
pretty simple to take off you know just
undo the bolt make sure to press the new
bushings into the little circle part
where that will goes onto the bolts make
sure they're evenly spaced around that
side on this one I've already finished
putting it in I just pressed the
bushings in to either side of it and
then put the new washer same old bolt
it's got a little locking washer right
here and then the same up on the top if
you take on the tire obviously had more
room to work but I was able to do it all
the bolts are stuck too bad on this one
I'll show you what I did to push the
bushings in you can kind of see that it
it's ribbed up in the center there and
if you take the shore end of the bushing
and push it in this side and the other
end in this side then just get him to
stay the farther in that they are
farther preston that they are the easier
it'll be to get him onto the bolt and to
get the net in the bolt as well anyway
so what i did is i took both the palms
in the hands and i just press it against
both those obviously it's kind of
difficult while holding the camera if I
line them up right and then use the
palms of my hands to press them in all
the way
so obviously you kind of get the point
on that
channellocks what I'll see way of doing
it it's kind of grabbing it just like
that and pinching in one side at a time
making sure they're both level you can
say before the you know the tighter
there in the easier it is to to put them
on in the end so some reason you can
kind of see along the edge of this bowl
like it's all rested up a little bit
this is where the the shocks at on so
you may got to make sure to clean all
that stuff off or else the other
bushings aren't going to slide on very
easily
I'm with the top one I just hit it with
the hammer a couple times I'm going to
clean most of it off gonna see it up in
there so that should be ready for the
other bushing down there we go
bull shocks are now on the truck whole
process Brett took about 45 minutes
hardest part is just getting them off
and then getting them back on the bolts
are when you put the bolts in it's kind
of hard to give to reach the part where
they screw in just because they're kind
of short anyway it's about if you have
any questions be sure to leave them in
the comments I'm sure described as well
usually put up you know one or two
videos a week different car repairs
usually dealing with you know tacoma's
jeeps things like that anyway yeah
thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
