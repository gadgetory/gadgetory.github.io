one of two reasons either you've reached
the end of the Internet and have nothing
left to watch or you've broken the
camera lens on your Samsung Note 8 and
you want to fix it for cheap instead of
paying a huge insurance deductible well
you're in the right spot
because I have a broken camera lens oh
wait hold on okay now it's broken
let's get started
the biggest tip I can give during this
operation is to go slow be careful and
don't let the glass fall into the camera
unit glass dust inside the camera will
keep it from focusing later on I'll give
you some tips on how to correct the
situation if it should happen to befall
you there are two types of lenses one
that comes with the full metal frame
this would need to be installed under
the back panel which is a little more
difficult but if the back glass of your
phone is already cracked and needs to be
replaced any way it's easier to replace
the frame of the camera lens and the
back panel at the same time it took me a
long time to source these bonafide
hardware camera lenses there are a lot
of imitation cheap flexible plastic
lenses out there but as you can see
these are a much higher quality glass
version if you don't want to remove the
back glass panel of your phone by the
glass only version of the camera lens it
has the adhesive pre-installed it is a
little more dangerous to replace but the
whole operation is easier because you
only have to remove one thing instead of
the whole back panel
I'll explain heat is gonna be our best
friend during this operation along with
a thin pair of tweezers which I'll link
in the video description heat softens
the adhesive under the glass layer
making the little shards of glass easier
to pull up without breaking them you
want to minimize the breakage as much as
possible remember since glass is the
same hardness as glass any bits of glass
dust laying around in your workspace has
potential to rub up against the screen
and scratch it
give it some micro abrasions so try to
keep the glass dust clear from the
workspace each time the lens cools down
the adhesive will get hard I'll just
warm it up again it's a rather tedious
process because I'm taking special care
not to let the glass fall into the
camera unit the camera has optical image
stabilization and a focus mechanism that
requires movement
so getting glass jammed up inside the
note 8 camera unit will keep things from
moving and working like normal the
exterior glass we are installing has
nothing to do with focus just protection
all of the focus and stabilization
happens underneath the glass all of the
glass dust shards and adhesive needs to
be cleaned off from inside the metal
camera lens frame any dust left will
become a pressure point for the new
glass and might cause the new glass to
break when it gets pressed into place
I'll flip the phone over and give it a
couple sharp taps with my finger to help
dislodge any dust caught inside the
camera unit it looks like this note 8 is
focusing on both my hand
and my metal pry tool easy enough with
both the normal lens and the telephoto
lens so now it's time to put the new
glass into place I'll have these
bonafide hardware lenses link in the
description the important thing is to
make sure there are no fingerprints on
the inside of the lens before putting it
down it needs to be clean on the
underside I'll blow it off to get rid of
any dust and gently remove the adhesive
protection without touching the
underside of the glass and then I can
set it into place remember glass is
glass and it doesn't need any force I'll
make sure it's snug and the adhesive
will do the rest
and there we go the glass is installed
flush with the back surface of the phone
I'll test it out really quick and it's
having no problems with either of the
two lenses focusing on my hand and the
practical if it was to stop focusing I
would give it a few sharp taps on the
screen while the camera was facing down
to help dislodge any debris everything I
used in this video will be linked in the
video description whether your camera
lens is broken already or you are the
prepared type just buying a backup I
hope I was able to help out hit that
subscribe button if you haven't already
and thank you so much for watching I'll
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
