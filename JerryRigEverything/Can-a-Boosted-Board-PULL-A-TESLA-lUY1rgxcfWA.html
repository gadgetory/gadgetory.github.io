Oh powerful it's sketchy I could really
learn how to ride this story actually
attempt something okay I'm a whole class
right now on the beaches so I just
barely got the brand-new boosted board
to the other day this one and I've never
really ridden the booster board before
I've ridden snowboards but I've never
been like a skateboarder or a long
border so being on this it's slightly
weird but the first thing that came to
my mind when I got this board and I
don't know why but can it pull a Tesla
because they're both battery-powered one
is significantly heavier than the other
so it'll be interesting to find out if
your Tesla dies
can your boosted boards save you so
looking underneath the Tesla is no point
to attach like a tow strap or anything
but Dan here can pull off that front
grill type thing and that leaves some
oil in the frame that hopefully we can
attach something to for our throwing
adventure we're excited testing this
yellow tow strap and better than the
hooks on it like there's only one look
soft for the hooks have to grab on right
here
luckily Jerry garrison has more than one
tow strap in his truck about that's that
year a bad feeling about this
we got to put the car neutral what
happened dan has your Tesla ever died on
you before just this last week like we
went to Hawaii he did the Haiku stairs
trail thing over those four days we lost
the 40 miles that were remaining on our
battery range as they tell me it you got
you they tell me that you lose two to
five percent a day and so I get to the
airport I don't know what to do what do
you do an electric car dies so we made
an entire but you know off of it but one
thing that I did learn is that you can't
even put your car into neutral unless
you get a take off this front guard and
you jumpstart the 12 volt battery that I
don't even know existed and then you can
put it in neutral so how do you put a
Tesla neutral pin
all right put your foot on the brake you
just barely halfway push of it right
here
your filter and now we're in neutral so
I let go
we're pretty much stuff stops oh it
automatically put it into it
automatically put it into the heart mark
how are we going to do this so as soon
as you let go of the nukes we'll put it
in the part yet maybe have to say it in
all cuz the doors open
let me test ok all right I'm in neutral
okay we're stuck in neutral I step sit
in the car at a car smart enough and
knows that is a neutral and you're out
of it if you roll down your window and
you come out of the car we will still
say no is what already went into part
alright so you're gonna have that
passenger you stay there I'll grab the
board so quick thing about the booster
board you have this little handle right
here that basically gives you the
battery life of your boosted board and
it has this knob up top so if I pull
this trigger and roll the knob
forward and backward it's going to move
the boosted boards so right now I'm in
something called like the beginner mode
which is like what noobs are supposed to
be using because I haven't written a
booster board that often so I'm going to
use that first mode and try to move to
Tesla here in the garage and if that
first mode doesn't work I have three
other modes after that that might end up
working so let's see what happens
that's pretty cool we were only in the
dinner mode and the car was moving so
I'm going to jump up to mode number four
by pressing this button three times so
now that it be four times we are now in
the fourth mode which is what the pro
mode is or the advanced mode which I
shouldn't be in right now
so let's see what happens oh I can
really learn how to ride this for
actually finishing ok folds laughs right
now in the boots is sketchy it's right
here we have two different boosted
boards we have mine which is the version
two and we have what's inside which is
the version one and there's a couple
differences between the two one right
here if you can see inside of this motor
as its turning you can see like little
brushes inside and a little copper wires
that make the motor turn this one is all
filled shift on the version to boosted
board if water ever get inside it won't
damage the motors also these cables are
waterproof they're lengthwise the boards
are about the same but it looks like
with the version to the tires are just
slightly bigger and on the version one
you can kind of see the lines where the
cables run from the back to the front
the version 2 doesn't have those yet not
sure if the difficult that haven't
written it enough or if they hit the
wires some other way
about that hi this is where we have
what's inside why is this one cut in
Hampton this was one of our first videos
we did first ever collaboration we could
have a show on earth and that we could
open a booster board we took it to a
skate park first but I didn't know that
these wires went from one side to the
other underneath the grip tape so that
was an interesting thing to find out and
then you can also see down in here with
a circuit board this isn't the battery
this is what charges gets the motor
going here but the batteries on the
other side it talks to each other with
this running down through there all the
way into those holes and then from there
the battery was on there really strong
with the MI on batteries that I was
hitting with a hammer before I knew that
lithium-ion batteries are dangerous to
puncture and that is the only thing that
boosted board officially tied to it they
sent us a tweak saying don't ever hit
batteries it could be very dangerous
so this our video obviously and that's
all they chose to stay on it so I
learned my lesson the one wish that I
have is that the version one was
waterproof because in our gold play
button video I accidentally launched
Lincoln's boosted board which is
actually Casey's that Lincoln was
borrowing into the East River in New
York City and I had to buy him a new one
and it cost me $1,300 but if we would
have had the other one you could have
fished it out like you did that would
have still works though yeah so I did
not expect that to work the Tesla weighs
about 5,000 pounds and including me on
top of the boosted board trying to pull
a car I didn't think it was going to
happen the motor on the boost board is
pretty small
obviously it's probably not the best
thing to do with your boosted board
since the booster board was struggling
pretty hard and the motors were stuck in
one spot they weren't able to spin and
cool down and keep themselves cool as
they were moving and even though this
project was pretty fun it is slightly
unrealistic just because when the Tesla
dies just like Dan said you can't put it
in neutral the battery's dead maybe in
my next video we'll see if a DGI Mavic
can pull a helicopter we never know
what's possible these days I've linked
both kc9 stats and what's inside YouTube
videos for your boosted boards viewing
enjoyment if that thumbs up if you like
seeing technology tested in weird ways
and thanks again for watching I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
