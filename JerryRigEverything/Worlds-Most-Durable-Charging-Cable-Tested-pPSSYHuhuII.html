needs to be charged there's a good
chance that you've owned a broken
charging cable today we're going to be
durability testing the stock iPhone
cable that comes with every new iPhone 7
and a brand new cable that could very
well be the most durable cable in the
world from anchor at the end of this
video we'll be giving away 2000 of these
cables so stick around and thumbs up to
anchor for giving away a bunch of free
stuff let's get started
so we're going to start with the iPhone
cable and I've built this contraption
that sits inside of this Smith machine
right here and it has the cable plugged
into the iphone the cable goes down
tight around this pole right here this
bar and then it's plugged into a power
bank so we can see when the cable
actually stops charging so how the Smith
machine works is that the weights go on
either side and these rails guide it up
and down and so as I add weights to the
end of the bar it's going to be adding
weight to the cable and eventually it's
going to stop working or tear out so
both these cables are brand new we can
already see a difference here on the
head we can see two different materials
and this is usually where the cable
breaks here on the anchor cable it's one
solid piece of rubber all the way down
so that already gives it an advantage if
we look at the USB end of the cable we
kind of have the same thing two
different materials this is kind of a
rubber we'll find out how well they're
joined together in this weight test and
then here we have one solid piece of
rubber all the way down now this is the
weakest point of any cable and by
putting a ton of weight straight down on
this cable we're deliberately testing
the weakest link let's start adding
weight
10 pounds 20 pounds
30 pounds 30 pounds all right that's
interesting
so all it takes is 30 pounds of pressure
and that cable rips right out of the
bottom of your iphone here's what that
other end looks like rip the wires right
out from inside of it it's crazy now the
black anchor cable is plugged in it's
tied to the bar and it's got its power
let's test this thing 10 20 30 now 30s
where the iPhone broke so we'll go 35
still charging 40
all right right on 40 pounds looks like
it ripped right at the bottom as well
but it still held 10 pounds more weight
than the original cable did and 10
pounds is a lot when you're talking
about something as small as this so now
we're going to check the tensile
strength of the actual wire since the
head is already ripped off so we got the
wire knotted at the top and the bottom
and now we're going to add weights to
the end of the Smith machine
so I added a 25 pound weight to the end
of that machine and it ripped the cable
completely in half let's hope the power
line to dura will last a little bit
longer than this did all right the power
line to dura is knotted end that has
been ripped off before with our last
test we wrapped around the Machine we're
good to go
all right 25 pounds
6070
eighty so keep in mind of these tests
aren't extremely scientific we don't
know exactly how much that bar weighs on
the smith machine but what we do know is
that the anchor cable s at four times
longer with the weight and the original
iPhone cable did which is pretty
impressive so now we have both of the
cables torn completely apart let's take
it back to my desk and get a close look
at what the inside of these cables look
like so if you watch the video closely
you'll see that each of the cables broke
along the knots that I tied so my knot
was a factor in it breaking but since
each cable was treated the same way it's
still a pretty fair test between the two
the power line tuturro outperform the
stock iphone cable by quite a large
margin the anchor lightening had handled
30% more weight and the cable itself
held almost four times as much weight as
the iPhone cable but let's be honest the
average person won't be lifting weights
with their cell phone charger bending is
much more common with charging cables
and that's where this rubberneck comes
in handy
Ankur said they tested it to 12,000 hard
bins which means the last 12 times
longer than a normal cable inside this
cable is also super interesting if you
look at the stock iPhone cable you'll
see it has a super weak neck and that's
why so many people complain about having
to hold their cable in a certain spot to
get their phone to charge with one hard
Bend the little fragile wires tear loose
from their connections inside the head
the power line too doesn't have that
problem now when I stripped down the
power line to is immediately evident why
this thing has a lifetime warranty look
at all that metal it's like an
industrial Chinese finger trap toy the
middle helps hold the cable together and
protect the internals if it accidentally
gets kinked stepped on or slammed in a
car door
you know life happens another
interesting thing is the internal
gauging of the wire anchors cables are
mi5 certified if you remember from my
previous video on third-party Apple
accessory standards Ankur does have that
MiFi certification and can use Apple's
port anchor just uses thicker wires more
metal sheathing and has a better neck
basically just beating Apple at their
own game if a 3-foot length isn't your
thing it also comes in one feet six feet
and 10 feet and red black blue and white
coloring it's too bad Apple hands out
those weaksauce cables with every new
iPhone 7 but lucky for us Ankur is
giving away
of these things I'll toss a link right
below this video where you can
participate in that hopefully you can
get one of these cables that lasts
forever instead of the stock ones that
just last a year or two thumbs up to
anchor for sponsoring this giveaway and
if you don't have an iPhone I'm sure you
know someone who does let them know what
incres up to thanks for watching I'll
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
