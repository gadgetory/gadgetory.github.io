pretty impressive specs, but most importantly,
it has a hidden internal mechanical front
facing camera.
Today we're going to delve deep inside the
OnePlus 7, find that camera, and see how the
robotic contraption functions from the inside.
And we'll see what a totally transparent OnePlus
7 would look like.
This video is sponsored by Audible.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
Not gonna lie, I kind of like this Nebula
Blue colored back glass.
It's got that frosty matte finish on top which
will probably cloud the internal components
a bit when we remove the coloring from the
glass, but we'll have to see.
The back glass comes off like most modern
smartphones.
A lot of heat softens the adhesive, and then
my thin pry tools can slip in and slice through
the black sticky stuff holding everything
down.
OnePlus doesn't have a specific IP rating
for the OnePlus 7.
We'll have to delve into that a bit more during
the full tear down.
Right now I'm just being super gentle with
the glass, because glass is glass, and glass
can break.
I'm also being super gentle with my fingers
around that razor blade because fingers are
fingers, and fingers can take...take apart
cellphones.
This is a bit harder than it looks, so I should
probably definitely suggest not attempting
this on your own.
I'll slide off the back panel, the final top
line of adhesive stretching loose, and we
get our first look at the battery.
It's, you know, still not red, but the pull
tab is.
I've been asking OnePlus to bring back the
epic red battery ever since the last one appeared
on the OnePlus 2.
[Flashback 2015] “And this is the best looking
phone I've ever been inside.”
[Flashback 2016] “The biggest disappointment
of this phone is that the battery is not red.”
[Flashback 2017] “We get our first glimpse
at the non-red battery.
I guess OnePlus didn't get the memo that internal
beauty is just as important as external beauty.”
[Flashback 2017] “This also exposes the
totally not red battery.
Kind of disappointing.”
[Flashback 2018] “It's not red.”
[Flashback 2018] “Finally lifting open the
OnePlus 6T reveals no red battery.”
I've been doing this for a really long time,
but I do believe that the squeaky wheel gets
the grease, and we'll have a red battery again
soon.
This time around the battery is black, and
with the red pull tab, I still think it looks
pretty aesthetic, so I think I'll leave it
alone for this OnePlus 7 clear edition.
The motorized camera is up here at the top,
hidden underneath the black plastics, so we'll
have to unbury that component still.
Unfortunately it looks like in my excitement
to take apart the 7, I forgot about the wire
cable attached to the rear sensors and LED
flash, and I kind of decapitated the Lego-style
connector.
(Nobody tell OnePlus.)
I'll use a bit of heat and my razor to pop
off the camera lens housing.
This is it's own separate unit which I think
is a bit better design than LG's idea of using
the entire back panel as a camera lens on
the G8.
Big pieces of glass have more of a chance
of breaking than smaller pieces of glass.
The OnePlus 7 Pro has 10 Philips head screws
holding down the top plastics.
Then the black plastic panel can come off.
It looks like the NCF coil's positioned right
above the motorized front camera.
This camera looks very similar to the one
we saw inside the Vevo Nex S. It also had
a motorized pop up camera.
Let's see how it operates.
I can turn the phone on at this point.
Even in it's undressed state, it will still
function.
I'll make sure not to touch the exposed circuits.
The camera looks like it's operating on a
stepper motor system, spinning it's threaded
shaft to raise and lower the camera in and
out of the phone.
The camera itself has a flexible ribbon that
moves up and down alongside the camera when
the selfie taking is activated.
Eventually, if the OnePlus 7 Pro camera is
constantly moving, a warning will pop up saying
to protect the front camera, we need to not
activate it so frequently.
Probably because the electric motors generate
heat, and if the constant raising and lowering
loads heat the motor up too much, it will
burn itself out sooner.
Where was I?
Oh yeah.
Raising and lowering the camera too much.
OnePlus said that in their own testing, this
camera is capable of raising and lowering
300,000 which is rather impressive.
Manually pressing down on top of the camera
when it's in the open position does engage
a safety mechanism that pulls the camera in
automatically.
Mechanical moving parts inside of a cellphone
are pretty much my favorite hardware feature
of all time.
One of my favorite software features though,
that OnePlus has added to the top pull down
menu, is Zen Mode, which allows you to put
your phone in a notification free totally
locked down mode for 20 minutes.
Disconnected from social media notifications
and the Internet, and you can't access anything
for those 20 minutes.
Only phone calls and the camera app will work
when Zen Mode is enabled.
It physically restricts yourself from accessing
the distractions on your smartphone.
This goes hand in hand with a recent audio
book I've been listening to on Audible.
And thanks to Audible for sponsoring this
video.
It's called The Shallows – What the Internet
is Doing to Our Brains by Nicholas Carr.
He talks about neuroscience and the plasticity
of our brain, and the way our brains are adapting
to receive information.
He says that the little “hits” that social
media and news headlines blips give us are
actually changing our ability to concentrate
on larger projects, and inhibit our ability
to develop those longer term connections in
our brain.
It's a super interesting listen.
You can get this or any other audio book for
free, plus two Audible Originals when you
try Audible for 30 days.
Visit audible.com/jerryrig or text the word
“jerryrig” to 500-500.
Normally I like to bump up the speaking speed
a bit when I'm listening.
The Audible Originals are exclusive audio
titles created by story tellers that sound
way more like an immersive production instead
of just a narration.
It's pretty interesting.
Audible is one of the many ways to develop
those longer term brain connections, and enable
better concentration abilities...you know...the
important stuff.

I've personally been limiting my own social
media intake, and it's good to see OnePlus
providing a built in option for their users
with Zen Mode.
I think every phone should do this.
Let's get back to making a clear OnePlus 7.
The color on glass smartphones isn't dyed
into the glass like on a stained glass window.
It's coated on the underside of the glass,
and shines through the glass to give the phone
color.
Sometimes it's a powder coat, sometimes it's
a weird paint, but more often than not, it's
just a laminate layer that's adhered to the
glass.
And that's the case with this Nebula Blue
OnePlus 7 Pro.
I can use my heat gun once again to soften
the adhesive layer, and then peel it up in
one large chunk.
It's a tedious process since the adhesive
layer is pretty strong, and I don't want to
flex the glass too much or it might shatter
into a million pieces.
But it is rather satisfying to see the blue
coloring come up in one massive piece.
Thumbs up for that.
The logo and text are still etched into the
glass itself, so honestly, it really wouldn't
be hard for OnePlus to make a clear version
of the phone themselves.
Just saying.
It's already ready.
The glass itself is clouded, so from a distance
it kind of blurs out objects, but closer up
things are clear, just with a little matte
finish.
It's not totally transparent, but should still
look pretty cool when finished.
Since the NFC coil on the black plastics will
be blocking our view, I'm going to unwrap
it from the panel and set it off to the side.
The NFC won't work anymore of course, but
I'm willing to make some sacrifices for the
cooler hardware.
And then with a couple of carefully planned
snips from my scissors, we can keep the rest
of the plastics, which have some integrated
antennas and shielding for the motherboard,
but still provide us with a window to the
insides of the phone.
I'll screw everything else back into place
so it's as close to stock as possible.
And then I can clean off the underside of
the rear glass panel to get rid of any fingerprints
and minor adhesive residue.
The laminate coloring did come off pretty
clean.
The rest of the install is pretty simple.
I'll add some thin strong double-sided tape
all around the 4 sides.
I'll link this tape in the description, and
I'll put some on the back of the camera lens,
making sure it's surrounding the entirety
of the edge so that dust won't ever start
to seep in.
Not too shabby.
And that's what the OnePlus 7 looks like totally
naked.
No coloring, hardware exposed, with a see-through
glass panel and a tiny window in the corner
for the coolest part.
The motorized front facing camera is visible.
If OnePlus has gone through all the effort
of adding cool hardware, I think they should
at least want to show it off with a clear
addition, right?
What do you think about about it?
Should I have changed the battery to red,
or do you like the stealthy black?
Should I add the red battery when we delve
deeper into the 10 layer thermal heat pipe
OnePlus has been talking about?
Let me know down in the comments.
Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
I only post a few times a week...you know...keeping
the healthy balance with social media and
real life.
And make sure to grab your free audio book
with the Audible link in the description.
And thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
