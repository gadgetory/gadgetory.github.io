how to replace just the glass on a
samsung galaxy s5 this is one of the
newer phones that just came out and
everything on this phone is working
perfectly except for that the glass is
cracked now you have a couple options
one is just buy the glass which is super
cheap but is very difficult to replace
the second option is to buy the glass
and the LCD combination it's more
expensive but it is much much easier to
replace I will link both of those parts
in the video description below and you
can choose what you want to do I am
using some playing cards a screwdriver
and some tweezers to finish this repair
I'm going to pop off the back cover of
the phone and then underneath this
little plastic piece right here there's
a little ribbon cable that we're going
to disconnect this ribbon cable goes to
the home button on the galaxy s5 I'm
going to pull out the battery pull out
the SIM card and I'm going to use a hot
plate in order to heat my phone up to
the right temperature in order to
separate the screen from the rest of the
body I like to heat it up to about 97
degrees Celsius which is about 206
degrees Fahrenheit there are a couple
different ways that you can heat up the
phone one is with a heat gun so go ahead
and click that top video if you want to
watch how to remove the screen of the
heat gun or you can watch the three
common mistakes that people make when
removing just the glass I would
recommend watching both of those videos
if you're serious about this repair I'm
going to use a knife to get started up
in the top corner and then slip my
playing card inside and this is just
going to help separate the adhesive from
the foam body itself I'm not going to go
too deep into the phone just yet because
there are two important ribbon cables
that are inside of there and if you go
too far you're going to rip them so make
sure to watch farther ahead in the video
as well to see where those ribbon cables
are and make sure you avoid them because
if you do rip them you'll have no option
but to buy the more expensive part
I'm leaving the cards in there as I
slide them in so that the phone doesn't
read here to itself now that it's cooled
down a little bit I'm going to go ahead
and put it back on the heater the hot
plate that I have and once it's heated
up for about a minute or two I'm going
to get back at it again once I have all
the sides separated I'm going to use my
red pry tool and slide it into the phone
to separate the adhesive that's holding
the LCD down to the back of the phone as
well the LCD to this phone is actually
surprisingly resilient it doesn't break
very easily I would be very careful
though as you're sticking the pry tool
down to not damage any of those ribbon
cables so this one right here is one I'm
disconnecting for the LCD and that's
where it connects to the main board and
then as you can see as I'm pulling up
the screen from the phone this little
ribbon cable that goes with the home
button is also pulling through that back
hole I'm going to heat up the screen
again so I can pull off this last little
bit the only thing that's holding the
screen onto the phone right now is the
cables that are in charge of the back
button and menu button so I'm going to
scrape those off the front glass with my
knife and then kind of press them down
into the phone so that they don't rip
they don't get in the way for later now
for the menu button and then I can just
twist the phone off of the adhesive and
pull it off of the main body this right
here is the LCD and glass combination if
this is the part that you're going to
buy you can just go ahead and reattach
that right now and clip it back into
place but if you're going to attempt to
do just the glass repair then I'll show
you how to do that right now
as you can see from the heat and the
prying up we almost separated the LCD
from the glass you can see the glue kind
of separate away I'm going to go ahead
and test the phone right now to make
sure everything's still working looks
like it all turns on in functions
everything's working great so I'm going
to use my hot plate again set the screen
down on top of it and let it warm up for
a couple minutes remember that you can
use a heat gun and a temperature sensor
I'll link these in the video description
below and those will accomplish the same
thing that the hot plate does now that
the screen is heated up to the right
temperature I'm gonna use my playing
cards again to separate the glass from
the LCD and you can see as I go in the
glue just kind of separates you'll see
it kind of streak down the edges of the
LCD as you pull it away also keep in
mind that there is a million things that
can go wrong while you're doing this so
you do this at your own risk and
remember that you might need to buy the
more expensive part anyway if something
goes wrong in your LCD stops working I'm
going to put this screen up every time I
reheat the phone just to remind you what
temperature needs to be yeah you can see
that the glass shards on this phone will
come away individually they're not
laminated like they were on the galaxy
s4 I kind of liked that about the s4
because the screen is so thin the window
of opportunity that you have to pull off
the glass is relatively small because
the screen cools down so quickly and
when the screen cools down the glue is
not as liquid between the glass and the
LCD and is much harder to separate if
your phone has less cracks in it it will
be easier to pull the glass away this
one was pretty obliterated so it makes
it more difficult anyway still
continuing on with the removal of the
glass if you're getting bored of this
whole process and watching me do it you
go ahead to skip to around minute 8 or 9
and that's when I start to read here the
new glass to the LCD using the UV light
and the UV glue so that's pretty
interesting
anyway each time your phone cools down
you need to make sure to heat it up to
the right temperature again and a couple
things to be aware of if you overheat
your phone you're going to discolor the
LCD also when you're pulling away the
glass shards from the body of the phone
if you pull up one edge of the shard
while the other shard is still good you
know adhered to the LCD it's going to
put a lot of pressure on the LCD and
could
possibly crack it so you have to be
super careful with that now if you feel
like you've learned anything or you just
enjoyed watching this video I would
appreciate it if you subscribe to my
youtube channel I do put up videos
pretty much every week usually related
to cell phone repair or automotive
repair you know fixing something here
and there jerry-rigged everything you
can also follow me on instagram at
Zach's jerry-rigged it would be fun to
see your own also while you're doing
your own repair if you think of any more
hints or things that I left out of this
video make sure to leave them down in
the comments below for other people it's
always good to have a group
conglomeration of ideas when attempting
a project this hard anyway continuing
onward with the cards I'm just going to
go around the edge of the LCD super slow
you know slow and steady make sure you
don't break anything I would say that
this whole entire project took me about
two hours two and a half hours if you're
just planning on doing the LCD and glass
swap which is the more expensive part I
would say the process would take about
you know 25 or 30 minutes removing the
glass is a little more complicated and
you know you want to take your time just
you don't have to you know spend the
extra money on the whole part itself
anyway we're getting closer here all the
big shards are pretty much taken away
I'm going to eat it up one more time you
have about a 30 second window just
because the glass is so small and so
thin it doesn't retain heat very well so
it cools down very quickly and that
makes it harder when you're trying to
keep the glue liquid so you can separate
the glass from the rest of the phone
anyway now that there's just little
shards left I found that it was easier
to go in a kind of sawing motion with my
card I would just run the edge of the
card down along the pieces of glass and
it would almost twist them out instead
of lift them up if that makes sense you
can kind of see me do it here in the
video
for those of you in the future who are
going to attempt this without a
temperature sensor to tell you what
temperature the phone is that you're
going to want to heat it up to the point
that it's too hot to touch comfortably
you won't be able to rest your finger on
it for more than maybe a second at a
time and then you'll know that the glue
between the glass and the LCD is ready
to be separated anyway as you can see
the whole slicing motion with the card
works pretty well to get the little
shards off I'm just going to town on
those right now brushing a little bits
away with my fingers as well to keep the
screen as clean as possible this last
little bit went pretty quick I have this
whole process sped up right now to about
400% so it's four times faster than how
I normally did it all right now I'm
going to make sure I didn't break
anything on the screen pop the battery
in plug it in and it looks like
everything's still working so I'm still
good to go with just the glass repair
now if something wasn't working at this
point you have to buy the more expensive
part and rolled up now right here in
order to get the rest of the glue off
I've found that the easiest way is to
just kind of roll it off with my fingers
you can see that I'm just pressing up
against it and just rubbing the glue off
and little rolls as I go down and this
gets the big chunks of glue off that
won't come off with the the denatured
alcohol that I use once the main chunks
are gone you can see me have a little
rag right here and I'm just using the
denatured alcohol to get rid of the rest
of the residue off of the LCD pretty
straightforward now I'm going to put the
home button back on just so I can use it
to line up the glass as I position it on
top of the LCD again makes it a little
bit easier this is the UV glue some
people call it loca it's the optical
grade ultraviolet adhesive I've linked
it in the video description below so you
can check that out and get it there with
the UV glue it's a little bit easier
with the galaxy s5 than it is the s4
because the run-off glue just ends up on
the paper towel below you you want to
put the glue on just like this
so that when you place the glass on it
it'll run towards the edges and you'll
see why in just a second here's the
glass once again you can find these in
the video description below I'll link
all the parts you need down there and
I'm going to go super slow with this the
slower you go the less bubbles you'll
have under your screen I lined it up
with the home button and I'm just
starting very gently with the bottom
edge of the screen and slowly lowering
it down on the glue you can see how the
glue acts once the glass touches it put
my pair of tweezers underneath the top
of the glass and I'm still just going to
lower it down if you do it any quicker
than this bubbles can form in the glass
and it's super difficult to get them out
you have to kind of push them and you
have to kind of push them towards the
edge of the screen it gets a little bit
annoying so just go slow and steady them
just like the rest of this repair
now that the glass is fully dropped on
the screen I can take my finger and just
press right there in the center of it
and that'll just make the glue run
towards the edges kind of sweet how this
works just press where you want and the
glue goes out the nice part about this
is that as I'm pressing it down the glue
is going to kind of suction the glass to
the LCD and this is super important
because when I'm going to line the LCD
up with the glass I can just lift the
whole contraption up off of the paper
towel flip it over and make sure that
the edges of the phone as you can see
the black line around the edge of the
copper there as equal on both ends
that's how you know the LCD is correctly
positioned in the glass window so you
won't have any laps or gaps in the LCD
when you're putting it back together I'm
going to flip it over one more time and
make sure that it's completely aligned
up as well at the bottom and you can see
a little bit of glue seeped out the
edges this is totally normal and I'll
show you what to do with that in a
second
okay so here's the UV light once again
I'll put this in the video description
below if you need to buy it and you
would use this for any type of repair in
the future the UV glue is a really great
way to replace the glass on your screen
it's not even very expensive anyway so
I'm going to go ahead and just brush all
the top really quick and this will kind
of get at
underneath the whole process only takes
about you know a minute or two for the
glue to completely cure I'm just going
to rest the light on top of the phone
and let it sit there for a little bit
now that that's done I'm going to take a
little rag and wipe away the excess glue
along the edge of the phone making sure
to get both sides down around the button
and then I'm going to go over with the
UV light one more time just to cure any
glue that might have seeped out from
around the edges and this will make it
so you don't have any excess glue inside
of your phone which is nice now I'm
going to test it make sure everything
works I'm going to clip that screen back
in put the battery in and it looks like
we're good to go everything is 100%
functional so the only thing we have to
worry about now is making sure that the
glass well the whole screen unit itself
can be adhered back to the phone body
I'm going to clean out underneath the
home button as well alright so this is
the double-sided sticky tape I will link
this in the video description below as
well and I'm going to just go to town on
the inside of the phone and put the
sticky tape everywhere I would make sure
to focus on the edges of the phone as
well as the top making sure not to cover
anything important like the cameras or
the home button and right now I'm going
to take the the back button and the menu
buttons the stuff that you peeled off
the front glass earlier I'm just going
to lay them in the little grooves that
are already made for them that way when
I put on the front glass I don't have to
worry about it I'm going to take off the
paper from the double-sided sticky tape
and prep the screen to be position back
into place remember the little ribbon
cable that goes through this back slot
just kind of feed that through to start
off with plug the screen in make sure
that it's working everything is
functioning well so I can just take the
screen and press it back into place
making sure that it's completely stuck
down along the tops the edges and the e
bottom I'm going to clip the ribbon
cable down onto the mainboard underneath
that little plastic bracket thing and
snap the back cover in place and there
you go whether you did just the glass
repair or you did the more expensive
part which is the LCD and the glass
either way it is very impressive repair
