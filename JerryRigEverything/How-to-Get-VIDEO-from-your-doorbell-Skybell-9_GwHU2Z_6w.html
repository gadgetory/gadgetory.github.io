leave my house an important package is
delivered while I'm gone or maybe when
I'm home the delivery guy doesn't even
ring the doorbell and leaves my new
stuff on the porch today skybell sent me
something that might just solve all my
problems
skybell is a 1080p video doorbell that
can detect and record movement and allow
you to see what's outside your front
door whenever you want inside the box we
have the sky bell itself I have the
silver version it has a metallic finish
but the body is actually plastic like
most doorbells are below that we have a
mounting plate and screws and a drill
bit for brick houses and a screwdriver
below that we have one more little
adapter that you'll only need if your
doorbell is digital pretty easy to
install but my doorbell is all
mechanical as you can see here a digital
doorbell would have a speaker instead of
the metal tone bars installing a
doorbell is actually pretty easy it's
just a simple switch you have two little
signal wires that will disconnect from
the old doorbell if you touch these live
wires together your doorbell will go off
the vast majority of doorbells will use
low voltage wires so touching them is
safe but it's your job to make sure that
your own doorbell isn't using standard
voltage wires or this could very well be
your last do-it-yourself project I'm
screwing the new backplate into one of
the original holes and then starting my
own hole for the bottom screw luckily my
door frame is made out of wood drilling
a new hole into brick is a whole
different project for another day the
signal wires get tucked below each
little screw on the left I find it's
easier to tuck the wire end at the base
of the head that way when you tighten
the screw the screw pulls the wire
deeper underneath it instead of pushing
it out like it would if you put the wire
at the top of the screw make sure the
wires are tucked out of the way and then
the sky bill will clip in up top and
screw in at the bottom it'll charge up
for a few minutes and then when it
starts blinking red and green connect
your phone to the Wi-Fi signal it is
emitting this will allow the skybell app
to sync the doorbell with your home
Wi-Fi that way it can communicate with
your phone wherever you are even outside
of your house and you can immediately
start recording live video now even
though this particular video is 720p it
is extremely low bitrate since it's
live-streaming here is some sample
footage indeed the video footage does
look pixelated but just remember that
you're literally watching a video feed
from a doorbell the future is here
inside of the skybell app you can change
several settings one of the coolest is
you can actually turn your doorbell off
this is awesome if you have a sleeping
baby inside the house or me when I'm
doing voiceovers your phone will still
be notified that the doorbell rang but
there will be no sound echoing inside of
your house you can change the motion
detection sensitivity the high
sensitivity would go off whenever
someone walked on that sidewalk in front
of my house so I switched it to low you
can also change the color of the LED up
front it is way bright and kind of
distracting so I just turned it off
altogether but you know for Christmas or
Halloween this could be a cool feature
overall this is an interesting fun
little piece of tech even though the
angle of the lens wouldn't let me see
the packages on the ground of my porch
it is still useful in other ways the
motion detection feature might come in
handy whenever the camera turns on it
will save the video feed to a cloud but
you can always download individual clips
that you need to your phone storage
big thanks to sky bill for sending me
this interesting gadget I'll keep the
video description updated with my review
on it as time progresses thanks for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
