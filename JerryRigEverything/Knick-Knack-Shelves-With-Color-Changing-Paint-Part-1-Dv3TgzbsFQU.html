to make these knickknacks shelves that I
saw on an internet site it's pretty
popular basically the shelves look a lot
like this these are the exact shells
we're going to be making I'm gonna kind
of walk you through it step by step
these ones are actually made with the
color shifting paint that kind of shifts
from green to purple I don't know if you
can tell really with this camera it
looks pretty cool it's kind of a subtle
change just goes from green to black to
purple kind of cool I like it anyway
you're real
all right so all the plans are writable
on the internet so you can find them you
know on your school comm Google books I
think it was so it's nothing that's you
know top-secret or anything like that so
I'll give it a link down in the comments
now where the plans can be located and
also kind of inclusion here at the video
as well just you know again
you
okay so right now in the medium-sized
stencil so what I've done is I've taken
the measurements have right here so four
feet five inches and nine sixteenths is
the top nine inches and five sixteenth
is the width of it and then I found the
middle of it
two and two with two feet two inches and
3/4 and I find the middle because when
you're going to make the curve on it you
have to put the peak of the curve right
here on the string just kind of find
yourself on down by this corner over
here so you have to just curve it up and
down like that so I've been using is
this strap right here
I find the radius of it and just put the
pencil the radius on this one is about
three feet eleven and five sixteenths
and so I have a little mark right here
on my strap and so I'm just going to
line that mark up with the peak and just
kind of hold the pencil as it curves
down and that's how you get the perfect
arc on I give that a shot right now so
on the stop up dead center with this
line right here that's why I put my
finger on the peak of that and I swing
it down like that it ends up right down
there at the bottom corner so once I am
going to stab a pencil
through this just like that and I'll
keep the lead in the same spot and I'll
be able to make a perfect arc so I had
to put a poster down as well and on to
keep the cable from stacking on the
concrete if you can see there I have the
perfect curve for that shelf so that
stencils done on you to do is cut it out
he's kind of got to repeat that process
for every stencil you know getting a
length getting the height I'm finding
the midpoint and then getting a string
so you can draw the perfect circle so
there might be a better way to do that
personally this way we're
for me so once you have all the stencils
is pretty much the hardest part of the
whole project anyway so now I'm making
the lines like the slots of where the
the board slide into each other so I'm
going to start marking the mouth so this
is the center line right here I'm just
going to double check to make sure I
have the center line in the same spot so
that's the kind of like 26 and 3/4
this one is looking what's going from
end to end here to the center just what
I was looking right on 26 and 3/4 as
well so tiny bit off on that one okay
it'll be alright so then what we do is
we come four and a half inches on either
side of this and make a mark and then
what I do once I have that mark made I
use this thing right here just kind of
because the material I'm using is kind
of like a plastic just put the mark
right here off the edge of the table so
this is flat then I can draw a straight
line between the two just right along
that edge so right here I have the large
party made up at the centerline and I'm
mark in the middle of each of the other
slots so I want to have the middle then
ask me to go to make make the slot 3/4
inches just divide that in half and put
half on the other side I might just get
a piece of the plywood and just lay it
down and just trace the outside of it
so that's for the slots still making
this stencil what I'm doing as I went to
a three-eighths on either side of that
Center mine you know how I went a four
and a half here and then I have nine
inches between these Center lines and so
now I'm coming across from the other
side lining that up and then continuing
the line with my pencil just like that
come on right in there and then I just
go in and I fill in the lines just to
make sure that I don't that I know where
the the center marks are
all right we have all the senses done
just like I mentioned before you know
four and a half inches from the center
line and then nine inches in between
them all from nine inches on center okay
so right here at all the stencils lined
up this is important to do just to make
sure all your slots are in the right
spot so if you have let's say this is
over like half an inch it's not going to
mesh well with the rest of the pieces so
all your lines have to be in the in the
correct positions so make sure you check
that before you do any marks on the
boards as far as the slots go
you
all right so we're turned up working out
for me is taking a tape measure and
going up the sides and putting a market
every 10 inches just so I know where I'm
at to try to keep the whole thing about
parallel now on this side as well
keeping me every 10 inches and I finally
got the little ones to fit up at the top
so that was probably a super huge puzzle
but in the end it worked out so I know
you've got to cut them out and then make
the slots just cutting out the shapes
right now I'm doing it with the jigsaw
one of these look guys I figured that
was the best thing to use in this
situation just because you have the
curves any other type of saw would have
been would have taken too long or even
too hard to make the turns with like a
skill saw or something like that um so
yeah so I'm just cutting out the basic
shapes right now I haven't marked or cut
the grooves in it yet I'm going to do
that afterward just because it'll be a
little easier to cut the grooves so I
have this straight edge to go off of I
can use that same metal square that I
was using before so yeah it's pretty
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
