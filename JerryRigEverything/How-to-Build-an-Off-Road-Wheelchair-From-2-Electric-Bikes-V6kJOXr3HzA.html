in a wheelchair
now wheelchairs are great for pavement
and flat surfaces but not so much for
off-road adventures I secretly built
this off-road wheelchair by tying two
electric bikes together with the seat in
the center kind of like a chariot of
sorts it goes 20 miles an hour with a
range of about 20 miles which is pretty
cool and this video shows how I put the
whole thing together if I were to build
it again though I would get bikes that
have a suspension in the rear as well as
the front so it has a smoother ride
while off-roading and going over curbs
and stuff let's get started so behind me
I have two normal electric off-road
bikes with the super big fat tires and
we're gonna try to combine these two
bikes into an off-road pod racer chariot
of sorts type contraption a contraption
where someone can sit in the center
between the two bikes and still be
completely stable so the goal here is to
preserve as much of the structural
integrity of the bikes as possible
trying to leave them in pretty much the
same condition as they are right now
since a lot of planning probably went
into the design of these bikes and we
don't want to change too much of it we
want the rigidity the safety and
security that is already naturally built
into the frame we just want to modify it
a little bit okay so one of the
structurally sound points of the bike is
right where the pedals intersect with
the frame so we're gonna use that as one
of the strongest points for this chariot
podracer thing we're gonna make so I've
cut this bar we've already removed the
pedals and we're gonna stick this right
in between where the pedals used to be
are
so even with just that one bar in
between where the petals used to be this
is already super solid the thing I'm
excited about is that the brakes are
still intact on the rear and the front
and the front shocks are still intact so
it still should operate as one bike
would except for we have two
so those tacks should hold it in place
just long enough for us to situate it on
the other side of the bike so let me
show you where we're at with the bikes
we just finished welding up the seat
frame which is gonna be the perfect size
for the current cushion she has on her
wheelchair made sure that was the right
size so luckily the seats resting on the
back of the frame and then it can just
rest forward and I want the seat to be
slightly elevated back so when she's
driving around
she's not gonna slowly slide off the
front of the seat so it's gonna be
raised up a little bit we have that bar
down there so that should be the perfect
distance to keep her on the seat while
it's moving and for her legs to go
downward towards the middle of the front
wheels so we know that this bar is
secure where the pedals used to be we
have this all-thread bar right here
stuck through the bottom brackets all
the way through the bar Scruton is some
massive washers a locking washer and
then a nut and that will keep it tight
the whole time she's on the bike so you
can see the excess of the all threads
sticking out on this side obviously
we'll cut this off before we finish
we're just making sure that it's all in
place while we finish fabricating the
seat so far I'm pretty pumped that was
turning out I think it's gonna work it's
pretty cozy for me should fit camber
pretty well right now only one bike is
turned on we have the seat all welded
into place the steering wheels aren't
tied up in tandem yet but I think we
have that figured out but right now I
need to hide the bikes as cambrie's
coming over this is no way
and that's just with one bike motor
moving right now so stoked this is
awesome
okay so the bikes are strapped together
we have the seat basically built we
don't have the leg extensions yet we
want to figure out the steering just in
case we have to tie in to the metal for
the seat we think we have it though
there's a little hole in the front of
the shock where a light is supposed to
go we're gonna use that hole and drill
in this angle bracket it's kind of like
something you'd hold up a shelf with and
we're just gonna cut one of these sides
off have it extend out and then attach
the two with the metal bar that way the
front wheels are locked together so if
you turn one the other turns with it and
they won't bind up while you're driving
right here we went with the bolt right
through the top that a washer then the
metal bar we just drilled through with
another washer right between them the
stabilizer right here
you had another washer and then a
locking nylon knot between them all then
when we tilt the steering wheel back and
forth both tires turn and tandem we have
the front bar in that ties the front two
wheels together so they turn in tandem
and then we have the seat and the next
thing we're gonna work on is the leg
rest now initially I thought that she
would be able to sit here and then like
extend her legs like she's laying down
but that would block the wheels from
turning so there would be like a metal
cage right here and so she wouldn't have
a very tight turning radius and I feel
like it's way more important to have a
tight turning radius so we're gonna drop
her legs straight down so our legs are
almost at a 90 degree angle coming off
the seat and dropping straight down to
rest on the footrest
so this is how the steering is normally
but if we take it and turn it drop it
down and rotate it backwards so it's
parallel with the wheel itself and then
tighten it down with these bolts right
here then the wheel will turn when the
steering wheel is parallel with the tire
and with the throttle right here and
right there she can control both the
motors independently of each other while
she's driving and her field of view is
still wide open we're just getting rid
of all the stuff we don't need on the
handlebars like the little bells and
also the the gear shifter because we
don't need that because no one's gonna
be pedaling on this bike okay so we have
bolt the handlebars cut off the front
which turned out pretty sweet-looking we
have the cable wrapping around the side
looks pretty minimalist the computer
still sits very comfortably right there
on the inside of the handle with the
power switch and the brake that can just
be accessed with your thumb but now it's
time to work on the back so I've taken a
look at her wheelchair and I'm gonna
kind of design the same little footrest
thing we were using before take that and
put it right here on the back about 11
inches up which will clear the tire just
barely and then come down here on the
other side and then probably use some
flat plate along the sides in the bottom
to keep everything secure and for
somewhere to put her pad when she's
off-roading on this bicycle so I am
definitely not a professional welder by
any means but welding is actually pretty
cool with welding we're running
electricity through this metal so we
have a ground right here we can clamp it
anywhere to our work of art that we're
constructing right now and this gun
right here spits out a little bit of
metal each time I pull the trigger and
it's part of what conducts the
electricity and helps melt the metal
together and adds a little bit of metal
to the joint that we're making it's
pretty solid I can move the whole bike
with it but I'm not gonna put a lot of
pressure on it yet once we pull this out
of the bike frame I'm gonna solidify all
of the welds we've made then I'll put
the bike back together for some testing
this is all the metal for the seat the
frame anyway we're gonna put
a metal plate over the top the back is
at a slight angle towards the rear but
that's fine because the seat is also a
slight angle up just a tiny bit which
you can see a little better right here
the seat is up and the back is just
barely tilted back a tiny bit
so this is the back of the chair I've
added some straps from the back to the
base this is where she will sit and then
down here at the bottom we want to
support this leg structure so I'm going
to take this bar and put it right behind
these two for a little added support and
you'll see what that looks like when
it's back on the bikes again
she is ready for a test ride we got the
foot thing in place I'll still clean up
my welds a little bit later and then we
have the side of the chair bolted into
the frame back there with that little
u-bolt which keeps being super secure
especially at high speeds which since
this thing is capable of 20 miles an
hour being structurally sound is a good
thing okay so far it's holding my weight
200 pounds right there on the footrest
not too shabby
you just cozy okay okay both computers
are on both brakes work probably finds
something do like a parking brake at
some point I think all right so I've
dismantled the bike one last time so we
can powder coat the seat powder coating
is a type of really really thick paint
that gets cooked onto the surface of the
metal to make it look you know a little
bit more professional than kind of what
we've been doing here the metal
fabrication can probably be custom fit
to any size even a double-wide if the
metal is rigid or not it's hard to say
without trying it out for sure it'll be
fun to see what you come up with hit
that thumbs up button and if you ever
end up building one of these off-road
wheel chairs go karts for yourself I
want to see it cambrie had no idea I was
building this bike so her reaction to
receiving it was pretty fun I'll link
that video up here and down in the video
description as well so you can watch
that maybe you know someone who could
use this or you just want a
sweet-looking go-cart for yourself it's
pretty fun and powerful feel free to
share this video thanks ton for watching
hit that subscribe button and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
