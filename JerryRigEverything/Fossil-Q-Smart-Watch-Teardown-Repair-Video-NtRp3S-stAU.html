watch made from an actual watch company
the fossil queue I've tried other
smartwatches but they're cheap feeling
faced and bands always leave me feeling
like I'm not actually wearing a real
watch and well now it's time to do that
thing I do with every piece of tech that
I like take it apart as always I'm going
to turn the watch off first and then
flip it over to the back so I can remove
the four small Phillips head screws that
hold the metal band to the brains it was
surprisingly easy to separate the two
from each other it's literally just the
four tiny screws doing all the holding
watches generally aren't abused too much
so the four screws will definitely be
sufficient I was just a little surprised
there wasn't more now the back of this
watch is plastic this is because the
wireless charging doesn't work through
metal so it's plastic out of necessity
you can see as I pull the black back off
it has some yellowish glue and a black
rubber gasket this fossil watch has an
ip67 rating same as the original Apple
watch so huge thumbs up for water
resistance you can see the metal contact
points from the wireless charger on the
inside of the black panel these just
rest up against the two motherboard pins
to transfer power and then from the
motherboard the power goes onto the
battery there are three ribbon cables
here the top two are for the LCD screen
and the digitizer and then the bottom
tiny little guy is just for the battery
these are the same Lego light
connections that we see on every single
cell phone there are two t5 screws
holding the board down remember I always
link the tools that I use in the video
description so if you want one of these
toolkits click there I'll link to watch
down there for kicks and giggles as well
now this board is soldered onto the
watch frame this could be a way to
ground the board like you see in all the
iPhones but it is slightly unfortunate
because it brings repairability down a
notch either way we can still see all
the important things from here and I can
keep my watch functional as we review it
down at the bottom we have the
microphone hole and it's ribbon
connector it just gets plugged into the
motherboard when the motherboard gets
pressed back down into the frame on the
bottom of the motherboard we have this
battery it is a 1.5 2 watt hour and 3.8
volts and the little spinning doohickey
over here is the vibration motor for
your notifications as it spins you get
the vibrating sensation on your wrist
now the gold part you see here with the
ribbon cables is the back of the LCD it
looks like this is the type of screen
that if you want to replace you have to
break the old one out of the frame
first I did a brief search for
replacement parts and I didn't find any
but I'll keep the video description
updated if they become available in the
future the button on the side of the
watch has three golden contact points on
the inside and you can see the
motherboard also has three pins that
rest up on these contact points so it
can receive the signal from the button
I'll push the motherboard and battery
back down into place and make sure it
clicks into the microphone plug then
I'll get those two t5 screws back into
place as well and then clip the battery
ribbon and the two screen ribbons down
like little Legos at this point the
watch can turn on if it doesn't the
watch just might need to be charged up
for a few minutes to restore power to
the motherboard make sure that the
plastic back of the watch is lined up
with the two charging contact points on
the motherboard before putting it down
into place and then the whole
contraption can be put back inside of
the thick heavy metal watch band and
screw it into place if you want to see
one of the first Android smartwatches
ever built that I took apart a few years
ago go ahead and click that link
on-screen and hit that subscribe button
if you want to stay on the bleeding edge
of tech I took apart the Apple watch as
well thanks for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
