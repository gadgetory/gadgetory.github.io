manual Toyota Tacoma I have four years
my last truck was a manual this truck is
a manual I don't drive an automatic
vehicle because I like being in control
well this is a Tesla and it has
something called autopilot which means
it basically drives for you one of the
questions I've had in my head is can you
text and drive a Tesla at the same time
while it's doing its autopilot thing
because it's actually illegal in 47
states to text and drive at the same
time but what if you're not technically
driving there's only one way to find out
we're in the middle of nowhere right now
on a very secluded road where it should
be safe to do this let's get started
alright so this is the Model X there is
a total of eight cameras surrounding
this thing we're gonna see if we can
find them all I know up here by the
rearview mirror there are three cameras
one pointing straight forward and two at
a diagonal I believe then there's
another camera right here up here by the
driver's seat just kind of like points
down to the road to find the lanes that
you're in there's also a series of
ultrasonic sensors which are these
little bits right here I assume they're
plastic here by the passenger side
window we have another camera and
there's a camera right here on the side
pointing back towards the lane so that
should be all of the cameras and the
ultrasonic sensors there's another four
sensors on the front as well here and
they're same on the other side so all of
those sensors and radar which i think is
behind the rear view mirror as well it
could be similar different that's just
where it's out of my coma I should be
able to keep us safe while we're driving
I just put my foot on the brake oh and
the door closes alright so we are
currently inside the Model X and it has
this huge dash right here with the
display got the testing logo so Dan how
do we turn on the autopilot okay so
first of all you need to be driving the
car is always looking and it's showing
you up here in the front it has to see
the lines on the road and see it long
enough to recognize that okay this is a
road we can drive I can look at this and
then it's always looking at the other
cars so once it pops up and you're in a
place where it's legitimately a safe or
a good place for you to do it then there
will be a little gray steering wheel
that will pop up right here
and then you know you're ready to enable
it and at that point there's a little
lever on the side you just have to pull
back on it two times and you'll be good
to go
all right so right now our route is
programmed for CES because that's where
we're headed we're headed to a hi-tech
conference in a high-tech car pretty
stoked about that so I am going to
switch us down into drive
there is no key for like you know
ignition for this car because there's no
combustion engine it's just like an
electric engine underneath and so the
car is ready to go right now and it's so
weird to me because there's like no
explosions happening under the hood or
under the bonnet if you're on the other
side of the ocean and so we're gonna go
ahead and merge over into this Lane
we're on the road and the computer right
now if you can show the dashboard right
here it's showing us that we can see the
lanes that were in it shows either side
of it and it can say like if I emerge
over a little bit to the side over here
it shows me at the edge of the lane or
if I get on the other side it'll move
over to that side of the lane so it's
keeping track with all of those cameras
around the outside of the vehicle where
we are located in the lane itself okay
one thing that is super important is
that there does have to be lions on the
road for the autopilot to work and so if
we want to show the road right now we
can see that there's lions on this newly
paved road so we should be fine and then
here on the dashboard we have this grey
steering wheel icon which means that we
are enabled and ready to go into
autopilot the icons this little guy
right here so in order to get on
autopilot I'm going to pull in so it's
not these top two shifters but there's a
shifter underneath and I'm gonna pull it
twice and I'll hear this little ding and
then the steering wheel starts moving by
itself it's the strangest thing and so
right now it's set it shows me the speed
limit so the speed limit shows up right
here and my max is one mile an hour
above the speed limit I'll drop that
down one more and so there's blue
steering wheel right here shows us that
we're in autopilot and it shows us where
in the lane we currently are and the
cars driving completely by itself like
it just took a turn in the car and I
didn't
touch a thing so when I turn on the
autopilot on this vehicle there is
little warning message that pops up
telling me to keep my hands close to the
steering wheel at all times because
remember autopilot is different than
autonomous driving and I do have to be
ready to take over just in case anything
goes wrong remember full autonomous
driving has not been approved yet in the
United States and that's why the
hardware is ready inside of the Tesla's
but it's not enabled yet so every now
and then this will pop up a little
warning telling me that I have to it
like hold on to the steering wheel in
order for it to continue taking us to
our destination or where we have planned
to go and so while I can look at you and
talk to you and the cars gonna do all
the turning and braking and like if
another car merges into our lane is
going to stop it's still going to make
sure that I'm awake and that I'm
attentive by having me see right here it
says hold the steering wheel and the
outside of this frame has started to
flash a little bit so I'm gonna grab the
steering wheel with my hands and then
that warning sign goes away and then it
goes back to autonomous driving so I am
looking forward to the fully autonomous
driving in the future this autopilot is
a step in that direction my question is
what happens when someone gets too
comfortable on this autopilot so right
now that warning message just popped up
on the steering wheel saying I have to
grab the steering wheel to show that I'm
attentive I'm not texting I'm not you
know watching a movie or something like
that
so we're gonna see how long it takes for
the car to actually stop we just heard a
beep and it doesn't know if I'm asleep
it doesn't know if I'm texting it
doesn't know if I'm talking to a YouTube
camera so it just beeped again so if I
was falling asleep I probably would be
awake by now and I could show that I'm
unavailable for the rest of the drive
and it stops in the middle of the ride
so there's a car coming so I'm gonna
move our car really quick it just said
press the accelerator pedal everything
turned off as soon as I accelerated and
okay so now we're gonna pull over and
assess what just happened here I've
never done that in my Tesla and I was
pretty nervous and I was surprised at
how fast it was like that happened quick
yeah like if we let's say I was having a
heart attack or like some kind of
medical emergency or something like that
no I I kind of
wish that would have pulled over the
side of the road maybe with autopilot it
doesn't know what Lane were in and so it
just stopped in the side of the road
turned on our flashers which is probably
a good thing but that was really
interesting it happened really quick
what was that between the time that we
know we started autopilot and I never
touched the steering wheel it was
probably within about 60 seconds that
was interesting that was pretty quick
that was a little scary I didn't expect
it to stop in Miller Road like what if
you are driving on the actual freeway
we're on a safe road off in the middle
of a not even a town we're in some
farmland but what if you're on the
freeway four-lane highway going 85 miles
an hour to neut ah the speed limit is 80
on some of these roads and the car just
stops and turn-ons on the flashers right
in the middle road I guess it's safer
than if you had a heart attack and the
car just kept on going and veered off
and stopped that's definitely one way to
get your attention one thing that did
freak me out a little bit and I hope
that it you know doesn't mess up the car
permanently it said that it was that
feature was not gonna be available for
the rest of the drive so I'm curious now
that if we start the car up again that
gray steering wheel which allows us to
go into autopilot is not popping up so I
wonder what that punishment period is I
wonder how long that's gonna last well
thanks to your little test Zac it's now
like we have six and a half hours left
el Vegas we're driving an autonomous car
we can't even use autopilot the rest of
the trip I win some you lose no we'll
keep track of it we'll drive for another
four or five hours and we'll see if that
great steering wheel pops up and in the
meantime I'm sorry Dan that your car is
not autonomous anymore okay here's what
I think is gonna happen I'm hoping we're
about 15 minutes away from an actual
super charging station so I'm hoping
that if we sit in part for maybe 30
minutes get some electricity in this car
maybe it'll count as a new session a new
driving session once we get back on the
road because 600 riving to Las Vegas to
see us with no autopilot I know it's
like firstworldproblems but I really
like my autopilot
nice you may have killed it I hope it
comes back good news we made it to Las
Vegas and even better news the autopilot
started working thank you for not
breaking it so we had to stop in charge
like 15 or 20 minutes after we did our
test and then we started the car again
the autopilot was working and it worked
for the rest of the trip we did not try
to make the car break again but it was
interesting to see the probation period
between when we broke it and when it
started working again it really wasn't
much and I would think that Tesla would
maybe punish you a little bit more
because you got to think about it like
you fell asleep where you're texting or
just weren't paying attention it was
like yelling out of beeping and shining
lights at us but yet 20 minutes later 30
minutes later autopilot is engaged it'll
be interesting to see what happens when
the fully autonomous driving kicks in
and what kind of stipulations there are
with that technology when it's you know
legal and implemented and everything the
coolest part to me though about this
road trip was that we didn't pay one
single cent for gasoline that is really
nice I mean those of you that are buying
a Model 3 right now I know a lot of
those are going out you have to pay for
your super charging at all these
stations always is still cheaper than
gas but for the Model S and the Model X
they have this referral program right
now to where if you use somebody's code
somebody that already has a Tesla then
you get you're charging for free and
that's only until I think January 31st
and then Tesla will probably come out
with another one but if you're thinking
about getting a Tesla within the next
few months now would probably be the
time so that you can take advantage of
that free super charging so I'm gonna
still dance code and put it down in the
description so if you're thinking about
buying a Tesla for it's been on your
mind and you want that free unlimited
charging for life for life of the car
yeah that you own it that goes down the
description that's a pretty good deal so
we're at Vegas and one of the coolest
things that I'm looking forward to at
CES is all of the electric cars there's
one in particular tomorrow that is
especially fascinating so stick around
for that thanks a ton for watching and
I'll see you guys around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
