front fender on a Nissan Sentra you can
see that this one is just you know
completely bent off so I had a new
vendor right here
oddly enough so we can see where those
screw holes are so you can see there's
some mounting holes the front and then
along the top and along that bottom side
I'm just gonna go through and unscrew
all the holes on this fender here you
can see the screw holes here they're in
there then pop the new one back into
place and there's one inside the door
right here as well as I think there's
another one down there at the bottom but
this one's been broken off and there's
another one right inside here on the
bumper on this little slot it just goes
through there so quick as I'd know if
you plan on getting yours painted
there's a good chance that the paint
shop will want if this before you mount
it on your car so they can paint the
inside edge of it because with their
paint gun once it's mounted it won't
grab the inside edge and you might have
some black marks you know showing
eventually so this one I'm not going to
get painted we're just going to leave it
black but then once they've painted the
inside you mount it and they could blend
it with the car to match better because
paint fades over time and it's not the
same color now as it was stock you know
ten years ago but since I'm just leaving
this one black we're not going to have
it painted at all it's already coated so
it's not going to rust or anything and
here you can see on the original piece
what I was talking about with that
painting the inside edges first before
you put it on doing what they did at the
factory anyway so there's a bunch of
little plastic bits on this that you can
transfer over to the new one if you want
a lot of work it's not going to hold the
bumper in place a lot of this is broken
though so I'm just going to have to get
some other kind of fasteners to just you
know tighten the bumper onto the main
metal part
but I'm ready to put the other fender in
place then by opening the door all the
way I had enough room to slide that in
and now I just need to screw it all back
down again getting those three screws
along the top two screws down by the end
and then the one screw on the inside of
this bumper right here and then I'm
gonna have to find some new fastener
because this has been ripped through
gonna find a new fastener to tighten
these two things together and we should
be set down here along the bottom there
is a nether bolt right here this was a
little bit bin so I had to hit it a
couple times with a hammer to straighten
it out and then get that screw in it was
pretty solid I'll link the part for the
fender in the video description below
you can get them for pretty much any
vehicle on Amazon so check there and
then feel free to price-match for this
connection right here I just use an
extra bolt locking washer and not that I
had laying around so I turned out pretty
good and everything's back on this part
right here is actually pretty cheap got
it off Amazon flex sixty or seventy
bucks and all the fenders are pretty
much the same no matter what vehicle
you're working on so any questions make
sure to leave in the comments below
