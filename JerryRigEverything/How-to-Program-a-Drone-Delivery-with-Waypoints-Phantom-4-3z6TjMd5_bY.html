my buddy Jared he's a big youtuber who
lives close by me and has one of those
new phantom fours I've had a phantom too
since about when they came out and it's
been pretty fun to fly I'm not as good
as I wish I was
I don't know everything there is to know
I mean matter of fact last time I flew a
drone this happened
so I might not be the best flier of
drones but this guy Jared he's pretty
good I've flown once or twice he's going
to teach us today how to deliver
something special what are we doing so I
have a little gift for my wife and we're
going to use some of the drones special
features to deliver it directly to our
house all right let's get started let's
do it so we've got the DJI phantom4 the
remote and then the little kids in the
bag here the Phantom has a pretty unique
system called waypoints where you can
actually control a set pattern they call
it a mission where you tell where to go
how high how fast and we're going to set
up those different way points to direct
the drone where to go and drop off the
gift and you do it all through the
remote control on the iPad it's really
easy you just hit a couple buttons as
you fly the drone it's probably one of
my favorite features on here so right
now we have the Phantom 4 turned on and
what's going on here how do we set up
those waypoints so this is like the main
screen that you see at the beginning
when you're about to take off and
obviously we're not taking off yet but
if you'd that button right there that'll
take you into different the different
fly modes that you can go through we're
going to go to intelligent and then
waypoints now obviously we're not in the
air just yet so but that's the path that
you would take and we're going to take
off right now so we can show you a
little further just as simple as slide
to takeoff
there we go
now again to get back into the waypoints
we're going to hit the different fly
modes intelligent waypoints we have a
they call them missions and so we're
going to tap new mission and it's going
to give us a few different options here
we can see how many waypoints we have
the total distance of the mission delete
the Waypoint and record the Waypoint
now you see C 2 and C 1 those are
actually going to be the buttons on the
back here C 1 and C 2 so it's really
easy to fly and record at the same time
so I'm going to hit my first button here
I just recorded that one Waypoint there
I'm going to fly forward at least 25
feet and I'm going to hit record again
and I can fly wherever I want now as
long as I fly 25 feet away from the
previous one and I'm 9 feet high in the
air it'll be able to record the Waypoint
so Jared is there limit on how far away
you can set these waypoints so I believe
the max path length is 5,000 meters so
that's I think that's as long as your
mission can go and the biggest radius is
500 meters there and that gives you your
limits and then again you have to be 25
feet from the last point and at least
three meters high above the ground so
once you are done with your mission set
up there's a few different options you
have here you can have a head two
consistent with recording consistent
with a route or free consistent with
recording means that the drone will fly
in the same way that you had flown it
whether it's turned or anything else
when you created the Waypoint consistent
with the route means it's going to point
to the direction of the next Waypoint
and free means you can like yaw the
drone throughout the waypoints when
you're done with the mission you can
have two options you can have hover
where it ends or you can have it return
to the starting point of the very
beginning when you flew off the home
point and you can also adjust your speed
from very low all the way up to five
meters per second
once you're all ready to go hit apply
and then you're good to go so right now
it's uploading those waypoints that we
just set to the drone is it actually
starting the mission right it's starting
it's going to the very first point and
once it gets there it's going to start
its mission cool so now it's starting so
when you set the Waypoint it's setting
how high the drone is and the location
like where it's facing and stuff exactly
yeah now if I was a pitched or yacht a
different way I have it set to
consistent with the recording so it's
doing the exact same thing that I did on
the on the drone if it was a different
point it would point to it as it's
flying too so there's different settings
that you can have to make get different
looks as you're flying the drone okay
we're gonna make it go a little faster
alright geração now that we've learned
what waypoints are how to set them up I
think it's time that we actually set up
this mission for the delivery I think we
should - I think my wife is ready to
receive this gift and I'm ready to give
it to work okay let's do it so right now
what we're hoping to accomplish is Jared
wants to deliver this gift to his wife
without actually having to fly the drone
to her so we're going to use the
automated system to take the gift fly it
up into the air all while no one's
controlling the drone and then drop it
off on his front doorstep where his wife
will be waiting for it let's see what
happens
so we're finding the actual route right
now that the drone is going to fly
autonomously by itself so we started way
down there at the end of the street
we're going to fly the drone around this
roundabout and then up the street over
there all the way to his front step and
the drone will follow each Waypoint as
we set it so this is probably the
trickiest part of the whole thing we're
right by the townhomes that we live and
we're trying to navigate through all of
the trees and brushes and everything
make it look cool while staying safe so
we're down the driveway but we've got to
go that way it looks like we have 20
waypoints set up already yes and we're
at a distance of 242 meters so we've got
plenty of room to go you should've went
up to like 5,000 or so the 5,000 lengths
yeah so the biggest thing is getting
around that corner with the waypoints so
I'm going to go down here a little
further now you can see here this
Waypoint is too close to the one I
previously just did within 5 meters so
I've got to go this way a little bit so
it gives you a little warning Waypoint
altitude is below 32 feet maintain a
steady speed and fly with cautions
basically saying don't be an idiot
so Jerry's lining up those final
waypoints making sure that the cameras
positioned right towards the front door
that way when he delivers the package
the camera will be focused on his wife
and positioning it so the package will
be ready for her to grab all right
Jarrod think it's gonna make it I'm
hoping it does we've set it up to do so
so I think with our powers combined we
can make it work alright so we've
learned how to set waypoints yep we've
actually set the waypoints for this
specific mission check what are the
chances of this actually succeeding you
know I want to say that we've got at
least an 85 percent chance of this going
through exactly how I wanted to I don't
doubt the drones going to go through and
pick the right way and everything I
think the drones going to make it just
fine where I have a little hesitation is
in the actual package if that's going to
hit like a tree or something I don't
know
but I'm so excited to see I'm very
anxious and it's I think it's gonna do
well but there's a small chance of
something terrible happening hopefully
don't had any kids or tree that's right
exactly all right so if you want to
watch the actual drone delivery for the
very first time that we've ever
attempted this go ahead and click this
link in the center also put a card in
the top corner and in the video
description if you're on mobile you can
go find it they're looking forward to it
it's gonna be awesome
thanks stump for watching hope see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
