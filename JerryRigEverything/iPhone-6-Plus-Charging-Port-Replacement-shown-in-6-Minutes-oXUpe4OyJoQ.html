the charging port in your iPhone 6 Plus.
If you want to check out any of the other
repair videos click on the links on the front
of this video.
Here’s the iPhone 6 Plus.
To get to the charging port we have to go
through the screen.
So we’re going to remove the two screws
at the bottom called pentalobe screws.
If you need any tools or replacement parts,
check in the video description below, I will
link everything for you there.
Take your suction cup and put it on the screen
and lift up a little bit.
Then you can take your pry tool and lift up
on the frame of the glass and pry against
the frame of the phone and that will lift
the screen off.
Be super careful because the screens are very
fragile and you don’t want to bend it or
it will crack.
Don’t bend the screen past 90 degrees because
these ribbon cables will get stressed.
Take out the 5 screws.
Remove the metal plate.
And then pop up each of these little ribbon
cables.
There are four of them and you can kind of
treat them like Legos; they just unsnap from
the motherboard.
Once you’ve unsnapped all four the screen
will come loose.
You can see all the components there: the
earpiece…the home button.
Set that aside somewhere safe.
Then there are three screws next to the battery.
Undo all three of those and pop off the little
metal bracket.
Then unclip the battery from the motherboard.
Then there’s a ribbon cable right here that’s
hiding another screw, so lift that up and
then unscrew that screw.
Set it aside.
And make sure you stay organized with these
screws; that’s super important.
Unsnap the wire cable and then the vibrator
motor will slip out from underneath that ribbon
cable.
Pull the wire cable from the vibrator motor.
Then you can see here that the two contact
points are where it goes on the ribbon cable
for the charging port.
Anyway, pull out the wire cable.
Two more screws down at the bottom of the
loud speaker.
Undo those; set them aside.
Keep them organized.
And then the loud speaker will come out from
the phone as well.
So this is what plays your music and your
ring tone and stuff like that.
You can clean it out if there are ever any
metal shavings stuck inside it because there’s
a big magnet.
There are two contact points that connect
to the ribbon cable down at the bottom.
Then there’s a little square metal bracket.
Put that somewhere safe.
Two screws holding the shield down for the
charging port; undo that.
Set that aside next to the two screws that
you just took out.
Then there are five more screws.
The blue one is for the microphone, the little
bracket that holds that in place.
This little guy.
Set that next to the screw you took out.
Two screws down for the headphone jack and
two screws on the other side of the phone
as well.
Keep those organized and then lift off the
wire cable as well.
You’ll need to move that to your new charging
port.
Then you can kind of use a plastic tool and
scrape underneath the ribbon cable for the
charging port and lift that out of the phone.
You want to be pretty careful with it just
in case your new charging port doesn’t work
you can put your old one in for the time being.
Lift that out and be super careful with the
headphone jack and the microphone.
They are kind of embedded in the frame of
the phone.
Once you’ve lifted those out from the frame,
you get the charging port itself.
Now there might be a little rubber boot on
the end of the microphone that you need to
transfer over to your new one.
It just depends on if your new charging port
comes with that or not.
So make sure you’ve transferred over everything
that needs to be transferred over.
Pop the headphone jack back into the frame
of the phone.
Same with the microphone; just kind of press
it in there.
Make sure the hole lines up with the hole
in the frame.
Then you can take the microphone bracket;
slip that back into place.
If you need to pause it here you can.
Make sure all these screws go back into the
same holes they came out of.
The wire cable goes down on the little connection.
Just line it over the top and press it in.
Get that shield back on there with the two
screws.
Once that’s done you can get the loud speaker….I’ve
already put the little square metal bit, attached
it to it, and then the wire cable goes underneath
in that little groove.
Once you’ve positioned all that you can
screw in the little screw at the corner of
the battery and then the other screw down
at the other corner of the phone on the loud
speaker.
Clip the wire cable into the vibrator motor.
Get that hidden screw back in place.
Clip down the ribbon cable.
Clip down the wire cable; press it right down
on top of the connection.
And then you can clip down the battery.
Pretty straight forward.
Get the top clip on there and then get the
other two screws and also the screw down at
the bottom of the vibrator motor.
A lot of steps to remember.
Here’s the screen, and then there are four
little connections that go right back onto
the motherboard.
Remember we’re treating them like Legos;
so line them up right over the connection
and then press them down into place.
Pretty straight forward.
If you end up with lines in your screen that
means one of these connections wasn’t pressed
down correctly.
So turn off your phone again, pop off the
screen, and make sure they are all pressed
down correctly.
You want to make sure you do it right.
I actually…once I get the all pressed down,
I turn on the phone before I actually close
my screen down so I don’t have to risk breaking
the screen as I pull it off again.
So you can see the screen is still up.
Everything is working fine; no lines.
Turn the phone off because you definitely
don’t want to be working on it while the
phone is on.
That was just to test the screen.
Anyway get the little metal bracket back on
there with those five screws.
Then you want to line the top of the screen
up with the frame on the phone; just kind
of press it in so it’s flush.
And then once that’s in you can line the
rest of the phone up with the screen and just
kind of clip it down.
Remember to be super gentle with it because
you don’t want to break your screen.
The more gentle you are the better.
Just be super careful.
I will link all of the replacement parts and
tools in the video description below.
Get those two bottom screws in there after
you turn the phone back on.
And you’re set.
If you have any questions make sure to leave
them in the comments.

It does mean a lot to me.
