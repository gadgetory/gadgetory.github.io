makes too many phones exemplified by the
fact that this is called the Nokia 6.1
they can't even use whole numbers
anymore because they used up all of
their first 10 numbers last year no joke
either way the Nokia is 6 1 my most
durable phone of 2017 so hopefully with
this 6.1 it can hold its own in 2018
let's get started at first glance the
Nokia 6 and 6.1 are pretty similar last
year six the one at the map of Finland
on the back is slightly taller but the
6.1 has a longer camera lens housing
which really accomplishes nothing beyond
the aesthetics and distinguishing
between the two both still have the same
size 5.5 inch screen speaking of which
it's time for the scratch test I have a
series of numbers laid out on the phone
which correspond to the different levels
of Mohs hardness since Nakia is running
the very common and familiar Gorilla
Glass this version is 3 we already know
that we should start seeing marks at a
level 6 and deeper grooves at a level 7
different parts of the phone are
outsourced from different manufacturers
and Corning Gorilla Glass is probably
the top of the line when it comes to
cell phone glass no matter which version
it is this is the black and copper
version of the Nokia 6 it also comes in
a white iron configuration but the
important thing is that it's mostly
metal the volume button and power button
are also made from metal on the top of
the phone
next to our favorite buddy jack is also
metal I asked on Twitter the other day
how often people still use their
headphone jacks and out of 14,000 people
unimpressive 75% of the responded that
you use a headphone jack at least every
week the sim and SD card tray is also
metal and down at the bottom of the
phone we have a microphone pole and a
USB seat charging port which is a step
above the micro USB port from the Nokia
6 last year the 8 megapixel front facing
camera is protected by that same Gorilla
Glass 3 and the recessed earpiece grille
is still made from that same wire mesh
stuff as previous Nokia models it is
secure though and won't be falling out
on its own the bottom of the screen also
has no physical home button this time
around the main camera lens on the back
with its elongated camera lens is made
from glass and does keep the singular 16
megapixel camera protected from
scratches the flash for some reason
isn't under the glass it's exposed but
that might be to keep the flash from
refracting through the glass into the
sensor when it's being used so it's not
a big issue the fingerprint scanner is
located on the back panel below the
camera lens slightly recessed I'll give
that a little scratch a roo to simulate
a few years worth of abuse but in normal
Nokia fashion it still works just fine
it's not invincible
like we saw me one plus 6 but this phone
is still way cheaper so we'll let it
slide for the back panel if you remember
Nokia's from Finland and a little known
fact is that the Finnish national
cross-country ski team which as far as I
know is the only hobby over there
they were the first people to ever use a
portable heartrate monitor which was
also invented in Finland in 1977 and now
we use it all the time and watches and
cellphones all over the place so thanks
Finland one thing I am worried about is
that the glass screen of the phone has
no plastic layer buffering it against
the metal too brittle objects against
each other isn't a good thing especially
during drops or bins we'll find out soon
enough
the burn test is next the six point one
has a 5.5 inch 1080p screen and the 16
by 9 LCD lasted about 10 seconds under
the flame from my lighter which is
perfect timing because that's about how
long it took me to say that sentence the
pixels did start working again though
which is nice of them and now the bin
test going from the strongest phone of
2017 last year to another zero flex
device this year Nokia is over there
producing some of the strongest phones
known to man and this six point one is
no exception for the price this build
quality is pretty incredible it's a
shame that the phones aren't more
available here in the United States the
lack of a plastic buffer between the
glass and the metal frame is a non-issue
since there's also no flex but it might
become an issue if you're the type of
person who drops your phone regularly
the first thing to give out or break
won't be the middle it'll be the glass
since there's no cushion so a case in a
screen protector are still always good
ideas it gets a thumbs up for me coming
out on Twitter if you want to take part
in the next poll question and thanks the
time for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
