has been one of my most requested
durability tests of all time
flagship specs with a super cheap budget
phone price run around $300 the thing
I'm most interested in is the internal
liquid cooling system and the four
thousand milliamp hour battery which
would rank it right up against the $1000
galaxy note 9 that has the same specs
this video though is about durability
let's get started right out of the box
this phone feels heavy and solid which
is a good thing
weight is usually subconsciously
associated with quality like always with
my systemic durability test we'll start
with the screen with a $300 budget phone
like this one it would not be crazy to
see a cheaper plastic screen covering
the display but as we can tell from this
Mohs scale of hardness the screen resist
scratching until level 6 with deeper
grooves at a level 7 it's covered in
Gorilla Glass and you won't have to
worry about keys or coins or razor
blades scratching the large 6.2 inch
display xiaomi has included a 20
megapixel HDR front-facing camera up in
the notch of this phone right next to
the face unlock both are tucked up under
that glass layer and protected against
scratching the center earpiece is made
from metal which is definitely more
durable than the cloth earpieces we've
seen in some of the ultra pixels so far
this budget phone is shaping up to have
a nice solid build delving deeper into
the physical attributes with my
calibrated surgical instruments we
scientifically discover various coatings
a shiny silver layer of paint lies
directly underneath that graphite black
layer and giving the impression of metal
but the sound is different our razor
blade of truth reveals that the sides of
the phone are made entirely from plastic
which quite honestly is not a big deal
whatsoever as long as the plastic does
not compromise the structural integrity
we'll find out in a second the buttons
are made from metal and do not pop out
of the phone body like we've found on
some of the Samsung phones down at the
bottom of the f1 with our modern USB C
port we discover more plastic it's been
a long time since we've had a fully
plastic phone on my desk but you can see
all these
doulas large chunks of plastic falling
away under my razor blade and my razor
blade i mean my scientifically
calibrated phone testing apparatus it
does have a headphone jack though that's
pretty cool the sim an SD card tray is
made from plastic when i pulled out from
the phone we can see zero water
resistance around the opening no rubber
rings to be found I'll check out the
other internal orifices for ingress
protection during the teardown but it's
pretty safe to say that this phone is
not safe around liquid whatsoever
moseying our way round to the back of
the phone we find dual cameras but once
again xiaomi is not using any white
angle or telephoto lenses like we see on
the iPhones or with Samsung this means
that the second camera is still more of
a glorified decoration than anything
else both cameras are protected by glass
which is good but if an extra camera is
going to take up precious space inside
my phone it might as well give me an
additional perspective or zoom right let
me know what you think the fingerprint
scanner is unscratched and invincible
which is good thumbs up for that
impressiveness the flash off the decide
is made from plastic but that's totally
normal and will still do its job no
matter how scratched up it gets you'll
notice that the back of the phone has a
much quieter sound than normal again
back here we have more polycarbonate
which is plastic there is a version of
the Popo phone f1 made with a Kevlar
backing but it's a bit more expensive
and I wanted to test the version that
the majority of people will end up
buying the plastic back against my razor
is almost silent but I felt it was only
fair to draw a poke on the back of the
poco phone you might remember this
little design from a social media app
that old people use called Facebook the
poco phone branding down at the bottom
does have a shine it gleamed to it but
the lettering is permanent and won't be
falling out individually one thing to
remember that with plastic it has a
lower scratch resistance than glass
falling a level-3 unknow scale so keys
and coins will be able to damage the
phone if they're all in the same pocket
but on the plus side the plastic backing
won't shatter in a drop either way there
is a free case in the box and I
recommend using it protection is a good
thing the Polka phon f1 has a 6.2 inch
1080p IPS display and lasted about 10
seconds before the pixels
turned off and went black I've been
burning phones for about three years now
and still haven't found a valid reason
for this test but you got to admit the
recovery is pretty satisfying the bin
test though is much more important
especially since phones these days are
powerful enough to be relevant for years
and the physical integrity of that phone
is pretty crucial to the lifespan the
Polka phone f1 has the same thickness of
the Galaxy Note 9 but like we found out
is made from plastic the initial Bend
showed a heart-fluttering flex in the
top half of the device but locks out and
does not have any permanent deformities
like we saw with the metal xiaomi note 5
pro nor does it catastrophic elyse nap
in half like the Xiaomi 5 even though
it's plastic this poco phone f1 might be
one of the most structurally sound
phones xiaomi has ever made even when
bent from both directions there's no
permanent damage anywhere the f1 passes
my durability test and gets a thumbs up
for me go ahead and poke that subscribe
button if you haven't already I'll be
tearing down this phone in the next
video to see if that industry-leading
liquid cooling system is real or not
thanks ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
