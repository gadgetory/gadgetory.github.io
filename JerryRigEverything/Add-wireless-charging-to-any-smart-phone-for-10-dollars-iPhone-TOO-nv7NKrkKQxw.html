receivers on Amazon you can add them to
any phone to make it wireless charging
capable obviously it's much easier to
add these modules to a phone with
removable back like the note 4 or LG g4
but you can add them to a glued shut
glass packed phone like the oneplus X
which is what I'm going to do today this
particular module is for a smart phone
with the curve of the microUSB charging
port facing down away from the screen
but I will link another in the video
description for phones like the note 5
that have the curve of the microUSB
facing up toward the screen so check the
orientation of your port before buying
they do make these for iPhones so I will
link those in the video description as
well way inexpensive I've already opened
this one plus X before so pulling off
the glass back is easier than normal if
you have a different phone just search
YouTube with the name of your phone and
add jerry-rigged everything in the
search box now we'll probably have a
video showing the process on your device
I have hundreds of cell phone repair
videos on YouTube now if you make it
super tight it'll make the phone more
portable while the module is under the
back cover which is great if you have an
easily removable back like the note 4 or
galaxy s5 but if it is a glass back like
my oneplus X
making it super tight will make the
charging port unremovable on short
notice without special tools so keep
that in mind if you leave a little bit
of a loop next to the charging port
you'll be able to unplug the port to use
your normal charging cable if you need
to but it'll leave the ribbon more
susceptible to damage if there is any
slack next to the port when it is tight
against the phone body I personally
wouldn't be worried about it breaking or
damaging the charging port while it is
in your pocket or purse naturally
wireless charging is a bit slower than
regular corded charging so what you make
up for inconvenience you lose an actual
charging speed hit that thumbs up button
for awesome technology and subscribe for
my future videos thanks for watching
hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
