that front shock on a Jeep Grand
Cherokee as you can see this one is a
pretty rusted out so right here at the
bottom there's two 13 millimeter bolts
as far as the top goes if you look
inside here underneath these things you
can see really into that bolt is that's
the top of the shock so you're going to
focus on that so that's the top of the
shock and so you have to unscrew that
you look at the passenger side you get a
better clip with it so something that
looks like that anyway the top nut on
that one is a 9/16 and then basically
what I do is I grab onto it with the
wrench and then you need to start
turning it this part right here this
guard for the shock will start turning
as well so usually grab onto that with a
pair of channel locks to keep it from
spinning and I just rotate the top and
the and the shield independently of each
other to get them taken off so mushrik I
have the wrench kind of kinked right
there between the engine and then the
other end if I can't see their Wells
down there on the nut and so the wrench
isn't going anywhere but now that I've
broken it loose with a pair of
channellocks
just grabbing onto that and twisting it
I can twist the whole thing with my hand
and so that since the wrench of top is
staying still this is just unscrewing
the nut from the top of it it's a lot
easier than trying to maneuver that
wrench inside of all that it's not a
whole lot of space to maneuver up there
and now that the nuts off the top I can
just take this out by hand and just kind
of compress it a little bit then move it
around so the reason I take off the top
first is because right there didn't give
me enough room to put my mother socket
for my wrench on there but now that the
tops out I could move it left and right
and give me enough room to fit each side
in so that's how I do it
I'm just mashach in right now on the
other side these bolts when I was taking
off the shock just twist it completely
enough so I went ahead and bought some
more bolts was on like five boxes that
would be safe and sorry so even though
these bolts came out in one piece a I'm
putting the other bolts in this size was
the m8 1.25 by 30 millimeters and that's
got the washers and nuts to go with it
so I might tighten those in once again
leaving this now disconnected so I can
tip it left and right right so I can
have room to get the wrench in there
okay so it doesn't matter you know which
side of the shot goes out I usually just
put the one with the letters and stuff
out so whoever needs to come in and
order another shock whatever it can read
which kind it is and then also remember
that the guard right here is always on
the top just like when water and stuff
comes down it runs off of the shock
instead of being stored down inside the
protector so right before you put it up
inside the mount on the top end make
sure you put your whole bushing zone and
just kind of pull it down and then let
it go up into the top there and it does
come with the new nut so it doesn't
matter what you do with the old ones
here we got the passenger side you can
see that I had to replace those two
bolts down there at the bottom because
they broke apart I was trying to take
off the shock there's the top part of it
you it's all attached up in there and
down there have the washer and then not
and the other black rubber thing that
holds it all in place so that's how you
do the shocks on a Jeep Grand Cherokee
you have any questions be sure to leave
in the comments I do end up putting
videos up on that YouTube that every
week or so now a lot to do with Jeeps
cell phones technology have fixed random
stuff anyway so if you like them go
ahead and subscribe and yeah thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
