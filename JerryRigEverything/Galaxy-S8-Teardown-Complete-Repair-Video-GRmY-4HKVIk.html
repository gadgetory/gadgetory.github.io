displayed flagship from Samsung but what
happens when that display breaks there's
being already past my durability test
with flying colors now it's time to see
what this thing is made of and what it
looks like on the inside let's get
started
there are no visible screws along the
outside which is pretty normal for
Samsung these days it does make the
phone slightly harder to repair but not
impossible the process I am
demonstrating is going to be pretty much
the exact same for both the galaxy as 8
and the s8 plus but the replacement
parts are going to be different I'll
have those linked separately in the
description I warmed up the back of the
phone with my heat gun or a hairdryer
until it's just barely too hot to touch
then I can stick a thin metal pry tool
between the metal frame and the glass of
the phone lift it up just high enough to
strip a playing card or business card
inside and that will help you get around
that curve without breaking anything
if you need replacement backs or if you
break yours during a repair they are
pretty inexpensive so don't stress out
too much after slicing through both
sides I'll split my green pry tool in
and hold the glass up and to keep it
from resealing itself down to the foam
body the rest of the adhesive will be
easy to cut away after that remember
it's important not to go too deep inside
of the phone because there is important
stuff under there that can be punctured
like the wireless charging or the
battery so stick around the edges once
the back glass is free we can see the
fingerprint scanner up along the top
it's still attached to the rear panel
the first interesting thing that we find
is all the warnings on the battery
you got normal stuff like don't burn
don't puncture avoid extreme
temperatures and then you get this no
dogs allowed sign like I'm not a dog
person myself but I don't advocate pet
discrimination either our cats and
goldfish ok I don't really understand
the rules anymore and Samsung just kind
of made it weird there are 14 screws
holding down the first layer of guts the
circle thing is the wireless charging we
cut open one of these on the what's
inside YouTube channel the copper wires
coil up to receive power through
inductance and then pass that power
through the battery into these pins on
the motherboard
pretty sweet technology Apple will
probably invent this technology in the
future for one of their next iPhones so
that's something for iPhone users to
look forward to the better disconnects
from the motherboard is enough but there
are no magical pull tabs underneath like
we've seen on some other phones so it's
time to use brute force I'll use the
rounded end of my metal pry tool taking
extreme care not to slice or puncture
the battery
I also took special care not to use a
dog at any point during this procedure
since that's one of Samsung's battery
requirements the battery does look
pretty cool it's got a 3000 milliamp
capacity and it even has a see-through
area up at the top
for the protection circuit that I talked
about during my note 7 video the clear
plastic on the battery makes me want a
clear phone even more it's also cool
that the inside of the phone is the same
color as the outside just like what we
saw with the red iPhone that I took
apart a few weeks ago the loudspeaker is
the next piece to come out it's got a
little water damage indicator on the
bottom remember these phones are
water-resistant and not waterproof still
has those golden contact points where it
receives its power and signal from the
phone before we can remove the charging
port we have to take out the mainboard
I'll start disconnecting the wire cables
at the bottom there are three of those
then the screen ribbon unsnaps like a
little Lego from the side of the
motherboard after that I'll move up to
the front sensor array ribbon cable and
the front-facing camera ribbon connector
and then you know there's the SIM card
tray that I should have removed before
we started at the base of the
motherboard there's a Lego connector for
the charging port but it's on the
underside of the board making things a
little more complicated than it should
be I'll give you a better view of that
in just a second now that the
motherboard is out we have the classic
Samsung heat pipe this helps keep the
processor cool
since copper is a better conductor of
heat than aluminum is the thermal
transfer away from the processor is more
efficient with copper now the rear 12
megapixel camera has its own Lego type
connection on the motherboard I'll snap
that off and push the camera through the
board this is definitely replaceable
just for kicks and giggles I'll pull out
the front-facing camera as well this
little guys attached to the iris scanner
if you look at the rear camera you can
see it move around inside of the frame
this is called the OIS or optical image
stabilization I'll show you more of how
this works in just a second on the front
camera unit the iris scanner is solid
and normally the front-facing camera is
solid as well but this one has movement
Samsung didn't advertise having
stabilization on this front camera but
it looks like they might have been
playing around with the idea of adding
it Ã´s takes image quality to the next
level so it would be pretty awesome if
they did I took that front-facing camera
back into the frame and then clip the
rear camera back into place as well
let's take a look at that earpiece
speaker remember during my durability
test I complained that the grille size
was way smaller on the new s8 then it
was on the older s7 turns out that the
internal speakers are pretty much the
same size if anything the s8 might even
be a little bit larger of a speaker so
no worries there since the speaker does
set a little lower than the actual
earpiece lot this Chan
direct the sound out of the hole in the
front the sensor read the front is all
connected with this ribbon cable and the
volume and bixby buttons are connected
with these golden contact pads the round
vibrator has its own two contact pads
and the power button is built the same
way two little contact pads resting up
against the motherboard now for the
bottom of the phone the headphone jack
is very easily replaceable just one
little screw to hold it in place and it
has the same little Lego style ribbon
connector connecting it to the charging
port board you can see the rubber seal
along the lip of the headphone jack to
help keep water out there are five more
screws holding the charging port board
to the frame and here is the charging
port itself incredibly nice we don't
have that front capacitive button reach
around that we saw in the galaxy s6 that
was a nightmare the charging port is
pretty standard it's got the USB C port
and the little microphone off to the
side this stone is actually pretty easy
to work on once you get inside that
glued shut back glass from the exterior
you can see that there is metal all
around the edge of the phone but now
that we have the guts taken out and the
internals of the s8 exposed we can see
that is the same hunk of metal
throughout the entire device which fully
explains the rigidity of the phone
metal is pretty solid there's a little
slot in the frame for the screen ribbon
to poke through speaking of the screen
replacing a crack display is not cheap
or easy with the Samsung for one its
glued into place and to the curved
AMOLED panels are pretty expensive
I'll have the current pricing linked in
the video description for you since the
screen is glued in the old display is
essentially sacrificed in the removal
process once it is heated up and removed
similar to how we did with the back
panel just feed the new screen ribbon
through the metal frame of the phone and
plop it down into place I did this with
the galaxy s7 tear down if you're
interested in seeing the exact process
since the screen is not broken though
I'll leave it intact and I'll talk about
a few ways to protect your phone towards
the end of the video assembling the
phone is a piece of cake charging board
gets tucked back into place along with
the headphone jack this is a pretty
great use of space Samsung there are six
screws holding down all the components
then get those round wires tucked into
the grooves along the metal frame now
the charging port is connected at the
base of the motherboard which is normal
for Samsung but strange to the rest of
us I'll plug that in before setting the
motherboard into place making sure there
are no ribbons or connections
underneath the board as it goes down
equip in the front sensor array and then
the iris scanner and front facing camera
there are those three signal wires down
at the bottom of the motherboard the
circular heads are pretty fragile so
make sure you are gentle as you press
them into place and finally the screen
ribbon snaps into place like a little
Lego the loudspeaker is next it's
easiest to snap the plastic into the
metal frame from the bottom edge first
and the last thing we plug in is the
battery this is for the phone's own
protection normally you want to put new
adhesive under the battery as well and
you should definitely not turn your
phone on at this point but I kind of
want to show you something cool so I'm
going to do it anyway remember the
camera stabilization I talked about
earlier here it is in action the camera
is turned on right now and the phone
hardware is physically stabilizing the
camera image to compensate for the
shakiness or the movement of my hands
huge thumbs up for that it's seriously
one of the best features you can have in
a smart phone and not every phone comes
with this kind of hardware stabilizing
my name is pretty sweet I check the
front camera but it doesn't look like
there is any kind of movement or
stabilizing in the lens so while Samsung
might have considered adding OIS on that
front camera it's definitely not enabled
at the moment now the phone is turned
off again I will set the wireless
charging into place and get all 14
screws screwed in and finally I can clip
in the fingerprint scanner rivet this is
a tedious process that reminds me a lot
of the iPhone 5s I maybe could have
popped the fingerprint scanner out of
the back glass and set it into place on
the inside but I wanted to keep that
seal with the back glass as tight as
possible and my green tool worked just
fine the best kind of repair is the one
you don't have to do the best way to
keep your phone from breaking in the
future is to protect it with either a
case or a skin a naked phone is just
asking for trouble
a skin like the one you see here from D
brand goes a long way for adding grip
keeping that phone scratch free and
adding a raised surface around the
camera lens for little extra protection
I'll toss a link in the description for
you and thanks to D brand for supporting
this video hopefully it'll save people
money when they break their phones in
the future if you want to check out a
few other projects I'm working on
Instagram and Twitter have all my behind
the scenes and let me know if you were
successful in repairing your own phone
thanks ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
