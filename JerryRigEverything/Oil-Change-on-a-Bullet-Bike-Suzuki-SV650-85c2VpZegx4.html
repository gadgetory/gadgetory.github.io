bullet bike this particular one is
Suzuki sv650 changed the oil pretty
simple process I'm underneath the bike
here this is just the end and you can
see we have the oil filter and then
usually at the lowest point of the bike
where it's tipped over like well when
it's leaning on the kickstand there's
gonna be a screw and this one is a 14
millimeter and this is what has all the
oil in it know what drains the oil I'm
just gonna twist this off I already
broke it loose with the with a wrench
I want to make sure not to drop this in
the oil pan and do this when the
motorcycles cult as well otherwise I'm
folios freaking on there we go
this whole process takes you anywhere
from you know four to five minutes to
get all the oil to drain out so what
does let us do this thing for a second
okay so I'd slowed down we're gonna take
off the filter I've already broken this
loose as well I'm you can use channel
locks or you know there are special
wrenches that take off these oil filters
this one I managed to break these by
hand and there's gonna be royalty count
of this as well so keep it over your
boom screw on
I'm just wanting it drained for a while
alright so before you tear oil filter
and put it in and just get a little dab
of oil on your finger and go around the
top of it and this just kind of helps
seal it when it's back on the on the
bike again it's kind of hard to do it on
hand go and this part numbers the pH 60
18 from friend just take the oil filter
screw it back seems cute flavor when
your hand tighten it or when you tighten
you just want to tighten it by hand
don't use any tools or anything like
that but make sure you get it as tight
as you possibly can because if you use
any tools you can crush it and it makes
it a lot harder to get off in the future
as well so this isn't something that
needs to be you know
Hercules tight
you stick your drain plug and put that
up in there this one you do want to
tighten down with a wrench
you know don't over tighten it but make
sure it also is not going to come off
just putting the oil in this is the oil
I'm using just like a ten-week 40
motorcycle oil oil goes in this little
cap right here and then for the view
where you can see how fold is the bike
does have to be level for that so I'm
going to dip the bike up right now and
you can see in there that the oil is
right there between those two lines of
fuel in the low so you know that's a
change oil so I'm going to turn the bike
on really quick and let it run for a
couple minutes and then let the oil coat
the inside of the engine and then check
the oil level again just to make sure I
need to top it off anyway that's a
change the oil and a bowl like so if you
have any questions leave them in the
