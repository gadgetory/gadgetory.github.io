brake pads on a 98 Toyota Tacoma it's
actually a super simple process these
are what the brake pads look like I'm
going to link these in the video
description below so you have a quick
and easy place to buy them from Amazon
has them for pretty cheap so go ahead
and check that out and then what I've
done up to this point is I have loosened
up all of the lug nuts on the tire
before I lifted it off the ground then I
went ahead and put the jack on the
knuckle underneath the tire and that
lifted the tire up and off off the
ground and then I put a secondary jack
right there just in case you know
anything happens when the tire is off
the vehicle that's just more of like a
precautionary thing now that the tire is
lifted up and I have the lug nuts loose
I'm going to go ahead and loosen up the
rest of lug nuts and then pop the tire
off and then I'll show you the caliper
where the brake pads are located this is
called the caliper right here this is
what holds the brake pads you can kind
of see down inside of them right here
how worn down they are this guy's called
the rotor and with the rotor you can
kind of see this is where the brake pads
press against it to stop your car and
right now there's kind of a little lip
up at the top and that just kind of goes
to show like what's being worn away when
the brake flat brake pads clamp down on
the rotor itself so for me it's about
time to replace my rotors as well on the
caliper itself if you look around on the
back side you're going to see two 17
millimeter bolts this one and then the
one a little bit farther down and those
need to come out in order for the
caliper to slide away from the vehicle
so I've pulled the caliper up and off
the rotor itself and I've also supported
it with a little bungee cable so that it
doesn't put any pressure on this brake
line right here because if those brake
you're in it for a much more expensive
repair so here's how to release the
brake pads there's this little wire
thing right here you just press down and
then pull out and then you'll be able to
pull the wire out of each of these
little pins and then these pins come out
like this and that releases the brake
pad so they can slide out through the
other side also this little metal thing
can just be pushed down and then
lift it up and out it also helps if you
take like a nail or something or a screw
and stick it through that little hole
and then you can hit the end of this and
that will also push the little pins out
I found if that helped out a lot as well
anyway so now these two brake pads will
fall through the other side so one thing
we have to do right now as you can see
with the old brake pads they're a lot
closer together because they've been
worn down so much new brake pads take up
a lot more room so we have to do here on
the caliper itself we have to push back
these Pistons a little bit to make room
for the extra thickness of the new brake
pads so that it'll still fit over the
rotor when we go to put it back on so
inside the engine bay there's this brake
fluid box right here so I'm going to go
ahead and unscrew the cap of this and
pop it off so that brake fluid will be
able to rise up as I compress that
piston down I'm just going to leave it
on the top so no debris or dust falls
inside of there so since we don't need
the old brake pads anyway I went ahead
and toss one of the old ones back in
there and then use a giant C clamp to
clamp down on the brake pad itself which
in turn is compressing these little
pistons right here to make room so with
each turn of this I compress that piston
down just a little bit more then with
the new brake pads remember that the
holes on the top go inside the caliper
so that those little metal rods can
slide through them again go ahead and
clip that up
pocket in place now everything's in
place the two pins metal plate the
little latch thing I did have to rotate
these just a little bit to get the holes
to line up for this little bracket
anyway
if you are going to replace your rotors
usually you replace your rotors you know
if this ledge is too big or if it's kind
of jerking when you're slowing down to
be pressing the brakes in your car kind
of chugs good chances are that it's the
front rotors are warped a little bit all
that these are is there is loose and you
can just pop them off of the vehicle
like that and then that's your rotor
itself and then that's the part of your
truck so these are actually relatively
inexpensive I'm going to leave mine on
for now if you need to replace these I
will link then also in the video
description below I've painted these
calipers probably about two years ago so
if you want to see a video on how I did
that go ahead and click right here
and that'll give you a little
walkthrough on the type of paint that I
used and a little process behind that
anyway I'm gonna do right now is just
pop on the tire and cap the brake fluid
again after I finish the other tire when
you replace one set of brake pads you're
going to want to do both the left and
right side of the vehicle if you have
any questions go ahead and link them in
the comments below don't forget that
I've linked the parts that you need in
the video description below and also
before you actually drive anywhere
you're going to want to make sure to
pump the brake pedal a few times and
that'll make sure to clamp the brake
pads closer to the rotors so that you
won't have any delay when you're braking
for the first time so make sure that you
press on the brake pedal enough times
until it feels like normal again it will
feel really loose for a little bit it
probably only took me about 20-25
minutes to do one side of the vehicle so
I would say you know about an hour
process to do both sides
if you have any questions make sure to
leave them in the comments below don't
forget to like if this video helped you
and don't forget to subscribe thanks for
