tests have become a rite of passage of
sorts for every new smartphone that
comes out and this brand new flagship
from Samsung is no different I'll put it
through a few years worth of abuse in
just a few minutes I'll make sure the
phone can survive the test of time and
see if the s8 is a worthwhile investment
for those concerned with durability
let's get started
this orchid gray color is the one lucky
enough to end up on my desk
a new color variation for this round of
smart phones it's nice to see something
different than the standard black gold
and silver that pretty much every
manufacturer has the phone is cold and
solid feeling in my hand so we're off to
a good start the scratch test is always
first my most picks do a pretty good job
of seeing how scratch resistant the
screen is plastic screens like the
galaxy s7 active would scratch at level
3 last year's galaxy s7 edge scratched
at level 6 which is pretty much the
standard for smartphones at the moment a
sapphire screen would get into the
levels eight or nine on the hardness
scale and I'm working on getting my
hands on one of those phones but they're
pretty rare the good news is the Gorilla
Glass 5 on this galaxy s 8 scratched at
a level 6 so your normal keys and coins
won't do any damage to this glass there
is no physical home button on the bottom
of the screen aesthetically it looks
pretty sweet I'm a fan of the larger
screen size taking up the whole front
face looking at the earpiece is where I
run into my first issue definitely a
minor issue but still something to think
about the speaker grille is recessed
slightly below the glass surface which
is a very interesting design choice if
it was protruding like on the galaxy s7
it would help protect the screen a
little by not allowing the glass to rest
directly on a surface if set face down
or maybe through is flush like the LG G
6 at least it would look cool and
uniform with the rest of the screen but
recessed under the glass is just asking
for it to collect all kinds of lint and
dust and other goodies from your pocket
or even makeup off your face recessed
isn't the most ideal design choice the
good news is is that the grille is made
of metal so when it does need to be
cleaned out it's pretty secure and won't
be falling out on its own like we've
seen with some of the other phones I've
tested one more thing is the speaker
size the s7 edge that I've been using
for the past year is already pretty
quiet and the grill on the s8 is less
than half of the size so if they shrink
the internal speaker inside of the SI it
would be a terrible move I'll have to
check that speaker size when I open up
and tear down the phone tomorrow
the sensors like the iris scanner and
the 8 megapixel front-facing camera are
all covered by the same glasses on the
screen so my razor blade is not leaving
any marks since the screen is harder
than my razor blade
now for the back of the phone the back
panel is made of glass and the Samsung
logo is printed on the underside of the
glass so there's no chance of removing
it from this side if we jump up to the
flash and the focus sensors they are
also covered by the same glass rear
panel this is the first time I've ever
seen a glass covered flash on a phone
normally it's plastic I think that
see-through window to the sensor is
pretty awesome if there was a totally
clear version of the essays I would buy
it up in two seconds
my favorite gameboy was the clear one
back in the day and older me hasn't
changed a bit
would you buy a clear phone let me know
in the comments the camera lens is also
covered with glass and luckily my razor
blade leaves no marks on it definitely
scratch resistant the Galaxy s8 has a
subtle ring around the camera that
protrudes ever so slightly
it's almost flush but the ring is
definitely there it's made of metal and
hopefully if you're the type of person
who walks around without a skin or a
case it'll be enough to help protect
that camera lens if you ever set your
phone down now the fingerprint scanner
off to the right of the camera is
definitely in a unique spot it'll take
some getting used to
after heavily sketching this fingerprint
scanner I was able to set my fingerprint
with no major issues it still unlocked
the phone almost every time without
looking though it was pretty hard to
differentiate between the camera lens
and the fingerprint scanner with my
fingertip since they are pretty close
together hopefully muscle memory will
improve with time and I'll get better at
it now it's time for the hypothetical
apocalypse test the Galaxy s8 has a 5.8
inch Super AMOLED display now in the
past when I roast an AMOLED display with
my lighter like with the galaxy s7 it'll
start to go white after about 10 seconds
and never recover
but there's Galaxy s8 lasted 30 seconds
the screen still went white but then
completely recovered I'm happy about the
success but I'm also all about second
chances but even after another 30 second
round of flame the screen had no
markings definitely impressive speaking
of apocalyptic scenarios I talked
audible into giving a free book to every
single one of my subscribers so if
dystopian novels are your thing and you
like free stuff I highly recommend
Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
or another book called 1984 by George
Orwell both of these books reshaped my
entire way of thinking and well
thought-provoking books are the best
kind of books if you use this link
audible.com slash jerry-rigged all
lowercase you get to keep the free book
you download even if you decide not to
use audible after your free 30-day trial
it's a pretty good deal I'll also
include the link right below this video
in the description a burn proof phone
would be incredible but in order to make
sure I tried the flame test one last
time
it was only then on my third burn but I
was able to get a permanent mark on the
screen I would definitely certified this
thing for a mild to moderate apocalypse
but with any extinction-level events
you're going to need a little more
protection now the size of this phone
are made from pure metal everything from
the SIM card tray to the actual borders
of the phone the phone might look a
little beat-up at this point but it's
still less violent than flying United
all of the buttons are made from metal
even fixed e are permanent new best
friend that nobody asked for is also
metal down at the bottom of the phone we
have the USB C port which I prefer at
this point the transition to USB C is
pretty much mandatory on all flagships
this far into the game there's also a
headphone jack down here you can charge
your phone and listen to music at the
same time how ridiculous would it be if
your phone couldn't do something basic
like that another interesting thing
about the galaxy s 8 is that the rear
panel is structural it's embedded inside
the metal frame instead of resting on
top I managed to permanently borrow the
rear back panel off of what's inside
galaxy s 8 that we've cut off in a few
days ago it looks like the graph
coloring can be scraped off from
underneath black even a cloudy computer
surface behind the logo I think it looks
pretty cool that clear galaxy should
definitely be a thing it took several
hard hits with my knife to destroy the
back panel and when it finally did crack
its spiderwebs similar to the LG G 6
where everything was still relatively
intact much safer than the HTC you
we're the large unlimited glass chunks
were falling off all over the place and
now it's time for the ultimate test of
build quality the bin test two years ago
the galaxy s6 was the first phone I ever
did a durability test on and Samsung has
never disappointed since when it comes
to building physically solid devices
there is almost zero flex to this thing
and more importantly no seals are being
broken either so everything is still
water-resistant it's nicely you can
count on your phone even if an
irresponsibly large amount of pressure
is applied to both ends the fleshlight
complained for a few seconds about the
abuse but other than that I'd have to
say that the Galaxy s8 is an incredibly
well-built phone and definitely a
candidate for my daily driver my Twitter
and Instagram followers got a spoiler
free preview of the phone before this
video went live so if you like seeing
tech tested follow me over there and
don't forget your free 30-day trial form
audible for real it's free with audible
you can read or listen directly from
your phone so you'll always have
something productive in your pocket link
is in the description I'll see you guys
tomorrow for the teardown thanks for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
