most useful Xbox controller I've ever seen.
This box has an interesting plastic bit down
here at the bottom with large loops for easy
opening.
In fact, everything about this controller
is designed to be easy to use for people with
limited mobility.
From the massive oversized buttons, to the
19 headphone jacks along the top.
Microsoft has designed this gaming controller
to fit a wide range of gamers who might not
have full range of motion with their hands
or arms.
The oversized buttons are much larger and
easier to press than a standard controller.
And the massive array of headphone jacks up
along the top allow for any combination of
unique exterior button arrangements.
Now I don't know about you, but I want to
see what these 19 headphone jacks look like
from the inside.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
So all these 3.5 millimeter jacks up at the
top allow for a wide variety of additional
switches, like foot controls, joy sticks,
or large buttons, depending on what the game
requires and the mobility level of the person
using the controller.
The back of the hub has the cross industry
standard AMPS mounting holes to screw into
a stand or wheelchair.
It also has a standard tripod mount hole in
the center.
The same one that's used for most cameras.
It's nice of Microsoft to use common non-proprietary
connections like headphone jack inputs and
camera mounts that can be purchased anywhere.
It makes things easy.
We could always just sit around and admire
the outside of the controller of course, but
we also got to review it from the inside.
With no visible screws, I'm going to bet that
Microsoft hid everything underneath these
large rubber grippy pads down at the bottom.
And there they are.
Four screws hold the whole controller together.
These little guys are torques T9H security
bits.
Companies use weird uncommon bits like this
to try to keep people out...which is kind
of exactly why we're getting in.
Pulling off the massive black plastic slab
reveals and itty bitty battery and quite a
bit more plastic.
The mounting holes are still connected with
the main body, and the wires are running from
the backside of the large A and B buttons
and connecting to the motherboard.
The battery has no adhesive holding it in.
That's refreshing.
I'll just unplug that.
The Xbox adaptive controller is using a rechargeable
2,050 milliamp hour battery.
Normal Xbox One controllers use 2 double A
disposable batteries, which isn't quite ideal
for the environment, so I'm glad Microsoft
is switching things up and changing to rechargeable.
It's cheaper for the customers in the long
run too.
I'll unplug the large circle buttons just
for kicks and giggles.
And then there are 4 more of the same screws
that we saw on the outside housing holding
the mid-plate into the front half of the controller.
Remember how there are 19 headphone jacks
along the top side?
Well there is one more headphone jack for
headphones chilling in the side panel â€“ literally.
The little guy just rests on top of the motherboard
for it's signal and brings our grand total
of headphone jacks to 20.
Apple has left the chat.
Pulling out the black mid-plate from the white
front half shows us the motherboard.
Each of the large buttons on the exterior
will respond with a tiny clicky button soldered
onto the motherboard, which then communicates
with the Xbox.
There is a USB port on the side of the controller
that can connect one handed joy sticks or
triggers or additional game pads that might
be needed.
Like a directional foot pad that can be controlled
with your feet.
Then a mother load of headphone jack digital
inputs.
Like if your left hand doesn't have full range
of motion, you can attach larger external
buttons for each arrow on the direction pad
and use those instead.
Huge thumbs up to Microsoft for making gaming
more accessible to everyone.
They definitely deserve it for this one.
The USB-C port is for charging the hub controller
itself.
And the circular DC power port is only needed
if you plan on powering other USB accessories
while they are plugged into the controller.
And we have one more USB port over here on
the left side.
I'm a fan.
One of the coolest parts of this controller
though is how the large buttons work.
Check out how simple and effective this spring
mechanism is for the massive circles.
Each time they are pressed, the plastic spiral,
made from the same chunk of black plastic,
springs it back into position.
Effective with minimal moving parts so it
should last a long time.
The other buttons are just pieces of plastic
placed into their corresponding holes on the
controller.
These rest directly onto the motherboard switches
with no cushion or rubber between the two.
It's interesting to see how different the
Xbox controllers are when compared with something
like the Nintendo Switch.
And it uses a lot more rubber inside.
I'll tuck the menagerie of headphone jacks
back into the front panel, along with the
4 screws holding everything together.
One feature you might not know about Xbox
controllers is something called co-pilot.
With an Xbox, you can set up 2 controllers
to work as one.
Both controllers have full control of the
game at any given time, so it's kind of like
teamwork.
One controller can manipulate game movement,
and the other person can manipulate the weapons
during a shooting game or scoring goals during
a sports game.
It's just another way that Xbox is making
it easy for everyone to join in no matter
what level of mobility they might have.
The headphone jack and battery got plugged
in, along with the massive back black plastic
panel.
If you currently use one of these adaptive
controllers, Tweet me a picture of your setup.
I want to see it.
Tell me your favorite video game down in the
comments.
And thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
