functional clear Nintendo switch all of
the housing on the back and the front
have been changed into a clear plastic
looks pretty sweet there's a couple
other videos on YouTube showing kind of
the same thing but none of them are
super detailed on how to accomplish this
process I'll be selling these kids down
in the video description right below
this video there's a couple different
colors not only clear there's like
atomic purple there's green there's red
all of them transparent which is exactly
what we're trying to accomplish remember
though as with all of these projects you
attempt this at your own risk I would
say if you're serious about this make
sure you watch the video all the way
through from start to finish to make
sure it's something that you can
actually accomplish if you know you're
doing the screwdriver though and you're
good at organizing your screws
everything should come out fine let's
get started
I'm going to start with the left joy cot
since both joy cons are slightly
different then I'll show the right joy
con and end up with the center console
itself at the end I'll have a successful
fully functioning clear Nintendo switch
to play after I'm all done this whole
process took me about an hour to
accomplish so go slow and keep your
screws organized there are four try
point screws along the back of the left
joy con I'll have all the tools and
stuff linked with the clear shells in
the video description and then the whole
plastic back unsnaps from the front and
folds open be careful not to stress
those ribbon cables along the sides if
you rip those your controller will not
dock or charge anymore the 525 million
power battery comes out next no adhesive
or anything holding it down it just has
its own little plastic holder there are
two thin wires going down to the plug on
the motherboard
I pulled mine out pretty gently because
once again this is a fragile process and
I don't want to break anything
there are three more screws holding down
the plastic battery holder I'll unscrew
those and unlatch the ribbon for the
trigger button then I'll also disconnect
the joy conrail ribbons each of these
have their own locking flap as well but
the latches are different for each
ribbon so watch out for that luckily
there's only one screw holding the rail
in place so I'll remove that and set it
off to the side and pull out the little
black latching button that allows the
rails to disconnect from the switch body
while I have the button here I'll just
toss it into the clear counterpart it
has a little notch on one side so it'll
only fit in the correct way I'll set the
joy con rail into place along that same
clear plastic piece with its one little
screw and we're done with the first part
anyway
now the left trigger is a little bit of
a pain to disconnect and even more so to
reconnect but I'll walk you through it
there's a little plastic pin that needs
to be decompressed underneath the
trigger so it will let go of the black
plastic I'll press that in and then grab
the trigger there are two squirrelly
little Springs that are here that you're
gonna hate in a few seconds they'll keep
track of them for now the electronic
trigger switch is held down by one screw
I'll remove that and very gently
transfer it over onto the clear
counterpart remember never bend kink or
tear these ribbon cables they are pretty
fragile
there is one Phillips screw holding that
little button in place and then I'll put
the two little Springs over the little
circular guiding pegs on either side of
that tiny board before trying to get the
trigger button and top over them the
trigger has its own pegs for the springs
it's tough to keep the spring straight
and get the trigger clipped in at the
same time but it's a good idea to make
sure it's done correctly the first time
so you won't have to come back and fix
it later it can be done the rest of this
left joke on body is pretty
straightforward
the joystick is going to come out next
pretty simple construction with two
screws on either corner of the square
body and then one little ribbon
connector attached to the motherboard
this also has a black locking latch that
needs to be lifted up before the
joystick can come out up at the top of
the board we have three more screws
these screws hold the board's tight for
the top buttons they'll come out as one
piece after the ribbon cables detached
from the larger motherboard below it the
top L button can come off at this point
to notice that it also has a spring
attached to it this is easier to work
with but still don't lose it grab the
little minus button from the controller
along with its inner rubber cushion and
set those off to the side in an
organized fashion there are only two
screws left holding this motherboard in
place remove those and the motherboard
comes loose now you can disconnect the
rumble pack from the motherboard but I
found it easier to just leave it intact
since it has a pretty fragile connector
I don't want to mess with it if I don't
have to the rumble pack has its own
adhesive and a pretty tight slot holding
it in place but my tweezers provide
enough leverage to get it out now the
motherboard and vibrator out all the
buttons can come loose these little
units are designed to only go in one
hole so don't worry too much about
losing track of their orientation as I
set the arrow buttons into the clear
housing you can see that the little
notches are in different shapes for each
button clever construction on a tendo's
part I could be using the colored
buttons that come with the clear kit but
I prefer the gray ones personally after
the buttons are set in place the rubber
padding goes back on top same with the
square button below it and finally we
get to start putting the
beautiful-looking electronics back into
the clear plastic the rubble tag goes in
first since I've left it attached to the
motherboard and the motherboard has
those two screws holding it to the
plastic remember if you kept your screws
organized the assembly is super easy now
I'm not really sure what this little
black spacer is around the Joye con
joystick but I'm gonna transfer it over
anyway just in case it's important the
joystick itself can poke its head
through the clear plastic hole and then
get the two screws holding it down on
either corner before trying to get the
ribbon cable plugged in I'll make sure
the latch is up so it can receive the
ribbon and then tuck it in place
locking it back down again there is an
unfortunate lack of Lego connectors
inside these things but the ribbons work
just fine I just you know miss saying
Lego sometimes the top buttons get set
into place along with the minus button
it's shaped in a way that will only let
you set it in wonder
and then the smaller circuit boards get
folded into their slots I'll zoom in a
bit here so you can see exactly how
they're situated with those three screws
and finally remember that spring you
weren't supposed to lose get that
situated on top with that el button then
we can attach the trigger and battery
housing back over the motherboard first
getting the trigger ribbon clipped in
just like with the rest the ribbons each
of them will have their own little latch
including these sight joy con rails that
we were working on earlier it's really
starting to come together now and
looking pretty fantastic the battery
bracket has three of its own screws as
long as you get the motherboard screws
in the right spot previously this won't
be too big of a hassle I'll use my
plastic pry tool to clip in the battery
metal is a bad idea when working with
anything connected to power setting the
battery in place allows me to close up
the whole contraption positioning the
rails and trigger in a way that the
whole thing can fold completely shut all
the way around the outside get the four
Y shaped screws back into the rear
housing and it is one fantastic looking
piece of hardware it even works at this
time it would be a good idea to make
sure all your buttons work before
getting everything officially screwed in
also keep that in mind as we start
working with the right joique on this
one has some special requirements to
stay functional but I'll walk you
through those the right joy con has the
same four Y screws on the back I'll set
those off of the side in an organized
fashion and then open it up like a
little book making sure there is zero
stress on those rail ribbons after it's
open I'll gently lift out the battery
and then give a gentle pull on the
connector so it'll come away from the
motherboard the little antennas the next
thing to get out of the way it's got one
little circular connection like we've
seen inside of a lot of cell phones the
battery bracket and right trigger is
held in place by three Phillips head
screws once those are out the bracket
can lift up and out of the way it is
kind of at a weird angle this joy con is
built a little bit different than the
other one but I'm still able to lift the
ribbon latch and free it from the
controller and since I have it out right
now I might as well make this section
clear to stay organized it's got the
same little plastic niblets holding the
trigger in place as the other joique on
once that trigger button has popped off
we see the same little electronic switch
with it's one little Phillips head screw
holding it in place I'll pop that off
and immediately transfer it over to the
clear counterpart so that one little
screw doesn't get lost the two Springs
for the triggers are still here I'll
plop those in the little slots and
gently line the trigger over the top of
the springs this is probably one of the
trickiest parts of this
project making sure the spring stay in
their grooves while clipping in the
trigger is like defeating the final boss
in a videogame it is possible though
back inside the right joy con again the
rail does need to come off
I'll unlatch each of the two ribbon
cables and then immediately transfer the
rail onto the clear section this part is
the same as the other rail with the one
little screw up top lifting off the rail
and then transferring over the black
latch button and reassembling the whole
thing with the one little screw pretty
simple process once it's lined up right
it should fit naturally without any
force needed the joystick is next on our
list of things to remove it's got one
ribbon cable and then two Phillips head
screws on either side of the joystick
I'll wiggle that out of the hole and
then remove the two screws that are
still in the motherboard now this
motherboard is a bit more complex it has
two more ribbons at the bottom that we
need to worry about but once those are
disconnected I can lift the motherboard
out along with the rumble motor the
infrared sensor at the bottom of the joy
con was one of those ribbons along with
whatever this square thing is if you
know let me know in the comments it's
probably some kind of antenna this joy
con also has a black buffer between the
joystick and the front plastic I'll move
that over to the clear piece it's got
little tabs to help it line up in the
correct spot then I'll start moving over
some of the buttons these are just like
the other joy Kong where they can only
go in one particular location and each
button has a little rubber cushion over
the top that allows it to decompressed
every time it's pressed it's nice that
they use rubber instead of something
mechanical that might break rubber lasts
a lot longer
the last button to move over is a little
plus sign up at the top of the
controller and it's little rubber shield
I'm going to continue using the original
buttons from my switch but there are
always the colored options that you see
at the top of the screen to make things
easier for myself I'm going to connect
the square-looking ribbon cable and
infrared sensors before tucking the
motherboard back into the clear frame
since these cables are a little short
it's easier to attach them first the
rumble motor is still attached as well
so I'll plop the hold dangly contraption
into the clear plastic at the same time
at this point in the game I'm going to
make sure all the buttons can be pressed
and that none of them are obstructed
from this point on if you screw anything
in too tight it might make the buttons
unpossible so we'll be checking that a
few more times throughout the assembly
the joystick is in place with its two
screws the ribbon cables tucked in and
latch down the motherboard itself has
two screws holding it in place once
again after those are tight
I'll check the buttons to make sure they
can still be pressed if the buttons are
stuck I'll just loosen up the screws a
bit it's pretty easy the joy con rail is
neck
with its two ribbon cables latching onto
the motherboard and then the battery
bracket and trigger button get plugged
in flipping it around to sit on top of
the motherboard before the screws can go
in though the right corner button needs
to be slipped into place and then those
three screws go into the plastic frame
to hold it tight remember too tight and
the exterior button stop working so find
that balance I'll use my plastic pry
tool to hit the battery plugged in and
then set the battery back onto the
holder along with the little Lantana
gizmo it has the little circular plug at
the bottom after it's plugged in the
antenna part just rests in a little slot
next to the battery then the whole
joique on can be folded shut like a book
lined up and closed and then the four Y
screw is going to the back panel I think
this controller looks pretty awesome
that black and copper colored antenna
thing on the front is perfect for clear
plastic both joy cons are now clear and
appear to be functioning perfectly this
thing is looking better and better by
the minute the last thing to clarify is
the console itself for this I'll be
turning the thing off and grabbing a
Phillips screw driver to remove the
bottom two screws next to the USBC
charger each of the side rails also need
to be unscrewed now you might be able to
get away with just removing one Center
screw since that's all that's holding on
the backplate but I just removed all of
them for kicks and giggles make sure you
use the right size head to the screws
don't strip there is one Phillips head
screw at the top of the console as well
that I'll remove and then all the screws
along the other side rail keeping
everything organized of course it's good
to put all the screws back in the same
hole that came from even if they look
like they're the same size there are
four more screws going directly into the
back panel these are the same in Tendo Y
shaped screws that we saw in the joy
cons there's one tiny screw left under
the kickstand and then the whole back
can lift off exposing the SD card slot
large silver metal plate and processor
fan that you'll be able to see through
the new clear plastic luckily we don't
need to go any deeper inside of the joy
con in this video there are two things
that need to be transferred over from
the back the game card slot protector
and the kickstand hardware the game card
slot protector has just one screw then
lift the protector off and place it over
on the clear back and then tighten the
same screw down again the kickstand has
three screws of its own and they'll
attach directly to the nuclear kickstand
on the replacement housing I'll make
sure the kickstand works a few times
before plopping the whole contraption
back onto this which again getting it
secured we'll have two screws at the
bottom of the switch four screws at the
back of the switch including the one
little screw up at the top and the
little
a guy under the kickstand and the final
step in this whole project are the
screws into both side rails and you're
done now I might be a bit biased but I
think this clear electronic thing is
phenomenal
you get to see the technology at work
inside the device we use every day it's
pretty incredible I will have all of
these kids link down in the video
description so if you want to try this
on your own switch you can there's clear
there's a couple different colors as
well let you look and see what's in
stock
remember this took me about an hour so I
would set about that much time or more
so you can get it all done in one go
it's important to keep all your screws
organized that's probably the biggest
tip that I can give you you might have
noticed that I have a new shirt on this
is my buddy Moe from back in 1812 you
could say that Moe is my bro I'll have
these shirts linked down the video
description as well if you're interested
in getting a couple of those and I'll be
down in the comments for a while
answering questions about this project
whether you're watching this video today
or a year from now go ahead and ask your
question either I or someone else who's
done this project will answer it for you
thanks ton for watching and I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
