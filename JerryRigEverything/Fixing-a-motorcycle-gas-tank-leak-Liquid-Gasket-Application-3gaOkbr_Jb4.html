gas from this spot right here the gasket
around the fuel pump
the gasket that I put on there last year
lasted for about a year before it
started letting the gas leak out again I
guess when it gets cold here in the
winter the gas just eats through the
gasket so I got this new stuff it's jet
fuel rated so hopefully it works out
better than the last one
basically I'm I do is I'm going to pop
out these bolts right here remove the
pump itself clean off the old gasket and
spread on the new stuff see what still
has a pretty good grip on the fuel pump
as you can see right there it was
leaking more out of that bottom corner
down there by my finger and most of the
gas is already drained out otherwise
we'd have a pretty big mess on our hands
there's the fuel pump itself I'm going
to go ahead and clean off all that old
gasket from around that little rubber
rim this is the edge of the tank and the
part that was giving me the most trouble
was right here the tank is just bowed a
little bit to the inside so it allows
the gas to seep out so I guess I could
take some like plastic epoxy or
something like that and build it up but
hopefully this other gasket does a
better job of keeping the gas in and
then we want you to go to drastic
measures with the epoxy build up so now
that I cleaned off this service with
denatured alcohol I can take the gasket
and spread it around the surface it's a
lot more runny than the last one I had
hopefully still works out
then it says leave it on the surface for
about two to five minutes let it get all
tacky and stuff I'm going to put it on
the other service as well around the
fuel pump and then let it sit for an
hour at room temperature I'm gonna
actually leave it for a day or two
mostly because it's colder outside than
room temperature right now and that
should fix it now it's successfully
colored on both surfaces that rubber
band is coated on both sides as well and
it will fit down inside of the groove
here in a second once I put it back on
and the three minutes is up so I'm going
to go ahead and install again back
inside the bike so I tighten a pump down
again with that little rubber round seal
in place and left it for about an hour
and right now it feels dry to my touch
the bottle itself says that you can use
it after an hour but I'm going to go
ahead and leave it for about 24 maybe 2
or 3 days also what I've done is I've
opened up the tank as well to kind of
let some air circulate inside of that
and dry it from the inside as well
anyway hopefully that works if you have
any questions go ahead and leave them in
the comments below don't forget to like
if this video helped you and feel free
to check back in every now and then and
see if the seal is still working for me
I usually respond to comments pretty
regularly thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
