the cooling system you have to do the
same time that you let's say like you
switch the thermostat or you do an
engine swap or just drain all the fluid
out of here all the radiator fluid out
of your car basically how you do it is
take off the radiator cap and then tilt
the vehicle so it's up on up on jack
stands or you can just Park them like an
incline or something like that because
basically what happens is that when you
fill the radiator up when you put the
radiator food in here and in the
reservoir the radiator fluid gets down
inside the engine but it doesn't get
inside of these pipes right here instead
of these tubes so burping the system
we're getting all the air bubbles out
I'm having it up at an incline helps at
the airflow flow to the front so I'm
going to turn the car on and then I have
to just kind of squeeze the tubes like
that to get the air out all the way into
the end of the radiator and up outside
of this that side of a cap so that's
what we're going to do today so you're
doing this make sure you keep an eye on
your fuel your heat levels and stuff
just make sure you're not overheating
basically is waiting for it to warm up
right now because the thermostat opens
up at 180 degrees on my car so once the
car hits 180 it'll open up allowing the
coolant to go inside those tubes
you can see the air bubbles kind of work
on their way up to the top there I just
been pouring some in that's why it's all
kind of bubbly and milky they see how
it's bubbling up and down like that
that's the air bubbles coming out
all right Nathan I was able to put about
another 4 quarts of coolant in because
of that so yeah so if your car's
overheating and you've recently done a
thermostat changer
I mean think it could be an air bubble
it'll save you a lot of mice by tipping
it up and then I'm in control here go
let's get out of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
