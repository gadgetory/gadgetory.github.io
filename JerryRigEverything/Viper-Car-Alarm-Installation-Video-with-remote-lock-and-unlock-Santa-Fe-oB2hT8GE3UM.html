a car alarm system with a remote unlock
we just took off this panel down here to
take off the panel there's four screws
there's one that goes in that corner
this corner and there's two screws right
inside here this is what the pin eye
looks like there's also some clips as
you can see there's those three Clips
right here that just kind of there's
they're in there really tight there's
one on this part there's one on the top
of the ignition switch over there and I
think there's one down there in the
corner I basically just have to pry them
apart there's one also behind this
little kick panel here so once you get
those out pretty simple
we're going to take off this it's got
four bolts on it that will give us
access to the wires behind the ignition
and down here by the door which are the
ones we need to install the alarm system
so to get off this kick panel and
there's a few different there's a lever
right here you have to pull out is for
the hood release basically take these
little pins and kind of push them in to
get the lever out is pop off of the
screwdriver there is a bolt back down
here at the end holding it on behind
there and then on here there's this
little groove right there that slips
into a clip down there at the bottom and
right here on the kick panel there's
these little knobs that there's those
little lips inside of here that fit into
just put a screwdriver inside and lifted
it both up and they both popped out and
I was able to release this so I'm going
to show you how to test for wires right
now the I have this little sensor right
here spacely what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to connect one into the ground
which is right here clipped into one of
the bolts that just goes to the ground
I'm going to have these two wires right
here I'm in the schematic that I pulled
up it said that the wire covering that I
needed was black and gray and blue and
black
there's not a whole lot of room attached
on to those wires with these wires
probably one to one of the back doors or
splice into them already so I'm going to
Reese place into them how to test for
wires so you're not causing a whole lot
of damage when you make sure you get the
right ones or not you can see this wire
behind I'm I took a razor blade and I
just made a little tiny slit right there
and I can put the sensor inside that
slit and see anything happens when I
touch it and make a connection so if I
touch this the doors unlock if I touch
this the doors lock so I know which wire
does what so after I've verified which
wires they are I make a slit right here
with these wire strippers I'm I just
basically I bite down on top by down on
bottom and then I make a slit down the
wire to expose it like that and then I
could take my other wire and feed it
through and make a connection because I
don't want to cut the wires basically
how I'm doing this is I split them open
like I showed before and there's a
little hole going through right there
and I have a really long bit of metal on
this end that I can just stick through
that hole and then wrap it around a
bunch of times I can get to focus on
that please wrap it around the opening
that way I never cut the wire hum but
the electricity still going to flow
through either way and then once I'm
done with that I'll just wrap the whole
thing up in electrical tape really well
that way so every if I manage to pull on
these wires are also never going to come
loose the door wires it's whatever
light turns on when you're pressing that
that button right there for the door
let's let you know what stores closed so
I have my tester on the I think it's a
green and orange wire right now fort
work see if we can I'm sorry to my press
this button right here on the side that
light turns on that one right there
also just so you know the instructions
say most vehicles use negative door
circuits connect the green wire to a
wire showing ground when doors open so
right now
the door is opened and there's no light
that means the electricity from the wire
is going to ground so it's not working
as soon as I press this lever right here
though I press this button
that means there's current going through
the wire so it's not grounded anymore so
if the door is open like this button is
released then it's grounded so that's
the wire we're going to use so right now
we have it connected to the this is the
underneath the key switch like the
ignition but manuals show me that the
orange wire is the 12 volt ignition wire
so when I turn the key the light should
turn on so put the key in the ignition
and I turn the key and this light turns
on just like that so as if I cranked it
as well
the ignition will also turn on so that's
the sy we need okay so we're still
working under here behind the ignition
switch this is the ignition wire my
splice the yellow into the orange could
be different on your car and then the
starter wire is this green one right
here that just cut the starter wires the
only wire that you will ever cut I cut
this one just because as part of the
safety features of the alarm system so
this right here just you know if someone
ever tries to steal your car by hot
wiring or whatever it won't start unless
your alarm system is deactivated so
basically the green one right here is
going to attach into the ignition and
then this one is going to continue on to
the starter wire so green to this one
going to the key and the black one goes
down to the starter motor and that just
makes sure that no one can ever start
your car without disarming here your
alarm system so it's called the starter
interrupt as far as the horn goes the
horn needs to go inside of the hood so
we have it mounted right now it's kind
of temporary I just kind of attached it
onto this metal bracket back here where
the sensor is the horn itself is just
like a speaker I didn't ever showed you
the other side of it but there's you
know looks like a speaker like a loud
horn and I put it facing down so that
water can't accumulate inside of this
it's really secure right here so I'm
actually just leave it I've got like
four or five zip ties on it and then
this is that red cable that I talked to
you about before going through the
firewall down in there and then on the
inside clean all this up in a second so
the red cable the red part of the horn
the red cable attaches to the Brown of
the sensor and then the black just goes
to the ground and you put it to the same
ground that we had the other and that
everything else attached to so I'll go
to the same ground
so to get through the firewall basically
what I did is there's a little hole I'll
show you in a second where the line that
goes through the pop the hood goes so I
took the screwdriver put the that metal
the wire around the tip of it and
stabbed the screwdriver through that
hole and once it was through the hole on
the other side I could take the wire
from the alarm I'll choose an example
right here use a wire from the alarm and
I tucked it through it like that
and then I tied I taped the wire
together to itself and I was able to
pull the wire back through the firewall
and with this once the wires were taped
to each other so that's the wire wasn't
strong enough to feed through by itself
so I to use a screw driver the hole
going through the firewall is right
there it's right there so that is the
receiver the thing that I guess the
commands from the little toggle that
goes onto your keychain I'm so basically
what I did is I took it brought it up
underneath here on the windshield pop
this off route it down through here all
the way down and then this is that right
here it's going to connect into the
computer and I'm going to make it all
look pretty down here just okay
everything is wired up even though it
looks like a complete message is pretty
organized basically there's two sets of
wires there's this going up to the
ignition and this set which is all kind
of bundled in with wires down here in
this beginning says kick pedal so it's
pretty easy to clean up all you got to
do is just kind of you know take zip
ties and just kind of clean up the wires
I'm going to mount the main computer
unit which is this guy um out of
underneath there on a firm surface I'm
probably the zip ties I might get some
sticky tape and put that underneath as
well we can lock the car unlock the car
and then this also has different buttons
where you can do the
unlock the back but this this car is
tied in with the just a normal unlock
button there's a bunch of different
wires on here actually let me show you
this
alarm sounds like so it just goes off
like that um there's a bunch of wires I
didn't use we just wanted it for the
door unlocking the alarm features but
the actual alarm system does have other
features you can attach to it but so the
actual computer part of it needs to be
mounted on something really sturdy and
so what I did is this plastic plate is
something that I bolt on before I put
the finish plastic over the string will
cover and I just drilled four holes in
it and then zip tie place to it so it's
pretty sturdy and then this will show up
underneath where I can plug all the
wires tooling on each side and then
right here is where you adjust the
sensitivity of it so once I have it
actually mounted I won't be able to
adjust the sensitivity very easily but
that should be a good place for now he's
headed right in the center there so this
is where I have that computer zip tied
in and then there's a big bundle of
wires up there and the rest are down
inside of here where the kick panel is
going to go so that's all taken care of
did it always zip-ties electrical tape
gets kind of messy after time it all
melts together
so anyway noise and you put the plastics
on and we're good to go
there's no wires visible below have the
appear posted and the wires are on here
and there is the speaker siren anyway
actually yeah there you go
that's how you install an alarm system
in a car I was pretty general all cars
the same I've done this in Tacoma and
the Santa Fe so yeah if you have any
questions make sure to leave in the
comments like if this helped you and
don't forget to subscribe thanks
