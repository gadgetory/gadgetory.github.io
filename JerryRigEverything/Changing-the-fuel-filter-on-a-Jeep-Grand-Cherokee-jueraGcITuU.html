on 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee the fuel
filter is located probably dead center
of the car right above the rear
differential that's what it looks like
this guy right here this one's pretty
old I've already taken off the two
connectors that go on it
basically it's just a little snaps like
you just press in the two little tabs
just do it with your hands pressing the
two tabs and this comes off remember
that the gas line is under pressure I'm
you can release the pressure up at the
front of the car I just basically just
snapped them off there will be about
probably a cup to two cups of gasoline
that will just kind of leak out so just
make sure you have something to catch
all the gas in then just take off these
two bolts release the filter put the new
one back on bolt it in and I'll show you
how that's done in a second do a quick
shot of what it looks like without the
filter in it little pieces right here it
looks like this thing hasn't been
changed in years so the um someone told
me once these things should be changed
every year I think it'd be fine every
couple years and I just kind of depends
on what you do with your rig
to see the dirty gas is pouring out of
this that I needed to be changed a long
time ago anyway what I'm doing right now
is I'm taking off these little
connectors on the ends my knee does in
order to put the new cap on I'm just
taking a razor blade and kind of just
prying it up over the lip there once I
get it off I'll just be able to clip it
on to the other one I'll be good to go
all right it's all done make sure you it
should have come with like a roller
rubber seal that goes around the outside
as well I'm so kind of stick that up in
there and these just clip back on once I
got the clips little plastic bits on
there so that is how you change the fuel
filter in a Jeep Grand Cherokee well the
next thing is I'm cleaning out this
these are the towels I used to collect
the extra stuff that was spilling down
you can tell that filter hasn't been
changed in years nuts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
