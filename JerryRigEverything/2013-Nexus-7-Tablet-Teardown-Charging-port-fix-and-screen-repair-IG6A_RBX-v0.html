how to take apart the Nexus 7 tablet
this is not the old 2012 version this is
the 2013 version it's a different shape
with different parts so to start we're
going to take off the back the back is
relatively easy to take off
I'm just slide your either a pry tool or
I found out just worked best with my
finger I could pop the back off
relatively easily I started around on
one side to work my way up towards the
top and then down around the other side
because it's mostly attached down by the
charging port kind of see me just
pulling the back away from the tablet
right here and make sure the tablets off
as well so you don't damage anything all
the tablet is running so there's no
wires attached at the back casing so
just set that off to the side and then
we're going to go ahead and start off
with the bottom end of the phone the
charging port here's the screw layout
the dark arrow is pointing towards where
the Void sticker is so you just peel
that off obviously you know Google
doesn't want you working on their
tablets by yourself now but sometimes
you gotta anyway so take all the screws
and then keep them organized that's the
best advice I can give pull them all out
and then set them in a place where
you'll remember where they go right here
we're going to disconnect the speaker
it's just kind of like a wall outlet
plug you just kind of unconnect it and
then right here these little ribbon
cables have a little flip latch I just
disconnected the two on the smaller side
and then it has the big flip latch for
the silver ribbon cable I'm kind of
starting on one end and then prying it
up all the way across and you saw just
flip up right there
once it's flipped up you just have to
pull them out so what I did with the
smaller ones I lifted up this little
spongy tape and once I got the tape up I
was able to slide my pliers or my
tweezers underneath and the two little
ribbon cables pulled out of there slots
and that released it from the the
circuit board and then the circuit board
is actually free from the housing at
this point so I lifted it up this is the
charging port so this is the part that
you'll get parts are cheapest on Amazon
so I'll list that in the video
description below as soon as they're
available then we have the speaker the
bottom speaker right here in this just
fits right on top of the right
underneath the the targeting port then
we have this ribbon cable down at the
bottom I'm going to lift up the black
sticky tape find the latch flip the
latch pull the ribbon cable out pretty
straightforward
then this is the screw layout for the
top screws once again the solid arrow in
the center there is where the void
sticker is make sure you pull that off
before you start unscrewing because if
that gets pressed down inside the screw
it makes it a lot more difficult to pull
out and set the screws where you can
remember where they are they are
different sizes this is the ribbon cable
connector for the volume and power
buttons so I'm just going to lift up the
latch slide the ribbon cable out of the
connector pretty simple there and then
there's one speaker up at the top as
well so the same as the bottom one I'm
just going to pull that out of the plug
and that's out and there's four screws
around the battery and I really like the
battery layout because the battery is
actually glued to the metal housing
underneath and you don't have to unstick
it from the glue you just unscrew those
four screws and the whole thing lifts up
out of the tablet which is super
convenient the battery connects to the
top motherboard by a by a little
connector like this you just lift it
straight up and out doesn't doesn't
slide out a lifts up and out so keep
that in mind I did make a mistake right
here the camera needed to come up with
the motherboard but it is glued down so
remember before you pull the motherboard
up unstick the camera and then it will
still be inside this little latch there
wasn't any damage done to this tablet
because it just slid out of the latch
but obviously you know it could cause
damage
you got to be careful with it anyway
there's one is the speaker up at the
tops I'm going to pull that out once
again I'll try to list all the parts
that become available in the video
description below this is the screen the
whole screen right here is the part that
you'll be replacing if it ever cracks
there is a small chance that you would
be able to replace just the glass on
that but that is really complicated and
we try to avoid that you like heat guns
and you got to pull class out and stuff
it's a real big pain anyway putting the
speaker and the motherboard back into
place pretty straightforward just make
sure all of the ribbon cables are on top
of the motherboard as well as the little
speaker wire that way you're not digging
for them later clip the battery back
into place then we have the bottom
speaker setting that in making sure all
the wires are up and out of the way so I
can plug them in
it's hard to position these Ches right
they do have two little tabs on either
side of the end of it you can kind of
use to press it into the little latch by
itself and connecting the silver ribbon
cable
and then I clip down the latches to kind
of lock the ribbon cables in place
same with these bottom two
and then I press them using the little
tabs on the side like you can see right
there making sure they're snug inside of
the little latch and then latching them
into place
then we have the speaker cable I'm just
going to plug that into the little slot
where it came from
all right so here's the here's a kind of
a better angle of the speaker wire being
plugged in two little notches go up at
the top and it just slides into a little
little hole and then here's the ribbon
cable for the power and volume buttons
I'm going to take that and kind of
wiggle that into place
all right here's the screw layout again
and the better you kept the screws
organized the easier it will be to screw
everything back into place
there's 21 screws and now that we have
all the screws in we're just going to go
ahead and pop the back housing on start
by putting in the charging port end of
the of the tablet into the case first
and then you can kind of clip up and
around the rest of it and there you go
everything works if you have any
questions make sure to leave them in the
comments below make sure to LIKE this
video if it helped you or if you thought
it was interesting and don't forget to
subscribe it really does does help me
out anyway like I mentioned before all
those parts and tools and stuff you'll
need can be found in the video

place to buy this stuff anyway thanks
