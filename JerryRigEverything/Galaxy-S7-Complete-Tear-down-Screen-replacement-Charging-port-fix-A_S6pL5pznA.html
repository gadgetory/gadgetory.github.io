the regular-sized galaxy s7 screen and
charging port replacement the phone does
get sacrificed during the process so it
should make for an interesting video
first turn the phone off then the
easiest part of this whole repair will
be removing the SIM card and SD card
tray from the top now to remove the back
panel we will use a heat gun to help
soften the adhesive underneath the back
glass after heating the phone up for a
couple seconds it'll be too hot to touch
and we can stick a giant suction cup on
it to gently lift up and away from the
phone as we slide our metal pry tool in
between the glass layer and the phone
layer this is the hardest part of the
whole removal process so once you have
it started you're probably good to go
that little gap will let us slide a
playing card or business card in between
the glass in the frame and then we can
slide that around the glass edges
because the business card will go with
the curve of the back glass I'm also
putting playing cards underneath the
glass foot won't read here back down to
the phone again as I'm removing the
adhesive once you've sliced through the
adhesive on both sides make sure you
don't go too deep or you will cut into
the Qi charger and you can remove the
back panel if you need to replace the
camera lenses you can just push those
through the back frame then there are 12
screws around the backside of the phone
now this little gold ticket gets you one
free chocolate candy bar from Willy
Wonka's chocolate factory so set that
off to the side and save it for later
then the plastic loudspeaker can bring a
move from the bottom of the phone same
thing with the Qi charger and then the
plastic bit at the top the nice thing
about having a Qi charger that doesn't
go through the charging port is that if
your charging port breaks your Qi
charger will still be able to charge
your phone through the contacts on the
motherboard I'm disconnecting all these
little ribbon cables starting with the
volume rocker the earpiece the front
sensors the screen and the battery you
should probably start with the battery
and then the power button is off to the
side over there down here at the bottom
of the phone there is the fingerprint
scanner then a couple wire cables you
don't need to disconnect the back one I
just got a little disconnect happy and
pop it off anyway then you can lift the
motherboard away from the phone just
like in the galaxy s7 edge there is one
little cable at the bottom of the
motherboard just unsnap that like a
little Lego and then the motherboard is
removed from the phone here's the
front-facing camera it's a 5 megapixel
stun snap that like a Lego and then the
rear-facing camera
on the motherboard here snaps off the
same way it is clicked into the
motherboard of this little plastic frame
so you have to unsnap that and the
camera can be removed now this phone has
been on for a total of 30 seconds this
tape sits right on top of the processors
and with that much discoloration I
wonder if these phones are going to have
overheating issues later on I guess
we'll find out here's another look at
the cameras the top one is the 5
megapixel front the bottom one is the 12
megapixel rear going to go ahead and
snap those back into the motherboard
just like little Legos you'll feel them
click into place with the rear camera
you'll also feel the camera unit itself
click in because that plastic frame
holds pretty tight now the battery
removal will need a metal pry tool I'm
going to use the blunt end of this metal
spudger and just slip it in and then pry
up little by little all around the edge
of the battery make sure you do not
puncture the battery at all there's a
battery itself I will link replacement
parts down in the video description
there are three screws down here by the
charging port that allows you to remove
the headphone jack set that off to the
side now this is where the problem
starts this is the exact same as the
Galaxy s7 edge where the back button and
the menu button wrap around underneath
the screen of the phone so it makes the
charging port repair impossible unless
you remove the screen of the phone now I
assumed that removing the screen of this
phone will be easier than with the
galaxy s7 edge and I was wrong because
the screens are constructed differently
and I'll show you why so I'm heating up
the phone I slipped a playing card in
underneath where the battery was that
all the way to the edge of the screen
and that allowed just enough separation
between the screen and the metal frame
that I could slip my metal pry tool in
same thing with the back of the phone I
slipped the playing cards in so it
doesn't reappear back down on top of
itself I was working my way around the
edges the screen is not going to survive
this process try the same trick with the
other side slipping a business card in
and hoping that that would lift off the
other side of the adhesive now down here
at the bottom you do have to watch out
for the charging port buttons slide back
button in the menu button and here's
where I broke my screen right here on
this corner I nicked that corner and
that made a crack all the way through
the LCD it is super super fragile that's
why I say that nothing is salvageable
when you are removing the screen from
your device so a charging port repair is
most likely going to require a screen
repair as well here's the other
difference the glass and polarizer are
not glued to the AMOLED screen normally
like with the note 5 and other Samsung
phones everything is glued together
so it's more structurally sound this
screen is not it is much thinner and
does not have the glue there so now that
I've severely destroyed my screen I'm
just going to pull that away from the
phone I will link replacement screens
down in the video description I will
need to replace this one believe it or
not here's the three layers we got the
glass and polarizer that have separated
from the AMOLED screen but now that the
screen is off that will allow us access
to the home button and fingerprint
scanner as well as the charging port so
wanna point out look how thick this
aluminium chassis is no wonder it
survived my bin test now that we have
access to the home button we can just
pop that out from the backside and then
slip it through the little hole in the
frame set that off to the side with all
the other components and then right here
this is where the buttons are wrapped
around the mid frame and attached to the
other side so I'm going to lift those
off gently and then stick them through
the mid frame and then I can lift the
charging port off of the mid frame as
the charging port usually they're pretty
cheap right around 10 15 maybe 20 bucks
if only it was easier to get at it would
make this phone a lot more repairable
here all the components if you have any
questions leave them down in the
comments I will make a part 2 to this
video where I reassemble everything once
I've purchased the new replacement
