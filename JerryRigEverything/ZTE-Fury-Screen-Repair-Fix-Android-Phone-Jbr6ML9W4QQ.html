ZTE theory from Sprint to start off with
their seven screws going around the
outside to speed this up so come to
watch me taking off each one one of the
screws is underneath that little sticker
is the void sticker just you know like
taking apart the foam and stuff your
board all the manufacturers warranties
but it's a pretty simple process you
shouldn't have too many problems to
start unequipping the screen from the
frame I started at the bottom of it and
you can see as I take my pry tool and
just kind of slide it along the edge
here
there's probably got four clips on
either side and then a few on the top
and the bottom that snap open they
separate oh right where the color meets
the silver
you
when you pull the two pieces apart make
sure you make sure the motherboard stays
down on the top of it next to the screen
and doesn't pull away with the bottom
half of the phone as you can see all of
the different components of this phone
are soldered onto the board so there's
really nothing else that you can replace
without getting super technical into the
soldering aspect and there's three
ribbon cables attached to the screen the
bottom line is stayed by the battery in
this one right here that goes to the
screen and then this one right here by
the top basically just take the little
tiny clip and slip it up flip it up
right along the edge and then you wiggle
the the ribbon cable out very gently
from the edge and they are pretty you
know resilient so you shouldn't have too
many problems you know ripping them or
carrying there anything as long as
you're fairly gentle there's no screws
holding the motherboard down so just
pull it away this is the whole screen
putting it back together the motherboard
does kind of clip into place not clip so
much but it sits really firmly between
the screw holes
back into place that was one of the
hardest parts getting into lino
so in theand just be gentle with them
and then once a
goes all the way inside of the little
holster for it you can slide down the
little latch which locks it all into
place
the back plastic itself just clips right
back on again make sure you run your
hands at both sides make sure all the
latches are in place then you can take
all the screws and put them back in any
latches that you miss like any clips
that didn't clip into place will clip
into place once we get the screws inside
toss the batter you're good to go and
you know I do post lots of phone you
know tear down rebuild videos at least
once a week so go ahead and like if this
helped you and don't forget to subscribe
