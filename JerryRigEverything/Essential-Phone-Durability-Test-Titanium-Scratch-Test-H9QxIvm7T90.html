the block and while I'm normally all for
being nice to the new kid the essential
$700 price point means it wants to
compete with the big boys and it would
be demential to expect preferential
treatment for such a quintessentially
price device let's get started inside
the box we get a rather nice braided
cable along with the USBC dongle
headphone jack which already spells bad
news for the versatility of this device
and of course the wall plug here's the
phone itself supposedly this device is
Android boiled down to the bare
essentials also while calling it
future-proof personally I always thought
devices from the future would have more
features instead of less but that might
just be me let's start with a scratch
test
remember the Mohs scale of hardness is
exponential curving significantly upward
as the numbers increase build quality is
one of essentials big selling points
using some of the most premium materials
available in the cellphone world the
Gorilla Glass 5 on the screen is a good
start scratching at level 6 with a
deeper groove at a level 7 the essential
phone has the exact same scratch
tolerance as the Galaxy S 8 and the
iPhone 7 up here at the Cyclops looking
8 megapixel front camera it's under the
same glass as the screen so it's
protected as well you might be wondering
to yourself at this point where is the
earpiece on this phone is it a piezo
electric vibrator like we saw inside the
me mix and no it's not it's just a super
thin little line up here at the top
covered in some kind of fabric it'll be
interesting to see the shape of the
speaker and the audio channel
configuration during the teardown
because that slot is tiny down at the
bottom of the phone how the buttons are
still underneath the glass so there's
nothing new to check down here the back
of the phone though is brilliant
I do like glass phones and the ceramic
of the essential phone takes design to
the next level not only is the ceramic
super reflective but it's also super
super hard we'll have to test and see if
Essentials using real ceramic in a
second but since my razor blade is
leaving no marks in the material things
are looking good there are two circular
holes in the top back panel I thought
the modular accessory mount would be
more flush like they are on Motorola's
phones but these are literal holes in
the phone with super strong magnets
inside kind of interesting the two
circles on the opposite side of the
phone are from the dual 13 megapixel
cameras this part I'm not a fan of don't
get me wrong I love dual camera setups
the zoo
the iPhone 7 plus or the wide-angle lens
of the LGV 30 are both amazing but I
have yet to see a monochrome picture
that I just needed to have in my life
the camera lens is glass so at least
that's a positive being so extremely
flush with the back panel though is
great aesthetically but not when you're
trying to keep scratches and damage to a
minimum we'll try to solve that in a
second but first let's see if essential
really used a ceramic panel ceramic
normally start scratching at level 8 as
we learn from the ceramic may mix phone
last year and it looks like that same
level of hardness is achieved on this
essential phone no marks were left by
memos picks until level 8 the back panel
is essentially impervious to scratches
along with the fingerprint scanner zero
damage means the hardware will continue
to function long into the future
besides this phone are made from
titanium which is a level 6 MMO scale
this is not to be confused with titanium
carbide which is a level 9 these are two
very different substances stainless
steel like my razor blade is also around
a level 6 and you can see the damage
being done to the surface of the phone
both titanium and stainless steels beat
out aluminum though which usually sits
around at level 3 or 4 depending on the
alloy and if all of that made sense
you're probably watching too many of my
videos it's not pure titanium though
around the edge there's a pretty sweet
little plastic rim plastic is much more
forgiving than metal so even this minor
ring pressed up against the glass will
keep pressure off the glass during a
drop if this phone survives the rest of
my test and enough people request it I'd
be willing to drop this phone a few
times before I take it apart let me know
if you want to see a drop test down in
the comments down here at the bottom of
the phone we find the lack of headphone
jack this phone really is just the bare
essentials which means it's barely
useful if you forget to bring or charge
your headphones personally I own a ton
of different wireless headphones I enjoy
them but I still appreciate the
convenience of my headphone jack on a
regular basis the biggest downside to
the glossy ceramic back is the
fingerprints and like I said earlier how
the camera sits flush with the back
surface one option that potentially
solves both problems is a skin this
matte black skin helps keep things sleek
and minimal or if you want more of a
khaleesi vibe the dragon skin also looks
very sweet a skin raises the camera
glass just enough so it's not rubbing on
whatever surface you set your phone on
I'll include a link to these skins down
in the video description and big thanks
to D brand for supporting my channel and
help me make this video possible
dragonfire this 5.7 inch quad HD IPS
display lasted about nine seconds under
the heat from my flame not invincible
but still impressive the pixels went
black and turned off but after the heat
was removed they came back to life which
seems to happen quite a bit north of the
wall the ultimate test of build quality
is the bin test the construction of the
phone says a lot about how long it will
last in everyday life and this phone
does feel extremely solid and heavy and
that carries over into the bin test it
is impressively rigid and sturdy
even when flexed from both directions
physically this phone passes my
durability test I'm definitely impressed
with the materials ceramic is one of my
favorites but the second monochrome
camera is unappealing to me that
combined with a lack of headphone jack
no water resistance no SD card and no
standardized wireless charging brings
the useless level of this phone to a
load that I'm not willing to accept I
don't need the bare essentials I need
all of the essentials let me know if you
want to see a drop test I think I'd
rather enjoy dropping this phone onto
concrete somewhere come hang out with me
on Instagram and Twitter if you want to
see a little preview thanks a ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
