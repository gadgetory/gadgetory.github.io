me six we'll see if it really is splash
proof and check out what it looks like
with a clear glass panel on the back
instead of the black coating you see now
let's get started as I mentioned in my
previous video there is an unfortunate
lack of holes in this phone there is no
headphone jack
this makes the phone easier for show me
the water proof though since water can't
get inside a hole if it doesn't exist
the dual SIM card tray does exist though
and it has a very thin bead of rubber
surrounding the opening this is pretty
darn similar to how Apple and Samsung
have waterproof their phones as well in
this shot we have the v6 on the left the
samsung s8 in the center and the iPhone
7 on the right side the Samsung has the
most rubber which hopefully makes a
tighter seal but all of the SIM card
trays appear to be pretty equal so the
me 6 is doing just fine in the
waterproofing department so far
we'll have to analyze the other holes
from the inside so it's time to remove
that back panel this is pretty similar
to how the LG G 6 or the Galaxy at 8
works as both of those have glass panels
as well I'm going to take a bit more
care with this one know since the me 6
has a curved glass edge on every single
side with enough heat and some gentle
persuasion from my metal pry tool it
starts to come off this might look easy
on camera but the back is very very
secure speaking of secure I go through a
lot of phones on my youtube channel and
setting up my individual accounts on
each new device is a pain but there is
one app that makes it a little bit
easier - laying reached out and wanted
to sponsor one of my videos to make sure
the phone got the full teardown
treatment so let me show you how it
works instead of trying to remember my
passwords for every single app or online
account when I get a new phone I'll just
sign into dashlane and it will
automatically bring up my passwords and
sign me into any app or website as I
visit them it's much easier than trying
to remember everything myself and is
totally free and more importantly
totally secure they use aes-256
encryption so not even the employees who
work at dashlane can see your notes or
passwords because of this trust no-one
system which I approve of if you forget
your master password literally no one
can help you since no one has access to
your account
yourself you don't have to take my word
for it though - Lane has been downloaded
over a million times from the Play Store
and has over 50,000 positive ratings it
works on iPhones and computers as well
I'll toss a link in the video
description so you can try - laying
yourself the app is totally free but if
you want the extra features like backing
up your data or syncing across multiple
devices I'll leave a 10% discount code
for - Lane premium now that the glass
panel is completely off let's try to
make it clear there is no lamination on
this glass just one giant sticker that I
assume is there to hold all the glass
together it's cracked the coloring is
from paint on the inside of the glass
after I spent several satisfying minutes
scraping away at the glass I realized it
was going to take far too long and I
resorted to the same industrial paint
remover you saw me using on the Galaxy
s8 this managed to destroy most of the
paint in a matter of minutes I did end
up removing the camera lens as well
because there was some color trapped
beneath the lens that needed removing
that paint thinner is pretty strong
stuff I'll give it one last spray to get
rid of the stragglers and set it aside
so we can do the actual teardown there
are 16 screws inside of this phone they
are all Phillips head screws but there
are different lengths so you have to
keep them organized as you remove them a
wrong size screw in the wrong hole when
reassembling the phone could damage the
electric components and then the top
plastic can come off the black
motherboard is pretty cool looking it
looks like the diffusers from the camera
flash might pose a problem for us later
on though the battery is the next thing
to disconnect it's always good practice
to disconnect the power on whatever
phone you're operating on luckily this
battery does have those magical pull
tabs and hopefully there's another one
since we already remove the screws for
the bottom plastic it pops off easy
enough flipping it over exposes the
loudspeaker with its two golden contact
pads as well as the vibration motor it's
interesting that this is a rectangle
vibration motor similar to the iPhones
and pretty much every single other phone
I've taken apart besides iPhones the
vibrator is a circle so that's
interesting
the battery does have one more hard to
grab magical bulb and once the adhesive
is removed from that side of the battery
a gentle little pry of shame with the
flat end of my pry tool will pop out the
other side since that pull-tabs the one
that broke the 3300 milliamp hour
batteries released from the phone I'll
try to include any replacement parts I
find in the video description to pop out
the motherboard I'll remove the signal
wire the two extension ribbons at the
bottom of the board and the volume and
power ribbon on the left each of these
will unsnap like a little Lego another
little screw on the right side of the
board and the whole thing can be gently
lifted out of the frame on the backside
of the motherboard we have a thin white
rubber snake that I assume is helping
the heat transfer from the processing
chips to the metal frame of the phone
the dual SIM card slot is non removable
but all three of the cameras are held
down by that same Lego light connection
we saw earlier this cute little guy is
the eight megapixel front facing camera
and over here we have the dual 12
megapixel rear cameras one has the two
times zoom on it for the close-up shots
without losing any image quality the
normal lens on the left has the for
access optical image stabilizing so the
phone is physically moving a lens inside
of itself to compensate for hand
movement the two times zoom lens moves a
little as well but that could just be
part of the focusing mechanism it
doesn't look like the extended lens has
the full optical stabilization that the
normal lens has I'll snap both lenses
back into place and the last cool thing
that I want to show you on the
motherboard is the infrared diode for
the IR blaster this is the same little
doohickey you'd find in a TV remote
allowing you to change channels and
stuff
it's our the good thing when phone
manufacturers include features you
wouldn't normally expect on a smart
phone adding features is infinitely
better than subtracting features down
here at the charging port we have the
signal wire along with the fingerprint
scanner cable and the extension ribbon
there's one Phillips screw holding it
all in place and then the whole charging
port can pull out a phone let's talk
about waterproofing for a second since
the bottom of the phone had the most
ingress points the holes on the right
side of the charging port are for the
microphone there is mesh screen blocking
the holes as well as the rubber shield
for the mic and on the left side of the
charging port we have another mesh
Green for the loudspeaker this is the
same type of screen we've seen on the
iPhone 7 in the galaxy s 8 so I guess it
would be just as good at keeping the
water out as those phones the adhesive
holding the screen in place is pretty
strong up here at the earpiece another
point where water could get inside the
phone is the speaker this has a rubber
speaker cone and the same water type
mesh we saw at the bottom of the phone
so water shouldn't be getting in this
hole either so if all the holes seem to
be water resistant on the me6
why didn't show me just I P 68 certify
this thing and I'll tell you it's
because of the charging port the
charging port is not water resistant at
all there's no rubber ring around the
edge and it's not sealed along the back
like we saw with the iPhone in the
Galaxy s7 so if this phone ever gets wet
or submerged water has easy access to
the whole phone from inside the USB slot
show me is really close to getting the
whole phone watertight I imagine this
makes six of the practice round and one
of their next phones will start
implementing the full water resistance
that we've come to expect in major
flagships I would personally rate this
phone as an IP 60 for any forceful
splashes or immersion could very well
kill the phone entirely so be careful
especially with that charging port but
still you got to hand it to them some
waterproofing is better than no
waterproofing so thumbs up for that at
least now for the display it's glued
into the frame of the phone and has to
be removed with heat just like we did at
the back panel I'll put links in the
video description as the replacement
parts become available and now it's time
to reassemble this thing and see what it
looks like clear the charging port gets
set back into place along with the
extension ribbon and the fingerprint
scanner driven they'll snap in like
little Legos and then the round wire
cable gets clipped in as well one screw
holds the whole board in place and then
we have the plastics this plastic holds
both the loudspeaker and the vibrator so
we need both halves unfortunately this
means we can't show off the black
circuit board at the bottom of this
phone the top motherboard is going to be
hard to show off as well it has one
screw holding in place along with the
volume Lego connector the extension
ribbon and the screen ribbon cable they
all get plugged in and lastly the little
wire cable clips in next to that white
water damage indicator sticker before
the top plastics go on though the
battery needs to be set in place and
plugged in
added one little strip of adhesive to
help hold it in place because of the way
the flash diffuser is integrated into
the plastics and the way the antennas
are much more intertwined into this
panel I'm going to leave it intact
I wish the internal circuits would be
more exposed and visible but I think
cutting through this piece would
incapacitate the thawne more than it's
worth I'll get two 16 screws back into
place and we can finally start with that
clear back some of the clear
double-sided tape will allow the camera
lens to sit back in place and I'll put
that same tape all around the outside
edge of the phone to help keep the glass
down and to help keep dust from getting
inside the phone the tape is pretty
strong stuff I'll firmly press the glass
into place and it is finished I wish I
could show off more of the circuits but
it is what it is you'll have to let me
know which of the clear phones I've made
has been your favorite so far
tell me down in the comments or over on
Twitter I hang out over there quite a
bit as well I'll add a few more pics of
this phone and post it over on my
Instagram don't forget to check out the
dashlane link in the description big
thanks to them for making this video
possible and thanks for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
