s2r 800 oil changes of 2006 so I'm in
the middle of the oil change right now
I've drained all the oil out of the
system and I put the new filter in place
after filling it up with oil twisting it
up in there getting the rim wet with the
oil and then tightening it down with my
hand I'm going to pop this off this for
the screen then I've already broken this
loose with a 21 millimeter ratchet and
twist this
I have my 14 millimeter bit like this
that just slips up inside of that little
hole I'm just gonna ratchet it out now
that I've broken at least I can just
kind of get with my finger
all right this is your oil screen he's
gonna make sure that there's not any big
chunks of metal on here it looks like
there's a few tiny little flakes up
there on the top right next to my thumb
those aren't you know anything super big
to worry about everything looks pretty
okay so I'm going to clean those little
flakes off and then step it back down in
there tighten it up and you're good to
go
you don't need to do this every time you
change your oil I've heard people
recommend they do it every other time
honestly you're probably just fine doing
it every couple times every three or
four times keep in mind that on the end
of your drain plug there's also a Magna
so you want to clean off off little
metal shavings off of that and those two
things the screen and this little magnet
right here kind of keep the extra
shavings out of the inside of your
engine and you might throw any questions
make sure to leave them in the comments
