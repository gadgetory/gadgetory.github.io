the charging port in your iPhone 6s plus
I will link all the replacement parts
and the replacement tools down in the
video description below now before you
get all excited make sure that it's not
just dust or lint clogging your charging
port not letting your cable plug in all
the way more often than not that's the
only problem there is there are two
screws down at the bottom they are a
pentalobe screw once those are out I can
take my pry tool and pry between the
plastic frame of the screen and the
metal frame of the phone and lift the
screen away from the phone body using a
suction cup there is a little bit of
adhesive surrounding the edge so be very
very careful as you're prying it up I'm
going to switch to my plastic pry tool
to avoid damage to the screen if you do
damage the screen you'll need to replace
it and that would be a much more costly
repair there are two screws down at the
bottom by the battery connector I'm
going to remove that metal plate and
then unsnap the battery from the phone
there are five screws up by the screen
that metal plate comes off as well and
then each of these little screen
connectors on snap from the motherboard
they're very similar to Legos once those
are removed the screen pops off from the
body and then we have access to the
charging port the charging port ribbon
cable unsnaps from the motherboard and
then there's a wire cable up here at the
top that I can unsnap as well that
leaves two screws up at the top of the
loudspeaker and then another three
screws down here by the charging port
that have a little metal plate we're
going to remove that little plate that
leaves three more screws down by the
wire connector set that off to the sides
to make sure it doesn't get in our way
there's one screw down by the bottom of
the loudspeaker and then there's a
hidden screw down by the microphone and
the charging port once that's removed we
can get rid of the loudspeaker and set
that off to the side make sure you keep
your screws organized it is very very
important there's a lot of screws here
and there are all different sizes there
are five more screws here that we're
going to remove and that releases the
taptic motor from the charging port that
also unsnaps just like the same little
Lego connectors we've been dealing with
this whole time this is where you get
your vibrations from now we can start to
peel back the charging port from the
phone be very careful with it even
though it is broken we might need it for
troubleshooting later on rule of thumb
is to try not to damage any components
while you're removing them from the
phone there's one more hidden screw down
here at the bottom and then we can
release the microphones from the bottom
edge of the frame there is a little bit
of adhesive that holds them there you
can just pry that off with your metal
pry tool and then the whole charging
port can be pulled away from the phone
except
for another hidden screw down here at
the bottom this is a grounding screw so
you can just remove that from the frame
make sure to keep it organized and the
charging port comes loose so this will
be the replacement part you might need
to transfer over that wire cable it just
depends on how yours is shipped I will
link these down in the video description
below as well now that the phone has
more loose screws than Donald Trump it's
time to put everything back together
again
sit everything down inside of the frame
including the charging port in the
headphone jack get that taptic vibrator
back into place and then set the
loudspeaker as well into place moving
the wire cable up towards the edge of it
so it doesn't get pinched underneath the
loudspeaker tape that metal bracket down
into place and then set the metal
bracket on top of the little screw holes
now pause the video here if you need to
pray for a second or just to keep track
of the screws you've installed so far
once those are all in we can reattach
the wire cable to the motherboard and
then plug the charging port as well into
the motherboard just like a little Lego
connection you'll feel it snap in
underneath your finger as you press it
down now I personally like to test to
make sure everything works and all the
connections are good so I'm going to
clip the screen back into place and then
plug the battery into the motherboard
and then turn the phone on even though
it's not completely shut yet everything
is good sometimes there will be lines
through your screen or the screen will
be gray this means that your connections
aren't good with the motherboard so you
have to reconnect the screen ribbon
cables to the motherboard and hope that
those lines go away
all my connections are good so I'm going
to screw back in those metal plates and
then line the top of the screen up with
the top edge of the phone first before I
slide my fingers down the edges and clip
the screen into the body there's two
screws down at the bottom to have any
questions leave down in the comments
it's always great to have Instagram and
Twitter followers so hit me up over
there and thanks for subscribing hope
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
