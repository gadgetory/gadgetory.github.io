retail version I bought myself huge
thanks to Nord VPN for sponsoring this
video but more on that later
last year's key one didn't do so well my
durability test turns out the screen
didn't have enough adhesive on the back
and it would randomly fall off not just
on my phone but I know there's in real
life as well
luckily blackberry was pretty quick to
acknowledge the issue after my video and
started gluing their screens on better
and offering free replacements to anyone
affected now we have the key to a new
and improved Android phone with a full
keyboard but as the screen glued on
there's only one way to find out let's
get started there's not many phones out
there with full keyboards these days I
used to have a blackberry pearl back in
the days of t9 texting so the keyboard
and I do have a fond history even if I
don't currently use one the keyboard
this year on the key to is more of a
flat matte dry plastic which I'm a fan
of I think it's better than the glossy
rubberized keys from last year's key one
also the screen glass doesn't wrap
around the edges of the phone the key to
has flat glass which I think looks
better and is more durable the back is
still the black rubber we've come to
expect on blackberry phones and the
keyboard still doubles as its own little
trackpad controlling the screen speaking
of which it's time for the scratch test
I have a set of most picks that
differentiate between different minerals
and materials blackberry did drop down
to a guerrilla glass 3 on the key 2
which compromises slightly on the shadow
resistance but personally I feel like
Gorilla Glass 3 is slightly harder and
therefore slightly more scratch
resistant than Gorilla Glass 5 glass is
still glass no matter what version it is
the different variations of glass are
just marginally better than each other
this 4.5 inch screen still gets marked
up at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a
level 7 up here at the top of the screen
the glass extends all the way to the top
of the phone protecting the 8 megapixel
front-facing camera and also surrounds
the earpiece which appears to be made
from plastic the earpiece is very well
secured underneath the glass so unless
the screen falls out on its own which
isn't outside the realm of possibilities
with blackberry the earpiece should be
solid the keyboard of the BlackBerry key
2 is my favorite part of the phone it's
unique
it might be argued that keyboards are
outdated but everyone has different
preferences and that's what makes the
smartphone world awesome there really is
something for everyone we're here for
durability though the flatten on grippy
plastic is still scratch well but I bet
typing speed will increase when your
thumbs tickle the old ivory since the
rubber isn't there to slow you down the
keyboard letters are printed on top of
the plastic and not embedded all the way
through like we saw with the Nintendo
switch the printed keys are more cost
effective just time will tell if they
wear off with normal used or not the
keys themselves are pretty awesome each
individual key is very securely glued to
a rubber backing over the circuit board
and judging by how far I can pull them
away from the phone without breaking
these are gonna last a while they spring
back into place like nothing happened
this phone has no water resistance
though we'll have to see if blackberry
added any internal protections during my
teardown video the fingerprint scanner
is very creatively integrated into the
space bar and surprisingly does not
scratch the little guy scratch proof all
the other keys are the normal plastic
except for this space bar setting up my
fingerprint was still pretty flawless
and managed to open up the phone every
time I'm impressed
the scratch proof space bar definitely
gets a thumbs-up for me the viewing
angle does seem a little low on this
phone but blackberries have a reputation
for being secure so maybe that's a plant
feature and not a flaw the phone is made
from metal though which is great 7000
series aluminum and still comes with a
headphone jack
the sides are metal which is good the
volume rocker is also metal although it
did feel like plastic initially and we
have our heavily textured power button
and a dedicated programmable button on
the sash nice a black pray to leave it
open so we can choose what we want to
use it for the sim n SD card tray are
metal and the bottom of the phone rings
our USB C port all things we have come
to expect on a 2018 flagship dual
cameras are also the norm these days and
Blackberry did it right with two
different types of lenses a normal 12
megapixel camera and a 12 megapixel
telephoto zoom lens the dual 2 colored
LED flash is plastic but the light is
getting diffused anyway so scratches
won't matter if they happen the
BlackBerry droops are permanently
displayed in the centre of the phone if
you remember droops are what we call the
little balls that make up the blackberry
fruit hence the logo and each group is
very solidly secured into the back
these guys aren't coming out on their
own it's almost like blackberry was
ready for me this time around the back
panel itself is made from as blackberry
calls it textured diamond grip non-slip
back
I call it rubber molded in the shape of
diamonds also fun fact modern keys the
ones we use today were invented in 1861
they've been around for almost hundred
and sixty years a modern key against
this key to won't do any damage though
it should hold up against home abuse
like keys and coins and stuff blackberry
is pretty recognized as one of the most
secure smartphones especially back when
they had their own operating system
nowadays they're still secured on a
software level but against my physical
flame it lasted about 13 seconds one
thing that can make any smartphone or
computer more secure is Nord VPN not
against flames obviously but it encrypts
your internet traffic from one end to
the other meaning no one can spy on your
phone or computer when you're using
Wi-Fi these virtual private networks can
be accessed from your phone or computer
and can secure six devices
simultaneously Nord VPN has over 4,000
servers in 62 different countries it can
redirect your traffic as if it's coming
from anywhere for a totally risk-free
trial you can use the code jerry-rigged
and get seventy seven percent off your
plan bring in that final price down to
about two dollars a month WWN or VPN com
slash jerry-rigged one new feature on
the app is called cyber sec which
protects you against advertisements and
online threats check the video
description for links and thanks to Noor
VPN for sponsoring this video and
supporting my expensive hobby now let's
see if that screen pops off
I've been task is us a pretty good idea
of how well the phones are constructed
revealing any fragile points or kinks in
the frame we need to worry about even
with considerable pressure applied to
the back of the phone the front glass is
very solidly intact and still glued in
same from the rear the backpal remains
secure and in one piece this time around
if phone companies keep making super
solid secure smartphones I'm going to be
out of a job as a professional phone
breaker or maybe it's my job that keeps
smartphone companies making solid
smartphones who knows from a physical
standpoint the key to is a success and
passes all of my durability tests
nice work blackberry if you want to
check out the current pricing or give
Nord VPN a try to secure your internets
check the links in the video description
let me know if you have any questions
and thanks a ton for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
