restricted to the pavement for most of
my adult life either like my wheelchair
are you then so I met a girl named
cambrie a couple months ago who is
paralyzed which means she doesn't have
the use of her legs normally people who
are paralyzed get around in a wheelchair
but even with the wheelchair it limits
the amount of places you can really go
especially when the wheels are small and
is operated with your hands I saw this
problem and realized that I could take
two electric bikes and splice them
together with a seat in the center so
she could get around easier and go more
places all electrically powered cambrie
has no idea this thing exists or that I
built it or that she's gonna get it
today this baby can go 20 miles an hour
with a range of about 20 miles we'll
have to put it to the test a little bit
later so come along with us and see what
happens I hope she likes it let's get
started
so Canberra is on her way here right now
she thinks we're gonna make a video
about this bike which I built her a
couple weeks ago which has adult
training wheels on the back worked out
pretty well we could strap her feet to
the pedals we went you know five or six
miles down the trail with it but it's
not as safe as I want it to be which is
where the new contraption comes into
play my buddy's right now are hiding
behind this building over there with the
bike
so after cambrie and I filmed the video
about the adult training wheels they'll
ride out and we'll do the reveal
hopefully it works okay yeah so this is
the bike and this is Camry and she is in
a wheelchair so normally when cambrie
gets out of her car she sets the frame
out and then each of the wheels are
independent of each other I'm just kind
of like get on each of the size of the
chair how long have you been doing this
13 years
then how do you get from the car into
the chair very carefully
now already we've taken this bike out a
couple times what is something you like
about having this bike man this is hard
right sorry okay you can edit all of
this yes I can I like the freedom it
gives as I'm on the road with everyone
else on their bikes and it's not like
I'm strapped down and disabled like I'm
just on top of a bike like everyone else
I have to balance a little bit with my
upper body and it's a lot faster than a
recumbent bike my shoulders don't get
tired so that's fun but if you could
change something about it
what would you fix because I know when
we took it out the one time I was
nervous that like if you were to tip
over you kind of like stranded I just
want to go faster you want to go faster
I like change so she wants to go faster
what would you put on an upgrade what
would I put on for an upgrade there's a
couple ways I was upgrade this actually
I am super glad you asked there's
something I haven't told you yet about
the bike so come on over here so you
know when I've been at my office welding
stuff this is unreal
what happening right now
Thank You Marie uh okay this is really
cool how do you like it
I'm stoked this is really cool I don't
even know I just like Carlin yeah okay
this why you're asking so many questions
yeah about your realtor and stuff okay I
probably should put this Christian on it
yes
Figo there obviously let me put some
velcro straps to keep them down a little
bit later you have your miles per hour
and everything just like the other bike
and it's already on but then just turn
this a little bit so brakes are these
things up here on the top so I just
operate with my thumb but you can just
let go of the throttle and then
got it
for you
wait
don't you think it's unreal like nothing
like this exists amazing yeah I'm just
like okay that's why you didn't show me
anything that you're welding you're
showing the other stuff do you guys want
some pumpkin
sinister did two favorite the most away
adult life
that was
so you're doing like a victory lap
around this track and there's two boys
over there and they were talking and one
was like dude how is that accelerating
and then the other guy was like yo bro
it's solar powered so maybe that's a
feature we can add for the next one that
was it that's good it's a whole new
level of freedom I love it I like that I
can go down curbs and up curbs yeah cuz
in your regular wheelchair like that
would be oh yeah I don't always make it
up one curb could you have made it up
the grass Hill on you yeah and the best
part of it is we went 11 miles today and
my slope my shoulders aren't sort off
and it can go on like grass woodchips
and gravel and I think whatever else I
wanted to drive it on so if you could
change anything about it besides adding
solar panels what would you do and I put
some like shock absorbers in the seat
because I like going up and down the
curbs yeah so when we built the bike the
front shocks are intact so she has a
little bit of absorption but when the
back tires hit there's really no padding
from her seat to the ground adding in
some more shocks would probably be a
good thing or like a rear suspension
that would probably add enough cushion
to the seat we haven't decided a name
for this yet so if you can think of a
name for this off-road pod racing
chariot wheelchair contraption leave it
down in the comments and help us out
go-kart from heaven I'll have more
details listed in the video description
like the dimensions of the seat
obviously every single person is gonna
be a little bit different and where I
got the bikes from and stuff you have
any questions leave down in the comments
thanks stuff for watching huge thanks to
cambrie for being my test driver for
this thing and we'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
