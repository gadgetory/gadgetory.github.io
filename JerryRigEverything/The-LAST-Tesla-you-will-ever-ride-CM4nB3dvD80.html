the Mercedes a-class car reveal but
there's a pit stop first that we need to
make to show off one of the most unique
cars I've ever seen one-of-a-kind Tesla
which could be the last ride anyone
would ever take a hearse so the reason I
say this is the last ride you could ever
take is because this is a silent modern
and very stylish farewell this Model S
Tesla converted into a hearse we'll take
it for a spin here in a second but this
is literally one-of-a-kind they've taken
the Model S which you can see here in
the front part and they sliced it in
half extended the body this is a
rear-wheel drive and added the back half
so here in the back this is where the
coffin would lay and there's spots for
flowers and stuff you can take the
coffin and slide it along those rollers
inside in the book about Elon he says he
wants to die on Mars but if he ends up
dying here on earth this might be a
valuable option so obviously the Tesla
does not have a motor in the front so
there's the front space which you can
put you know different things there and
then they've also when they extended the
body of the Tesla this might be the same
hinges that they used for the previous
door they just you know have a half door
instead of the full door and then you
can put different funeral stuff in here
that they use for that then these rails
right here for the flowers alright so
coming around here to the back of the
Tesla this opens up and this is where
the coffins are stored so if I were to
grab right here this whole thing slides
out and I believe locks into place and
then the coffin is slid over these
rollers all the way back into the very
back and then this is placed here and
locked in to keep the coffin from
sliding around and then this is where
the coffin would sit you know on its
final journey you know to the graveside
of the graveyard then obviously the
whole thing slides out so people can
grab it on either side and do the
carrying and then if we want to put it
back in
perfect let's take this first for a spin
alright so pretty much just like a
normal car we're gonna jump inside it's
got the huge display up front just like
other Model S's and the model 3 has it's
got the same dashboard that we saw
inside of Dan's Model X and we are
moving so here in the front it looks
pretty much the same as other Tesla's
that we've seen but over in the back is
where things start to get a little bit
different we have the compartment back
there or the coffins so how fast is this
thing okay so the acceleration on this
thing is the exact same as the Tesla it
has as much get up as a regular Model S
this is pretty sweet one thing I do like
is that they kept the aluminum side
panels because the Tesla's use aluminum
body panels and then they kept the glass
top so you know you've seen in the model
3 and the Model X it has the glass roof
in the back and so I like that
aesthetics as the glass goes back over
the top this is my first time in a
hearse this is the fastest hearse that
will probably ever be in so the company
that designed this her specializes in
funerals and they have quite a selection
of different horses that they use for
funerals so if you have a funeral here
in the Netherlands to take care of this
might be a valid option for you
that is it for the Model S Tesla now we
are off to the Mercedes event to check
out their a class and thanks a ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
