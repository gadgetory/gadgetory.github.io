on I got the sway bar link added and as
soon as I put the tire on and drop it
down this will line up enough for me to
bolt it in I have the top of the leaf
springs and the bottom leaf springs just
kind of barely bolted in you know it's
still kind of loose so when I drop
everything down and everything tightens
up I can I couldn't you know torque it
down to factory specs anyway I got the
brake line you know where it drops it
down a bit more as well so we should be
good to go
all right pedals Wilson place I'm not
going to tighten it up all the way
remember until it gets a until we put
the tire out and drop it back down
because the everything needs to sit in
place before you tighten it down all the
way so right now I'm just going to leave
it you know snug so it's not going to
fall apart when I put it down but I'll
torque it down to where it's supposed to
be at once I get down to the bottom
rear shocks are super simple mala has
the bolt at the top which is a 19
millimeter and then it has the bolts
down here which are 19 millimeters as
well just pop a wrench on this side and
then do the ratchet on that side
and yes they I do it with the car on the
ground just because you know without the
high-tech lift equipment and stuff like
that it's just a lot safer to do when
it's on the ground anyway so yeah pretty
straightforward
okay so we're placing the shocks on a 91
Jeep Wrangler is his works ring at the Y
J's I'm basically of a better show you a
shock mount already so we have the shock
right there we've got the bottom bolt
you got any top hold and that's in the
passenger side only good reason 19
millimeters um I've already taken these
ones out so that's what that looks like
yeah just can I got the washer and the
nut and a little spacer right there that
you can put the top
the shotgun so the shock usually comes
pre-built like this with little rhythm
pulling in place and you're going to
want to mount the bottom into which is
this end over here in place before you
break that ribbon because it's pretty
hard to compress them once they're
uncompressed and then when you do it the
top end it'll kind of spring out a
little bit and you just want to line it
up with the the top of the mount and
I'll kind of show you how to do that
okay I cut that ribbon and expanded up
into the Jeep
you know these things are pretty strong
so I had to kind of manhandle it on that
little bolt there anyways once you get
most of the way on you can get this knot
there you just tighten that snug and
then I'll push it as you can kind of see
it's a little bit gap right there but as
you tighten it it'll pull a whole shock
em into the car so when I do if you like
to have the letters and stuff facing
outward so that on the next guy when he
comes along you can read what part
number it is you know not to use e from
the bolts or anything like that very
straightforward to get the bolts off
sometimes it helps to break or more and
then some people like to say that the
shocks need like a boot or a sleeve to
protect that with my research that I've
done online you know yeah it's nice yeah
it helps but you know you don't need it
in every case a lot of the shocks are
designed they're kind of before they're
designed to not let dirt and stuff
inside of them right there so these ones
should be fine without the without the
boot but you know some people like them
for aesthetic purposes as well anyway
that's how you put shocks on a on a YJ
Jeep Wrangler
all right so we can relocate the track
bar so that's the track bar right there
and this is a 55 well the t-55 bit that
goes in this end and I met on the other
side is a 21 millimeter he's got to take
off the track bar on this side and then
there's going to be a little bracket
that sits a little bit above it so that
the track bar can say where it normally
sit but still touch the axle because the
lift case when you're doing the Trevor I
find that it's easier to attack it from
the nut end of it over here on this side
because these star bolts are pretty
freakin ordered lists when you're trying
to torque them or twist at all so I use
you know just a big wrench to kind of
hold that one in place I do all my
twisting from over here on this end that
way I don't damage that bowl and I can
use beacon later so I'm going to end up
the track bar on the rear and we have
this little thing right here if I were
you put the crush sleeve in it basically
this thing slides right down inside the
bracket just like that um it's bolted in
on the back right there through that
hole and then there's another bowl
supplied that goes to the top right
there so I'll show you what that looks
like
all right so you do have to put in the
star bolt and this the crush sleeve
before you can tighten down that bolt in
the back there well in the back is a 13
millimeter on either side and I just
have the top bolt in to hold the track
bar in place
so as you tighten that bottom bolt on
the bottom there it pulls the whole
thing down so it keeps it tight so
that's what you have to have in this
order otherwise the holes won't line up
when that's bolt is all the way tight so
that's a little vague
get any bolts off the axle is pretty
simple
this one just had a 19 millimeter bolt
at the bottom and you just got to
ratchet it off having a very large
breaker bar helps out a ton especially
with these older jeeps are kind of
rusted on there okay I checked with the
car in two places one underneath the
back the other right on the edge of the
frame I'm just kind of supporting the
car you know more in one spot so if this
thing falls already not some serious
problems failing taking off the leaf
springs right now I have one inch wrench
on the back and on this ring where that
wrench size is a 22 millimeter and then
on the front bolt where the sockets at
it's a 21 millimeter and so with the
back wrench just with the way that I'm
twisting this twists around that way and
so the wrench is pinned up against the
transfer case mount so whenever I turned
this the wrench keeps the other bolt
steady because they need to spin
independently of each other so that's
what's getting that bolt off okay so I
ran to another problem where this
doesn't quite line up with that though
screws won't the bolt won't go through
the holes so what I've done is that
needs to come this direction so I have
the same you know contraption I'm going
to jerry-rig this little thing and as I
click this that will come towards me
which will give me enough room hopefully
to line up that bowl
there you go then
now when you're putting this on make
sure that this this wedge right here the
thicker part is always towards the front
and then when you're tightening in the
bolts on this on the leaf springs don't
tighten them all the way and tell the
vehicles you know all the way back down
on the ground and you'll be able to that
way because of everything I'll
reposition a little bit once it's all
that has the full weight on the springs
again so this is the rear side is kind
of finished what it looks like so you
got the leaf springs tighten on the
shackles in the back you have the bump
stop it can see how on the left side
there it's kind of is tacked in with
that you bowl at the u-bolts in place
and then I got the track bar mount place
a little bit higher up and it just bolts
on the bottom of the you moult's there
so that's what each of the back sides
looks like
all right that's the finished Jeep got
the bigger tires on there got the four
inch lift on it so yeah if you have any
questions you know be sure to ask I
usually put up videos you know a couple
times a week so if you have any
questions be sure to leave them in the
comments like if this helped you I do
like to get feedback and stuff on you
know how much it helps people and then
yeah don't forget to subscribe thanks
