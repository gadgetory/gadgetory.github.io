on a CBR 600 f4 I only have time at
night says what we're doing right now so
the nuts ID which I've already taken off
there's a nut right there is a 27
millimeter the other side which is right
here this part of the bolt itself as a
22 millimeter
these little guys back here eight
millimeters just loose them up a little
bit so you have a little bit of play in
the axle so you can slide the playing
the tire so you can slide the axle out
so anyway there's also another with with
the caliper up here you need to loosen
these up as soon as I get the axle out
that should just drop straight out even
though the caliper isn't loosened when I
before I put it back in on you to
straighten out or put some space in
between these two brake pads and I'll
show you how to do that
you can see there the tires just drop
straight down as soon as I took the axle
out it axles right there and then when I
was taking the axle out what I did is I
just put this wrench on this side and
twisted push down with it
as I was twisting on the other side with
the other wrench and that way was a head
you know either hand me the wrench doing
the opposite directions of each other it
loosened up pop it off so now I just
need to unwrap the chain from the tire
and I can take it straight to the the
guy who's going to switch out the tires
obviously the person who had it before
me wore it clear way past where I needed
to be changed we're going to get the
tire off the bike you have a few
different parts of the the tire so you
have this right there you have the gear
the sprocket and you have these little
rubber guys that we these are called
like the cush drive just make sure you
take all that stuff out you don't really
matter where they go there you go then
just make sure that whenever you set it
down you're not resting the rotor on the
ground I have it off a little bit so
it's not going to get bent in any way so
there you go go through the tyre switch
down bring it back so the caliper
actually comes up and off it's got that
little groove in there so when you put
the tire on you can lift it up put the
tyre in and then find that gap just kind
of slide it back into place and it
slides back on that groove
right there in the calipers these two
brake pads were kind of really close
together so I just put a screwdriver and
very gently kind of just twisted on my
bar very very gently and then I was able
to lift the tire up and into the between
them so the tire propped up with just a
rubber mallet right now getting ready to
put the excellent I just want to get all
the water off of it because it's raining
right now I'm supposed to get the water
off and rege resit I'll slide it through
into the other side and then tighten it
down then once you done with that I'll
adjust these to make the chain back to
the right tension again and all the
chain specifications are right there on
top all right got a greased tub just
have some height temperature just wheel
bearing grease just took a little towel
and just kind of put it on there's not
too thick otherwise it'll scrape all off
so you slide it inside the wheel so now
you can see the chain is pretty loose I
just get onto this and this up see it
kind of pull down away from the bike
too tight
it's got good so it's just the chain
needs to be tight enough so a little bit
of play in it and you're good to go and
then match the other side up with these
lines there you go and that's how you
install the back wheel on a on a
motorcycle the 600 f4i so if you have
any questions make sure leave in the
comments also after you drive it around
for a little bit you know 1020 miles
come back and make sure everything is
still tightened up so you're not going
to you know have any problems down the
road anyway I put a videos you know
about every week with motorcycles jeeps
all different kinds of repairs and stuff
so don't forget to subscribe thanks
