how to replace just the glass on your
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and your Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 I'm going to try it
actually with the piece of string that
ended up not working out too well you
can do it without taking apart the phone
I ended up taking mine apart just
because it is a little bit easier to get
the glass away from the LCD itself what
I'm going to do right now is I'm going
to take my heat gun and just gently heat
up my phone for about two to four
minutes some people say that you can do
this with the blow-dryer just like your
regular hairdryer I found that the
hairdryer doesn't heat up enough to melt
the glue between the glass layer and the
digitizer layer so I have the heat gun
they're pretty cheap I'll put a link in
the video description below if you need
to buy one you want to get the screen
too hot to touch that way you know that
the glue is liquid between the two
layers I'm just going to take my razor
and kind of slide it in between the
glass layer and the digitizer it's right
below the colored part of the lens and
this is where I try to take a string and
kind of slide it in and just pull it
through to kind of separate the glass
and it was good in theory the string
ended up melting so I guess if you can
find a stringer super thin wire you
might be able to put it in between just
pull it down and separate the layers but
in my opinion the prying it up with
razor blades works out a little bit
better so as you can see I've taken two
razor blades and kind of dug at the
corners a little bit to get it started
and I'm lifting out very very gently
along the edges super slow and then I'm
going to heat it up a little bit move it
another couple centimeters heat it up
some more move another couple
centimeters just a little bit but a
little bit you can see the glue just
kind of melting away on the inside I'm
going to put a link right here for
another video I made for three common
mistakes that people make when trying to
separate the glass from their phones and
it will talk about not heating the glass
up too much because you can burn the LCD
underneath
so you just want to put it on for you
know 30 seconds warm it up till it's too
out to touch anymore slide your razor
blades or your pry tools down a little
bit and just kind of continue that same
process I normally don't recommend that
people try to separate the glass from
their phone just because the success
rate is so low but it definitely is
still possible as long as you go super
slow and don't put any any pressure on
the digitizer underneath the whole
process took me about 45 minutes from
start to end so I would set aside you
know a good 45 minutes to an hour and
make sure not to rush anything you
always want to start at the top of the
screen as well just because there's the
buttons down at the bottom of the screen
that will rip if you start prying down
there so make sure you start up by the
earpiece you can see that I've lifted it
up in a way and now you can see that the
buttons are down there at the bottom I'm
taking care not to lift it too far away
from the phone so I don't rip any of the
cables down there if you do rip a cable
just send me a message and I can see if
I can find a replacement part for you
you can contact me on Facebook or just
leave a comment down in the bottom and
now I'm just prying the buttons away
from the screen themselves and now I'm
just going to clean up a little bit you
can leave the home button off for now
just make sure you reapply it before you
put the top screen back on so I need to
get rid of all the rest of the glue from
the phone as well as pull off the
earpiece from the old screen and the
home button bracket from the old screen
as well so just kind of pull that out
and away and now I'm going to finish
cleaning up the glue from the phone it's
actually a pretty big pain the glass
digitizers which is what is right above
the LCD right now is super super fragile
it's about the same thickness and
fragility as an egg so when brushing at
it remember that any force that would
break an egg is the same amount of force
that would break this digitizer it's
super fragile so I tried heating it up a
little bit to melt the remain
glue to see if I could pull it away that
way it ended up not working out too well
the best method that I found is just
getting a little bit of Windex on a
white glint free cloth and just rubbing
very gently at the glue and it'll
eventually just rub away now if anybody
else has any better ways of getting rid
of the glue on the phone please message
me or leave a comment below so we can
share it with the rest of the world
cleaning off the glue took about just as
much time as separating a glass from the
digitizer now if you've gotten this far
it's pretty impressive the hardest part
is over so there's three layers to the
screen you have the outer layer which is
the hard glass which protects the phone
the layer right below it which is the
digitizer and this is what senses your
fingers going on the screen and then the
lower layer right below the digitizer is
the LCD which is what you see on the
screen if your phone does not work if
the touch part of your phone does not
work or if you cannot see anything on
the phone because the LCD is broken then
replacing just the glass will not work
in order to replace just the glass and
be successful your phone has to be
visible and recognize your touches
that's when you can replace just the
glass now I'm taking my double-sided
sticky tape I'll put a link in the video
description below to where you can buy
this it's pretty cheap just a couple
bucks and I'm basically going to make a
sticky frame around the edge of the
phone as well as around the LCD itself
that way no dust can get inside between
the glass and the digitizer so make sure
that when you put the sticky tape in a
square around the LCD itself that
there's no way that dust can slip inside
so make sure it's completely sealed off
also make sure not to cover up any of
the light sensors the proximity sensors
or is that camera up at the top of the
phone taking the double-sided tape and
just making my little fortress around
the edges here if you have any problems
you can always message me for help you
can find me on Facebook or on Twitter at
Zacks jerry-rigged Google+ as well as
Facebook I'll put link
at the end of the videos for all of that
stuff you can click on the bottom left
corner to head to my website alright so
right here you can see that the earpiece
is already in place
and I pulled off the bottom protective
layer on the glass and I'm just lining
it up along the edge of the foam and I'm
leaving the bottom up just a little bit
so I can reline that home button now you
can see that I've messed up a little bit
here I forgot to put in the metal
bracket for the home button that we took
off of the old screen so what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to pry up the
screen a little bit again slide that
bracket in and then put it back down
again so save yourself a step remember
to put that bracket in beforehand and
you can see that everything's good if
you need a link to see how to put your
phone back together again go ahead and
click that if you decided not take your
phone apart you'll find you should be
good to go now make sure to get a case
on this thing try not to drop it and you
can see that everything works out great
if you have any questions make sure to
leave in the comments below don't forget
to like if this video helped you and the
best thing that you can do for me is to
subscribe to my youtube channel and
don't forget about Facebook Google+ or
Twitter I hope to see you around thanks
