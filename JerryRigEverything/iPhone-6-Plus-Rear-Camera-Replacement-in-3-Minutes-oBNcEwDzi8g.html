replace the rear camera and your iPhone
six-plus if you want to see any of the
other repair videos go ahead and click
the links in the front of this video
here's your iPhone six-plus to get to
the camera we have to go through the
screen so grab your pentalobe
screwdriver if you need any tools or
parts for this project it can be found
in the video description below once the
bottom two screws are out put your
suction cup on the screen lift up a
little bit and that allow your pry tool
to slip in make sure you pry up only on
the frame of the screen and the frame of
the phone so you don't bend the screen
at all you don't want to break it as
you're attempting this project the
screens are pretty fragile so be very
careful as you're lifting it up don't
bend it past ninety degrees otherwise
you'll put too much stress on the ribbon
cables that are underneath this metal
bracket take out the five screws and
then remove the metal bracket and then
each of these little ribbon cables
there's four of them they're going to
unsnap like a little Lego piece
just put your little pry tool underneath
the edge and lift up be careful not to
bend them or anything and that releases
the screen so you can see where the
earpiece and the home button and
everything else is there's two screws on
the side of the camera remove those then
lift up the little connector right here
just like the screen head remove the top
metal bracket and the camera comes loose
from the phone itself these will also be
linked down in the video description
below you ever need to buy a Muser
they're pretty cheap watch out for this
little ribbon cable right here it's a
little grounding cable be very careful
not to rip it as you're pulling out the
camera or off the metal bracket pop the
camera back in place secure that little
ribbon cable put the bracket back on top
and get those two screws back in this
video is great if your camera ever stops
working or if you ever have specks in it
or dust in it you can take it out
replace it you can clean it out videos
great for all that kinds of stuff now
we're going to get the screen place back
on each of these little connections need
to be very securely so make sure they're
over the top of the connection and then
press down you'll feel it kind of snap
into place if you put your screen back
down and there's lines running through
it that means there's one of these
connections is not placed on as well as
it should be so after they're all on
once you can turn your phone on to test
for lines without actually closing it
all the way like I'm doing here this
screen looks perfect there's no lines or
anything in it so I'm going to turn back
off the phone because you don't want to
be messing with it while it's on and
then I can screw down this metal plate
over the connections anyway now we're
going to line up the the top of the
screen with the frame of the phone and
that's going to slide into place and
then I can go let down along the edge of
the phone and snap that into place as
well make sure not to use too much
pressure or you can crack your screen
while you're doing this so be super
super careful once it's all back into
place you can turn your phone on and get
those bottom two screws into place the
same pentalobe screws that you took out
anyway thanks a ton for watching I have
a lot of fun making these videos the
