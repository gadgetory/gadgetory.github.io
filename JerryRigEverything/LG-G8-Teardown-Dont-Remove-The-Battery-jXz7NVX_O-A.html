I'll still be taking apart a pretty averagely
built smartphone, but I'll be talking about
something that's pretty important revolving
around the way LG installed their battery.
Even when turning the phone on, we find a
warning talking about how we shouldn't ever
remove this battery because it's a safety
hazard.
Repairing cellphones is not normally a safety
hazard, so if it is a safety hazard, it's
LG's own fault and I've got some words to
say to LG about that.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
Taking apart the phone is normal enough.
Everything is glued shut like we see on most
flagship smartphones, which just for the record,
I'm fine with.
It helps with waterproofing and looks pretty
sleek.
Not a big deal.
A professional can still get inside the phone
in about 10 minutes, and even an average person,
with a few cheap and simple tools (which I'll
link in the description), can also open up
their own phone.
It's safe...assuming you don't cut yourself
of course.
The heat gun softens the adhesive, and a large
suction cup helps release the pressure on
the glass so I can slice through the adhesive
underneath.
LG has made each edge of the back glass have
it's own curve, which does complicate things
a little bit, but still, not a big deal.
And if the back glass does break, it's only
like $10 to replace.
The back panel, which doubles as a camera
lens, is finally removed, revealing the fingerprint
and scanning hardware that rests up against
the motherboard's gold contact points.
Pretty normal so far.
We can see the cameras and the one way wireless
charging coil.
And, lucky for us, only 14 normal Phillips
head screws are holding everything in place.
If you've been watching my channel for a while,
you probably know this is a pretty typical
smartphone tear down so far.
The wireless charging pad comes off with the
top plastics.
Taking apart the G8 might even be a bit easier
than normal since the screws aren't proprietary.
The bottom plastics have the loudspeaker attached
with the waterproofing mesh over the speaker
opening.
The problem that I have with the LG G8 is
this: the battery - not because there are
no dogs allowed, bu because the battery is
the one dangerous component inside the phone,
and LG used permanent adhesive to hold down
this battery.
There are a lot of safe ways to secure batteries.
Static pull tabs, like we've seen inside the
OnePlus phones, or magic pull tabs, like all
the iPhones have.
Or even gentle adhesive like the HTC phones
– those can be removed by hand.
Permanent adhesive is dangerous and stupid.
Bending batteries during the removal can crush
the anode and cathode layers together, causing
a short, or sparks, or even explosions like
we saw with the Samsung Note 7 and the subsequent
recall.
Accidental punctures can do the same thing.
LG has put anyone who tries to repair their
own phone at risk by using this much permanent
adhesive...which is probably why they added
that disclaimer when turning on the phone.
It's their way of decreasing liability while
still making their phones difficult to repair.
Planned obsolescence isn't cool.
Even if you take very good care of your phone,
battery lifespan decreases a lot after the
first year.
My own Galaxy S8 Plus that I've owned for
over two years now needs to be charged up
almost twice a day.
It's ready for a new battery because batteries
don't last forever.
People who want to save money can save a ton
just by getting a new $20 battery replacement.
Plus, it's better for the environment to reuse
a phone than it is to buy a new one.
Even alcohol, which sometimes is used to soften
adhesive, is not working on LG's battery.
Yeah, heat might help a bit, but heating a
battery is also super dangerous.
LG has intentionally and dangerously made
their batteries very difficult to remove.
Basically what I'm saying is, if you're on
the fence deciding between this phone and
another phone, skip the LG G8.
From now on, if a smartphone has a permanently
glued in battery with no pull tabs, it's getting
a veto from me no matter how cool it is.
Battery replacements should not be dangerous.
Safe pull tabs cost pennies to manufacture,
and are just as easy to add underneath the
battery as permanent adhesive is.
There's no reason why pull tabs aren't installed
on every phone.
Alright, now that we got that out of the way,
let's see what else LG has to offer.
There is one screw holding down the headphone
jack.
The headphone jack is something I do like.
It has a little rubber lip to help keep a
tight, water resistant seal around the edge.
The LG G8 is ip68.
I'll disconnect the screen, the front facing
camera, and the front facing 3D time-of-flight
camera.
And I'll remove the dual slotted SIM and SD
card tray.
LG has done a lot of things right on this
phone, don't get me wrong, I'm just saying
unsafe battery installations need to stop.
The charging port is attached to the underside
of the main board.
So all the circuit boards will still come
out together at the same time.
And take a look at that.
Remember in the durability test where I assumed
the front earpiece was just a vibrator?
Well, I was wrong.
That massive rectangle there in the center
is LG's crystal sound OLED speaker.
It's what causes sound to emanate from the
top half of the phone, instead of having a
traditional speaker up top.
I'll dig more into it in a second.
First, let's get those cameras out.
The larger time-of-flight camera is on the
left with it's googly-eyed sensors.
A TOF camera is a range imaging camera system
that sends out light pulses and then the camera's
sensor measures the return time of each pulse,
mapping things in 3D.
This allows for those accurate hand gestures
and stuff.
The other little camera is an 8 megapixel
normal selfie taker.
Now let's see what we can do with this large
rectangle.
I'm not an expert on sound behind screen technology,
but LG has been using these little rectangular
exciters behind the panels in their TVs for
quite a while now.
So it's cool to see the technology bleed over
into the mobile cellphone world.
The exciter is held super tightly behind the
display with some foamy adhesive.
I was worried about breaking the display at
first, but it looks like there is a metal
layer between the exciter and the AMOLED.
I'm assuming this uses small electromagnets
to vibrate and project sound through the display
using the screen as a diaphragm.
It'll be interesting to see if these become
more common in the future.
LG has included a heat pipe inside the flagship
G8.
This helps dissipate heat coming off of the
Qualcomm 855.
Slicing open the pipe, we can see the liquid
quickly evaporate out of the copper.
LG is using the same style of pipe that we
saw in the Galaxy S10 with the kind of dirty
internals.
There's probably a reason for the dirt...I
just don't know what it is.
There is a triple camera setup on the phone.
If you're going to buy the G8 in the USA though,
it'll only come with 2 cameras....also, don't
know why, but that's just the way it is.
The main 12 megapixel camera does have OIS.
The 16 megapixel ultra-wide camera does not
have optical image stabilization.
And the third camera, which is not included
on USA models, is the 12 megapixel telephoto
camera, with 2x optical zoom.
The charging port is detachable and replaceable.
Thumbs up for that.
Having modular internals helps the device
stay alive longer.
And with phones, as good as they are nowadays,
there's really no reason to be upgrading every
year.
Overall, I'm pretty impressed with the LG
G8.
They've really stepped out of the box and
done some really awesome innovative things
that I definitely want to see more of in the
future.
Cellphones don't last forever though, so until
they make their batteries safe to remove with
pull tabs or softer adhesive, I'm not going
to recommend it.
If LG does add battery pull tabs to their
manufacturing process, I'll be sure to update
the description of this video and let you
know over on Twitter.
I'll get everything clipped back into place
and the plastics set where they should be,
with the glass panel set back on the phone,
and the SIM card tray installed.
Check that out – the whole thing still works.
Yeah, the battery got bent during removal
and could explode at any time now, but I'd
like to live life on the edge.
Hit the subscribe button if you haven't already,
and come hang out with me over on Instagram
and Twitter.
Thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.
[Female voice] Amazingly the speaker is still
working...even if it crackles.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
