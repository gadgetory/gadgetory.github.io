how to replace the volume mute and power
button flex cable for the iPhone 5 all
the parts and tools will be listed in
the video description below take out the
bottom two screws on the phone they're a
pentalobe screw and then most the time
you can use a suction cup to pull away
the screen from the rest of the body my
suction cup sucked its sucking so I'm
going to show you how to do it a
different way take a metal pry tool and
slip it between the frame and the screen
of your phone only pry up on the plastic
frame of the phone or else you will
crack your screen and destroy everything
so be very very careful with that
probably gently and then when you open
up your phone
don't open it past 90 degrees or else
you'll rip some ribbon cables which I'll
show you in a second take these three
screws out and then remove the metal
bracket and then these ribbon cables
right here just unclip like Legos and
there's three of them unsnap them all
and your screen can be removed from the
rest of the phone there's two screws
holding on your battery cable remove
that bracket and the most important
piece of advice I can give you during
this is keep organized make sure all of
your screws stay next to the brackets
that they came from and you know maybe
put them on a piece of paper and write
down where they came from as well so you
don't lose them the battery is a doozy
to get out the longer you've had your
phone the more time the glue has had to
stick it to the back of the phone so
it's getting pretty hard now that the
phones have been out for a while
I took my pry tool and just kind of slid
it underneath and pop the battery out
and then this is the part that we're
replacing it's very easy to unsnap from
the motherboard the only unfortunate
part is there's still a piece of it
underneath the motherboard so the
motherboard has to come out we're going
to start over here in the corner though
with the vibrating motor there are two
screws holding on a little bracket take
those screws out and then remove the
bracket once again stay organized keep
the screws next to the little holes that
they came out of I put mine on another
piece of paper and kind of label it
there's a screw holding the vibrator
itself into the top edge of the phone
and then this is the vibrator you can
see every time you get a text
message or a phone call this little guy
spins around alerting year that you have
a notification then there is another
screw holding down another little metal
bracket on the motherboard put that on
your little piece of paper and then the
flex cable for the charging port can
come undone as well as the little wire
cable for the cellular antenna pull
those out of your way and then there are
these two tiny little wire cables which
I'm still not exactly sure what they do
they seem kind of pointless because
they're going from the same board to the
same board
I guess Apple just ran out of room for
things actually on the board anyway five
screws holding on the motherboard and
then there's two screws up by the camera
bracket remove the camera bracket stay
organized keep those screws next to the
bracket itself and remove the SIM card
you can also do this before you take
apart your phone I would actually
recommend doing that then there are two
screws kind of grounding screws holding
the motherboard in place as well make
sure you undo those before you try to
move the motherboard or else you'll rip
them then the Wi-Fi antenna is actually
attached to the back of the motherboard
unclip that and the motherboard is free
to go
see both sides of it there and then the
Wi-Fi antenna is what I'm removing right
now there's a little metal bracket the
chest kind of sits on the back of the
phone I'm going to lift it up and then
I'm going to use my pry tool to kind of
get underneath it so I don't rip it just
going to separate the glue from the
actual ribbon cable itself
and pull it up away from the phone and
that's what it looks like pretty simple
little part then there are two screws
holding on another little bracket up by
the power cable get that little guy out
of your way and then there's one screw
holding the power button bracket close
to the top of the frame you can see that
it doesn't open up all the way because
our little ribbon cable that we're
replacing is in the way so basically
unpeel it from the back of the the power
button itself and then you can pull it
out from underneath the power button
door and there's also two little
brackets holding on the volume and the
mute buttons so take off those three
screws and then peel the buttons the
brackets re away from the edge of the
phone then you can lift up the actual
ribbon cable itself the little flex
cable that little part up that top there
is what controls the vibrating motor
pull those away from the edge of the
phone itself and then you have to pull
off the ribbon cable from the little
brackets remember the orientation of the
ribbon cable from the brackets as well
so you can put it back on the same way
that it came off you can see the buttons
right there and you can see how the
ribbon cable is stuck to the bracket
itself the mute button was a little bit
harder I ended up using a little razor
to kind of pop that out and away from
the metal bracket and then you can see
on the part of self that it has a bunch
of new little sticky tabs so you can use
those to stick it back to the metal
bracket put your phone back together
anyway if I helped you the best thing
you can do for me is just subscribe to
my channel I enjoy making videos and I
hope this video helped you thanks for
