internals of the galaxy s6 edge and kind
of give you a general idea of how
everything inside can be replaced
including the back of the phone the
camera the charging port the motherboard
all of the good stuff go and remove the
SIM card tray up at the top of the phone
with your SIM card removal tool all the
parts and tools for this project will be
linked in the video description below
now if the back of your phone is cracked
it's going to be a little bit harder to
remove it from the phone I'm going to go
ahead and heat it up with a blow-dryer
or a heat gun if your phone is not
cracked you can take a suction cup and
suction it to the glass and once it's
warm the adhesive will allow the back
glass to lift up a little bit from the
back of the phone and make the removable
back easier to remove now if your phone
is cracked like it is on my device
you're going to need to heat it up and
the suction cup won't stick to the back
because all the cracks allow air to get
underneath the suction cup so you take a
little metal pry tool and kind of slip
it between the metal frame of the phone
and the glass back you want to be really
careful while you're doing this you
don't crack the back even more and just
kind of slide the tool around the edge
of the phone to kind of cut through the
adhesive that's holding it to the device
and you'll get a better understanding of
how it's held down once you see what's
underneath
once I've initiated the cutting with the
metal pry tool I use a playing card
which is a little bit thinner and
doesn't stretch the glass as much as the
metal tool does ends up being a little
bit easier in the long run once the
glass is mostly up I can cut through the
last remaining adhesive with the card
and pull the glass up away from the
device so the things you want to watch
out for is that black Qi charger
underneath the glass if you cut through
that then it'll stop working and you
won't be able to Qi charge your phone
anymore here's the broken back I'm just
going to discard this as the replacement
backs are pretty cheap I'm going to run
you through a camera lens replacement
really quick down at the bottom there's
little groove that you can slip your
tweezers through or just any kind of
metal pry tool you can lift up the lens
if your lens has ever scratched or
cracked you can replace it fairly easily
these are pretty cheap on Amazon I will
link these in the video description
below as well pretty straightforward
with a replacement you just pull off the
adhesive from the back glass and push it
down and
side of the little metal frame making
sure that you never ever touch the
inside of the glass you don't want to
leave any fingerprints or smudges or
dust on the inside of the lens if there
is any debris under here your camera
will not focus once you get the new lens
installed so be super careful and make
sure that it's clean once the glass lens
is in place on the little metal bracket
you can just press it down and then when
you get your new back installed on the
phone it will hold it on to the mid
frame so you don't need to really worry
about adhesive on the camera itself grab
a screwdriver and there's 13 screws
holding down the frame to the frame of
the screen once you get those screws out
lift off the Qi charging pad and then
you can press against the back of the
phone and push it out of the mid frame
pretty straightforward I would recommend
pressing up at the top of the phone you
can do the bottom but it does kind of
get caught on the charging port as you
can see a little bit right there
once the mid frame is off you can see
the Qi charging pad the camera lens and
the buttons are kind of interesting
right here you can see if your power
button ever stops working you can remove
the button bracket and a little ribbon
cable it has just two little gold
contact points that attach to the
motherboard as the motherboard rests on
top of the button itself and you can
just put it right back inside of its
bracket and pin it into the frame and
all the buttons are pretty similar you
can see the volume rockers on the other
side as well so grab a plastic pry tool
we're going to disconnect all these
little ribbon cables some people call
them waffle connectors from the
motherboard of the phone this one here
is the battery the one you saw
previously was the fingerprint scanner
this one's for the earpiece and
proximity sensor here we have the
front-facing camera and you're just
going to unsnap these from the
motherboard like little Legos here is
the LCD and digitizer and then down here
we have some wire cable connectors and
these ones just unsnap from the
motherboard as well kind of pull those
out of your way and then you can lift
the motherboard up and away from the
plastic frame and then the bottom of it
is attached to the charging port ribbon
cable connector so once snap that like a
little Lego and you're good to go
here's the rear-facing camera
also has its own little ribbon cable
connector and it is also slightly glued
to the motherboard here's the rear
camera I'm going to push that back into
place and snap it back into the
motherboard all these parts are
replaceable now for the battery so
batteries go out pretty regularly on
these phones especially after you've had
it for a year or two and if you're going
to replace the battery and want to keep
the screen in one piece you know as and
not break the screen as you're removing
the battery it helps if you heat it up a
little bit and slide a thin metal tool
not a razor blade because it's a little
bit too thick between the battery and
the frame making sure not to push or
bend the screen at all or it will crack
you want also make sure not to puncture
the battery or it could you know start
on fire explode and we want to avoid
that if at all possible so now that
we've lifted the battery up out of the
phone we do have to remove the
motherboard in order to get at the
battery because it has that little black
lip up at the top here is the vibrator
motor we can lift that out as well so
this is where you get all your
notifications or if you know if your
phone's vibrating when it's ringing
this is what is causing that so there's
a little metal tab that is holding the
proximity sensor and the earpiece down
into the plastic frame and then down
here at the charging port there's two
screws that are holding it in place we
got one screw over here by the headphone
jack and then we have another screw over
here in the center of the board once
those two screws are out you can lift
the charging port away from the plastic
frame of the phone the charging port is
pretty interesting you know it has the
headphone jack the charging port it does
have the wire cable connectors on it you
can see in the center there you have the
home button where that presses down and
it has the two capacitive buttons on
either side of the device you have the
back button and the menu button you have
the fingerprint scanner ribbon cable
there the LCD cable and this is the
entire screen of the device right here
you can see it has the LCD the digitizer
and the black plastic frame that holds
it all together and I would strongly
strongly recommend that if this is the
part that you replace if your screen is
broken
some people may attempt a glass only
repair but I you know would bet that
that's pretty impossible with this phone
so I will link the entire screen
replacement in the video description
below you can grab that
if your screen is broken now to put the
phone back together again you saw me put
the charging port back into place with
the two screws here's the vibrator motor
as well as the front facing camera the
earpiece proximity sensor make sure to
get that little top of it pinned down in
the slot that's in the plastic frame
well here's one more part so this is a
little microphone that's attached to the
top of the phone with this little waffle
connector a little Lego piece so you can
just clip back into place there I like
Samsung because most of their parts are
modular and can be replaced on a whim if
you need to so here is the charging port
and how it connects back to the
motherboard I find that it's easiest to
put it in place while it's lifted up
like that and you can just set the
motherboard down into the frame take the
battery and slide it underneath the
motherboard remember that black plastic
lip that's up there at the top
definitely needs to be below the
motherboard and just clip it back into
place
snapping it down like a little Lego
piece here is the fingerprint scanner
ribbon cable that I'm also going to clip
down up here the earpiece and the
proximity sensor gets clipped to the
motherboard and the LCD cable right
there and then these are little wire
ribbon cables that need to be clipped
down into place as well
remember not to push so hard that you
bend them like it will you know snap in
and you'll feel it just make sure not to
put too much pressure and damaging the
connections because that will make it
harder later on make sure that the
ribbon cable is also fed into the little
grooves that it's designed for it
otherwise the back you know a mid frame
of the phone will not sit into place
like it is right here I slide the
charging port in first and then get
those 13 screws back into place pretty
straightforward and here are the
replacement backs I will link these in
the video description as well they are
tempered glass I believe they are pretty
scratch resistant and they do have the
pre-installed adhesive on the back so
you don't have to buy extra adhesive to
put on to the onto the phone so it makes
it a lot easier when you're doing these
kind of replacements it does not have
the IMEI or the information of the
device on the back as like the original
one does though I am going to put a blue
back on a white phone just because it's
the only one I have at the moment and
just pressing it down into place peel
off the protection and you can see that
it fits exactly
like the original does it doesn't stick
up too far and matches exactly along
with the edge of the device making sure
everything still works on the phone and
I'm just going to test out how
scratch-resistant it is just because
that's what I do
grab my razor blade scratch it right
along the logo and it looks like we're
good to go
there are zero scratches on the back of
the device so I'm pretty impressed with
it anyway I did do a durability test
with the galaxy s6 edge I will link that
video here at the end of this one if you
have any questions leave in the comments
don't forget to like if this video
helped you and don't forget subscribe it
does help me out thanks a ton for
watching hope see you around
