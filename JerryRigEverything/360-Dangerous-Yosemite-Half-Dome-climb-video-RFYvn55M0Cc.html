we're going to hike the Half Dome today
and I'm going to take you along with us
go ahead and take a look around if
you're on a computer you can use your
mouse to scroll back and forth you can
also if you're on your phone you can
tilt it up and down and see the whole
360 make sure you adjust your video
settings so that it's full quality and
then you can see farther into the
distance we're gonna have breakfast here
I got some Oreos and I had some eggs and
bacon hey Steve how long is the hike
today true $5 foot ovation did nice no
Reeko no big deal
hope you enjoy thanks for coming along
we just hiked up this trail down there
and it's totally misty all the way from
the Falls right here on the other side
of me
Steve tell us how far we've hiked fight
about 3.8 miles
began about 3,000 feet of elevation
we're just making up those numbers or is
that exactly what we're doing
that's exactly I've actually track you
how much you could write but we just had
to get from the top of that over there
so that's us hi that's us in about three
hours but if you look up you're gonna
see some dark clouds there hopefully
those don't meet up with us later
yeah you guys are you know make your own
decision if you wanna if you want to
continue up obviously lightning you're
up above the trees on a granite dome
they collect conducts electricity
there's the cables they conduct
electricity yeah um and it's also very
slick going down if it does rain if you
get up there at the top and search
raining and you come down and sweat I've
seen people almost leave it coming down
so something to evaluate you know you're
a little you have a little ways to go
before you get above the treeline you
might kind of wait out see you to think
use your best judgment okay so you guys
have a permit oh we only permit now and
he is the heaven-sent one right well
right instant yeah you know just use
your best judgement so we have Half Dome
right here and the Rangers said that we
should turn back because there's been
too many lightning storms and thunder
and stuff like that and you can see kind
of the clouds in the distance a little
bit of clouds over there around the half
don't peek but we're going to wait it
out for a second and see if the clouds
will pass and see if we can get up the
ropes
we'll see what happens how's it going so
far stable getting good to climb up to
the top and avoid these lightning
strikes how far we hike so far we're
probably about
six six miles six months on the game
about 4,000 feet elevation
whoo I got some rocking sway my eyes I
feel your pain I feel a pang did I saw
lightning right there a to do restrict
climbing the stairs in Wardour back
there over the hills camera was on -
maybe you've got it over that rainfall
yeah we gotta get up there
we got half dumb hair storms on the
other side
storms over there storms over there
we're gonna do this we got to do it
quick you can see the cables running up
the side of the mountain over there got
to use those to get to the top here we
go got our rubber gloves on
hey you guys doing
cables are gnarly there's rain right
there do this is a stupid decision
probably alright more stupider decisions
come up here in a rainstorm as as far as
I'm going
this is what over the edge looks like at
the Half Dome getting nervous
thanks a ton for watching for coming
with me on this slightly insane is
stupid journey I get off this mountain
before I get struck by lightning because
the cables metal is it just an overall
very poor decision when today we made it
to the top I'm open against that score
look at it toss one by the camera like
there already are pretty bad you should
have seen the ones in that brand cap
there's actually sign like can't even a
squirrels and it's like do not eat the
wildlife they are already know be for a
green kind canyon they're like so fast
it's hilarious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
