on a 91 Jeep Wrangler this will work for
any of the Y J's so we have the wheel
already taken off the car jacked up you
can see the shocks are right there you
got the bolts on the top bolts on the
bottom these ones are just rusted out so
we're going to we're going to switch
them so as I'm trying to take off the
top told it's a 14 millimeter and as I
spin it and see at the top butter shock
is spinning as well so what I do is I
just grab Berenices alright so we're
just going to throw away the shocks
anyway I'm just going to grab on to the
bar like that with a pair of channel
locks and then keep on twisting that
wrench I'm cool thing I like about this
wrench is one of my favorite tools is
that it's got a little ratchet head in
there so I get out to keep on adjusting
it just always spins on its own I'll put
a link down the bottom of the video so
you guys can see a how much they cost
that's I got them off Amazon
they're pretty solid little tools anyway
so I'm just gonna get rid of that bolt
okay so when you're installing the new
shocks just put the bolt through the
bottom there I'm using the shocks
compound in some kind of way obviously
don't stretch out it's easier your ship
and stuff I put the rubber washer in the
middle washer on it and I always have to
extend it up into the end of the housing
there so I'm going to do I'm going to
cut that and it will extend on its own
I just have to kind of guide it in there
a lot easier with two hands I'll tell
you that
and then by its own means it'll go right
up into the top there then I'll put the
other little washer on top with little
groove there so we'll go down inside the
middle housing and then then that goes
on top of that just once I tighten it
all down that's how you install the
shops
all right so in shocks come with a kind
of metal sleeve that goes over the metal
part of it so dust and water and stuff
doesn't go down inside of that it is
kind of a good idea to have them they're
not super super important but you know
it's worth that you can get in for disco
bucks on Amazon I'll put a link in the
description so you can get some of those
if that's what you want um I think it's
it the bottom nut on that shop was a
nineteen millimeter by the way and you
have any questions even in the comments
if you like what you see make sure to
give it a like and don't forget to
