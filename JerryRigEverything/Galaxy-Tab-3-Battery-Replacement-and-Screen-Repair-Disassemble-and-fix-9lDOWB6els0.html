how to take apart the Galaxy Tab 3 this
is the little 7 inch version first
you're going to take your non-marking
pry tool and just kind of pry between
the edge of the screen and the plastic
around the outside the whole process
will take about a minute there's a bunch
of little clasps that you're trying to
separate as you go around the edge
I'm not going to speed it up so you can
see exactly what I'm doing as I go
around the outside every single part for
this phone or this tablet I'm going to
link in the video description so you can
if you ever find replacing any of the
headphone jacks or speakers or screens
you can find all the parts listed below
pretty easily anyway so I'm just
finishing with the last couple clasps
right now and you can see the screen
will separate from the body right about
here and you just kind of pull the back
off and then you see these four screws
and these four screws hold the battery
into the tablet they're a Phillips head
so once you get those screws out take
your little pry tool and kind of lift up
on the little connector down below be
really careful with this and don't pull
away from the motherboard because I've
seen that connector come loose before so
be very gentle and pulling the battery
out battery has a little plastic frame
around it so when you're buying the
replacement it probably won't come with
that frame just take off those little
stickers and then you'll be able to
reapply the frame to the new battery
here's all the screws for the
motherboard all Phillips head and all
the same size you'll need to worry about
where the screws actually go so get rid
of those and here's the ribbon cable
connectors just pop them up and off
they're kind of like Legos the clasp on
and off just pry each one of those up
that's the headphone jack and those are
the buttons along the side and then the
motherboard comes up and away from the
tablet there's the headphone jack
there's two screws holding that in so if
your headphone jack is fuzzy or if it
stopped working or if there's something
stuck down inside of it you just want to
replace it just take those two screws
out and this is all that it is
once again the parts are listed in the
video description below here is the 3
megapixel rear camera tiny little guy
and then these are the speakers that are
going along the bottom of the phone
that's dual speakers and conveniently
these little ribbon cables are very
fragile but a Samsung left a little
groove underneath each one of them you
can see me taking my little wire my
tweezers right here and kind of finding
that groove and you can use like a pin
or a needle or anything else to slip it
under there and you can see the
double-sided sticky tape right there so
have you really careful damage those
ribbon cables and then these speakers
just come up and away from the device
this one has a little clasp long wire
right hand side so it's a little bit
harder to pull away now I found this
part to be pretty interesting is a
plastic bracket up along the top you can
just kind of pull away from the top of
the tablet and it holds in the camera
the front camera and the LED for the
flash or the light sensor and you can
see right next to the camera and the LED
that there is a slot for a speaker so it
makes me think that when Samsung was
designing this they had you know an
option was to make it as a phone instead
of a tablet so I found that very
interesting the frame is a built-in
speaker spot anyway clip the black
plastic piece back down into place
and that will hold the front camera LED
and now this is the screen I'm not this
is the whole whole screen right here I'm
not going to show you how to separate
the glass in the LED mostly because that
takes forever and the success rate is
very low but if you have a heat gun and
a kind of a pry tool a separator you can
probably get the two apart I just
remember play seing the whole thing as a
unit has a much higher success rate
anyway just let me replace the headphone
jack and the rear camera just putting
those back into place and I'm also
snapping the bottom speakers into place
making sure that the ribbon cables are
in there the spots they were designed
for so they'll reconnect again with the
motherboard getting the one screw in for
that speaker on the left side now the
motherboard make sure the ribbon cables
are you know above the motherboard when
you put it in so you can clasp them down
into place and then here's the screw
layout once again all seven screws grab
the battery with the plastic bracket get
it into place then you have those four
screws around the outside as well and
then clip the battery connector back in
just kind of like a Lego and then run
your hand around and make sure all of
your little connectors are pressed down
and snapped into place you'll have to
worry about that later
you have to pry the screen up out of the
frame game you'll hear a series of
satisfying clicks as you press the
screen back into the frame and that is
it if you have any questions make sure
to leave them in the comments below
