budget smartphone from the company
oneplus I initially wasn't going to make
a durability video for this phone
because I didn't think would be fair to
compare a 250 dollar budget phone
alongside $700 flagship devices by
between the YouTube comments and my
Twitter followers I was convinced to
give it a shot and I'm glad I did let's
start with the scratch test if you've
seen my other videos you are familiar
with Mohs scale of hardness and the pics
that I have that let me know what level
of hardness the glass has the oneplus X
is rocking Gorilla Glass 3 it also has a
screen protector included and
pre-installed on the phone I forgot
about this minor detail and was very
surprised when the screen started
scratching at a level 4 but let's remove
that plastic screen protector and try
the test again you can see that my picks
leave no mark up until level 6 6 left a
minor scratch and 7 left a much deeper
groove this is exactly on par with other
smartphones that have Gorilla Glass 4
like the Nexus 6p and the blackberry
proof a razor blade could do a little
bit of damage but you'll have no problem
with keys or coins scratching your
screen the back is made of the same
exact material and scratches on the same
level as the front glass a small scratch
at level 6 and a larger scratch at level
7 so far the phone is doing pretty well
while we are scratching things let's
scuff up the camera lens the camera lens
is independent of the back glass panel
you can see it move around inside its
little circles I scratch it with my
razor blade the lens is scratch
resistant which is awesome a scratched
up camera lens would absolutely ruin
picture quality props to oneplus for
protecting their camera the 700 block
very privileged thumbs up if you like
taking clear pictures let's move on to
the extreme heat test I've tested 10
different phones now with this lighter
and every single phone has survived
unscathed except the Nexus 6p the Nexus
6p pixels turned white and never
recovered the same thing is now
happening to the oneplus X the AMOLED
pixels turn white and never recover this
particular background hides the damage
pretty well so let me switch it to a
plain black background so you can see
the permanent damage now I'm not going
to say that the Nexus 6p used a budget
AMOLED screen but I will say that the 6p
screen is very comparable to the budget
AMOLED screen of the oneplus X but let's
be honest don't start a fire on top of
your device and you'll be just fine the
metal sides of the oneplus X feel very
good in your hands it is relatively soft
though so be careful when your phone is
around razor blades and keys onto the
bin test I'll be honest I was
100% expecting this phone to break but
after the initial flex it locks out and
will not let the phone bend any farther
there are no weak points if you'll watch
my teardown of the oneplus X you'll see
that each section of the phone like the
motherboard and battery and charging
port all have their own little
compartment inside of the metal frame
which allows the front glass motherboard
and battery to all add structural
integrity to the phone making it
unbendable I am very impressed with this
device it is awesome that such an
inexpensive phone can be more durable
than a device that cost two or three
times as much thanks for talking me into
testing this device follow me on Twitter
