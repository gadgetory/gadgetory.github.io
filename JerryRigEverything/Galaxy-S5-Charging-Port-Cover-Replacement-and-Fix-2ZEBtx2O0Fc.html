replace the little protector thing over
the charging port on your Galaxy s5
whether you don't like the protector you
just want to remove it or you've broken
it and need to replace it with a new one
this video is for you don't mind the
broken screen I'm going to use this same
phone to make a glass only screen repair
video and you can click here if you want
to watch that start by popping off the
back cover it doesn't matter whether or
not you remove the battery as you are
not working with anything electrical at
the moment grab your screwdriver the
tools and replacement parts I'm going to
list in the video description below so
check that out if you need the tools and
pop out the little Phillips head screw
you can lift up the little plastic part
right at the bottom of the phone and
it's also going to be held in place by
some black tape try to keep this in the
little hole to help with the water
resistance later on now you can see how
the little protector fits in place I'll
try to find a dealer for these so if you
break one you can find a replacement
easily look in the video description
below for those now to reinstall it all
you have to do is take the little rubber
end put it back in the slot where it
came from
take the top plastic piece put it on
screw it in and you're good to go if you
have any questions be sure to ask me in
the comments below like this video if it
helped you and don't forget to subscribe
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
