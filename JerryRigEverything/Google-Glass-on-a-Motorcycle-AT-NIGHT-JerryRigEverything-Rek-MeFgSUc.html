Google glass on a motorcycle if you want
to see the daylight version go ahead and
click the link in the upper left corner
one thing you have to know while
watching this video is that while the
glass is inside my helmet all of its
light is reflecting off the inside of my
visor to understand better let's take a
look at how the Google glass is built
the main display light emits from the
black portion here and most of the light
is focused onto your eye through an
angled display but since the glass
itself is clear there is still light
escaping from every side it does get a
little distracting at night and I did
not notice this as I was making my
daytime video back on the motorcycle
again the glass can be controlled by
voice commands which is pretty cool you
can start stop and change directions
whenever you want the glass is always
listening to your commands one cool
command is that you can see a round
overview at any point this pulls back
from the normal navigation it shows you
a top-down display of your route that
you are traveling which is pretty useful
when traveling in a new area as you can
see the display is much more prominent
at night than it is during the day
partly because the display itself is so
bright there is no outside light to
shine through the other side of the
glass which would help it become more
translucent it is not a see-through at
night as it is during the day keep in
mind that this is not a direct recording
at the Google glass itself this video
took several cameras in a screencast to
my note 3 to make a realistic rendition
of how this glass actually works also
keep in mind that the human vision will
extend slightly past the edges of what
this YouTube video portrays as I was
driving around there was a few things
going through my mind first of which was
how dangerous this was a second of which
was why there was so much light
reflecting off the inside of my visor I
explained part of the problem at the
beginning of the video but north another
source of light caught me off guard take
a look at this lamp the light shines
into the edge of the crystal and on the
edge of the crystal is in front of your
eye so even though the streetlight isn't
in front of you the reflection or the
refraction still manages to get in your
way I did not notice this effect as I
was driving around during the daytime
anyway on a scale of things that I want
to do every night riding a motorcycle
with Google glass ranks at about a
negative 7 don't get me wrong the Google
glass is a fantastic piece of hardware
it has a lot of potential and other
aspects
but from a motorcycle navigation
perspective it is not a good match the
dangers of Google glass outweigh the
positives with the extra light
reflecting off the inside of my helmet
the screen blocking my blind spot and
the general distraction of having a
bright light shining in your eyes I
don't recommend using the glass while
riding not to mention the current price
tag 1500 bucks is a little steep for a
GPS but that price is bound to drop as
soon as the glass is officially released
I will put a link in the video
description below for current Amazon
pricing so check that out anyway thanks
