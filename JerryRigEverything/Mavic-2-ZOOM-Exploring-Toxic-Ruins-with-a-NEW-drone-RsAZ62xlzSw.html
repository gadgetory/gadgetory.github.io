middle of nowhere we are reviewing one
of the two drones that DJI has released
today this is the Mavic to zoom drone
and behind me is the ruins of a tent
tech standard reduction mill which has
been off-limits to the public for the
last 15 years it was built in the 1920s
about a hundred years ago and the only
way to get close to it without
trespassing is with one of these with
the zoom feature on this drone we can
get pretty up close and personal let's
get started alright so this is the
maverick to zoom and there's a couple
major differences between this and the
previous Mavic one my favorite is that
it actually has sensors on every single
side sensors on the side sensors on the
front and sensors on the back so no
matter what direction you're flying this
thing it's going to be pretty hard to
wreck not impossible to wreck but much
harder than the previous Mavic and the
other DJI drones
while these ruins might look like a
colorful graffiti gangster castle it was
actually built around 1920 about a
hundred years ago to refine or or is a
special type of rock that contains many
type of valuable elements like gold
copper silver and lead if you can
extract those elements from the ore you
get instant money it was built into the
side of a hill because gravity would
help flow the ore from the beginning of
the process all the way down to the end
after the precious metals were extracted
unfortunately this mill only lasted
about five years partially because of an
antiquated extraction method called the
Augustine process one cool thing about
the DGI Xoom is that it's camera can
actually look up at the sky instead of
staying level with the horizon and it
doesn't catch any of the propellers
while filming it adds a whole new
dynamic to the camera one cool trick you
can do with a drone that has a two times
optical zoom lens is something called
perspective distortion when I'm flying
toward something or flying away from
something I can zoom in or zoom out at
the exact same time and make the
background and foreground have kind of
like a warp effect to it you can add
this in post sometimes but you lose
image quality where I'm doing it
directly out of the drone with the lens
itself I'm not losing any of that
quality with a crop the Augustine
process was an acid Brian leaching
process in which the ore was first
roasted with salt and then reached in a
strong brine solution and finally
precipitated with copper to recover the
silver each batch required about a
hundred and forty hours to run and the
recovery rate was pretty high about
eighty-five percent of the silver sixty
percent of the copper 32 percent of the
lead and seven percent of the gold was
able to be extracted from the ore the
reason the whole place is off limits
currently is because of the high levels
of lead and arsenic leftover in the mill
covering the landscape making it
relatively dangerous to humans and
trespassers and also because the
buildings are basically falling apart
you can see the metal reinforced rebar
popping out of the concrete in many
locations another problem was that it
didn't get enough quality or from the
nearby mine which shut down the whole
building five years after was
constructed
you can still see evidence of the water
tanks or bins the crushing rolls the
iron boxes and the leeching tanks it's a
pretty cool bit of history so with the
zoom drone you might be thinking to
yourself well it's probably easier to
spy on people which isn't the case at
all the drone is still relatively loud
while it's one of GG is quieter drones
there's no way this is sneaking up on
anybody so we have thematic to side by
side with the original Mavic we can see
some differences right off the bat we
have these side sensors in decide and
then rear sensors in the back which the
original Mavic does not have the
original Mavic is only equipped with
sensors in the front on both sides one
thing I do want to point out is the
gimbal construction of the two drones so
we can see this one right here there's
no extra like ribbon cables dangling
around anywhere but with this drone
every time that I would clamp in the
drone for transportation with this
little plastic piece I was always
worried about catching that little
ribbon cable right there in the side it
seems like a much more fragile design on
the original Mavic we're on the Mavic -
they fixed it I want to point out the
LED lights as well it's kinda hard to
see them in the Sun but this guy right
here is lit up red whereas on the Mavic
2 right here it's a different type of
LED lights but they're much brighter the
Maverick to remote remains pretty
unchanged compared to the Maverick one
we have the same directional joysticks
and antennas but over here on the
right-hand side is a switch where we can
switch between tripod mode which keeps
the drone stable during time lapses then
we have our positioning mode for normal
flight and then sport mode which turns
off some of the safety features and
allows the drone to go super fast the
top of the controller has the same
gimbal adjustment circle except for this
time with the Mavic - it can adjust all
the way up allowing the camera to look
at the sky while you're flying and then
the knob on the right is specific to the
zoom drone allowing it to zoom in and
zoom out onto
and objects which is pretty cool and one
of my favorite features of this
particular drone and there you have it
we got the full experience of exploring
it poisonous landscape with the safety
of a zoom drone I'm a pretty big fan
with all the safety features on the
sides back and front it definitely makes
it safer to fly which is important
because these things are an investment
I'll leave the current pricing and a
link down in the video description and
if you have any questions leave them
down in the comments thanks stump for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
