the beginning of this year I've had so
many requests for it everyone is curious
at the new Nokia smartphones have the
same nuke proof durability that the old
3310 said and well there's only one way
to find out I have tested the durability
of every major smartphone that gets
released over the last few years I think
I've tested about 60 different phones
now and it's Nokia's turn pulling it out
of the box it already has a heavy feel
to it which in my book is a good thing I
purchased the slick looking matte black
version as always we'll start with a
scratch test I have a set of most picks
that allow me to differentiate between
different materials plastic scratches at
a level 3 tempered glass scratches at a
5 or 6 and sapphire would be at an 8 or
a 9 the nokia 6 has advertised Gorilla
Glass 3 on the screen and it scratches
at a little 6 perfectly on par with
other flagship devices onto the
fingerprint scanner now this is pretty
sweet it's not a button just a pad but
it's totally scratch proof my razor
inflicts no damage to the scanner there
are only a few other phones with durable
fingerprint scanners like the iPhone 7
and the one plus three most phones
scratch the eight megapixel front-facing
camera is also under the front screen
glass so it is scratch resistant as well
but the earpiece on the other hand it
seems to be made out of a super fine
cloth almost like the cloth we saw
inside the pixel this one can't come out
now obviously I pulled this out on
purpose but over time on your own phone
through heating and cooling and normal
phone abuse the little bit of adhesive
holding this earpiece in place can
become weak I imagine after a year or
two of this rattling around in your
pocket your phone might look the same as
mine it's an unfortunate material choice
I'll just stuff it back in and pretend
like nothing happened
nailed it might want to turn up your
volume for this next part it's real
metal definitely one of my favorites
down and feels on a smart phone now
today I'm going to switch things up a
little art class with Jerry is
temporarily canceled last month I had
about 50,000 views on my channel from
the lovely little country of Finland and
in Finland there is a tiny town that's
actually called Nokia chart about here
turns out Nokia originated in Finland
would have thought if any of you are
planning a vacation to Nokia my map will
help you get there it's a good map
probably the best map the 16 megapixel
rear camera protrudes quite a bit out of
the back metal housing not quite as good
looking at the completely flush LG g6
but the Nokia 6015 camera lens I
originally does nothing to it it's good
to see that most cell phone companies
these days have stopped using plastic on
their camera lenses the flash is still
plastic but that's fine
since light will still flow through no
matter how scratched it is the top of
the phone is metal the Nokia six does
have plastic antenna lines like all
metal phones do these are similar to the
wraparound corner design that the iPhone
7 currently has but this phone has one
distinguishing ly useful feature that
the iPhone 7 does not have a headphone
jack the volume and power buttons are
completely made of metal as well so no
matter where you are holding this phone
you'll be touching metal I'm not going
to lie it's a good feeling phone on the
outside but it's what's on the inside
that really counts we'll find out more
in a second the phone does have stereo
speakers that's a bonus but it is still
living in the microUSB world I'm
starting to like this USB C thing more
and more so Nokia needs to get with the
program
the Nokia 6 has a 5.5 inch 1080p IPS
display which means that if I take a
lighter - it will get about 10 seconds
of life before the pixels go black and
turn off luckily though with IPS
displays the pixels do recover and
within a few seconds of the heat being
removed they'll be back to normal now
I'm still using my galaxy s7 edge that I
tested about a year ago on my channel
the burn mark on the AMOLED screen
doesn't go away so don't try this at
home kids I'm a professional the
ultimate test to build quality is B Ben
tests at about 60 phones that I've
tested in the past few years only five
have catastrophic we failed and snapped
in half this is the first Nokia
smartphone that I've ever tested so I
was nervous but this is literally one of
the most solid devices that I have ever
felt there is basically zero flex to the
frame pressing from the front or the
back
this Nokia six is definitely a contender
for the most durable phone of 2017 the
only thing I would change is the
earpiece fabric overall and very
impressed with Nokia so far 2017
been a pretty fantastic year for phones
I'm looking forward to testing the
Galaxy s8 in a few weeks so make sure
you're subscribed to that and let me
know in the comments what phone you want
to see me test next I'll be reading them
thanks for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
