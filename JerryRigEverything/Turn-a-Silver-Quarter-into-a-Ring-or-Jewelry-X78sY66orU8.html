the year 1964 or before time you can
tell if it's a silver quarter or not by
if if there's a dual tone on the quarter
now you can see this one's kind of
silver and copper that just means that
this one is not is so reporter solar
quarters are much more pliable and also
as a site now these ridges were
implemented to make sure that no one
would shave little bits off with the
silver quarter and keep them so here's
the quarter after about three hours of
pounding or so the best way that I found
to do it is just just place it on a
mousepad just like this and then take a
spoon and we'll show you how to do that
just take a spoon just tap it just like
that so it's not too hard not too soft
and after about three hours or so you
get about to this level so now we're
going to take some drill bits and we're
going to take out the center of it make
it into a ring
yes right now we have a little hole in
there just kinda like a little pilot
hole we just use just your normal metal
bit and so now we're gonna take a bigger
bit and go through that hole again
and make it make it so we don't have to
file down as much once we get the edge
so we start with the bigger bit that was
grabbing it and spin it around we had a
pair of pliers that make this a lot
easier a pair of pliers that wouldn't
damage the sides because if you grab it
when we first started doing this we
grabbed this size and you can see it
kind of Nick's it right there so you're
trying to avoid holding on to it with
pliers as much as possible but hopefully
with the smaller bit we can get it
without having a spin too much all right
I've drilled it with a half-inch and
this was looking right good you just get
a file and just file it down something
like this tool we're a little bit wider
just put the ring on it and then just
rub up and down and I'll sand off all
right what you'll do is you'll put it
over a bit like this and then smack with
the hammer so it rounds out the
stainless steel like this and and it
pound it around it should go smooth on
the inside
