the brand-new ps4 is super easy all you
got to do is grab the top plastic part
the shiny part and kind of press down on
either side of it with your hands and
pull away from the main body and it will
unclasp and let you in to see the hard
drive and this doesn't void any
warranties with the PlayStation so
you're perfectly fine swapping out hard
drives there's one big screw towards the
end of the hard drive that you can just
undo as the Philips head and then your
hard drive comes loose from the ps4
there are four screws surrounding the
hard drive there the big black ones and
if you unscrew all of those then you'll
be able to slide the hard drive out take
your new hard drive and slide it back
into place you can upgrade sizes you can
you know switch out broken hard drives
it's super super easy once you get it
lined up pop those four big black screws
in again and you'll be able to slide it
back into place
I'll put replacement hard drives down in
the video description below so if you
have any questions or anything like that
go ahead and shoot me an email or leave
me a comment and I'll get back to you as
soon as I can get that big Phillips head
screwdriver put back into place and pop
the plastic piece back on super easy
anyway don't forget to like this video

subscribe I put a videos every week you
can hit me up on Google+ Twitter or
Facebook jerry-rigged everything thanks
