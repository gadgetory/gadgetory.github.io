faster than Taylor Swift goes through
boyfriends and I'm just trying to catch
up with all of them I have a Nokia 7
from a few months ago and a Nokia 7 plus
from 2018 that's going to be tested
today since I don't need the 7 anymore
I'll be giving it away over on my
Instagram and I'll explain more about
that at the end of this video there's
black copper Nokia 7 plus as the one
will be durability testing today the
entire Nokia lineup have all had some
pretty impressive build quality and the
aesthetics of this dual camera black
copper device is pretty sweet right now
the box the phone feels solid and has
what feels like smooth plastic on the
back but there's only one way to know
for sure let's get started
the Nokia 7 plus is rocking a 6 inch 18
by 9 aspect ratio for the display which
makes it the same dimensions as the
Google pixel 2 XL and has Gorilla Glass
3 protecting the surface which means
that during the scratch test we get very
faint marks at a level 6 and then
scratches at a level 7 makes me wonder
if the Gorilla Glass 3 was slightly
harder than the Gorilla Glass 5 no
physical buttons down at the chin of the
phone my razor is making no marks on the
glass as we move our way up to the 16
megapixel front-facing camera also
protected with that same Gorilla Glass 3
the earpiece grille is made from a fine
screen like material and sits just below
the surface of the glass the screen
itself is glued and tight then won't
ever be falling out on its own I have to
admit that the black and copper coloring
of this phone is very eye-catching
Nokia says they anodized the aluminum
block twice to get the bolt coloring on
the sides makes me wonder if the inside
of the phone is copper as well the edges
are definitely metal you can see the
silver aluminum under the anodizing the
coloring might come off with a drop or
ding the buttons are also metal and we
even have a headphone jack up top it's
interesting that the premium devices
these days are now skipping the jack but
the cheaper budget phones are keeping it
it's got a metal SD card tray which is
nice the oneplus six does not offer
expandable memory so that's a bonus for
Nakia down here at the bottom we have
more copper colored aluminum and a USB C
charging port if the seven plus can hold
itself together for these last few tests
is turning out to be a good phone for
the money Nakia claims that Zeiss has
done some special stuff with the camera
on this phone and that's fine I'll let
other youtubers review the actual
software I do hardware Netherlands has
oh I yes but there is a two times
optical zoom which I feel the useful
feature to have when you have dual
cameras both are protected by glass
thankfully Nokia has used plastic camera
lenses in the past like on their Nokia 3
the flash is plastic that's fine that's
diffused and doesn't need to be
optically clear or scratch free the
fingerprint scanner is also located on
the back directly below the camera
lenses and is scratch Abul it does sit
slightly recessed below the back panel
so it's not totally exposed
but either way even with the abuse the
fingerprint scanner still functions like
normal thumbs up for that so far the
nokia 7 plus hadn't given me much to
complain about
but if I had to pick one thing it would
be the way they advertised the back
panel material Nokia said the seven-plus
received six layers of ceramic feel
paint ceramic and paint are two totally
different materials one could classify
as a premium material and the other one
is attempting to use a premium buzzword
to make his health seem cooler one is a
level 8 on Mohs scale and one is a level
3 you can't really claim one feels like
the other when it just isn't my razor
blade is a level 5 on Mohs scale of
hardness and it was able to draw the
white teeth Frater that made the Kessel
run in 14 parsecs I mean 12 12 parsecs
there probably is six layers of paint
though like Nokia said it's pretty thick
and you can see a glint of aluminum
through the deeper cuts either way it's
definitely still in the plastic realm
back on the other side of the phone
under the Gorilla Glass 3 we have a
1080p IPS LCD and initially after 10
seconds of flame it looks like nothing
is happening but once I slid over to the
white background we see that the pixels
did indeed turn off and stopped working
but they are currently in the process of
completely recovering unlike an again
after
duel on Mustafar now the ultimate test
of structural integrity the bin test
applying pressure to the back yields
zero movement and even flipping the
phone around and bending it from the
front nothing
Nakia has seriously produced some of the
most sturdy bunch of phones I've ever
tested the plastic back panel will never
crack in a drop like glass might and
it's just overall a very well-built foam
I'm impressed
I'll still be giving away these sealed
Nokia seven on my Instagram just leave a
comment on the Millennium Falcon picture
I drew during my art class with Jerry
and I'll pick one random person in the
next few days to send the phone to I'll
leave a link for my Instagram in the
description thanks to them for watching
and I will see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
