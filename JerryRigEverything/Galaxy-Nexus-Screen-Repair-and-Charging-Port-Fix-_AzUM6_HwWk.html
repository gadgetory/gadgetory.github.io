how to take apart the Galaxy Nexus
there's six screws all around the
outside I'll speed this up I'm also
keeping running this is the Galaxy Nexus
is not the Nexus not the Nexus S or the
Nexus 4 this is the third Nexus the
Galaxy Nexus
Google's gotten a pretty creative with
their naming system anyway once those
six screws around just take your pry
tool and slide around the outside of the
screen and it'll there's a few different
through the few snaps on either side of
the phone as well as on the top and the
bottom and once those are out the screen
lifts out of the back casing here you
can see the three pins
there's also three water damage
indicators to take off the bottom part
of the phone there's only one screw and
then the whole plastic piece just kind
of snapped into place split a little bit
it'll pop right out
it also has the little ribbon cable as
well
one thing you really like about this
phone with all the new Samsung phones
they've have the charging port as its
own part of the phone and it's not
connected to the motherboard the ribbon
cable is a that was the first one is the
charging port the second ones to the
screen and this is the third one
so right now I'm going to lift off the
motherboard you can see on the side of
the phone there's another cable that's
attached right here that needs to be
pulled off and then those three ribbon
cables and then this one wire cable are
the only things holding them on the
board in place
kind of
the motherboard out the camera is stuck
inside little plastic slots you just got
a little bit pulled out
right here the front-facing camera can
be detached you just flip up this little
lever you can pop the camera out slide
it back in and then climb it back into
place so if you want me to replace your
camera let's out do
I'll show you how to remove
a charging port usually that's one of
the main things that go out in
cellphones so there is sticky tape
holding it down into place and each one
of those little segments has a little
kind of guiding hole that help it fit on
to the screen itself and this is also
held on with sticky tape just kind of
private way I'm going to put it back
place just make sure it hits each of
those little guiding holes so it's this
right where it came from
I'll try to post a link in the comments
of where you can buy these just in case
yours does go out
those are the guiding holes to put the
motherboard
back in place there is this little
ribbon cable that attaches to the bottom
of the motherboard so clip that on first
you can fold the motherboard over make
sure to keep the other ribbon cables on
the outside
the top
the board does need to slide into place
first there are little plastic brackets
along the top of the phone that hold the
motherboard into place just right here
I'm kind of wiggling it and pressing it
in underneath those brackets so that it
will sit tight against the phone there
shouldn't be any wiggling room
one more cool thing you can see right
there underneath my thumb there's a the
scan disk so it looks like that's where
the memory is the built-in 32 gigabytes
I wonder if they'll ever come out with
the 64 gigabyte where you can just swap
it out looks pretty simple
and like a permanent SD card I'm just
going to clip this wire cable back in
place all there
and cables and wire cables are kind of
like Legos just put them into place they
only fit in one direction and then you
just gotta snap them in and then this
wire cable has guiding brackets along
the side as well though I'm going to
push back into place and reattach the
bottom plastic piece with the
correlating ribbon cable and snap that
in
now push the back into place as well
making sure to go around the outside of
the phone and press all the little clips
which attach the screen to the back
housing
then all this
down is just slide the screws back into
place and that's a relatively simple
Samsung is usually pretty solved their
design anyway if this helped it don't
forget to like the video and don't
forget to subscribe I'm usually pretty
quick with getting a new phones show you
how to take a look or thanks for
watching
