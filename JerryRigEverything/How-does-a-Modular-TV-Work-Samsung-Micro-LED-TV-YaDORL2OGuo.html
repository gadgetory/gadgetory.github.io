this video
so you might be thinking to yourself all
TVs are the same but that's not quite
the case
Samsung has just released a modular
micro LED TV that's pretty incredible
I'm going to show you how it works let's
get started so here's the thing with the
new Samsung micro LED TVs they're
completely modular and customizable size
free ratio free bezel free and
resolution free you can combine these
little squares together to make a TV as
big or small as you want you can see the
TV behind me it's a 1 by 8 panel that's
completely modular each of the little
squares can disconnect and be put
somewhere else let's say you have a TV
budget for this year you can buy the
panels get a TV as big as your budget
allows and then next year if you have a
larger budget you can buy more panels to
make your TV even bigger and increase
the resolution anywhere from 4k 6.5 K 10
K as big as you want as much resolution
as you want it's pretty interesting plus
with the modularity of this TV you know
repairability is pretty important for me
in my channel if one panel happens to
break let's say you're getting
aggressive during a video game and
someone throws a controller at the
screen and cracks it you've seen the
YouTube videos where people do that
instead of replacing the whole TV you
can just replace the one particular
panel so I think this technology
definitely has a place in the world and
I'm excited to see where it's going so
how does it work
magnets each of these modular squares
has a backplate which mounts directly
into the wall there's kind of like a
master square that controls all the
squares around it and each of the rear
panels have two little latches that pop
up there's little metal contact pads and
they clip into the panel next to it just
like a little connector to get their
information and signal from that master
square in the center and because each of
these little modular panels have no
bezels you can stick them right next to
each other and the seam disappears when
the content is displaying now this isn't
on the market just yet it's just where
the future's headed
I think modular micro LED TVs are the
way of the future and the same
technology that they're using in these
modular blocks is used in Samsung's
massive TV which I'll show you right now
viewing angle on this thing is insane
even when you're like right up close to
it you still can't see the pixels inside
of it and you can still see the whole
image this is crazy it can be a window
to the outside world it can watch your
movies and the internal technology the
artificial intelligence displays
whatever content scaled to the right
dimensions for your uniquely sized
modular TV so with 8k TVs obviously not
everything is 8k content just yet we're
barely getting into the 4k realm but
with Samsung's TV that they're calling
the wall because of how big it is it has
internal AI that can upscale
high-definition ultra-high definition 4k
it up scales it to 8k so it looks even
better in real life so this massive TV
behind me is still the same modular
technology that we saw in the smaller
TVs over there this is what Samsung is
calling the wall TV because it can
literally take up an entire wall so LED
TVs are 100% light efficient all of the
light emitted from the LED shoots
directly out to your eyeball the viewer
plus the micro LEDs use inorganic
material which means there is no burnin
with this new technology so you can have
the same outside of your window
displaying for years with no burnin on
this TV Samsung does have their high
resolution 8kq LED technology up and
running it's not modular but it's still
8k super impressive I'll leave the
current pricing down in the description
if you're curious so whether you're the
type of person who likes to go out and
buy the latest stuff or you just like
knowing what's out there for the future
aka isn't something only in your
imagination anymore it's here and it
looks pretty darn good
would you rather have a modular TV built
from panels you organize yourself or do
you prefer the large standard pre-built
TVs I'm curious to see how the
technology is going to be utilized in
the future thanks again to Samsung for
sponsoring my trip to CES this year let
me know if you have any questions down
in the comments thanks ton for watching
and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
