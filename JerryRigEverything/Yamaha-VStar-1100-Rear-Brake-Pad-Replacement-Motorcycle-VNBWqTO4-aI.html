a motorcycle this one particular one is
a V Star 1100
it's a shaft remember that doesn't
matter when you're changing the brake
path it's all pretty Universal with all
the motorcycles that are disc brake so
basically these two bolts are holding on
the caliper and the caliper is the place
that adds the two brake pads inside of
it I'm gonna pull that off and show you
on these particular I'm on this caliper
these bolts are 12 millimeter so I just
took it off you can see the two bolts
that I unscrewed and you can see inside
of the caliper those are the two brake
pads that slide over the rotor which is
right here that's when you blow pull the
handle that compresses it make if it
pushes the brake fluid down through
those lines and compresses the two brake
pads together so to get to the actual
brake pads themselves you have to pop
off the there's a cap that sits on the
top of that and basically has a little
lip you just kind of press in and that
pops off you can kind of see it says for
pet service you pop it off anyway I'm
kind of a hard shot here but up here at
the top of this there's a little cotter
pin in that I already took it out but
then you can see this pin is coming
loose so once I get that pin out this
metal bracket will pop off releasing the
brake pads and then you can see the
cotter pin the pin itself and the
bracket and brake pads so we have the
new brake pad in the old brake pad um
you can kind of see how worn down the
old one was but now we have a problem
because the newer brake pad is thicker
than the older brake pad so we have to
find a way to compress these those two
circles in there which are the pistons
for the brake pads we need to find a way
to push them back out so the brake pads
will fit in and it'll still fit over the
rotor as you compressing this as hard as
I can with my fingers right now and I
won't go back out so what you have to do
is
have more space it's nice to use a
c-clamp like that or a pair of
channellocks
so I'm going to just kind of compress
those back into the caliper itself so
I'll have no room I also unscrewed the
brake fluid reservoir up there to let it
the levels inside fluctuate a little bit
while I was decompressing these
basically I use two channel locks um
these two guys right here to grab one on
either side and compress them in that
way now they're completely open and get
my pads in there and pop those two pins
back through but the cotter pins the
room I'm after I put that metal plate in
and then hopefully it all slides back on
over the rotor itself or you can kind of
see down in there I got the two pins and
this is definitely easier with the one
with smaller hands that's what I do I'm
gonna pop that cap back into place and
wiggle it back on to the rotor alright
you can see down in there I got the on
either side of the roller the pads are
now clamped on I'm just gonna tap the
back brake a few times before I go
anywhere so no compresses back onto the
rotor again anyway yeah if you have any
questions make sure to leave in the
comments like if this helped you and
