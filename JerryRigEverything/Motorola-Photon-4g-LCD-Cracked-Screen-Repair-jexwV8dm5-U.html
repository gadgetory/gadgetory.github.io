the motorola Photon it's a dual-core
phone from Sprint it's rocking the
Android operating system there's a total
of 10 screws around the outside there
are seven normal screws that you can see
me taking apart right here
and then there's a screw head and
underneath this little rubber tab you
can just pop that off with a pair of
tweezers just kind of lift up underneath
there and then this screw is in that
upper part right next to the camera
the other two screws are down near the
bottom make sure to take out the battery
before you start prying away the case or
anything let me get a better view you
can kind of see it's kind of like a hard
piece of plastic you just kind of lift
up and out it's got a little bit of
sticky stuff on the bottom that you can
put back on later if you won't do
pop those two screws out these screws
are different than all the other screws
so it would be pretty easy to put them
back into place
anyway once those are off the phone
itself actually lifts away pretty easily
you might need to use a little pry tool
around the edges to get it all the way
off but it's pretty simple this is the
kickstand right here which is
replaceable so if your kickstand is
stuck in the upright position you get
rid of it this is the audio jack the
little pins that connect to each part of
the headphone jack and then this is the
vibrator right here that's what spins
around to vibrate your phone
unfortunately for this phone not many of
the components are replaceable there's
one screw holding down the motherboard
which is what I'm taking off right now
and there's two ribbon cables that one
and this one right here
once those are snapped off they're kind
of like Lego so just kind of lift them
off and the board itself is glued on to
the LCD so kind of take your pry tool
and lift it up just a little bit and I
slide my prior tool in all the way and
it kinda clicks up and off of the off
the mainboard don't have bend too much
so it wouldn't damage the motherboard
and kind of lift it wiggle it and then
you can pry it away and make sure that
your piece right there doesn't get
ripped away from the motherboard it's
just kind of glued on to the front
screen so now I have my new screen and
I'm gonna put down and I'm going to
slide the motherboard into place here
making sure the ribbon cables are on the
right side of the motherboard correct
side of the motherboard and then just
snap them down into place just like
Legos and now if you look in a video
description I'm going to try to find as
many replacement parts as I can
hopefully there'll be some screens
after the phone's been out for a while
that you screens are usually pretty
cheap on Amazon so I'll post those
anyway make sure you get the screws back
into place this is the little silver
round one and the rest of the video is
you know pretty self-explanatory
pop the plastic into place make sure
it's clipped in all around the sides
this one doesn't have very strong Clips
around the outsides so that's why it has
so many freaking screws so put the two
silver ones it's long silver ones down
the bottom and then grab your other
seven black screws and screw them in
around the outside as well as the screw
underneath the rubber piece next to the
camera
pop the battery back in huh the phone
works anyway if you any questions leave
them in the comments don't forget to
like this video if it helped you and
don't forget to subscribe it helps me
out a lot thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
