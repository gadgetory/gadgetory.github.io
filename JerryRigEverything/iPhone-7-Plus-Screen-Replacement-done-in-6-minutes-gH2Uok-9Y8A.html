iPhone 7 plus this is actually my
personal phone the only phone I have
ever broken on accident everything's
still worse great is just the screen
that shattered to bits I went to hug a
friend and her purse knocked it out of
my hand and it was Merry Christmas to
the ground the broken LCD perfectly
blocks out the battery life indicator
the time of day and the name of the
person I am texting so it's definitely
time to fix this thing it's pretty much
the exact same process as the regular
iPhone 7 there are two pentalobe screws
down at the bottom of the phone right
next to where the headphone jack used to
be if you need a screw driver or
replacement screen I will link those for
you in the video description right below
this video now heat is not 100%
mandatory for this repair but it does
help soften the thin band of adhesive
that surrounds the screen on all sides
this is a type of waterproofing adhesive
so after completing this repair your
phone will not be water resistant
anymore but if your screen is cracked
it's already not water-resistant so
you're not losing too much I'm taking
one of my thin metal pry tools and going
between the metal frame of the phone and
the plastic edge of the screen and
cutting through the adhesive this makes
lifting off the screen a lot easier
don't slide in very deep though because
there are fragile ribbon cables along
that right side of the screen that are
very important the bottom of the screen
will lift up first and then you'll have
to pull the top of the screen down and
out of the phone frame then the whole
thing flips open like a book for this
next part we need a new bit it is called
a y triple zero tri point screwdriver
and I'll include a link for that as well
in the video description there are seven
of these tri point screws holding down
two silver plates it is excruciating ly
important that you keep your screws
organized put them on a separate piece
of paper next to you and draw a picture
or label where each screw comes from
some of them are different sizes I'll
use a plastic pry tool to unsnap the
battery connection so that there is no
power to the rest of device and then
I'll start unclipping a little ribbon
cables these are just like little Mega
Bloks once the display and fingerprint
scanner ribbons are disconnected you can
unsnap the top earpiece ribbon and that
will release the screen from the body of
the phone here is what the replacement
screens look like remember all have
these link down in the video description
it is super important to be gentle
the ribbon Cable's if they get bent or
kinked too far in any direction your new
screen will not work after the
installation is complete we do have to
transfer over some of the components to
the new screen like the earpiece and the
home button I'll start with the earpiece
there are five screws up here at the top
that need to be removed
these ones are regular Phillips head
screws now that the screws are out I
will remove the top metal bracket and
slip out the little earpiece speaker
then comes the tricky part this little
ribbon cable might look complicated but
it's actually not it is fragile though
and while it is very inexpensive to
replace it is better just to keep the
original intact and not rip anything so
be very gentle with it it's about as
strong as paper is each little segment
like the front camera the proximity
sensors and the little golden circular
contact points have some adhesive
holding them to the back of the screen
I'll show you how to origami it back
into place in a second but first let's
get this home button transferred there
are four screws we have down here these
are the same why triple-zero screws that
we were working with before and once
these are out we can remove the metal
bracket this exposes the guts of the
fingerprint scanner touchpad there is
one more super tiny ribbon connector
remember that this ribbon is also very
fragile so be careful with it since this
original home button does need to be
transferred over to your new screen once
the ribbon cable is lifted up the button
will just fall out from the front side
of the phone there is only one more
thing we have to remove from the old
screen and that is the large metal
backplate this also has the white
triple-zero screws on it three on one
side two on the other side and one more
little screw down at the bottom there is
some adhesive holding the plate to the
ribbon cables you can lift that up and
then slide the whole plate up and away
from the back of the old shattered
screen take that same plate and feed the
ribbons from your new working display
through the little hole being gentle
with the ribbons make sure they are
straight and not kinked before you screw
the plate down and get all the metal
frame screws into place three on the
right one at the bottom and two on the
left side and then the home button gets
put back into place from the front side
of the screen there is a little plastic
guiding pin on the backside of the
screen that will help the little ribbon
fall in the exact place that it needs to
go then it can be snapped into the other
little connector right next to it when
you are screwing the screw for the back
of the home button make sure to snug but
don't go too tight it is a pretty
fragile little piece of tech and a super
aggressive screw might cause damage
now let's get the front camera and
earpiece into place remember these
little plastic pins I was talking about
these are going to be your friend up
here as well get the ribbon down by
lining those up and getting a little box
sensor into place
it'll be like giving a cat a bath but
eventually everything should line up the
speaker gets tucked under the front
camera making sure the gold springs line
up on the gold contact circles and after
the camera is tucked into the clear
plastic circle the metal plate holds it
all together
and finally we can attach the screen to
the foam body again I'll start with the
two ribbons in the center and then clip
the top ribbon down right afterward
you'll fill each of them snap into place
just like a little Lego has a much
better ring to it the last thing you
want to plug in is the battery connector
before putting on the protective metal
plates I usually test my screen to make
sure everything works if the screen is
grey or has lines running through it it
might just be a bad connection so turn
the phone off and reconnect the little
ribbons again and if that doesn't work
one of the ribbons might have gotten
bent during the installation or it could
just be a bad screen get the seven
screws back in over the metal plates and
then make sure the top of the screen is
lined up with the phone body first
before clamping down the rest of the
screen also don't put any stress on the
right side ribbon cables remember
they're as fragile as paper and very
very important to the functionality of
your phone so don't let them rip thumbs
up for success I have a working phone
again I'm normally an Android guy but
I've been using an iPhone for the past
few months I'll have my review video
posted with my verdict very very soon
let me know if you have any questions I
try to be pretty active down in the
comments and if I don't respond someone
else sure will you can usually get an
answer pretty quick here on my channel
my Twitter followers heard the story of
my broken phone the night had happened
so if you want to stay up to date on
random stuff like that head on over to
my Twitter and if you've made it this
far in the video comment your favorite
flavor of ice cream I'm always curious
as to who makes it to the end of my
videos I personally prefer Oreo ice
cream the more Oreos the better thanks
done for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
