how to replace your vibrator motor in
your iPhone 5 and under 2-minutes you're
going to take off the two bottom screws
there are pentalobe screws I'll link the
tools and parts in the video description
below and then grab a large suction cup
bigger than the one I have and you can
pull up and it should separate the
screen from the frame if your suction
cup sucks at sucking you can also grab a
razor blade or a metal pry tool and slip
it between the frame and the glass and
pry up very very very gently on the
plastic frame along the edge of the
screen make sure not to put too much
pressure on the glass or you will crack
something and it will stop working the
screens are pretty expensive so be
careful then there are three screws
along the metal bracket as you can see
here take those screws out and then
remove the metal bracket and then you
can unclip the three ribbon cables at
the base of the screen and this removes
the screen so you have a little bit more
room to work with when you're replacing
the vibrator motor now I've taken out
the battery you don't have to you can
get the vibrator motor without taking
out the battery there's those two screws
and that removes one little bracket and
then there's one screw holding on the
motor to the frame of the phone as well
and that takes apart the motor and you
can see right here this is the little
guy that spins around when you get up a
notification phone call or text message
and it vibrates the whole phone kind of
cool-looking anyway make sure to clean
off these contacts if your vibrator
stopped working especially if you've
gotten gunk like pop or water or
something else in your phone if you
clean this off and install the new
vibrator you should be good to go anyway
if you have any questions make sure to
leave them in the comments below don't
forget to like this video if it helped
and don't forget to subscribe and don't
forget I've listed all the parts and
tools you need in the video description
