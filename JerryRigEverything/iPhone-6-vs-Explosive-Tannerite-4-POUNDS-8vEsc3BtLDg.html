videos posted to YouTube and even that
gets a little bit boring for me and I
love fixing stuff so today we're gonna
do something a little bit different
we're gonna take some Tanner right and
blow up an iPhone 6
what is Tanner right you asked well let
me tell you
tannerite is a binary explosive that
means it has two basic components
ammonium nitrate which is used in some
fertilizers and aluminum powder both of
these components are very stable by
themselves and even when mixed together
they're safe to handle the only thing
that will make this mixture explode is a
high-velocity bullet an explosion cannot
be created by using flame or electricity
this bottle is the equivalent of a small
bomb you probably shouldn't try this at
home alright so here's the iPhone 6
fully functioning it's the gold version
we're gonna tuck it right down in there
on the top and then put the cap back on
I have a GoPro there we got the Tanner
right there in the center they might go
for a sitting farther up on that pallet
and then this is the SKS this is what
we're shooting with it fires a 7.62 by
39 millimeter round so the only thing
that will make tannerite explode is a
high-velocity bullet these are 22
bullets and they travel around 1,400
feet per second that's not enough to
explode Tanner right you need one of
these guys this is what goes inside of
the SKS and this travels at 2300 feet
per second and only a bullet traveling
faster than 2200 feet per second will
make the Tanner I'd explode so it's
pretty safe stuff for the most part
you
so this is where the kena right was this
is part of the LCD screen back spoil
this as well this is the QR code that's
on the back of every iPhone screen right
there you can see the crater from the
tannerite
and over here probably about 30 feet
away are all the individual chunks of
the battery so the battery is made up of
copper layers there's one there there's
one here a little bit more of the
batteries still looking for the metal
housing there's a little bit more of the
battery
there's my GoPro there's a bit more of
the battery here that is a pretty
impressive crater that the Tanner I left
bits of the iPhone are scattered for
around 30 feet in every direction found
some more the back metal plate this is
what goes on the back of the LCD inside
the metal housing it even has some of
the screws still attached to it I think
it's safe to say that the iPhone 6 does
not survive four pounds of tannerite
what should I do to my next phone let me
know down in the comments and hit that
subscribe button for future carnage I am
definitely not going to stop doing my
tear downs and durability tests but a
guy has to have fun every once in a
while thanks for watching hope see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
