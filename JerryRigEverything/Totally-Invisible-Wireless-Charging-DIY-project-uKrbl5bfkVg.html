seen or heard of wireless charging or Qi
charging some phones are naturally
capable of doing wireless charging like
the galaxy s6 edge or Nexus 6 you can
see the phone light up as soon as it
makes connection with the pad some
phones require a special back to allow
to charge wirelessly like the note 4 or
the galaxy s5 eventually Apple will also
catch up to modern technology normally
this charging pad is always visible on
your nice standard desk but today I'm
going to hide mine permanently all the
parts I use for this project are linked
in the video description below in order
to hide it I need to see if the Qi pad
is capable of charging through a layer
of wood taking wooden shims I can slowly
adjust the distance of the phone from
the charging pad the phone will kick on
with about 3/16 inches of wood between
it and the pad but will charge pretty
consistently with one a chinta wood now
I just need to make my desk 1/8 inch
thick we want to get as thin as possible
without ripping through the top of my
desk
I added some tape at the top of the desk
to help protect from the torque of the
router I screwed some metal latches into
place to hold the charger I cleaned up
the charging pad cable and added a few
pennies to the charger so it would be
tight up against the top of the desk you
can always make yours look less
jerry-rigged if you want speaking of
which you should hit that subscribe
button if you haven't already and it
works now I'll never have to plug in my
phone while I'm working it can just sit
right there on the top of my desk and
charge wirelessly if you were wondering
the charging pad does charge through
glass as well and doesn't look half bad
with a decent braided cable I will link
everything I used in this video in the
video description below thanks ton for
watching follow me socially for sneak
peeks at my other projects hope to see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
