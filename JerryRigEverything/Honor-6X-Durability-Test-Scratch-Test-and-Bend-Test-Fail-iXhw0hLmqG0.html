honor 6x the newest and cheapest phone
from Huawei decent specs for a budget
phone it even has dual rear cameras an
octa-core processor and three gigs of
RAM but we're not here for specs we're
here for durability so let's see what's
this honor phone has to offer as always
let's start with the part where we count
to nine also called the scratch test
each of my Mo's picks have a different
tip that gradually increases in hardness
I start off with the level to pick and
saw that it was leaving a mark on the
screen which is incredible and unheard
of the included screen protector almost
fooled me it does make you wonder why
they included a screen protector are
they worried about the glass underneath
after removing the screen protector and
restarting the scratch test on the
actual surface of the phone I see that
levels four five six and seven all left
a mark and now we see the reason for the
screen protector the glass underneath is
not scratch resistant now these
scratches could be caused by a few
things soft glass imperfections in the
glass or some kind of weird residue on
the screen everyday objects are able to
leave a mark as well my tweezers left a
pretty decent groove and my razor blade
also left a mark
neither of the marks could be rubbed off
with a cloth and neither the tweezers
nor the razor would leave a mark on a
normal tempered glass screen since most
of the phones I test these days do
scratch at level six another weird thing
about this glass is when I peeled off
the sticker with my numbers on it it did
not come clean off of the phone I use
these same stickers for all fifty other
phones that I've tested and they always
come off clean so there's definitely
something funky going on the glass on
the six X either way
leave that plastic screen protector in
place if you want to keep your phone
looking good and when that included
screen protector gets worn out replace
it with another one the front earpiece
grille is made out of metal
which would qualify the durable material
and the opening is small enough that
it's not going to be a big collector of
dirt and grime so that's good news the
front camera is protected by the same
glass that covers the screen so just
make sure you're careful the rear camera
lens is not affected by my razor blade
which is fantastically good news while
we didn't use the same glass back here
that we use on the display the phone
so big thumbs up for protecting the dual
camera setup and now for the back panel
if it's cold like metal and screeches
like metal we can safely assume that
it's metal now a lot of people think
that my name is Jerry which I can
totally see why they would think that
since my youtube channel is called Jerry
rigged everything my real name is Zack
though and that's why my Instagram and
Twitter handle is Zack sherry would say
combines both my real name and my
youtube channel name see what it did
there
besides the phone are also made for
metal even the SIM card tray is metal
plus definitely a plus when we get to
the top of the phone we see some plastic
coming to the build that's mostly fine
with a budget phone like this you can
see the silver and black color
differences plastic will probably
provide a bit more give and cushion for
the screen during a drop more than metal
would anyway so as far as durability
goes it's still okay I'm mostly just
happy that it has a headphone jack the
more useful features of phone has the
better it has a micro USB charging port
at the bottom of the phone and the base
of the phone is also made of plastic
same as the top there are always pros
and cons to having plastic integrated
into the build but I'll talk more about
that just a second the side buttons are
also plastic so they don't have that
premium metal feel but this is a budget
device and plastic is cheaper to work
with than metal is so it's not
surprising that a lot of things are
plastic I do test the fingerprint
scanner on every phone i buy because see
how well it stands up to scratches I
think we can all agree that this is more
scratched up that it could ever happen
naturally
unless you're Edward Scissorhands of
course the enrollment and fingerprint
recognition of this phone did fail after
the scratching unfortunately there are
other phones that can survive an equally
scratch sensor like the honor eight or
the LGV 20 but this phone did not so
just make sure not to obliterate yours
with a razor like I did the owner 6x
lasted 12 seconds under the flame before
turning black we can tell this screen is
an IPS display because of that color
change AMOLED screens turn white and
usually don't recover kind of fun the
phone is completely cool to the touch
within seconds of the heat being removed
from the screen and it still functions
just like normal and now it's time for
the bin test
I've tested about 50 different phones on
my youtube-channel
I agree it's a slightly strange hobby
I've only had five of these 50 phones
catastrophic we fail most phones are
pretty well built budget phones included
among the flagships but this phone in
particular doesn't quite make it the
exterior glass doesn't look too bad it's
more the LCD under the glass that
cracked and shattered that's the
unfortunate part even though the
fractured LCD looks cool the phone is
now unusable if I pop off the back which
is actually pretty easy to do we can see
why the phone's flexed there are zero
screws holding that back metal panel to
the frame of the phone so while it does
have metal on the back panel that metal
is adding zero structural support to the
phone the only thing holding the back
panel in place was those flexible
plastic end caps we saw this exact same
problem with the redmi note 3 which is
also perched on my shelf of shame here's
another shot of the glass on the honor
6x being just fine it's the LCD under
the glass that is destroyed very weird
for it to happen on a bin like that the
glass can flex but the LCD can't just
for kicks and giggles will flex the top
glass more one more time look how far it
bent before it finally shattered and
gave up the ghost between the
non-structural back panel and the weak
LCD we have a recipe for a fragile phone
the front glass can only protect it so
much it also makes you wonder if the LCD
will be weak curing drops as well but
anyway back to comparing to the redmi
note 3 the note 3 also snapped in half
for the same reason that the honor 6x
did there is no structural integrity
offered by that back metal panel it
bails out and pops off as soon as it
going gets tough so if manufacturers
want to build a sturdy phone the back
panel needs to be physically attached to
the frame at multiple points to add some
strength now just because the phone
itself is cheap in price that doesn't
mean that the construction has to be
plenty of budget phones have passed my
test and there are plenty of screws
inside the honor 6x while we just has to
stick some of them through the back
panel and then the back can be
structural and not just aesthetic either
way I'm just here to review durability
and the honor 6x is definitely the
newest member on the shelf of shame but
that doesn't make it a bad phone if you
this device just make sure it has a case
and a screen protector and that you
don't scratch the fingerprint scanner
and you'll be golden if you need a
durable phone in your life from the
honor family check out the honor eight
that's on pass my test with flying
colors
thanks for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
