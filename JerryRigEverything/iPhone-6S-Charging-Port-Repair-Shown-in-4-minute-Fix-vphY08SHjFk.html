replace the charging port in your iPhone
6s before you jump into the
semi-difficult repair make sure that
it's not just like a piece of dust or
lint blocking your charging port you can
usually reach in there and clean it out
with a small brush or a toothpick I will
link all of the tools and parts you need
down in the video description of this
video there's two screws down at the
bottom of the phone there pentalobe
screws unscrew them and then you can
lift up on the screen with the suction
cup and pry between the metal frame of
the screen and the metal frame of the
phone you want to make sure not to bend
the screen at all as you're prying up or
else you'll break your LCD and it will
turn into a more costly repair than
gesture charging port there is adhesive
surrounding the outside of the phone I
separated that with my plastic pry tool
and then the screen was able to just
lift up away from the body
be very careful do not bend the screen
up past 90 degrees there are four screws
here in a metal plate I will link a free
pdf screw chart organizer in the video
description that will help out there's
three ribbon cables down here you can
just unsnap them from the phone like
Legos then there's a metal plate and two
screws here for the charging port then
there's two screws down here for the
vibrator motor it just pulses back and
forth instead of spinning around like a
regular vibrator motor you can see the
contact points for the charging port I'm
disconnecting the battery and
disconnecting the charging port from the
motherboard pull it away from the
loudspeaker and there's one wire cable
down here on the motherboard as well
just kind of lift that up be very
careful with that it is fragile there's
three screws here for the loudspeaker
three screws here for the headphone jack
and then six screws here right next to
the charging port itself make sure to
place all those on your screw organizer
that you printed out from the video
description then there is one hidden
screw underneath this black tape scrape
away the black tape and find your little
hidden guy remove it pull up the end of
this wire cable from the loudspeaker and
the loudspeaker will be able to pull
away from the foam body here's the
loudspeaker you can see the two gold
contacts up at the top they just rest up
against the charging port ribbon cable
and that's how it receives its signal
then the charging port ribbon cable can
lift up away from the phone be very
gentle because there are two parts that
are still stuck to the phone body
there's a microphone here and then a
microphone
on the other side as well held in with
this little rubber plastic bit there's a
spot on the screw chart for that as well
keep it organized and then you can pull
away the other microphone from the foam
body pull the headphone jack
out from its little slot in the foam
body as well and that releases your
charging port you can see the contact
points for the vibrator the loudspeaker
the two microphones the headphone jack
and the charging port itself and here is
the empty foam body take your new
charging port there's probably adhesive
on it so remove all of the safety tabs
on top of the adhesive set your charging
port down into place and put the
microphones back in their slot make sure
the hole lines up with the hole in the
frame as well otherwise your microphone
won't be able to hear you when you speak
then you can line up the little rubber
piece as well get all these screws back
into place except for the red one leave
the red one out for right now get the
loudspeaker put back into place as well
once again all this stuff will be linked
down in the video description make sure
to get the wire back into place and make
sure it's pinched on the top of the
loudspeaker you can see in the top left
there now you can put in the rest of the
screws that hold down the loudspeaker
and the charging port and you can clip
the ribbon cable into place and the wire
cable make sure it's positioned directly
on top of its connection before you
place it down
two screws holding the vibrator motor
and then last thing you want to pin down
is the cable for the battery there's a
three ribbon cables for the screen you
have your front camera digitizer and LCD
ribbons and make sure they're all placed
down and then before I put the metal
plate and I'm just going to turn on the
phone to make sure it works looks like
everything is working fine but if you
have like lines running through your
screen or the screen is white there's a
good chance that your cables aren't
plugged in correctly you're going to
want to reseat them and plug them in
again to get the screen pinched down
into place line up the top first then
you can slide your hands down the side
and clamp it down into place all the way
down if you have any questions make sure
to leave in the comments I do respond
fairly regularly make sure to put the
bottom two screws in the bottom of your
phone check out a couple of my other
repair videos and don't forget to check
out my Instagram I do more fun things
than just taking apart cellphones thanks
