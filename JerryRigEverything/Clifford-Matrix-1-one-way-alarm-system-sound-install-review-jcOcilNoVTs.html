Clifford matrix plus one
alarm it's the one that comes with a
little key table like this cancion that
says clifford the installation was
fairly easy at myself I'm I'm fairly
experienced I've done sound systems and
stuff that's all the experience I have
doing a electrical wiring and cars
basically you have your sense that are
up here that I have melted behind my
rear view mirror
rounded cables up along the top down the
side right here by the kick panel and
then I mounted my head unit if the
brains of the operation right here you
can see we can adjust it to be more
sensitive or not all the cables the
hardest part of the whole project was
just getting the right cables to match
up the ignition has a few wires that you
connect to and I connected to the door
lights down inside of here right next to
this push pin so that's some where you
can connect I got all my the wiring
schematics on line as far as the alarm
itself goes I haven't mounted it
completely yet I had that kind of zip
tied in there and then the cables come
up and down and then through the
firewall right there and this isn't a
toyota tacoma so it's gonna be different
in every vehicle as far as how it sounds
if you press it once it locks it and you
have the unlock gives the two beeps the
alarms and ones like this and just
continues on I'm just pressing the
button once so the high-pitched whining
just keeps going and going and going if
the alarm goes off but that's the
installation for the Clifford collar
alarm system it is kind of cool though
with this light inside of here that
flashes blue just like that when the
make car alarm is set so it kind of
lights up the whole cab at night which
is kind of cool
anyway the only questions assessed
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
