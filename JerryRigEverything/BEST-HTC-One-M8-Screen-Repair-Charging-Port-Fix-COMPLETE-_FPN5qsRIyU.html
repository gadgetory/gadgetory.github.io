apart the HTC m8 to the one of the two
cameras on the back go ahead and turn
the phone completely off grab a heat gun
or a hairdryer and just heat up the
phone gently on the top and the bottom
we're not trying to heat up the screen
we're just trying to heat up the little
metal plates that cover the earpiece and
the camera once they're warmed up just
take a little razor blade and slide it
underneath the metal plate make sure not
to put the razor blade down towards the
phone because there is some stuff under
there that you can damage so lift up
these metal plates doesn't matter if you
damage them they're pretty cheap and
inexpensive to replace there are 45 Torx
head screws at the bottom and two normal
Phillips head screws up at the top tools
and parts will be listed down in the
video description below take out the SIM
card there's probably two in your phone
so make sure you take out both sim card
trays before you start to pry the back
off of the device
I've taken my razor blade because it's a
small thin little tool that can slide in
between the screen and the backplate and
unlatch each little clasp that holds the
screen and frame into the backplate
itself it is a pretty big pain trying to
get this thing apart it is not easy I
did take a little bit of heat and heat
up the back of the phone as well just in
case there was some adhesive back there
holding the screen onto the metal frame
itself the whole take apart process took
about 10 or 15 minutes so go slow and
take your time as you're pulling that
back plate off here's the back plate
itself you can see a little screw holes
and the camera lenses there is a glass
camera lens up for the top camera so if
that breaks you just have to pop that
out of its a little slot and replace it
from the inside take off the tape that's
holding down the little ribbing cable
connectors there's two of those make
sure you put this in a spot where it
won't get damaged because you will want
to put it back to on the phone again
when we're done lift up each of these
little white clasps they can break so be
very careful as you're lifting them up
probably use a little plastic tool and
then you can just slide the little
ribbon cables out from the little clasp
itself once it's lift up pretty
straightforward you can just watch as
I'm doing it here in the video once
again I'll replacement parts and tools
we
found in the video description below you
can grab these little wire cables and
lift them up
these ones are attached down towards the
charging port then this one right here
along that side as well there's some
more ribbon cables up here along the top
this is the most ribbon cables that I've
ever seen in a phone
so congratulations HTC there's two
screws holding down the battery
connector to the motherboard just lift
that up and you can see it's kind of
like a little Lego connection once you
lift it up its unsnapped
there's three screws holding on the
motherboard to the frame so take those
out two more wire cables up at the top
and the motherboard will slide away from
the phone so here's the motherboard it's
got the Qualcomm processor in it as well
as all the memory and RAM and everything
else that your phone needs to work none
of it is reducer replaceable so unless
you have some pretty complex soldering
tools you're just out of luck here is
the loudspeaker which is user
replaceable it's got just a little
ribbon cable connector that plugs into
the motherboard and once again the parts
will be listed in the video description
below
just like the charging port lucky for us
is replaceable usually one of the things
that goes out first on a device the
headphone jack is also included with
this part as well which is nice battery
comes out fairly easily there is a
little bit of adhesive that holds it to
the LCD so be careful when you're
sliding your pry tool underneath because
all of the pressure is going on the LCD
as well and if you plan on reusing your
screen you want to be gentle make sure
you pull away those volume rockers as
well so you don't damage that cable when
you're pulling the battery out here's
the battery it's a 2600 milliamp pretty
decent size for a cell phone
replacement batteries hopefully will be
found a video description as well four
screws holding down the dotted board and
after smart you'll take out the little
screw holding the camera in as well so
when you pull that away from the board
it'll come with it remove the SIM card
ribbon cable as well as the front facing
camera ribbon cable and the vibrator
motor plug you just want to unplug that
from the little device itself so the
power button up here at the top is held
down in a little slot so slide that up
and
and it is also connected to the top of
the front-facing camera to a grounding
strap so make sure you pull that off as
well
front facing camera comes away once the
motherboard is away from the phone
daughterboard sorry it's a five
megapixel camera and then here's the
camera the dual camera on the back of
the phone it's probably in a metal case
because any variation in the distance
would mess up the depth perception
feature that the camera is used for with
the phone it's a pretty unique little
thing that HTC has going on there is the
earpiece and now here is the replacement
screen see the screen comes with the
metal frame as well as the two
replacement brackets that go over the
front-facing camera and the bottom
speaker so if your replacement screen
does not come with all of this stuff you
probably bought the wrong piece and
you're going to want to get the whole
replacement kit because the glass only
repair is a completely different repair
and very very very difficult now to put
the phone back together I clasped the
rear-facing camera into the motherboard
first daughterboard and then set that
into place along with the front-facing
camera just plug those little ribbon
cable connectors in like Legos slid the
power button back down into a slot and
grounded it on top of the front-facing
camera again and now I'm plugging back
in the SIM card trays remember there's
this one and one more on the other side
so be very careful when you are plugging
those back in get the vibrator motor
plugged in if you are replacing your
screen you'll probably need to transfer
the vibrator motor over from your old
screen to your new one don't forget to
do that unless you don't like vibrations
get those five screws plugged into the
daughter board and the battery can go
back into place make sure you have all
of the ribbon cables on the correct side
of the battery you don't want to be
looking for those later on when you're
trying to put it all back together again
get the charging port back into place
really pleased that this is user
replaceable it's nice that HTC made it
easy for us
lift up the rear camera a little bit
when you're sliding the motherboard back
into place
it does need to be sitting on top of the
motherboard
then grab the ribbon cable connectors
plug them in and then just latch each
one of them down individually make sure
they're pressed in as far as they can go
there's little tabs on each of the
little ribbon cables that you can use to
press in and plug it into a little slot
and these little wire cable connectors
make sure it's seated correctly on top a
little plug before you press it all the
way in three screws on the motherboard
plug in some more wire cables in
battery cable clasp it in like a little
Lego get those two screws back into
place as well it's really important to
keep your screws organized obviously
they're all different sizes so keep them
grouped together maybe label them on a
piece of paper as you're taking your
phone apart pretty straightforward with
all these little ribbon cables plug them
in latch them down and keep on going
this is a little short stubby little guy
so you got to kind of wiggle them into
place and then use the extra tabs and
then maybe some leverage so you can plug
in back in and have him stay there
get the little wire cables press back
into place make sure you're seated
correctly you don't want to bend the
little connection on the mainboard
because once that's bent you don't have
a second chance so get it on there and
press it into place and you're good to
go I'm going to test my screen before I
put the backplate on because that is
honestly the hardest part of this repair
getting that backplate on and off it
looks like my screen is good to go the
touch sensitivity works color looks fine
if you have any liens or anything else
on your screen test the connections
first if they are still there after all
the connections are good then you
probably have a bad screen get the tape
back into place over those ribbon cable
connectors and then I had a problem with
my power button falling out I don't know
if that's going to be an issue with
everybody but just make sure that's
placed well into the frame and then
start with the charging port end of the
phone and then once that's pressed in
you can press the rest of the phone in
place my power button fell out again but
after some convincing I got it back into
place and snap the screen back into the
metal frame and you can see it snapped
in fairly well
you can hardly tell the phone has been
taken apart make sure to screw it back
in bottom four screws in the top two
screws now here's the cool part these
are the replacement metal pieces for the
top and bottom of the phone they're
actually really inexpensive so you it's
probably worth your time to buy the
replacement once instead of trying to
make the old ones work they come with
their own adhesive which is really nice
you can just take it press it into place
I usually lined it up with the bottom of
the screen and then just snap the rest
of it into place fairly easily pretty
straightforward I did find out that the
lens from my first piece and second
metal piece was different so I had to
take off the front-facing camera lens
from the old screen and then use the new
screen pieces to just set over the top
of it and it worked a lot better you can
see the old camera lens just sitting
there on the bottom but since as a new
one is just fine make sure there's no
dust or anything down inside of that
when you're putting it back together get
the SIM cards in place and there you go
once again all parts and tools and
everything that you'll need to be found
