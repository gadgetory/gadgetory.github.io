so every time a new phone comes out I
get curious as to how much abuse it can
take before breaking today I'm going to
give the durability test to a brand new
fully functional HTC m9 to start off
let's see how the brushed aluminum body
handles my car keys even though it left
some pretty heavy marks most of them can
be rubbed off I do make constructive
videos as well like the m9 repair video
you see in the upper left hand corner I
will also link that in the video
description below if you want to watch
that after this one if you take a razor
blade and slice into the back of your
phone it cuts pretty deep into the
aluminum surprise surprise taking my
razor blade and carving into the side of
the phone doesn't do as much damage it
takes that point to make any grooves
let's try the front glass this is
Gorilla Glass for the exact same stuff
on the galaxy s6 so there's no surprise
here that my keys aren't doing any
damage to it
the Gorilla Glass 4 is actually more
hard than my keys are so neither the
keys nor the razor blade can do any
damage to the screen you can see the
screen flex with how much pressure I'm
putting on it now because the screen is
so hard it does sacrifice a little bit
when it comes to how brittle it is an
impact or extreme pressure can make the
whole thing shatter you'll see what I
mean when I start testing the rear
camera lens you can see that there are
zero scratches on the screen this is
super impressive to me even with a sharp
razor blade it does absolutely nothing
to the glass here's a fun little side
lesson for you your eyes can't see
infrared light but my camera can so if
you take a remote control and point it
at the camera you can see the infrared
light pulses the phone also has an
infrared light that it uses as a
proximity sensor so that's what you see
blinking at the top of the phone you can
try it yourself with your own remote and
cell phone camera back to destruction
the front-facing camera is easily
scratched it is not made of Gorilla
Glass or sapphire glass the rear camera
suppose we made a sapphire glass though
and it would make it unscratched Bowl
but due to the scratch proof miss it is
much more brittle as you can see with
hardly any pressure the back camera lens
cracks probably because there isn't much
structural support underneath it I
expect this to be a big problem with
people's m9 s in the future hit that
like button if you're glad this is my
phone and not yours just for kicks and
giggles let's burn this guy I did all of
these same tests on the galaxy s6 if you
want to check out that video
I will link it here and in the video
description below the aluminum body
holds up just as expected it is easy to
wipe off the smoke marks the screen on
the other hand the pixels stopped
responding when there is extreme heat
this screen did not hold up as long as
the galaxy s6 did under flame but it
still mostly recovered once the heat was
removed and was allowed to cool off
before we hit that climax make sure
you're subscribed to my youtube channel
this next scene is a little gruesome and
I would hate if I lost you in a carnage
let's move on to the bin test
I thought the solid aluminium body would
do a much better job of holding this
phone together but I was actually really
really surprised at how easy this phone
was to bend it looks like the weakest
point is right there where that power
button is right smack dab in the middle
of the frame it wouldn't even turn on
now that the button is broken it really
did not take much force at all to bend
in half the closest thing that I can
compare it to is taking three spoons and
bending them with your hands that's how
little pressure it would take to bend
this phone so unless you're Tinker Bell
don't sit on it long story short I am
pretty disappointed in this phone not
only is it extremely difficult to repair
but it also royally fails durability on
every account except scratches on the
screen check out some of my other videos
we have the m9 tear down an invisible
charging station and my Instagram is
pretty fun as well thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
