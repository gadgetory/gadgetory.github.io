phone – with all the bells and whistles
a tech enthusiast could ask for is here.
But is it durable?
Can the under-screen ultrasonic fingerprint
scanner handle a few scratches?
Do the included headphones use a headphone
jack?
There's only one way to find out.
Let's go.
Wait....no....that's not it.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
The Galaxy S10 is the one with the infinity-o
display.
It's easy to remember because it's kind of
got a cheerio in the top corner.
As always, we start with the scratch test,
which means the included plastic screen protector
which means the included plastic screen protector
should probably come off first.
Samsungs have always held up very well during
my durability test.
In fact, the first phone I ever tested was
a Samsung Galaxy S6 four years ago.
And to be honest, physically not much has
changed since then.
The screen bezels have shrunk of course, giving
the S10 a more modern feel.
If the screen were made of plastic, it would
scratch at a level 3.
Sapphire would scratch at a level 8.
And here with the S10, we see scratches at
a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level
7.
The 10 megapixel front facing cheerio camera
is tucked up in here, protected by the same
Gorilla Glass 6, and unscratchable by my razor
blade.
We'll go down and check the ultrasonic fingerprint
scanner in just a second.
The speaker grill is also up here, tucked
into the black sliver of a bezel.
And it looks to be made of metal with rhombus
shaped holes to let the sound through.
Fun fact: the rhombus shape is never really
naturally found out in nature.
Hexagons, on the other hand, are everywhere.
Honeycomb, rocks, turtle shells, snake skin,
bubbles.
It's literally the most efficient and least
wasteful shape found in nature, and is structurally
sound.
And currently makes up dbrand's most textured
skin yet called Swarm.
Applying this skin will make it appear like
you know all kinds of cool nature facts without
needing to go outside.
Plus, you avoid social interaction altogether
with online ordering.
Win-win for everyone.
Thanks to dbrand for sponsoring this video.
Link in the description.
Three cameras adorn the back of the S10 this
year: a 12 megapixel telephoto, a 12 megapixel
normal camera, and a 16 megapixel ultra wide
camera.
The perfect trifecta, all protected with the
flash underneath a slab of glass.
I'll pull off the Swarm cuz what we do next
happens without protection.
Aluminum is the metal of choice this year
again for Samsung, even on the buttons.
It might not be as durable or heavy as stainless
steel, but it is cheaper and easier to work
with, and is usually still more structural
than plastic.
The bottom has a USB-C port 
that can connect with a keyboard and monitor
to act like a PC with decks.
It also still has a headphone jack that can
accept credit card readers or external microphones,
and headphones.
Good guy to have around.
Bixby is still here, but supposedly can be
remapped now to activate another app.
Thanks Samsung.
The buttons still come out and are actually
purple inside this time.
Purple might not be my favorite color, but
it's consistent on all the buttons.
Each of them have the same purple niblets.
No purple on the SIM and expandable SD card
tray though, even with the removable buttons
on the Galaxy S10, it's still IP68 water resistant.
It's nice to have that extra protection against
liquids.
I'll get the buttons back in.
Now this might just be my imagination, but
every time a new phone comes out, I feel like
people seem to collectively lose their minds
over the smallest improvements, when in reality,
taking a step back shows that not a whole
lot has changed in the last few years.
Samsung did manage to flip the wireless charging
around, so now it can give and receive wireless
power.
It will be fun to see what it looks like inside
during the teardown.
Before we check the fingerprint scanner, let's
talk about the screen.
The smaller bezels do make it look futuristic
and cool.
Each of Samsung's stock wallpaper is dark
in the upper right hand corner to hide the
cheerio-looking camera.
The S10 has a 6.1 inch infinity-o display,
with HDR10 and 1440 resolution.
I left my lighter in place for about 30 seconds
before a white mark started to appear.
But then, when the heat was removed, the pixels
completely recovered and went back to normal.
Flame still evaporates the outer oleophobic
coating of course, so don't try this at home.
The real reason we're here though is to durability
test the new ultrasonic fingerprint scanner
– the first of it's kind.
The ultrasonic scanner uses high frequency
sound waves pass through the screen to hit
your fingerprint and reflect back down into
the sensor.
Kind of like that echo location that bats
use.
Setting up my fingerprint was easy enough.
The screen itself doesn't need to illuminate
since it's all done with sound waves, and
it works super quick, every single time with
a cool little ripple animation.
But what happens if the front glass becomes
scratched or cracked?
Will the fingerprint scanner still function?
Let's bring over the deeper grooves level
7 pick, and we'll rough up the glass to mimic
a substantial amount of abuse.
We can all agree that this phone is much more
scratched than could ever happen naturally
out in the wild.
It's pretty brutal and almost makes me sad
inside, but science must continue.
Even with the heavy unrealistic abuse, the
fingerprint scanner is able to read the high
frequency sound waves bouncing from my already
programmed fingerprint, and unlocks the phone
every single time with no struggles.
Thumbs up for that.
It's good to know that normal scratches will
never inhibit the fingerprint reader.
We'll check and see what happens with cracks
in the glass in just a second.
First we got to try the bend test.
With only minor changes to the overall glass
sandwich design in the last four years.
Samsung phones have always been super solid,
and this Galaxy S10 is no exception.
Whether pressure is applied from the front
or the back, there is no flex to the phone,
and no glass separation on the back panel
or the front screen.
No kinks, no cracks, and no damage done to
the water resistance to the phone.
The Galaxy S10 passes the bend test and is
an impressively solid phone.
What happens though if there are cracks over
the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner?
Would cracks be enough to deflect the sound
waves and disable the fingerprint scanner.
Let's bump things up to a level 8 beyond scratches
and deeper grooves, this level 8 pick creates
gouges that only sapphire resists, effectively
imitating cracks in glass.
The glass directly above the scanner is a
mess now and unfortunately the fingerprint
scanning ability is not able to function.
Completely unable to recognize my fingerprint.
The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is out
of order.
Yeah I can draw a pattern and use the less
secure face ID, but the fingerprint scanner
is no more.
A while ago, MKBHD took sandpaper to scuff
up the glass over an optical in-screen scanner,
and afterward it still functioned just fine.
So in comparing the two side by side, my initial
impression is that the ultrasonic scanners,
like the one in the S10, are more affected
by scratches than an optical scanner would
be.
Either way, technology is pretty cool.
If you want a feature rich premium smartphone
with all the bells and whistles currently
available, the S10 is the phone for you.
But it's kind of also just another rectangle
with marginal improvements over last year's
phone.
I'm going to keep using my Galaxy S8 Plus
for a little while longer.
I don't feel the need to switch just yet.
You can always plop a skin on your old phone
and pretend it's new, and then take that $1,000
you just saved and fly to Hawaii and back.
Who knows, maybe nature is worth visiting.
Feel free to spam my Twitter with natural
hexagons if you go outside, and use your fingerprint
to hit the subscribe button.
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
