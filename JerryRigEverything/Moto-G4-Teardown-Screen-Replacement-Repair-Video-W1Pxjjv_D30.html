that passed my durability test it's time
to take it apart and see what it's made
of I have an unopened g5 on my desk the
life would not be complete without a
teardown of its older sibling first we
can test the g5 tomorrow let's get
started
it's a pleasant change when I finally
tear down a device that isn't glued shut
the back panel is removable but that
only gives you access to the sim and SD
card trays everything else is still
hidden under 19 T 4 screws surrounding
that back plastic panel at this point we
can pretty safely assume that the more
screws the phone has the more durable
it's going to be there is one ribbon
that we need to disconnect before
lifting off that back panel it's under
this rubber tab the little ribbon that
unsnaps goes to the camera sensor and
flashed the two gold tabs on the
opposite side go to the earpiece I'll
show you that in just a second now this
tape does not come off in one piece so
if you do swap out your screen or
battery it's going to be easy to tell
that someone has been inside of your
phone the battery connector is a pretty
flimsy little two prong plug you don't
see the type of connector very often
anymore the battery unfortunately does
not have any magic pull tabs either
instead it requires a bit of aggressive
negotiation I'm using that flat side of
my metal pry tool taking special care
not to puncture anything since a
punctured battery would be the end of
your phone this guy is at 3000 milliamp
power which is actually the same size as
the new Galaxy s8 interesting the
eccentric rotating mass vibrator motor
is over here at the bottom of the phone
with the same type of connector that we
saw the battery using it's tucked under
this black little rubber blanket that
also covers the non modular micro USB
charging port there are two more t4
screws holding down the motherboard some
phone manufacturers who I won't name
seem to be ashamed of their headphone
jack but we have Motorola over here
rolling out the red carpet on top of
theirs thumbs up for the red decorations
Motorola it's actually got a really
interesting design this headphone jack
ideally pulls out leaving a ribbon with
gold contact pads inside a little hole
in the frame
totally modular before the motherboard
can lift out of the screen frame I'll
disconnect the screen ribbon it's under
the copper tape and we had the last
little ribbon for the headphone jack up
here at the top I'll lift up the latch
connector and slip it out with my
tweezers before we look at the screen
let's talk about the mainboard
specifically the cameras the front
camera has a little bit of gold tape
covering the latch connector
I'll set that off to the side next to
the water damage indicator once that
tape is off the latch will lift up
unlocking the front camera and it can
slip out and away from the motherboard
the rear camera is on the other side it
has the same type of latch connector
that we've seen all over this
and then both cameras are free the
camera on the left of the larger 13
megapixel camera this camera only shoots
in 1080p but since most TVs and
computers are still displaying 1080
that's fine for the moment it's just not
future proof the iPhone 6 on the shoots
in 1080p as well and a lot of people are
still using those phones the
front-facing camera is 5 megapixels
neither of them have optical image
stabilization now remember that huge
speaker grille on the front of the phone
this is pretty interesting actually take
a look at this tiny speaker back here
talk about compensating I'll what about
the extremely large speaker grille
material so we can see exactly what's
going on there are a few screw holes but
the speaker is literally only shooting
out of that far left side of the grill
such a strange placement it's not even
in the center it's such a small speaker
for such a large hole maybe the sound is
supposed to echo down that chamber or
something kind of weird
either way this is the replacement
screen now and like always I'll be
including replacement parts in the video
description
luckily the Moto G 4 screens are pretty
cheap now you might need to separate the
old LCD from the frame just use some
heat to soften the glue remove it and
then reuse the frame for your next
screen the replacement screen should
come with adhesive pre-installed once
you get the new screen into frame the
rest of the assembly is pretty simple
I'll tuck that earpiece back into the
frame then the motherboard can literally
click down into place make sure the
external power and volume buttons are
lined up with the motherboard or you'll
have problems later on new screen gets
clicked and with the metallic tape over
the top of the connector then the
headphone jack ribbon can get slipped
into the little slot and lock down with
the little latch the vibrator motor
needs be sitting into the frame along
with the two silver T 4 head screws that
go into the two holes on the motherboard
lay out the red carpet for the set phone
Jack couldn't agree more
and finally the battery goes in with its
little flimsy motherboard connector make
sure and tuck the black and red wire
underneath the plastic brackets right
there alongside the battery the back
plastic slides on then you can clip the
flash ribbon connector into place
and 19 screws later I'll toss the
exterior back panel on the phone and
here it satisfyingly snap all around the
back and it's over the phone is back
together and fully functional you can
join me tomorrow to the durability test
of the Moto G 5 we'll see if the new
metal design holds up as good as its
plastic sibling and check it out I just
did a whole repair video with that one
saying the
leggo and never mind thanks for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
