on the Galaxy Note 2 in the galaxy s4
were interchangeable so I grabbed two of
the phones and I took them apart and to
take a look and find out for myself so
here you can see the motherboard from
the Galaxy Note 2 with the camera and
the motherboard from the note I'm sorry
from the Galaxy s4 with the camera and
you know first off you can see that the
cameras are different site is obviously
to be some physical modification but
looking at the back of the cameras you
can see that both of them have a semi
similar port on the back I will pop
these off and show you so right there
and the cameras the jack bonus cells
where they actually connect to the phone
that they're different so one is
slightly longer than the other one so it
won't work just out of curiosity you
know I kind of went through all the
other connections on the on the
motherboards and there is actually
nothing that goes from one phone to the
other and even with these sensors right
here we have the the camera and the
light sensor you would think the light
sensor or something super simple maybe
just plug the play the shiz out of that
but even the light sensors are designed
completely different and they will not
work with either the phones anyway so
that's it if you have any questions be
sure to leave them in the comments don't
forget to like if the video helped you
and don't forget to subscribe thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
