the driver side motor mount on a
Mitsubishi Galant this one's a 1999 the
driver side motor mount is actually
underneath the battery you can see it
tucked down in there the two little
holes are the same two little holes that
are right here your battery connection
might be a little bit different than
mine I just unscrewed these two little
wing nuts right here and then the whole
contraption just lifts up and away from
the battery disconnect the battery
terminals with the ten millimeter bolt
you're in a little ledge for the battery
there are two bolts here and then two
bolts down here all of those are 12
millimeter and then there's two 10
millimeter bolts right here on this
little wire bracket thing and that takes
off the little shelf for the battery
bracket alright so this little guy is
bolted in directly on top of that bolt
right there
seventeen millimeter just took it right
off and then I have my on each of the
four bolts down there one here one there
one there and then one underneath in
that little slot they are 17 millimeters
and so I stabbed my breaker bar right
there with little extension piece 17
millimeter attachment I'm just breaking
each of these loose all right so I took
out the air filter box basically it's
just a bunch of those little 10mm 10
millimeter bolts just are sitting around
the outside and then unplug this as well
just by pressing that down and pulling
it out
built-in millimeter screw right here as
well and then that will give me more
access to work on my motor mount
underneath all these cables
these things are in the absolute worst
position possible so if you look at the
new motor mount there's a hole through
the center of it on this motor mount
there is a 17 millimeter bolt that sits
right here going through the motor mount
and there's a 17 millimeter nut on this
end that I have attached two wrenches to
- wretches ones on this end ones on this
end and so as I turn this one the other
ones holding it still holding the nut
still so that this will ratchet off if I
didn't have both wrenches it would just
turn and turn and turn and never come
off and I would do this loosen up the
center bolt before you take off all four
of the base bolts that way this doesn't
shake around when you're undoing it so
in order to have enough room to get the
engine to get that transmission mount
away from the engine you have to take
off this huge bar underneath the engine
so these two bolts are 18 millimeters
and these are the two bolts along on the
backside of the bar this one and this
one that need to be taken off and then
once you take this bar off that'll let
you lower the engine enough to let the
give enough space between the engine and
the frame to get that motor mount out
and now
there's enough room for me to lift this
up and out so you can see the inside of
there's just all torn up and that's
what's causing the vibrations in the car
anyway keep those little pads because
you're going to install them on the next
one as well with a little persuasion I
got the new mount on the old bolts that
are sticking out and now I'm going to
lift the engine back up so that it will
fit back in the holes that it needs to
and with a little more persuasion I got
the bolt in through that eye of the
mount and it's sticking through right
over here
basically I just took it in there and
kind of wedged it down so that it would
line up the other end of the bolt with
the hole on this side and then I have
this little cat spot right here that I
could use to kind of pry it up just
metal-on-metal and kind of get the whole
line just a little bit just make sure
you don't hit the rubber or else it'll
break the mount again all right so
everything's back in place there's the
two screws on the front of the bar the
two bolts two bolts on the front of the
bar two bolts on the back of the bar we
have the engine mount in place
underneath the battery batteries back on
batteries type down boxes in place hoses
are screwed down wires back together
that's how you change the engine mount
and the Mitsubishi Galant if you have
any questions make sure to leave them in
