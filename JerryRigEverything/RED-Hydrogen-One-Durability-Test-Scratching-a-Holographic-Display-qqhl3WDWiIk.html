the most expensive phones I've ever
tested here on my channel coming in at a
whopping $1,300 I originally purchased
the $1600 titanium version but that's
been delayed for a few more months red
was nice enough to send out the aluminum
version along with this massive sticky
paperweight thing to help tide us over
until the titanium version comes out one
of the reasons these phones are probably
so expensive might be because we're
paying for the fancy metal and plastic
envelopes and laid into the cardboard
box the people normally display the box
their phone comes in announced over a
year ago with mini delays it's finally
time to assess the build quality of the
red hydrogen one let's get started
the first impression right out of the
box is that this thing is massive and
hefty metal is everywhere with deep
unique rugged corrugated grips along
both sides and the back panel it's
definitely one of the most unique
looking phones of this year the biggest
high point of this phone has been the
display read claims that they're for
view light-filled display creates an
experience beyond 3d that the world
never saw coming
the idrija 'none has two cameras on the
back so it can take these 3d holographic
picture things you can get a pretty good
idea of what it's supposed to look like
as I wiggle the phone back and forth
just in real life you don't need to
wiggle the phone to get this effect
because it's built right into the screen
it's really kind of like an automatic
digital magic eye it's interesting for
sure and with a 1300 our price tag we
hold the advertising and promises to a
whole new level I'm not the biggest fan
of meaningless advertising buzzwords so
when red says the world never saw this
coming
I got a step back and point out that HTC
did basically this exact same thing
seven years ago seven back in the year
2011 a year before my YouTube channel
was even born
the HTC released the Evo 3d with dual 3d
cameras on the back I just picked up
this little guy for $60 on eBay we'll do
a little camera comparison between the
Evo 3d and it's red hydrogen 1
counterpart holding both phones
side-by-side shows the exact same 3d
depth effect going on with each screen
we get the same shifty pop with both
images this is probably one of those
situations where red would have been
better off not hyping the display the
technology has definitely improved in
the last 7 years of course but it's
still been around for a long time and
it's not the $1,300 display I feel we
were promised let's jump into the
durability with a scratch test
like always we check to see what the
holographic screen is made from plastic
was scratched at level three glass
scratches at a 6 and real sapphire
crystal scratches at level 8 or 9 red as
using Gorilla Glass to cover their
holographic tech and indeed we see
scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves
at a level 7 similar to the razor phone
we have some massive speaker grilles at
the top and bottom of this phone the top
grille houses dual eight point three
megapixel front-facing cameras
that can also produce the same Auto
stereogram ik 3d effect as the rear
cameras both image sensors are protected
with glass along with the other sensors
on the right side the speaker grille
itself is made from black plastic
similar to the Razer foam the bottom
speaker grille is the same black plastic
which can be removed interestingly
enough even though the exterior plastic
grille looks like it has two speaker
locations there's only one small
interior slit where the sound comes out
it'll look super glamorous and pretty on
the outside but rather underwhelming in
reality so far the red hydrogen one is
not quite turning out like it's
hypothetical snapchat filter implied it
would these sides though are impressive
made with big textured aluminium ridges
there is no phone quite like it the
volume buttons are both made from metal
the rugged aluminum finger grips are
mirrored on the opposite side and this
includes a dedicated camera button with
a small red plastic inlay seems to be
reds theme no complaints the fingerprint
scanner and power button is also over
here and can be scratched although with
the height of the ridges on either side
protecting it from rubbing against
anything
I highly doubt scratching will be an
issue even then if it does get heavily
scratched it still recognizes my
fingerprint and functions every single
time the top of the phone is made from
aluminum along with the sim and SD card
tray and strangely enough this flagship
still has a headphone jack probably
because this phone was announced a year
ago when headphone jacks were still cool
either way I'm glad it's here the bottom
has a USB C port and a lot more metal
now for the back of the phone red has
put a lot of emphasis on their
industrial aluminum design with durable
Kevlar panels which I'm not really sure
what they mean by durable it scratches
about the same level as plastic and
peels up like a giant sticker at least
the copper accessory attachment pad
doesn't peel off that would be awkward
that part might still be real although
no accessories exist yet so it's hard to
say for sure the thick ribbed aluminum
backplate is all metal you can see that
silver shine through under the black
coating I wonder if these ribs will help
guide the hypothetical accessories into
place when they become available the red
media machine logo is
from metal with an unscratched will red
inlay in the center it's kind of neat
the massive camera lens is covering dual
twelve point three megapixel cameras
both of which are used for that 3d
effect and have no wide-angle or
telephoto options the dual tone flash is
made from plastic and we have another
scratch Abul kevlar sticker panel up
here at the top I'm pretty sure I saw a
D brand version of this for like ten
bucks the design of the hydrogen-1 is a
lot like getting catfished on tinder the
pixel orientation of the hydrogen one
might be a tad different than your
standard LCD so it gets that holographic
depth effect but it is still an LCD we
should see the pixels on the red
hydrogen's 5.7 inch 1440p IPS LCD start
to go black with the heat from my red
lighter but when the heat is removed the
pixels start to recover this proves that
taking a lighter to the screen has been
useful at least one time in the last
hundred smartphone durability tests I
knew it would be useful someday thumbs
up to the hard-working ladder doing his
job and now for the bin test with how
much metal is oozing out the size of
this phone it's pretty reasonable to
assume it's built like a tank and the
only way to know for sure is to apply
unreasonable pressure to an unreasonably
priced device but when doing so we get
zero flex not even a creek or a pop the
red hydrogen one might be seven years
late with screen technology using
misleading plastic speaker grilles with
built in kevlar stickers but they sure
did make a very rigid and structural
smart phone is it worth $1,300 I'm not a
big fan of the over-promising
under-delivering premium costing
buzzwords so I'm gonna have to go with a
no on this one for now I definitely see
potential down the road though when the
price drops by probably half hit that
