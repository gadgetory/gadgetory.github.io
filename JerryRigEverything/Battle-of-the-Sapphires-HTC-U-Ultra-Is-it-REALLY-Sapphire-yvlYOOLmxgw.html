in common
sapphire pure synthetic sapphires one of
the hardest minerals on the planet
usually falling at an eight or a nine on
Mohs scale of hardness right below the
hardness level of diamonds while regular
clear glass and clear sapphire might
look the same on the outside they're
actually made from entirely different
materials T so a watch manufacturer uses
sapphire instead of glass on their
premium watches this makes sense from a
durability perspective because the
Sapphire will remain scratch free
forever
unless your watch is coming in contact
with diamonds on a regular basis of
course glass would be cheaper to
manufacture but it also scratches at
level five or six sapphire is much more
expensive to make but its hardness level
and scratch resistance makes it very
appealing for use in high-end gadgets
and electronics HTC recently released a
special deluxe sapphire version of their
HTC u ultra with a sapphire crystal
display this sapphire version of the
ultra is being slowly rolled out to
multiple countries at the moment
and somehow dbrand managed to score me
one of the early ones for my tests so
thanks for the pink phone guys I
appreciate it if you can overlook a few
missing features and a lack of a
headphone jack
the HTC u ultra is actually a pretty
good-looking phone on the outside this
cosmetic pink finish is rather exquisite
and last but not least we have the most
expensive screen protector in the world
from Zack costing a mind-blowing fifty
US dollars this sag screen protector
advertises a hybrid glass with real
sapphire crystals infused inside of the
protector the box also claims
unparalleled scratch protection so we'll
have to see how this holds up so far
it's feeling and acting a lot like
plastic today we're going to find out
which of these devices are using real
quality sapphire and which companies are
just taking advantage of this sapphire
hypetrain and using advertising
buzzwords to empty the wallets of their
unsuspecting customers one of the
easiest ways to tell different minerals
apart is by their hardness level plastic
scratches at level three glass
the five or six and sapphire would be an
eight or a nine diamonds are the hardest
mineral on earth topping scale at a
level ten Mohs scale has been used by
geologists and scientists for over 200
years now I'll go down the line
scratching each sapphire object in order
with the same tip to see which one
scratches first already at level three
we start running into problems with that
unmatched scratch protection on the
world's most expensive screen protector
pretty embarrassing it is very heavily
scratched at a level three just like we
would see on any other plastic screen or
plastic screen protector that would cost
a few pennies very disappointing you
might be better off just taping a fifty
dollar bill to the front of your phone
and hoping for the best last time I
checked sapphire doesn't catch fire
either plastic on the other hand would
catch fire not sure why this protector
is marketed as a hybrid glass material
when is clearly neither glass nor
sapphire now you might be thinking to
yourself hey Jerry isn't false
advertising illegal but before we grab
the pitchforks though I did do an
elemental analysis of this screen
protector and I did find trace amounts
of aluminum oxide inside of the plastic
so technically Zagg isn't lying about
the elemental makeup of the protector
they did toss some aluminum dust into
the mix but it's still pretty darn
sketchy advertising in my opinion and
this melted glob of plastic definitely
does not live up to the hype on the box
so don't buy this the levels two and
three pick did absolutely nothing to the
HTC u ultra nor the T so watch no
surprises there
now levels four and five pics are still
relatively soft metals these are where
most razor blades keys and coins would
fall like nickel as a level four and
steel is a 4.5 and still the phone and
the watch are unscathed normal glass
won't start to scratch until level 5 or
6 and if you've watched any of my other
videos the majority of tempered glass
smartphones these days will scratch at a
6 I did run into a problem a few months
ago with the impure sapphire that Apple
is using on their camera lenses this
also scratched at a level 6 I made a
whole video on that subject which I'll
link in the video description
either way level six and seven are where
things usually start to get interesting
I honestly had zero expectations for
this HTC ultra it's incredibly hard to
make pure sapphire sapphire is actually
grown inside of large furnaces and
because of its hardness level and
brittleness the shaping process is very
difficult especially when creating
larger objects like phone displays the
company that was contracted to make the
sapphire displays for Apple's old iPhone
6 actually went bankrupt trying so it's
impressive that HTC has gotten this far
and we can see here that the level 6 and
7 pix did absolutely nothing to the
display of the HTC u ultra sapphire
Edition only when we started scratching
with the levels 8 &amp;amp; 9 is where we start
to see some damage both the sapphire
ultra and the T so watchface have
started to scratch it does look like HTC
was true to their marketing though and
they use solid quality sapphire I am
very impressed the sapphire crystal
screen of the HTC u ultra is the most
scratch resistant smartphone screen I
have ever tested definitely deserves a
thumbs up keep in mind that not every
altra is sapphire if this is a special
edition phone that does cost a lot more
so the T so watch passes the sapphire
test and the HTC u ultra definitely
passes as well but that $50 sapphire
defense hybrid screen protector from zag
is an overpriced overhyped
buzzword filled piece of advertising
garbage that takes advantage of
unsuspecting old ladies who don't know
any better I'm seriously not a fan
you're better off buying a five pack of
screen protectors from Amazon for a
dollar apiece I'll link them in the
description of this video if HTC can
bring back all the flagship features
they drop from the ultra and plop a
sapphire display on their next flagship
phone they might have an epic winner on
their hands I have my fingers crossed
for HTC if you know someone who could
use some real sapphire on their
smartphones or protection from fake
sapphire show them this video and if you
want that fire on your phone let me know
in the comments thanks dome for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
