the Nokia 3310 this is that awesome
invincible phone with the snake to game
on it
we have photographic evidence that this
phone is invincible and I know that it's
true because I saw it on the Internet so
let's open it up and see what's inside
turn it off slide off the back cover and
remove the old-school lithium-ion
battery and SIM card and then without
any effort that front panel will pop off
the plastic buttons can also be easily
removed for the front panel you will
need a t6 driver to remove the six
screws tools will be linked down in the
video description once those screws are
out there are a few clasps on each side
that hold the front panel and circuit
board in place the screen you see here
is an 84 by 48 resolution monochrome
graphic display let's take a look at
what else is inside this phone Oh what
is this this must be why they call it a
brick phone it has an actual real
life-size brick inside pretty impressive
actually I can see now why the phone is
as durable as it is let's take a look at
the circuit board on the front you can
see the contact points for the front
buttons and on the back here you can see
the adamantium encapsulated Faraday
cages a Faraday cage is a grounded metal
screen that surrounds the circuit board
to exclude electrostatic and
electromagnetic influences if we pop off
the cage you can see this is the snake
from the snake game it must be some type
of analog to digital conversion that
makes it function inside of the
circuitry let's pop off the bottom
Faraday cage and that's why they call it
snake 2 because there are two snakes and
they actually take turns on screen smart
move by Nokia don't want them getting
tired and quitting here's the exposed
circuit board up here we have the
transmogrified arc reactor a non binary
transistor which isn't super logical in
any sense of the word nutri transistors
have been widely regarded as nonsensical
over here we have the inverse parametric
and Cabul ated flux capacitor this helps
with the hydro Coptics sinusoidal
directons while synchronizing the retro
unilateral magneto reluctance resistor
overall a solid build I am pretty
impressed these LED lights are built in
flush with the circuit board to help
make the
phone as extraordinarily thin as it is
well let's put it back together I'll
keep one of these little snakes as a pet
and tuck the other one back inside to
keep on working kind of like the iPhone
sweatshops in China before I finish look
at the size of this vibrator I have
never seen one this big inside of a cell
phone before get those six screws back
into place and pop the front panel back
on once the battery is back in you can
use the top power button to turn it on
and look at these boot times infinitely
faster than both Android and iPhone I'll
be using this as my daily driver for the
next few months it has everything a tech
enthusiast could possibly need thanks
for watching hit that subscribe button
and share the nostalgia with your
friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
