the iPhone X you can call whatever you
want I'm not sure anyone knows what its
real name is anymore for a guy inside
the box Apple was nice enough to include
some headphones and an external
headphone jack to replace the one they
remove from the phone earlier
these cost $10 a piece if you lose it
it's time to durability test this newest
addition to the Apple family and see
what we can expect from the
top-of-the-line Apple flagship I am
worried about these antenna lines it'll
be interesting to see if they give up
the ghost like we saw in the pixel 2 or
if Apple's stainless steel frame is
strong enough to hold this fruit
together let's get started
starting with a scratch test this brand
new super retina top-of-the-line
one-of-a-kind HD LED display is the same
one that some Android phones have been
using for the past seven years
right now Orange tin the glass above the
display I'm scoring the surface with a
set of Mohs hardness pics to see how
scratch resistant the glass is plastic
scratches at level three and pure
sapphire would scratch at level eight or
nine most flagships these days like the
LGV 30 or pixel to scratch at a little
six and that's exactly what we're seeing
here with this iPhone X I mean ten it
has a normal scratch at level six and a
deeper groove at a level seven it was
interesting to see that both Google and
Apple are using beech pitchers for their
stock background I kept half expecting
apples to move as well but they'll
probably invent that next year the good
news is is that the screen is not going
to be scratched by your normal keys or
coins these metals are softer than the
level six glass hardness not even my
razor blade can do any damage it was a
little strange to not find a home button
at the bottom of the phone there is no
fingerprint scanner to test since the
phone is unlocked with your face this
time around and I'm not gonna scratch
test a face to see if it still works or
not the phone can be woken up with just
a tap to the screen so I don't think the
home button being gone is too big of a
deal
Apple is running out of things to remove
though so it'll be interesting to see
what happens next year up here at the
top of the phone inside the iconic black
knotch is the metal earpiece grille
slightly recessed under the glass the
metal grille holds its shape and won't
be falling out plus the holes are small
enough to keep dirt and metal shavings
from getting inside the magnetic speaker
thumbs up for that design the 7
megapixel front facing camera is under
the same glass as the screen so no
scratches happening here the back of the
phone is also covered in glass and this
is where things start to get bad for us
as consumers the scratch resistance is
normal with no damage being done by my
razor blade the iPhone logo is
underneath the glass so it won't be
rubbing off or get damaged that's a good
thing
it looks like this was the same tempered
glass that was used on the front of the
phone scratching at level 6 on Mohs
scale so keys and coins won't do damage
but pockets and and anything else over
level 6 like granite countertops or tile
will scratch the glass so if you are the
type of person who wants to keep your
phone pristine
scratch and fingerprint free one
solution is a skin thanks addy brand for
supporting my durability test this back
panel skin is easy to install and hides
fingerprints and protects against
scratches when you set your phone down
there's also a full-body skin that
protects the frame from damage as well
additionally skins are also great for
hiding accidental cracks in the back
glass which I'll get to in a second if
you're looking for something a bit more
colorful than the matte black that you
see here the brand has a ton of color
options available whether you want to
keep that Apple logo intact or my
personal favorite deep brand your phone
entirely I'll link the customizer in the
description if you want to play around
and design your own iPhone let's talk
about cracks this might come as a
surprise but glass is glass and very
susceptible to damage the biggest flaw
in this phone is that the back glass is
near impossible to replace even Apple
themselves charge 549 dollars to replace
the back glass even if you get the
insurance and pay the 99 dollar
deductible
you're still out three hundred dollars
for a back panel replacement the most
fragile and most often broken component
on this phone is the most expensive to
replace it does have a little plastic
buffer between the glass in the middle
which is smart but as we saw from my
iphone 8 drop test the glass can crack
from a drop of smallest three feet I
would like to see buy a raise of hands
who here wants to pay five hundred and
forty nine dollars for a bat glass
replacement hey Jerry what nobody raised
their hands I guess five hundred and
forty-nine dollars is a lot of money but
iPhones get dropped a lot won't it hurt
apple's image if there's a bunch of
unfixable broken iPhones walking around
a year from now yeah that's like getting
a flat tire
and needing to buy a whole new car I
know do you think Apple will change
their pricing to help their customers in
the future probably not well that's
unfortunate
if you do accidentally crack your glass
and don't want to pay apples absorbent
pricing skins are a valid way of making
the phone look new again the flawed back
glass construction aside this camera on
the phone is pretty awesome dual 12
megapixel sensor is with a telephoto
lens is a fantastic combination cameras
are something Apple does really
apple claims this lines' sapphire and
does a good job of resisting my razor
blade which is about a five or
five-and-a-half on Mohs scale there are
two circular cutouts on the lens one for
the microphone and another for the quad
LED flash and this iPhone x10 keeps the
same stainless steel theme around the
edge it does stick up kind of far but
with how much power it's packing it's
understandable and forgivable judging by
the marks that I levels sixth most pix
leaves on the lens though Apple is still
using their unique blend of sapphire
that doesn't quite match up with the
rest of the worlds I've covered that in
a few previous videos the sides of the
stone are made from stainless steel
quite possibly one of my favorite build
materials on a cell phone
super solid heavy and just looks good
the side buttons are made from the same
stainless steel material thumbs up for
consistency not quite the same ear
bleeding sound we get from aluminum this
is because aluminum is a bit softer than
steel and scratches easier down to the
bottom of the phone where the headphone
jack used to be may you rest in peace
I found something pretty cool Apple's
attention to looks and detail is
probably one of the best inside the
speaker and microphone holes we get the
matching stainless steel grill that
flows pretty well with the exterior
design of the phone the little things
like this is what sets Apple apart from
the competition
well that along with the extraordinary
superior dongle selection in the Apple
Store this black plastic buffer around
the edge of the front glass in between
the glass and the metal frame of the
phone is a good thing to help absorb
some of the impact and stress from drops
it's similar to the buffer we saw in the
back panel finally we have the burn test
this is the first time Apple has used an
OLED display inside of their smart
phones their previous IPS LCD displays
are really good don't get me wrong but
it's hard to beat the colors on an LED
panel one unique thing about this phone
is its touch sensitivity at 120 Hertz
the refresh rate of the display is still
60 Hertz like on previous phones but
this display tracks your finger 120
times per second instead of the usual 60
times per second like on the iPhone 8
the average person will probably never
notice this but it's interesting to know
that it's there the screen lasted 25
seconds under the heat from my lighter
before going white and not recovering
you can tell them my fingerprint
remaining on the burn mark that the
oleophobic coating has burned off so
there is permanent damage don't try this
trick at home the
did mess with a touch sensitivity for a
second but after the phone cooled down
it all came back
and finally the Ben test it's time to
see if those antenna lines are a weak
point in the phone's design flexing the
phone allows us to see how well the
phone is constructed and gives a general
idea of any flaws that will present
themselves in the coming years that you
own your phone there is a very minor
flex of the body as I've been the frame
but there is no screen separation or
body damage along those antenna lines so
the water resistance should remain
intact
this is incredibly solid phone the
Achilles heel of the iPhone X and iPhone
8 design is it's irreplaceable glass
back it won't Bend scratch or burn but
one little drop and it'll be cracked
forever 549 dollars is just an
incredibly unrealistic and unreasonable
charge for something as fragile and
prone to breaking as glass aftermarket
Samsung back glass replacements are $20
so it can be done Apple just chooses not
to to each their own though this phone
passes my durability test with flying
colors and will make a great addition to
any Apple ecosystem just consider
getting a case or a skin for protection
I'll have a link to D brand in the
description right below this video so
you can design your own iPhone what do
you think of this new iPhone 10x let me
know in the comments come hang out with
me on Instagram and Twitter and thanks a
ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
