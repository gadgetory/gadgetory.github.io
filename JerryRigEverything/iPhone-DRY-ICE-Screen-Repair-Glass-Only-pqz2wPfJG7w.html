interesting video for you today if you
are watching this you either have a deep
love for technology guts or your phone
is broken and you want me to show you
how to fix it well you're in the right
spot today I'm going to show you how to
do a glass only iPhone repair with dry
ice if you are subscribed to my channel
already you are seriously the best type
of human if you have not yet subscribed
hit that subscribe button and buckle up
we are going to jerry-rig all of the
things so I have to cracked but
completely functional iPhone screens in
front of me that have already been
removed from their phones the black one
is an iPhone 6 and the white one is an
iPhone 5 you can watch my previous
videos for the screen removal process
this particular video is just explaining
the dry-ice glass removal I have paid
about 5 bucks for this block of dry ice
now iPhone screens are made up of a few
different layers the important layers
that you need to worry about is the top
layer which is just glass under that you
have the digitizer layer and the LCD
both of these are fused together in one
unit and is about as fragile as an
eggshell
you think I'm joking about the eggshell
stuff but I'm not it is very fragile now
normally when a tech does a glass only
repair they either have super expensive
refurbishing equipment or it is possible
to use a heat gun to bring the phone up
to 100 degrees Celsius to melt the glue
between the top layer and the LCD layer
it is a difficult and painstaking
process now I was on the phone with tech
MD another YouTube channel about a week
ago and we are talking about the new
liquid nitrogen machines that can freeze
off the glass
these liquid nitrogen machines can get
down to about negative 140 degrees
Celsius which is incredibly cold but the
machines cost thousands of dollars now
dry ice while not as cold as liquid
nitrogen does get down to about negative
80 degrees Celsius and is available at
most grocery stores so I was curious to
see if it was cold enough to accomplish
a glass only repair and it was as you've
seen I set the broken glass screens down
on the dry ice and let it sit for about
five or ten minutes to get to
temperature then I can lift up the
screen and gently twist it with my hands
to break away the glass from the LCD
when I tell you to be gentle I mean
gentle it's like trying to flex a Dorito
without cracking
I was able to use a razor blade and
playing cards to help persuade the glass
off of the LCD the iPhone six screen was
easier than the iPhone 5 screen the nice
thing about dry ice is that it's never
actually a liquid so you don't have to
worry about liquid damaging your screens
it goes from an icy solid to a gas
through a process called sublimation now
this is also important to know because
dry ice is made up of solid carbon
dioxide carbon dioxide is not as good as
oxygen when it comes to staying alive so
make sure that you open any windows in
your car or kitchen when you're
transporting this stuff I don't want any
dead do-it-yourselfers out there hit
that thumbs up button if you enjoy
oxygen I'm going to test the iPhone 6
screen by plugging it back into the
phone and everything functions yes
science
it still has glue residue on the screen
so I will need to clean that off apply
the liquid optical adhesive and the new
glass layer but all of that will be
explained at the 8 minute
and 20 second mark in the linked video
dry ice is also extremely cold and can
burn you yes ice can burn treat it like
hot coal from a fire wear gloves if you
have to touch it directly I imagine that
with a $5 block of ice like this one an
experienced tech could repair about four
or five phones before it sublimates into
oblivion
the more glass I removed from the screen
the quicker the screen warms up so I
have to keep setting it on the block of
ice to cool down and get the glue
brittle again before I can break off
more glass the iPhone 5 was much more
shattered than the iPhone 6 but with my
razor blade I could put a little
pressure on each shard of glass and
break it off individually it is much
easier to work on a cold phone than a
hot phone when I do is repair with heat
it is blazing hot and almost untouchable
the entire time now for those of you
attempting this repair keep in mind that
even though both of my phones were
successful I've been doing this for a
while for noobs the success rate is very
low i broken hundreds of screens trying
to get good at this so it might be more
cost-effective and healthier for your
sanity to just buy the complete screen
and install that instead of trying to
attempt the brain surgery equivalent of
cell phone repair as you can see the
iPhone 5 is also fully functional if you
want to watch the Glu cleaning and
liquid optical adhesive application and
the installation of the new glass click
the link and watch the video here
starting at the four minute mark
make sure to keep the local glue off the
edges of the LCD so it does not seep
into the backlight thank you so much for
watching and subscribing my viewers like
you make videos like this possible
I appreciate it a ton
leave any questions in the comments and
I hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
