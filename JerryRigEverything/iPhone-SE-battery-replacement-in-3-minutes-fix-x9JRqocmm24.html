replace the battery in the iPhone se it
looks very similar to the iPhone 5s but
the batteries are not interchangeable
remember if you are under warranty or
your phone has insurance check those
routes first but if you need to replace
it yourself you are in the right spot
there are two pentalobe screws down at
the bottom I will link all the tools and
replacement parts and replacement
batteries down in the video description
below take your suction cup in your pry
tool and lift on the bottom left edge of
the screen a little groove there that
you can slide your thin metal pry tool
in between the plastic frame of the
screen and the metal frame of the phone
there's a tricky little ribbon cable
down here at the bottom as well lift up
the little metal latch then unclasp the
ribbon like a little Lego once that
ribbon is on clasp you can lift up the
screen 90 degrees then there are six
screws you have to remove these are
normal Phillips head screws remove the
two plates and then unclip the battery
from the mainboard this will stop all
the power from running through the board
and make the repair safer there are
three ribbon cables attached to the
screen lift those off just unsnap them
like little Legos and then there are
some magical adhesive underneath the
battery grab the little black pull tab
down at the base of the battery and lift
it up you'll see two white strands of
sticky stuff as you stretch the sticky
stuff it becomes not sticky stuff and
it'll pull the adhesive out from
underneath the battery without you
having to use any effort now this is
great in theory but these are also
extremely fragile so be very very
careful as you pull I'll show you what
happens when they break if the adhesive
does not break you'll be able to pull it
out completely from underneath the
battery and the battery will just fall
out of the phone very very easy if the
adhesive does break you'll need to pry
the battery up just a tiny bit do not
bend or kink or puncture the battery in
any way that is where the dangerous part
of this repair comes in lift it up just
barely enough to grab the rest of
adhesive and then pull it out the rest
of the way and your battery will come
loose from the phone I will link this
professional adhesive down in the video
description at the time of this repair I
do not have the adhesive so I'm going to
use the regular double-sided sticky tape
to put the battery back into place
remember that all of the replacement
parts and tools will be found in the
video description right below this video
if I've helped you out so far make sure
you're subscribed to my youtube channel
it is free and it does help me out a lot
before I clip the battery into the
motherboard I'm going to connect the
screen then I will
connect the battery and test the screen
before I screw everything in place if
your screen is gray or has lines running
through it there's a good chance that
the screen is not connected correctly to
the motherboard and you should reseat
those lego-like connections if
everything is working perfectly like
mine you can take those metal plates put
them back in place and get those six
metal screws pinned down now the
fingerprint scanner ribbon cable does
clip into the bottom near the charging
port then get that metal latch back into
place if you've lost this I will link
these down in the video description
below as well they are tiny little guys
and it is very difficult to clip them
down once that is done you can take the
top of the screen and line it up inside
of the frame of the phone and then take
your hands and press firmly down along
the edge of the screen be careful not to
break it moving your way down towards
the charging port everything is working
if you have any questions leave them
down in the comments below
go ahead and check out my screen
replacement video for all the different
parts on that as well as the charging
port replacement if this battery repair
did not solve whatever issue you are
having thanks ton for watching hope see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
