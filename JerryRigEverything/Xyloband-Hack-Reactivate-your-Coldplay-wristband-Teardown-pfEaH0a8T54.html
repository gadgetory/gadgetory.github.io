Xylo band from a Coldplay concert these
are handed out to millions of people who
attend Coldplay concerts or other events
this particular bracelet has been
smashed to bits by the what's inside
YouTube channel they gave it to me with
the challenge to bring it back to life
again and that's what we're going to do
I'll show you what a non cosmetically
destroyed bracelet looks like in just a
second but to explain these bracelets
receive a radio frequency during the
concert that allows the LEDs in the
wristband to flash along with the music
a pretty cool visual effect when the
whole audience is wearing one but after
the concert without that proprietary
radio signal the bands go dead and never
blink again completely useless and I
imagine most of them get thrown away
unfortunately so what I'm going to do
today is basically bypass the radio
receiver and the entire circuit board
then hardwire the LED band directly to
the power it's actually a lot easier
than it sounds I'm touching the tip of
my ha soldering iron to the base the red
wire the heat liquefies the solder
holding it in place and then I can pull
the red battery terminal wire out of the
circuit board LED stands for light
emitting diode and a diode is a
semiconductor that only allows
electricity to flow in one direction so
it's important that the red wire goes
here and that the batteries are oriented
in the right way when you plug them back
in otherwise this simple circuit just
won't work now for the black wire this
is the fun part where you get to decide
what color you want your band to be for
now you just get to pick one color but
I'll show you how to add multiple colors
later in the video it's a bit more
complex I'm going to stick the batteries
back in these are quadruple a batteries
I'll link some of these down in the
video description since they aren't a
standard size sold in most stores now
that I have power you can see that each
time I close the circuit on each one of
these little solder points a new color
appears the bottom color is green then
above that we have red and finally blue
is third from the bottom
since we are bypassing the circuit board
entirely we don't need this little
receiver so I'll remove that along with
the two little wires that connect it in
place
I chose green for this band and since
there is so much solder on the joints
already I don't need to add any of my
own solder I just need to melt the
solder that's in place and stick my wire
in it while it's liquid kind of magical
the way that works it's probably a bad
idea to
our live wires but here we are after you
reassemble the band it'll stay lit until
the batteries die and then you have to
swap batteries next time you want to use
it now I'm going to show how I add a
switch into our circuit this time I'll
use a bracelet that what's inside didn't
smash to bits
they aren't always super nice to things
they open up the process of adding a
switch is basically the same once it's
open I can cut off the radio receiver to
give me more room and then I pull the
red and black wires from the board I'll
reattach the red wire to the same point
I did on the last bracelet and here is
the part that is different I still get
to pick a color so for this band I'm
going to do blue but instead of wiring
directly to the battery I'm going to add
this little tiny switch these switches
were about five dollars for a pack of
fifty and I'll link those in the video
description along with this soldering
iron that was only about eight dollars
i'll solder the tiny switch between the
battery terminal and the LED this
interrupts the circuit and I'll be able
to turn the band on and off whenever I
want without opening it up to pull out
the batteries I'll only need two of the
pins on the switch the center one and
then whichever pin is on either side it
doesn't matter which side you pick
soldering moving wires is always a
little bit difficult so if you have a
stand with those little alligator clips
on it to hold things in place it'll be a
lot easier if you want access to the
rest of the colors you can either add a
switch for each individual one or you
can get a three or four-way switch and
then solder each color to a different
pin on the switch to go between all of
the colors kind of fun I'll just cut out
a hole in the top of the band and slide
my switch through it and then tack it in
place with some of the gel Stiles
superglue that way the switch can be
accessed while the band is screwed shut
again
the full destruction of the first
bracelet can be found on the what's
inside youtube channel
that'll link at the end of this video
and in the video description yeah yes
you fixed it I fixed it how did you fix
this look at it it's completely is all
he dented it and you my dad cut it with
the razor blade and hit it with a
hatchet a bunch of times yeah and he
still fixed it I was pretty shocked that
it's still working but basically I just
bypassed the board wired the power
directly into the band and that was it
uh okay no clue what that just meant but
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
