days
this beautiful panda was dropped on a
metal moving Airport walkway by mr.
mobile himself shattering the top-left
corner of the glass luckily I know a guy
who fixes phones me it's time to see if
we can restore this pixel to excel to
its former glory the process should be
pretty much the same for the regular
sized pixels as well so let's get
started this repair is actually super
simple with the pixel to the back glass
has nothing to do with the camera lens
which is a super good design on Google's
part they are separate entities let's
see what I mean in a second like always
heat is our best friend when it comes to
removing glass and lucky for us this
glass is removable
unlike Apple's back glass on their
iPhones after it's hot I'll use a razor
blade to slice between the glass and the
frame of the phone making sure to keep
the sharp into my razor blade up against
the glass so I don't cut the phone or
any ribbons or plastic or epidermis
while I'm making my way around the edge
thumbs up if you like to keep your
epidermis intact I'll keep the phone
warm why slip my second metal pry tool
to help keep the glass leveraged up and
when it's hot enough the whole thing
could just lift up and away from the
pixel 2xl body the camera lens is still
stuck to the outer glass layer and since
it's warm I can pry it away I'll clear
off any dust specks from underneath the
glass limb and then plop the whole lens
housing back down over the camera and
LED flash it's super important that the
camera is always protected from heat the
plastics underneath the lens can melt
and deform at a very low heat the heat
gun can do some major damage if it's
left in place too long I'll clean off
any leftover glass shards or replacement
glass can sit flush the important thing
to avoid during the glass removal are
the fragile ribbons under the glass like
the little ribbon off to the left and
the NFC coils in the center and the
other small ribbon on the right side the
less internal damage we inflict the
better since mr. mobile has hurt the
poor guy enough already
I'll link the pixel to XL replacement
lenses I'm using in the video
description these glass panels have
adhesive pre-installed all around the
edge making the installation slightly
easier for us I'll make sure the
adhesive is flat
all the way around so it says flush and
then gently press the whole thing into
place which definitely brings panda back
to its former glory I could have made
the whole thing transparent which could
have been cool and definitely tempting
the glass is a perfect fit all around
the edge of the phone sitting just as
flush and smooth as the original it
would be difficult to tell that it had
ever been broken that back glass white
body and orange power button looks
pretty sleek but I think there might be
one thing that we could do to make it
look even more interesting let's make it
transparent now that I've shown how to
replace the glass mr. mobile can switch
it back to black himself if he wants
getting rid of the color on the
replacement lenses is pretty easy
there's just a lot of scraping involved
and then you scrape a bit more and then
you scrape senility
luckily as we all know glass is a harder
material than metal pry tool so the
tools won't leave any marks on the glass
as we're scraping finally after a bit
more scraping it's done getting the
color off of the curve of the glass was
the hardest part since too much pressure
might break the whole thing glass is
glass after all I'll put a little
double-sided adhesive back on the
plastic of the phone avoiding the ribbon
cables just in case mr. mobile does want
to remove this glass later the adhesive
holding it in place won't tear the
ribbons during his removal process I'll
make it easy for him since he's broken
enough phones as it is already ask him
about his LG phone he drowned in the
ocean once the adhesive is in place I'll
clean the underside of the glass one
thing I would have done differently next
time around is I would have cleaned the
underside of the phone a bit better it
still has a bit of adhesive residue on
it and I didn't realize how pristine
white the phone is but even with that
little bit of minor leftover residue I
think that clear glass looks pretty
awesome we do need a new name though
since we can't really call it panda
anymore
maybe ghost panda fun fact giant pandas
were actually taken off of the
endangered species list in 2016
go team I thought about drawing a giant
panda on the back of the phone with my
razor blade to celebrate but I should
probably just give it back to mr. mobile
before I get too carried away coming out
the tech youtubers on Twitter it's where
all the action happens between videos
