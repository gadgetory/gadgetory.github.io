to remove the battery in the iPhone 6 Plus.
If you want to watch any of the other repair
videos go ahead and click the link in the
front of this one.
Here’s the iPhone 6 Plus.
In order to get to the battery we have to
take off the screen.
The screen is held down by two pentalobe screws
down at the bottom of the phone.
If you need tools or replacement batteries
I will link those in the video description.
So check there if you need to buy anything.
I’m going to lift up on the screen with
a suction cup and that will allow me to slip
my pry tool between the screen and the frame.
I want to pry up only on the frame of the
screen and the frame of the phone that way
I don’t cause any damage to the screen because
it is very very fragile.
So be very careful with it.
Don’t bend it past 90 degrees because the
ribbon cables will get stressed and we don’t
want put any damage to those.
Remove the 5 screws, remove the bracket, and
then unclasp each of these 4 ribbon cables.
Be careful with them.
They’re just very similar to Legos; just
unclasp them from the motherboard.
Technically you don’t have to remove the
screen for this repair, but getting the battery
out can be sort of violent so we want to make
sure we don’t damage the screen in the process.
Remove the metal bracket and the two screws
holding down the battery cable.
Now the phone that I’m working on right
now has been taken apart before so I’m going
to use footage from my iPhone 6 repair video
to kind of teach you how the battery is held
down by the glue.
I’m warming up the phone from the back.
If the phone ever gets too hot for you to
touch, you’ve gone too far and wait for
it to cool down a little bit.
You definitely don’t want to overheat the
phone or you might cause damage.
Also when you’re prying out the battery
you want to make sure not to use a metal tool.
Try to stick with a plastic tool so you don’t
cut the battery at all.
If you end up cutting the battery it does
pose a fire hazard.
It could burn you with the acid underneath.
Anyways, be really careful not to break the
black plastic around the battery.
So there is a trick that I’ve learned that
might help you out.
There are two little tabs down at the very
bottom of the battery that might help you
lift it out of the phone.
You will probably still need to warm up the
phone to kind of loosen up the glue underneath
the battery but the tabs are there to help
you out as well.
So give that a shot.
You can kind of see how much glue is underneath
here.
It’s kind of ridiculous.
Once you’ve gotten all the glue out, if
the glue is still stuck to the bottom of the
phone you can reuse it later.
If not, you want to put in some of the black
tape.
And make sure to avoid damaging the ribbon
cables up around the top edge of the phone.
Here’s the sticky tape.
Putting in another strand to help hold it
down so it doesn’t jiggle around inside
of the phone and cause any more damage.
Clip the battery back into place.
Get that metal bracket over the top.
Get those two screws back in.
And here’s the screen, be very careful as
you’re putting this back down.
Remember treat them kind of like Legos.
Line up the ribbon cable with the slot on
the motherboard and just put your finger over
it and press down.
If you end up with lines on your screen after
you turn the phone back on, it means that
these ribbon cables aren’t seated correctly.
So lift up the screen, pop off the ribbon
cables, put them back on, reconnect them,
make sure they’re clipped on good and that
should get rid of your lines issue.
Right now the phone is on with the screen
still up; just making sure there are no lines
or anything.
Now I’m turning the phone off because you
definitely don’t want to work on the phone
while the screen is up.
There are five more screws along the metal
plate.
Here you want to line up the top of the screen
with the phone.
There are kind of some grooves that fit in
there.
Once the grooves are flush with the phone,
you can just run your hands down the side
of the phone and press the screen down in
the metal frame.
Be really careful, this phone is gigantic
so you could break the screen very easily
by pressing the wrong place.
So make sure you stay around the frame and
be very gentle with it.
Get the bottom two screws in and you are set.
If you have any questions make sure to leave
them in the comments below.

helped you and don’t forget to subscribe,
it does mean a lot to me.
And feel free to check out my Instagram, I
think it’s pretty fun.
Thanks for watching, hope to see you around!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
