with two screens this is the Nubia X an
Android smartphone that comes with two
built-in screens one on the front and
one on the back you know we couldn't let
this one slip by without a full on
durability test let's get started so
supposedly if you want to work this
contraption there's two fingerprint
readers on the sides that when gripped
allow whatever's displayed on the front
screen to flip over onto the back panel
while retaining full functionality you
can run the whole phone from back here
when the rear screen is turned off it
looks just like a normal phone let's see
what happens when we scratch test both
screens this new UX comes with a
built-in screen protector which is nice
I'll pull that off the interesting thing
with this phone is that there's no
knotch there's no front facing cameras
or sensors that need to be hidden which
allows the whole front of the phone to
light up edge to edge as a display with
pretty much no bezels as we see from the
scratch test the front is made with
tempered glass scratching at level six
with deeper grooves at a level seven
we've got to be fair to both screens
though I'll grip the sides and flip it
around the rear screen has a much lower
refresh rate than the front screen and
has kind of a yellow tinge to it it's
also covered with the screen protector I
found that the yellowness is just a blue
light filter that can be removed I'll
show you that in a second the blue
backing on the phone is kind of like
reflective film that acts as a two-way
mirror that hides the second screen when
it's turned off and once again we get
scratches at level six with deeper
grooves at a level seven the rear screen
is covered with the same glass part of
what makes the front screen so bezel is
is how small this earpiece is I almost
missed it it's barely the thickness of
my razor blade the sides of the phone
sound and look like anodized aluminum
you can see the silver color I think
through under the blue coating you can
hear on the middle power button one
possible weak point in the frame is this
flattened portion where the fingerprint
scanner resides it looks suspiciously
like the design flaw we saw on the iPad
pro and we know how that one turned
this phone has two of them one on either
side I'm kind of nervous the top of the
phone has more metal and what looks like
an IR blaster up top for changing
channels on your TV on the other side we
have the SIM card tray volume rocker and
another flattened fingerprint here
because why have just one thing a print
reader when you can have two two is kind
of a theme of this phone there's two SIM
card slots as well which pairs nicely
with the two screens just one USB C port
down here at the bottom alongside the
loudspeaker or you might be thinking to
yourself
Jerry why in the world would anyone want
two screens on their phone well let me
tell you there are no front facing
cameras on the new BX just these two
dual rear cameras a 16 megapixel and 24
megapixel one regular and the other one
for that portrait mode stuff so when you
want to take a selfie you get to use the
powerful rear facing cameras while
seeing your face at the same time it's
an interesting solution to the notch
problem but also a solution that
actually works I'm impressed with the
ingenuity I genuinely did not see this
one coming
like dual everything else on the phone
there are true fingerprint scanners you
can use one or set up both for added
security and even with the damage
inflicted on the right side the phone
can still sense and unlock my
fingerprint not too shabby
but at least there's the backup if one
ever fails now here's where things get
interesting
this front screen is a 6.2 inch 1080p
IPS LCD meaning that after about 10
seconds we see the pixels getting hot
turning off and going black until the
heat is removed and then they slowly
recover they do recover completely
though checking the back screen though
is where we see one of the brilliant
parts of the new VX design an LCD screen
when turned on has light shining through
every single pixel even the black ones
so the whole display lights out an LED
screen or an AMOLED screen does not have
light shining through the black pixels
so you really can't tell when the screen
is on or off because the blacks are so
black and emit no light the Nubia X is
using a 5.1 720p AMOLED screen on the
back an LCD on the front and AMOLED for
the rear you can see the pixels going
white and not recovering both
technologies and one single device burn
test justification
checkmate on the haters the rear screen
can act like an always-on display
without showing the actual edges of the
screen this provides the aesthetic
illusion that there's no screen at all
on the back panel whether the screen has
lit up or not you can't really see the
rectangular edges due to the super black
AMOLED pixels it's interesting how all
these innovative smart phones keep
popping up out of nowhere and no
complaints from me here's a quick look
at the rear display with the blue light
filter turned off it looks completely
normal and as good of quality as the
front screen I'm not sure why the new
via X had that setting turned on right
out of the box I think it looks pretty
good all of these awesome gimmicks
though mean nothing if the phone can't
survive in your pocket for a few years
here on my channel we put phones through
years of abuse in just a few minutes
it's time for the bin test the dual
fingerprint design on both side rails
might just be fatal
with a solid flex from the front we get
minimal Bend but no catastrophic damaged
creeks or snaps the rear screen looks
fine even when bent from the front the
phone remains intact and fully
functional no complaints here
the Nubia X is a structurally solid
device even with all that fragile tech
packed in and while having screens on
both sides
this phone survives as a side note if
one screen does accidentally break you
can always just use the other as a
backup since it does come with two do
you think this phone is the future is a
dual screen phone a better solution than
a motorized front-facing camera which
one do you prefer
back-to-back screens are definitely
fascinating it does subscribe button if
you haven't already and coming out with
me on Instagram and Twitter thanks dumb
for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
