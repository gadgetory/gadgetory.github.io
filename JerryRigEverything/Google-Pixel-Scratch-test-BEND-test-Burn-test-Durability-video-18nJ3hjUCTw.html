4k video that we care about and that's
the Google pixel the latest phone by
Google it could very well be one of the
best phones of 2016 especially since the
note 7 just explosively dropped out of
the running
last year's Google phone the Nexus 6p
did not do so well during my durability
test so let's see how this newcomer
holds up the pixel seems like a
combination of all the other flagships
morphed into one we have the angled
edges of the HTC 10 the antenna lines
from the iPhone 6 the glass panel from
the galaxy s7 and the rear fingerprint
scanner from the LG v20 kind of like
they all decided to morph into the
Megazord of cell phones let's start with
the scratch test I have a set of picks
that tell me where the screen falls on
Mohs scale of hardness a plastic screen
like the droid turbo 2 would scratch at
level 3 a sapphire screen would scratch
at an 8 or 9 and glass typically starts
to scratch at a level 6 which is exactly
where the Gorilla Glass 4 on the screen
falls you can see the scratch at level 6
and a deeper groove with a much harder
level 7 pick this is totally normal so
no surprises yet this also means that
the front 8 megapixel camera is
protected by the same glass no buttons
at the bottom to check so let's look at
the earpiece this is the first thing
that surprised me the earpiece mesh is
made of cloth unlike the metal or
plastic speaker grilles on other phones
it'll be interesting to see how this
affects call quality over time if you
ever need to clean out your earpiece
because of dirt or makeup getting inside
that little slot make sure not to
puncture it ripped cloth over a speaker
does not sound too good the rear twelve
point three megapixel camera is
protected by the back glass panel so it
should be relatively scratch resistant
unlike the plastic camera lens of the
Sony z5 premium the back glass panel
does seem to be slightly softer than the
front glass though my razor blade was
able to leave some super fine scratch
marks on the really blue panel but if I
take that same razor blade and scratch
the front glass of the phone it does not
leave any marks so keep that in mind
when you are playing with knives around
your cell phone let's find out what the
rest of this phone is made of the really
blue aluminum part of the body is indeed
aluminum it is not covered by any primer
plastic the LG g5 had to use a thick
layer of primer to mask the seams but as
you can clearly hear the pixel manages
to join the glass and aluminum with no
extra coverings this blue phone makes
for a perfect backdrop for a lovely
cottage house just add in some bob ross
style mystic mountains and I'm almost
finished adding in some key scratches as
clouds but the markings rub completely
off this really blue aluminum color
holds up even better than the iPhone
against keys and coins that definitely
deserves a thumbs-up unfortunately the
deeper scratches do not rub off but
remember we don't make mistakes
we just have happy accidents on to the
fingerprint scanner this part of the
phone unfortunately is not glass it
feels more like a thin rubberish coating
and can be scratched off luckily the
button isn't protruding though so I
doubt it will get scratched easy in real
life even if it does get heavily
scratched though the fingerprint scanner
keeps working 100% of the time pretty
impressive how much damage it can take
and still function the SIM card tray
power button and volume rockers are all
made of metal every touchable surface of
this phone is made from a premium
material another minor perk is that
textured power button similar to what
was on the HTC 10 it makes finding the
button in your pocket or in the dark
much easier I'm liking this phone more
and more but let's see how well it holds
up to the last two tests the burn test
the pixel is using a 5.5 inch AMOLED
screen similar to what Samsung uses on
their phones this display was able to
last about 11 seconds under my intense
flame before turning white it never did
fully recover from the heat that little
white dot is permanent I'm still not
totally sure how relevant the burn test
is to anything but it was interesting to
watch the black pixels of the LG v20
magically recover from the flame test
yesterday onto the most definitive part
of my tests the bin tests I've tested
over 40 phones now some of them built
better than others I've only had a few
phones catastrophic ly fail and this
pixel is not one of them pressing from
the back I can get the screen to bulge
out just a little bit there is no
waterproofing on this phone so nothing
is being structurally compromised at
this point but when I bend from the
screen side of the phone it has zero
flex this pixel phone could very well be
one of the most durable well-built
phones of 2016 the things you should
watch out for while owning this phone
one is the little cloth covering over
the earpiece and the tiny scratches on
the back glass panel there won't be any
fragile volume button crinkling issues
like there were with the Nexus 6p
overall I'm very impressed with this
phone my shelf of shame playlist has all
of the phones that spectacularly failed
my durability tests so check that out
and hit the subscribe button so you
don't miss any of my future reviews I
check build quality on purpose so you
won't have to on accident my Twitter
followers found out the results of this
test before the video was posted so
follow me over there if you want to stay
in the loop thanks for watching I hope
to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
