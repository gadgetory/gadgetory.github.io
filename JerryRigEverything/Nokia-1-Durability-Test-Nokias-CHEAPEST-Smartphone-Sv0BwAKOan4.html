year was how well even the inexpensive
phones performed when put head-to-head
with premium phones the performance
margin between premium handsets and
budget phones is getting smaller and I
think that's a good thing the less money
you end up spending on a smart phone
that satisfies your needs means more
money you'll have to spend elsewhere
today we're gonna be durability testing
Nokia's cheapest smartphone the Nokia
one is that a removable battery I've
partnered with Bill and Melinda Gates
for this video
nokia has never failed one of my
durability tests before in the history
of ever so it'll be interesting to see
how their cheapest smartphone holds up
let's get started
out of the box it's a pretty lightweight
phone the screen brightness is turned
all the way up the Nokia one costs about
$70 right now which is 7% the cost of
the latest thousand-dollar flagships
while still accomplishing all the basics
we're here for durability though so
let's commence with the scratch test
like always I have a set of Mohs mineral
picks and on an inexpensive phone like
this I was expecting plastic for the
screen but as we can see there's no
scratches at level 3 like we would
normally see on plastic the Nokia one
scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves
at level 7 meaning it's using tempered
glass the top shiny logo is underneath
that clasp and the 2 megapixel front
selfie camera is protected under there
as well I was initially skeptical of the
2 megapixels but it's really not that
bad the earpiece is covered by a little
piece of cloth mesh gently adhered
inside the phone I doubt the little guy
will be sticking around for too long
there are no physical buttons on the
front though just one little cutout for
the microphone hold down at the bottom
we do find buttons however over here on
the side of the phone a long white
volume rocker made from plastic and a
smaller power button also made from
plastic plastic seems to be the build
theme of this phone since the sides and
back panel are also constructed of the
same material it's a little easier on
the ears at least then metal would be
plastic is easy to manufacture
mass-produced and is still a durable
material even if it might not have that
premium deal there is an old-school
microUSB port at the bottom but take a
look at this a headphone jack that's
worth $70 all by itself
the Nokia one has 8 gigs of built-in
internal memory but also has an SD card
slot that can expand the memory to 128
gigs for the rear camera we have a
whopping 5 megapixel sensor that can
film in 480p and is covered with plastic
which could very well be an issue in the
future because there's no raised edges
to protect the lens the plastic will
rest flat on whatever surface it's set
on making it super vulnerable to
scratches the inlaid Nokia lettering is
kind of like a thick metallic foil
pretty easy to remove definitely more
easy than the Tesla key card at or down
a few days ago
this means that letters will probably
fall out on their own with normal use as
the phone gets older one thing we
sometimes forget with smartphones is
that they aren't just social media or
network
devices they are useful tools Bill and
Melinda Gates write a letter to the
world every year with their thoughts and
goals and this year part of the letter
mentions cell phone specifically I'll
put the link in my description they say
that smart phones are game changers in
developing countries especially for
women giving them access to information
mobile banking and a free place to learn
new skills from sites like YouTube
income potential improves dramatically
as access to education expands and cheap
smart phones like this are perfect for
that connection to the Internet a budget
smart phone can do 90% of what a premium
phone can is just not as quick or flashy
mobile technology creates opportunities
to fight inequality lift people up and
increase that earning potential for
people who have them especially for
women in poor countries who never had
access before it's a developing market
for sure check out the annual gates
letter with the link in the description
it's kind of like a status update on the
planet written by one of the most
influential couples on the planet so
it's worth a few minutes of your time
and thanks to Bill and Melinda Gates for
sponsoring this video the little screen
on the Nokia one is 4.5 inches with a
resolution of 480 by 854 like I said
earlier this is definitely not an
expensive flashy high-end phone it's a
bare-bones key to the modern age and a
way to access information a budget phone
with a budget price the LCD screen goes
black after about 22 seconds and is
still able to recover a budget phone no
matter how cheap should still be
well-constructed in my opinion
Nokia has never let us down before in
terms of build quality and the bend test
will show us if they slacked off on this
cheapest smartphone the initial flex has
the screen protruding very far out of
the frame but no cracks or damage the
phone locks out and stops finding a bin
from the other direction also shows some
flex but still no damage the phone's
holding itself together even if it's
kind of bending like a soggy
black-and-white Oreo the internals are
probably all made from plastic but the
thing that saves this phone is the hard
square rigid battery that doesn't flex
and locks out inside of the frame
keeping the phone in one piece either
way for a phone that costs seven percent
of a modern flagship with a headphone
jack and expandable memory I can't
really complain nokia has made another
survivor and
perfect candidate for connecting people
from the poorest countries with the
Internet
