different today I have in front of me a
treasure chest but not just any chest
this is the same chest from the geekify
guys YouTube channel they use this Zelda
themed chest to reveal old-school video
games that they play every Thursday I'm
here to spice it up a little with some
internal lighting similar to how the
treasure chests are in these Zelda games
so let's get started I have some
metallic vinyl that we're going to use
to cover the wood very bright LED lights
and finally the battery pack and remote
control all of this stuff is linked down
in the video description now normally
these lights are plugged into a wall
with an adapter that will get them 12
volts of direct current but I want these
lights to be completely wireless and
portable luckily when you take 8
double-a 1.5 volt batteries and group
them in series you get 12 volts of DC
current which is perfect for running
these LED lights I'm testing the lights
first inside the box each strand can be
cut or joined with another strand every
three inches so they're very nice to use
on modular projects like this now I also
wanted to get rid of the plain wood
color inside of the box in a
non-destructive way I have a bunch of
silver vinyl lying around from one of my
old computer builds so I just wrap the
inside of the box with it it wasn't the
perfect surface to vinyl eyes but it
reflects the light pretty well and it
can be easily pulled out in exchange for
something else later if I want wrapping
the lights around the inside of the box
was pretty easy I want it to be bright
so I've made a couple circles around
that inside edge the strands have their
own adhesive backing that actually
sticks pretty well pop quiz time which
of these is Zelda is Zelda wearing pink
or a Zelda the one wearing green click
the little circle in the top corner of
this video to vote and here's the
finished box but is pretty bright while
I imagine we will most be using the
white color any color is an option with
these LEDs it gets a little psychedelic
head on over to the geekify guys channel
to watch me battle Jared Meachem in
Mortal Kombat 2 maybe i won maybe I
didn't you'll have to watch and find out
and you can see how the chest used to
look before I updated it thanks for
subscribing hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
