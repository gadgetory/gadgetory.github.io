PlayStation classic a tiny little
miniature PlayStation that comes with
two controllers and 20 games
pre-installed onto the unit not too
shabby
PlayStation is definitely copying
intended miniature classic consoles of
course but no complaints here it's a fun
way to bring back the classic game as
people grew up playing it's time to take
this tiny PlayStation apart and see what
we're paying for let's get started in
the box we get these two controllers
which they're 1.5 meter cable lengths
these are twice as long as the Nintendo
classic controller cable which is nice
the Nintendo classic came with 30 games
though instead of twenty like this
PlayStation just so you win some and you
lose some one huge flaw is that even
after paying 100 bucks for this
PlayStation Classic it does not come
with a wall plug PlayStation just
assumes you have enough cell phone USB
wall plugs laying around and they don't
feel the need to include one in the box
but that's kind of messed up the top
disc location does not open up which is
expected the PlayStation Classic only
plays the 20 pre-loaded games flipping
around we have the two USB ports for the
PlayStation controllers the power and
open buttons on the top the open button
just allows you to switch between the
theoretical disks for the games that
required more than one disc to play on
the back of the console we have the HDMI
output and the microUSB power port for
that while adapter you have to supply
yourself getting inside the PlayStation
Classic is pretty straightforward with
the five black Phillips head screws
along the bottom I'll link the toolkit
I'm using in the video description once
the bottom panel pops off we get our
first look at the circuit board and the
funky little sticker on the bottom of
the plastic base this sticker is
blocking the air vents with a silver
color
at first glance from the outside you
might think there's metal inside the
PlayStation classic but nope just a
sticker with no air flow at the bottom
vents either now that it's blocked the
circuit board has four additional screws
holding it in place I'll remove those
and pull the computer guts out of the
plastic housing you can see the internal
button structure here just plastic
contraptions that reach down to the
surface of the motherboard kind of the
same push style buttons we saw in the
solar powered LED light I took apart a
few days ago the metal cover for the
motherboard has just lightly stuck into
place with some thermal foam over the
process
sir it's sticky on both sides and now we
get our inside look at the two USB
controller ports the rear HDMI and the
micro USB ports pretty simple design
PlayStation is definitely pulling some
healthy profit margins off of this one
I'll reassemble the console so we can
get a closer look inside of the
controller everything on the console
kind of clicks into place with little
guiding plastic bits and the remaining
screws pretty simple now for the
controller it feels and looks almost the
same as the original controllers but to
be honest I never played around a whole
lot with the PlayStation growing up my
mom never let me buy one as a kid and
most of my friends at Nintendo's I have
one now though that's just much smaller
than I anticipated
the controller has eight screws in the
back holding the two halves together
once the back is removed we see the same
nifty cable routing that we saw inside
the Nintendo controllers these plastic
pins allow the cable to be stressed and
pulled but with no pressure on the
fragile motherboard connection itself
and this is where things get interesting
the plug inside the controller is just
another microUSB cable so theoretically
you could just buy a longer microUSB
cable from Amazon or something and
install it inside your controller with
this same normal micro USB plug and sit
farther away from your TV pretty awesome
the plastic housing and super small
circuit board have little clasps holding
them into the exterior gray housing
unclasping goes allows the plastic to
release and reveal this fantastically
blue ribbon for the button wiring it's
always fun when the insides look better
than the outsides each little black
rubber pad on the bottom of the buttons
touches the conductive pads on top of
the blue ribbon then the massive blue
ribbon plugs into the tiny circuit board
on the back to handle all the input data
is pretty interesting the buttons
themselves are also uniquely shaped and
only fit in one hole on the controller
kind of like what we saw with the
Nintendo switch buttons when we were
swapping into a clear housing the rubber
pad is what allows the buttons to be
compressed and then springs them back up
into place again it might sound like a
broken record at this point but a
transparent controller would look pretty
fantastic I almost forgot to plug the
microUSB cable back into the controller
and route it through the little plastic
pins that keep it firm and secure but
yeah PlayStation has done pretty well
with this one they should definitely
include a simple power brick in the box
but depending on your nostalgia level
towards PlayStation games this might be
a worthwhile purchase I'll have both the
PlayStation Classic and then
sendou classic linked in the video
description if you want to check out the
current pricing but I think it's a
pretty good gift idea hit that subscribe
button if you haven't already and let me
know in the comments if you had to pick
one PlayStation or Nintendo which would
it be
thanks Don for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
