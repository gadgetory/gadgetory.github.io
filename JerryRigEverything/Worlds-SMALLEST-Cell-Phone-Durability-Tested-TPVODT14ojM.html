little guy is the world's smallest
mobile phone and believe it or not it
works with both phone calls and get this
it can also send text messages using a
little something to us old people
remember as multi-tap on a nine number
keypad yeah it was a real thing and yeah
we actually used it the phone is cute
but is it durable let's find out this
miniscule cellular device is from a
company called zanko and as we know any
name that starts with Z is a good name
it's a little bit smaller than a
double-a battery and it's about twice as
long as the iPhone tens camera bump it's
kind of ridiculous how small this thing
is if you stick it in your pocket you
might forget it's even there like a tube
of chapstick going through the laundry
I've seen pieces of gum that are bigger
than this phone but like always we're
here to test things out and see if they
work let's call my mom and she sent me
to voicemail but she also sent me my
first text message it took me a second
to figure out how to actually get to the
texting menu since it's so small but she
said I'll call you right back
look at that 2005 all over again well
we'll cross our fingers that she
actually remembers and calls back cuz
phones don't always survive all the way
through my videos like always we'll
start with the scratch test normally we
have a lot more screen real estate to
work with but it's okay I can write as
small as I need to on this phone firenze
for reference plastic scratches at a
level three glass scratches at a six and
sapphire would be an eight or a nine but
judging by the marks we get at the level
three and deeper grooves at level four
this point four inch screen is made from
plastic the buttons do speak to you
which is interesting
makes it nice that you can leave your
magnifying glass at home when you're out
and about the buttons are made from
plastic not a big deal since
realistically I don't think anyone's
going to be texting novels on this thing
the sides are made from plastic
no volume buttons but there is a rubber
flap protecting the modern micro SIM
card slot I'm sure they would have also
added a fingerprint scanner if the whole
phone wasn't the size of a fingerprint
the bottom has a slightly outdated
microUSB port this is a lot like peeling
a baby carrot except for it's black
instead of orange and probably doesn't
taste very good the top of the phone has
no headphone jack but I'll give it a
pass since I'm pretty sure there is
legitimately no room this time around
the phone is basically the size of a
headphone jack as it is there is a
lanyard slot up at the top though if you
wanted to wear it as a necklace or
earrings or something my mom would be
pretty mad if I got my ears pierced
though so I'll skip that one speaking of
which I got a texter back so let's give
this a try
luckily texting on an iPad is kind of
like riding a bike and you never really
forget how for the kids who aren't old
enough to remember the good old days let
me explain how this worked you press the
key that contains the letter you want
and then keep pressing that same key
until the letter you need cycles through
then you can continue to the next letter
and repeat the process yeah it took me a
minute and half to write the words call
me but times were simpler back in the
day and we were usually too busy to text
people anyway doing crazy things like
going outside and stuff oh hey look it's
my mom
hi can you hear me we are currently
talking on the world's smallest cell
phone yeah there's a speaker there's a
loudspeaker on the back and then a
couple little microphones and it's a
little bit smaller and my thumb yeah
there's no there's no better way how
does it sound on your end all right I
think that should work okay I will see
you tomorrow
and there you have it it sounds like a
speakerphone on the other end
probably because speakerphone is the
only option with this thing and now for
the burn test this point 4-inch 64 by 32
pixels display is protected by the outer
layer of plastic so we don't see any
damage done to the actual inner screen
but the outer shell starts literally
melting after about 11 seconds it's a
pretty hot mess of distorted plastic I
highly recommend not using a lighter on
your cell phone the thing gets lit so
I don't know if you've ever tried to
break a jolly rancher in half but the
laws of physics have basically the same
effect on this nub of a cellphone
there's not enough surface area to even
grip even though it only weighs 13 grams
the little guy is as solid as a pebble
you know that little tiny pocket inside
the bigger pocket of your jeans
I feel like this phone was literally
made for that tiny pocket on this
channel the phrase in depth reviews is
taken pretty literally so let's dive a
little deeper inside this miniscule
device with no visible screws I knew the
teardown would be pretty simple I mean
how hard can it be to get inside an SD
card sized phone turns out as - face
plate that comes off first revealing a
plastic outer layer and a rubberized key
pad underneath it just like we've seen
in some of the older Nokia phones I did
forget the essential step of turning off
the phone first
there is no Lego connectors holding the
screen in place this is soldered
directly onto the motherboard I'll turn
the phone off and then proceed to lift
the motherboard out of the peanut-sized
housing being careful with the black and
red wires dangling from the rest of the
components the little battery comes out
with the whole contraption at the same
time the battery is a 190 milliamp hour
little guy just 10 milliamp hours
smaller than the Apple watch supposedly
this is enough capacity to last three
days on a single charge on the back of
the motherboard we have the micro SIM
card tray the bottom microphone and the
micro USB charging port along with the
2g antennas not bad for a phone you
might accidentally swallow during a
phone call how long do you think you
would actually last using this phone ya
can text and make phone calls and the
keyboard lights up but could you
actually use it for any amount of time
let me know in the comments if that
subscribe button if you haven't already
there's plenty more in depth reviews
coming your way thanks Don for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
