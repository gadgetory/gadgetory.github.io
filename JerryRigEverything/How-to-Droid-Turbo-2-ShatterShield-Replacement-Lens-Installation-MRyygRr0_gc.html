install the shatter shield replacement
lens for the Droid turbo 2 this is the
outermost layer for this Android phone
what comes in the box is the actual lens
itself the dry cloth removal pick and
the wet wipe to remove the lens is
relatively simple you're going to take
your plastic tool and slide it between
the power button and the top of the
phone get it underneath that top layer
and then just peel it off away from the
device make sure not to use anything
metal because you can scratch the lens
underneath the top lens because that is
made of plastic as well so be careful
you can see the plastic edges here that
your new lens is going to sit down
inside and I'm going to take the wet
wipe and clean off the outside of the
phone making sure that there's no
residue or anything else like dust
specks which are going to be your worst
enemy during this installation once
everything is cleaned off with the wet
wipe I can switch over to the dry wipe
and the main goal of the dry wipe is to
get rid of all of the dust specks you
only have one shot with the plastic lens
once it touches the phone it cannot be
removed or it will lose its clearness so
make sure that there are no dust specks
at all underneath this lens the lens has
two protective coatings on it we're
going to remove number one making sure
not to touch the lens itself because if
you do touch it it'll make the clearness
go away on the back of the lens the lens
will only stick to one thing one time
one last check to make sure there's no
dust and I'm going to take the lens and
line it up with the earpiece first
making sure that the lens is dead center
inside of that little slit at the top of
the lens once I've made sure it's dead
center I can press it down with my
finger and that will tack it to the top
of the phone and then you can eyeball
the bottom two slots or you can take
your hands and touch the edge of the
screen protector around the phone at the
same time to make sure it's completely
parallel with the rest of the device
once it's resting on top of the phone
you can take your hand and press down in
the center and make an X or a cross and
then you can press out any of the
bubbles inside this is just making sure
that no bubbles get caught underneath
the lens when it's all pressed down so
work your way towards the edges if you
have any questions go ahead and leave
them in the comments don't forget to
like if this video helped you and
subscribe does help me out a lot you can
also hit me up on Instagram or Twitter
@zacksjerryrig once all the bubbles are
pressed out grab that number to the top
protective coating on the lens and peel
that away and you are set the lens
should fully adhere to the phone within
24 hours and that's all there is to it
thanks ton for watching hope you
