and the samsung mega right next to each
other with their batteries and an iPhone
4s for size comparison these are some
gigantic phones today we're going to
take apart the samsung mega there are 14
screws surrounding the outside of the
phone and instead of making you watch me
take apart each screw I'm just going to
diagram them out here you can pause this
if you need to and then to separate the
screen from the phone itself it's
exactly like the galaxy s4 where it's in
the middle of the silver bracket around
the outside there's a little opening I
just spread it open with my finger a
little bit and then slip my pry tool in
and swiped it around the outside edge
gently unclasping each clasp as I
circled the outside and then at the top
inside the little battery compartment
there's another little latch gave me a
little trouble to squiggle it around a
little bit and then you'll see that the
back just slides away from the rest of
the phone right here you can see the
loudspeaker as well that's also attached
to the back and I'll go back to that in
a second here's a charging port you
could technically get inside this phone
switch the charging port and be
completely done in about three minutes
the charging port is that easy to fix I
unclick the two ribbon cables up at the
top and I'm just swiping my pry tool
underneath the charging port just
unsticking it from the tape below it and
that is it the charging port is out and
ready to swap Samsung usually has these
for about 10 bucks or so I'll list them
in the video description below as soon
as they become available that way you
can swap yours out if you need to
there's a little riot wire cable that I
just unclipped you just lift it up two
ribbon cables up at the top one ribbon
cable at the side and another one up by
the audio port headphone jack right here
there's like little Legos you just
unclasps one from the motherboard and
then there's one screw right in the
middle of the motherboard that holds the
whole thing down
is the only small screw on this whole
thing all the rest of screws are the
same size you'll see one more wire cable
right here that I'm going to lift up and
off the board and then one more ribbon
cable that's kind of on that little leg
of the motherboard right down here and
missed it the first time around unlatch
it right there and the motherboard comes
loose from the phone and you can also
see the camera right there that just had
a little ribbon cable that you can
unclasped as well so if you need to
switch out the camera is pretty
straightforward so here's the screen of
the phone this is what you will be
replacing if you ever crack it or drop
it I will also link another video that
shows how to separate the glass but the
success rate on that is very very low so
I would recommend replacing the whole
thing as a unit the headphone jack and
everything else depending on you know
what screen you get you might need to
swap out the headphone jack and the
earpiece there's just a little screw at
the top it lets all those loose as well
as the camera anyway putting the
motherboard back into place right now
making sure all of the wire cable wire
cables and ribbon cables are on the
right side of the motherboard which is
the upper side and not pinched down
beneath just clicking them all into
place you got to make sure that they sit
right before you apply any pressure so
you don't bend any of the connections so
I'm going to find little groove it sits
in and then press it down just like a
little Lego lifting this up making sure
the ribbon cables on the upper side of
the motherboard as well once again any
replacement parts and stuff you can find
in the video description below if you
need anything specific just leave me a
comment or email me and I'll find it for
you make sure you get the right parts
you're not wasting your time or your
money
right now I'm just clipping in one of
the little wire cables you got to be
really careful with the head of it so
I'm being super gentle as I press it
down into place because you only got one
chance of this if you bend one of the
heads on these wire cables then you just
got to get a new wire cable and they're
kind of hard to find same thing with
this other side being super careful
super gentle making sure it lines up and
then clipping it into place just making
sure all the wires and all the cables
are pressed down getting that final
screw back into place as well if you
forget to latch one of the little ribbon
cables and you get the whole phone put
back together then you got a you know
waste your time and open it all back up
again so check twice before you put
everything back together charging ports
going back in I'm just going to press it
down into place over the glue where it
was before snap the two ribbon cables
that connect it to the rest of the phone
get them in place slide it down inside a
little groove that it was sitting in and
place the back in place as well so here
is the speaker it has those two little
connectors that attach to the
motherboard and that's how the speaker
that's attached to the frame gets its
power clip in the frame back into the
screen right here you'll hear a bunch of
little tiny clicks as all the latches go
back into place sitting completely flush
again
there's nothing to indicate that the
phone was opened
you get all these screws back into place
again all 14 of them on this gigantic
phone batteries back in backs back on
and everything works if you any
questions make sure to leave them in the
comments don't forget to like if this
video helped you and don't forget to
subscribe you know if I help getting
