claimed to have sapphire crystal as
their iPhone camera lens this includes
the iPhone 6 the 6s and even the iPhone
se sapphire crystal is a man-made
material that is extremely hard and
almost impossible to scratch with
everyday objects since it ranks about a9
on Mohs scale of hardness right next to
diamonds so it's a pretty big selling
point when a company brags about using
it t so is another company that brags
about sapphire crystal on their watches
it is even written right here on the
back so let's compare T so sapphire
hardness with apples sapphire hardness
these pics let me know where an object
falls on Mohs scale of hardness glass
even tempered glass or Gorilla Glass
will always follow to five or six
plastic will be a two or three and
sapphire will be an eight or a nine as
you can see from my pics on this watch
face there is absolutely no mark until a
Mohs eight pick leads the first visible
groove if you remember from my iphone 7
durability test a few days ago when I
scratched the camera lens of the iPhone
7 with my pics it left a visible mark at
a most six which led me to assume that
the lens is just regular tempered glass
since it has the same hardness level it
was only after I made the durability
video that I noticed apples still
bragging about the sapphire on their
iPhone 7 so I figured it was time to
test all of the sapphire iPhone lenses
now full disclosure this hurts me even
more so than snapping a phone in half
I'm a camera guy so deliberately
scratching a camera lens even for
science is extremely painful i retested
the iPhone 7 and got the same result as
6 a seven and an eight pick all leave
their mark scratching much sooner than
sapphire crystal should scratch the
sapphire lens on the iPhone se also
scratched with a six and seven the
iPhone 5s showed marks at a six and
seven and even the iPhone 6 scratched at
a six and seven so we can easily
conclude that each of the iPhone
Sapphire lenses are much softer than the
T cell watch face at this point I
thought the case was closed and I got
ready to post a video saying Apple just
isn't using sapphire crystal but I
grabbed a diamond tester that I have
laying around and tested the outer glass
surface and bewildering ly enough
did positive for sapphire which is
strange because as we've clearly seen
the hardness level does not match what
sapphire should be when I test the
underside of the lens the Sapphire
reading is much lower also interesting
I'll explain that in just a second as
you can see when I test my tea so
watchface it is off the charts and
Sapphire readings but that is only
because it is a larger surface area and
easier for the Machine to identify just
for reference this is a real sapphire
it's a pretty small stone but still a
level 9 on Mohs scale of hardness this
is just showing the mineral picks in
action as well as a control for the
tester tool so both companies claim to
have Sapphire so why is there a
difference in hardness I looked at both
my tea so watch and iPhone camera lens
under a microscope and found some
interesting things first of all remember
that this scratch on the watch happened
at a level 8 we can see the damage
pretty clearly under the microscope the
thin groove and the little chippings
that permanently disfigure the crystal
but if we check the Sapphire iPhone 5s
camera lens under the microscope we can
see something entirely different
remember that this is the most six line
this is the most seven line and this
crack here happened as I was lifting
lens out of the iPhone frame the level 6
and 7 picks definitely did permanent
damage but under the microscope they
look like small fractures instead of
scratches still very permanent and still
permanently disfiguring the lens so it's
pretty clear that we're working with two
different qualities of crystal here now
that we've seen this damage let's figure
out why Apple's Lin starts to fracture
at a most six when it should be
resilient to at least 1/8 like on the T
so watch or a level 9 like we saw on the
actual sapphire stone so I checked
Apple's patent for their sapphire
information and found a few strange
things I will link this form down in the
video description if you're interested
in looking at it yourself one of the
very first things it says is that
Apple's patent is related to thin
sapphire laminates then down here it
talks about laminating regular glass
with the sapphire coating instead of
having the whole thing be sapphire
interesting ly enough because glass may
provide cost savings over sapphire it
also specifically references camera
lenses so is that why the lens is
fracturing maybe it's not solid sapphire
it could be just a thin laminate on top
of regular glass because it would be
more cost effective I realize that in
order
really analyze the lens before posting a
video I need some bigger toys I headed
over to a university where they have an
XRF machine x-ray fluorescence is a
non-destructive analytical technique
used to determine the composition of
materials remember that this particular
machine is only qualitative not
quantitative so it won't tell us the
percentage of each element just if the
element exists in the specimen when I
tested the outside of the lens I get a
huge reading of aluminum oxide which
means that the lens is most definitely
sapphire on the exterior when I test the
inside of lens I get no reading for
aluminum oxide but I do get a reading
for silicon which is an ingredient of
glass this means that the underside of
the lens is made of or coated with glass
but the XRF machine does not tell how
thick each side is so in order to find
the thickness of each layer of the lens
I need an even bigger toy now this
machine is an electron microscope
costing close to a million dollars
I wish I had one in my basement but
Santa keeps on ignoring my letters
either way in this test I have broken
the actual iPhone 7 lens out of the
phone and here we are looking at the
cross-section of the broken lens this
here is the total lens thickness and
this electron microscope is showing the
actual elemental makeup of the lens
thumbs up for science the lens was
cleaned before analyzing and this is
what we see during the scan the
different colors represent where the
different elements are found in lens the
carbon and silicon are not ingredients
of sapphire only the aluminum oxide so
from this image we can pretty safely
assume that the sapphire we are looking
at is not pure there are a pretty hefty
amount of contaminants like the carbon
and the silicon remember how my diamond
detector tool had a lower reading on the
inside of the lens that's because there
is a silicon layer that you can see here
but it is incredibly small in proportion
to the rest of the lens so it's pretty
much a non-issue I bet that the inner
layer is more to minimize reflection or
something minor
because structurally it doesn't seem
like you would add any value the vast
portion of the lens is aluminum oxide
the graph here is quantitative so it is
giving us an accurate percentage of
elements aluminum oxide carbon and
silicon in this particular reading let's
look at another segment remember that
this side is the exterior this side is
the interior of the phone and this is
the profile
of the crack it has an incredibly thin
coating of something on the inside the
lens niobium and silicon niobium
improves the refractive index of optical
glass allowing for thinner and lighter
lenses so it looks like that particular
element is intentional the majority of
the lens body is the aluminum oxide
which is what we call sapphire but we
still have quite a bit of carbon and
that's the main impurity here is the
quantitative graph again the carbon is
still a decent sized chunk the niobium
and silicon are just on that very tiny
inner layer now let's take a look at the
elemental analysis of the sapphire
crystal on my tee so watch the only two
elements found on the surface of the
watch in the scan are aluminium and
oxide no Carbon impurity also the ratios
of the T so sapphire are very different
than the Apple sapphire Apple only has a
2 or 3% difference between the aluminium
and oxide and T so has an almost 10
percent difference now I am NOT a
chemist a geologist or an engineer I
personally graduated in business but
these numbers sure are interesting
between a lens that does fracture and a
lens that doesn't after filming and
editing this video I noticed one of em
kbh DS most popular videos which I will
link in the video description it is
about the prototype sapphire screen of
the iPhone 6 that he posted a couple
years ago he came to the independent
conclusion that it's crashed at a 7 on
the Mohs scale which if that prototype
was indeed a real piece of Apple
sapphire it does match the same recipe
that they are currently using for their
camera lens it makes me wonder if the
sapphire screen prototype and the
current sapphire camera lens both
scratch early is the Sapphire Apple
watch made of the same weak recipe and
the bigger question how impure can your
sapphire be and still call it sapphire
in conclusion just because my results
show that the lens scratches earlier
than sapphire doesn't mean it's a bad
lens it is still scratch resistant just
like glasses and the pictures are still
great it's just not as scratch resistant
as we all thought it would be if you
