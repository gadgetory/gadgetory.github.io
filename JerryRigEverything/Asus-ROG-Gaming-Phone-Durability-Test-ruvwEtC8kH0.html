new asus rog gaming phone speaking of
games this video is sponsored by brawl
stars a new supercell mobile game
designed for smartphones brawl stars is
one of those fast-paced multiplayer
games that let you team up with your
friends or solo battle against people
all around the world with a bunch of
different game modes it's totally free
to download I joined up with my buddy
Lincoln from the what's inside YouTube
channel and we used our brawler's to
team up and fight against four other
teams Lincoln is definitely better than
I am if you want to join our team
download the game and search my club
Zak's jerry-rigged same as all my social
media and join up with my crew there's
real-time three verse three battles
going on as well Plus each brawler has a
unique super attack which keeps things
interesting you can play right now for
free with the link in the description
and huge thanks to brawl stars for
sponsoring this video this allows us to
review a phone we might not have gotten
to test otherwise let's get started
the asus rog phone asus has been around
for a long time making gaming hardware
ro G stands for Republic of gamers asus
is calling this phone a game changer and
they might just be right inside the
funky-looking box we have a charging
block and a fancy braided cable and over
here we have a external cooling dock
that plugs into the side of the phone
this is gonna be interesting and here is
the ROG phone this looks futuristically
stealthy and feels heavy mostly glass
with accent lines and what's supposed to
be a massive built in exterior heatsink
with spreaders and vents it'll be pretty
cool to see this thing from the inside
the outside though is still pretty
awesome there's Naik a chink prismatic
shimmer and the metallic silver on the
back I'm excited to see what this phone
can handle let's start with the scratch
test the point of standardized test is
that we put each and every smartphone
through the same situations and see how
they compare to each other some phones
have plastic screens others are made
from sapphire like Keo Sarah's latest
Android phone but this guy like most
other flagships is using Gorilla Glass 5
and we start seeing normal scratches at
level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7
the asus rog phone has the whole face
unlocking thing and front-facing 8
megapixel selfie camera hidden under the
front glass no notch on this phone the
earpiece grille is different it's copper
accents look great on the phone but
instead of an anodized metal grille it
has a plastic layer kind of glued to the
top I don't think this is a future
cosmetic blunder waiting to happen
though the plastic is very well adhered
to the metal almost like a colored epoxy
I really doubt the color will ever fall
off or peel away on its own it took some
serious persuasion to even get it this
far the bottom stereo speaker grille is
covered with the same stuff plus the
whole thing can pull away from the phone
this doesn't normally happen most
speaker grilles are built-in but I still
don't see it falling off by itself the
adhesive underneath is pretty strong
just something to be aware of now the
back of the phone is very unique with
this metal looking growth protruding
into the back glass panel
it's one of the more unique-looking
phones on the market right now the size
are made from metal over here on the
side we also have a little rubber plug
that covers the two USB C ports which I
have already lost this is where that
external Aereo active cooler plugs in
the beastly futuristic-looking accessory
for a futuristic looking phone a su says
this little guy can cool the surface of
the phone by 4.7 degrees Celsius which
is probably a stretch yeah I can feel
the fan kick on inside the contraption
but it's also adding a load to the
battery that power draw is going to heat
the internals up while trying to cool
down the exterior surface at the same
time kind of counterproductive plus the
underside of fan is plastic which is one
of the worst remaining conductive
materials any efficient heat dissipation
system would be metal it's definitely
not a heat sink per se it's more of just
a fancy USB fan I might be biased but
they should also have made this thing
transparent the top of the phone is made
from metal along with the other side the
volume buttons and power button I'm no
expert gamer myself but it's probably
safe to assume that gamers like the
option of wireless or corded headphones
so it's nice to see a headphone jack
down here at the bottom next to the USB
C port they sue says courageously added
more ports than anyone could ever want
there is an oddly shaped fingerprint
scanner on the back invincible to my
razor blade thumbs up for that this
doubles as the trackpad to drop down the
notification bar which is kind of cool
Asus is also doing it right with the
dual cameras on the back one is a 12
megapixel wide-angle lens and another 8
megapixel normal sensor for regular
pictures dual cameras each with their
own properties the single colored LED
flash is protected under the back glass
the back logo is also under the glass
and scratch proof kind of putting a
damper on art class with Jerry I need
Apple to release another iPad just like
on the razor phone - this logo actually
lights up a soos has it turn on for
notifications or when it goes into its
more powerful gaming mode but also just
like the razor phone - it's pretty dim
and best seen in low-light environments
of course besides raw power the next
most important aspect of a gaming phone
is the screen
and a soos has again pushed the limits
of what a smartphone can handle normal
smartphones like iPhones and Samsung's
have a refresh rate of 60 Hertz a soos
has somehow managed to bump that up to
an impressive 90 Hertz on this 1080p
screen while still using an AMOLED razor
is still the king of the refresh rate
with 120 Hertz but they're also using an
LCD panel where those kinds of refresh
rates are much more common
I'd say LCDs are a bit more color
accurate but EMA LEDs are definitely
more vibrant so it's cool to see the
refresh rate improving the AMOLED panel
did go white after 32 seconds and did
not recover I'm honestly looking forward
to the teardown on this one the copper
accents on the back don't appear to fall
off but realistically they are probably
just decoration we'll have to find out
from the inside sometimes the quickest
way inside of a phone is with a bin test
build quality and structural integrity
are always a factor when choosing which
mobile device to carry with you for the
next few years the initial flex had some
heart dropping pops associated with the
bend but everything is still working
just fine bending from the front we have
a minor flex but no permanent damage
every time it's bent from the back
though it pops not sure why but the most
important thing is it locks out stops
bending and is still alive and passes
the bin test hey soos has done a good
job with this one if you had to decide
between the asus rog phone and the razor
phone - which would you pick I'm curious
both phones are pretty impressive asus
is taking the accessory innovation to a
whole new level hit that subscribe

hang out with me on Twitter and
Instagram
thanks stuff for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
