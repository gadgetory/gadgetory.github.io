LG has been playing it safe on the sidelines
for the past few years.
You might have even forgot they existed.
But LG is back with the new G8 and a few magical
features you probably never thought you might
need.
It's time to find out if the new LG G8 is
durable.
This video is sponsored by ExpressVPN.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
LG went with a super minimal design this year
with no camera bump and a pretty average looking
notch up top.
I do think it's pretty funny that the phone
still comes with a warning about not removing
the battery...like that could ever happen
on accident.
The whole thing is still glued shut ridiculously
tight.
It takes a professional like 10 minutes to
open up the glass with blazing heat, so no
one's ever gonna take the battery out on accident.
Let's start with the scratch test.
These Mohs hardness picks help us differentiate
between different minerals and materials.
Plastic scratches at a level 3, glass scratches
at a 5 or a 6, and sapphire scratches at an
8 or a 9.
The G8 is using Gorilla Glass 5 on the front,
which means we should start seeing scratches
at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level
7.
And indeed, we do.
It's pretty much the standard.
Normal car keys and coins won't cause any
damage, but anything above a level 5 will
scratch your screen.
Like granite, quartz, or other minerals found
in nature, they can make way into your pocket
as dust and cause micro abrasions.
So screen protectors are always a good idea.
The LG G8 has two cameras on the front: a
normal 8 megapixel selfie camera, and another
time-of-flight 3D camera like the one we saw
on the Huawei P30 Pro.
I'll talk about how cool this TOF camera is
in a second, but first notice that there's
no earpiece.
LG is using the same under screen vibration
projection technology that that P30 Pro used
instead of having a physical earpiece speaker.
I'll check it out from the inside of course
in the teardown video.
LG calls it a crystal sound OLED speaker,
but I bet it's just a vibrator.
It is pretty aesthetic though to see the curve
of the glass continue all the way up to the
frame instead of having a hole up top.
I like it.
And yeah, the LG G8 does some interesting
things like remember where you parked a car,
or remember when it's time to get off the
subway.
But the coolest thing about LG G8 is its ability
to be magically controlled by gestures using
that 3D time-of-flight camera on the front.
Like check this out – without touching my
screen, I can hold my hand above the display,
bring my fingers together and then activate
my YouTube app, or turn on music by shifting
my hand left or right.
And then do it again to get my video to play
or pause.
And I can rotate my hand left or right to
adjust the volume all the way up or down.
You can see my hand rotating in real time
in the center.
[YouTube video volume getting louder.]
Granted, the technology is still in its infancy
and isn't perfect, but I can definitely see
this getting way cooler with time....Ironman-style.
Especially now that so many other companies
like Samsung and Huawei are using time-of-flight
cameras in their phones.
Like let's say my timer goes off, but my hands
are dirty from a project, I don't have to
touch the phone, I can just turn the alarm
off with the gesture.
[Beeping sounds]
I think it's pretty cool.
The sides of the LG G8 are made from aluminum,
but doesn't have the same thin anodized feel
as other phones.
The paint seems more glossy and smooth.
It doesn't matter much to me since I always
have a case on my personal phone, but it's
still interesting.
The LG G8 does have expandable memory with
an SD card slot inside its ip68 water resistant
SIM card tray.
It fits up to two terabytes – gotta love
that.
Nothing cool up here at the top though, just
more of the glossy painted aluminum.
The left side has a dedicated Google Assistant
button, and the normal volume keys – all
made from metal.
Down along the bottom we have our loudspeaker
grill, the USB-C port, and a headphone jack.
LG remains one of the more feature rich phones
on the market.
The back of the phone is covered in a slab
of glass with wireless charging.
All of the logos are underneath the glass
and protected from scratching.
The rear physical fingerprint scanner is also
unscratchable which is nice.
The oddest thing about this back panel is
the lack of camera lens.
Every other smartphone has a separate piece
of glass covering and protecting the internal
camera lenses, whether raised or flush, but
this time around LG just used the back glass
panel itself to protect the 12 megapixel standard
camera, 16 megapixel ultra wide camera, and
12 megapixel telephoto camera.
Some markets only have two rear cameras by
the way, but the minimalist flush look is
rather nice.
I do think that with the whole back panel
being the lens, it might be more prone to
breaking, but it does look sleek.
Another interesting aspect of the G8 is beyond
the normal fingerprint and face unlock features,
it also has something called Hand ID that
unlocks the phone using the veins and hand
patterns on your palm, like some kind of Jedi
trick or something.
It was pretty quick and only worked on the
hand that I set it up with.
My other hand was not able to unlock the phone,
so that's good.
I do like that LG is over here doing cool
things and being unique.
The bezels might not be the smallest, but
the screen of the LG G8 is 6.1 inches at 1440
x 3120p resolution, and lasts 18 seconds under
the heat from my flame before turning white
like other LED displays.
Liquid crystal displays would go black and
recover – these marks are permanent.
With the simple curved glass screen and flush
rear camera lens, it's time to see how structurally
sound the LG G8 is.
LG has usually done pretty well on my durability
tests, and this flagship appears to be no
different with the subtlest of flexes when
bent from the back, and a minor flex when
bent from the front.
There's no sign of damage or kinks or adhesive
separation along the front or rear glass panels.
The LG G8 is a solid device and I am looking
forward to see what LG does with that gesture
technology in the future.
Plus, LG has a free two year warranty option
instead of the normal one year manufacturer
warranty.
You gotta like a company that treats their
customers well.
I approve.
Speaking of being treated well, the internet
is not always a nice place, and the best way
to keep your personal information secure is
with a VPN.
