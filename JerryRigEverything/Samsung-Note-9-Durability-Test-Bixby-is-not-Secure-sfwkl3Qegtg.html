most powerful than professional phones
on the planet built for businessmen
hardcore gamers and smartphone power
users but is it durable there's only one
way to find out let's get started one of
the unique features of the note series
is the s-pen will break more into that
in just a second it's just one of the
many things that allow this phone to
take productivity to the next level
Samsung has never failed one of my
durability tests before and I have high
hopes that this phone will continue the
trend of solid build quality let's start
with the scratch test these little Mo's
picks with different tips tell us what
the screen is made from plastic would
scratch a level-3 tempered glass at
level 6 and sapphire would be a level 8
or 9 Samsung is using tempered Gorilla
Glass 5 this time around so there's no
surprise when we see scratches at level
6 with deeper grooves at level 7
perfectly on par with other major
manufacturers like Apple or LG razor
blades or keys won't hurt the glass but
there are still plenty of other
particulates out there that can damage
glass and cause micro scratches in your
pocket so a screen protector or skins
might be something worth looking into
the top of the phone is protected with
the same front glass so no scratches
will happen to the 8 megapixel front
facing camera or the iris scanner the
earpiece is made for metal and sits
totally flush with the glass screen and
even with some aggressive persuasion it
won't come out so solid design so far it
looks like Samsung has again stuck with
the same glass and metal sandwich
they've been using for the past four
years and it's definitely still metal
the volume buttons are also made for
metal as well as the dedicated Bigsby
button who even after much ridicule is
disappointingly still oh I did not see
that coming fix fee has exited the
premises it looks like every single one
of the buttons on the note 9 are
removable which is incredibly
interesting they are tight so I doubt
they would ever come out on their own or
during a drop but we just managed to
update Bixby right on out of the frame
it kind of takes remapping buttons to a
whole new level the sketchy part is
someone could steal your
power button or volume button in about
two seconds rendering your $1,000 phone
inoperable but I mean it's a
professional phone which means you
probably have professional friends and
they wouldn't just steal your buttons
and walk off right when the buttons are
replaced back into the frame they do
continue to function just like normal it
just seems like a super annoying prank
just waiting to happen the top of the
phone is made from metal one of my
favorite parts of this phone is the
expandable memory this phone with its
docking ability and powerful hardware
combined with the massive storage space
makes it more like a water-resistant
laptop in your pocket than anything else
the bottom of the phone is also made
from metal and it has more features on
this one side of the phone then Apple
has in their entire ecosystem we have a
headphone jack the quick charge USB C
dock and the integrated s-pen Samsung is
over here able to cram entire writing
utensils inside of their cell phone
while Apple is eating crayons watching
their whole pencil poke out the bottom
of an iPad I know which design I prefer
the S Pen does have some new features
this year which we'll check out the
entire thing is made from plastic
including the chrome section up at the
top near the clicky bit the button on
the side of the S Pen is also plastic it
still has the removable tips which come
included in the box so you can swap them
out for softer or harder rubber
depending on your note-taking preference
one of the coolest things about the new
S Pen is that this time it includes low
energy Bluetooth and a super capacitor
inside which makes this the most
advanced s-pen yet it still has the
copper induction ring around the tip so
the screen can sense where the s-pen is
pointing even when hovering over the
glass and not touching but on the
circuit board itself is where we find
the super capacitor which fully charges
after only 40 seconds inside the phone
and lasts about 30 minutes as a trigger
for your camera or to change tracks on
your music remotely the difference
between capacitors like the one inside
the S Pen and batteries is that
capacitors charge almost instantly and
keep that charge contained in an
electrical field while batteries store
their energy and chemical form like
lithium and have a much longer lifespan
it's pretty cool technology will reject
Bixby's update and move on to the back
of the phone the camera lens is made
from glass protecting the dual optically
stabilized regular and telephoto lenses
and that built-in heart rate monitor
Samsung has stuck their variable
aperture lens in here again which will
be fun to see during the teardown the
fingerprint scanner is still scratch
alone the camera lens and fingerprint
scanner sit pretty flush with the back
glass the camera is protruding ever so
slightly while the fingerprint scanner
is barely recessed even with the
scratches on the fingerprint scanner
though it was still incredibly fast to
recognize my fingerprint and was still
responsive every time I unlock the phone
thumbs up for that I talk about
protection a lot here on my channel one
way to protect against damage and
fingerprints is with the skin huge
thanks to D brand for supporting my
channel in sponsoring this video
D brand has protective skins in all
colors and designs but this yellow
carbon fiber is perfect if you're always
losing your phone or just really have a
thing for bulletproof bananas skins are
surprisingly inexpensive and I'll leave
a link for you in the video description
if you like saying yellow things on
phones you'll love my burn test this six
point four inch Super AMOLED screen only
Samsung note 9 lasted an impressive 15
seconds under my yellow flame before the
screen turned white and then
surprisingly recovered - the evaporation
of the oleophobic coating on the glass
of course the screen is totally back to
normal and now for the ultimate test of
structural integrity the Ben test
Samsung has pretty much always been a
leader in the well-built rigid
smartphone department ever since the
very first phone I tested back with the
galaxy s6 in 2015 Samsung's newest
flagship is no different with zero flex
in any direction front or back this
phone construction is worthy of the
massive price tag except for the part
where people can walk off with your
buttons like I always say keep your
friends close and your buttons even
closer would you buy this phone I'm
still currently using my year and a half
old Galaxy s8 plus as my daily driver
and I'm still super happy with it so I
think I'll hold out on upgrading for
just a little while longer customize
your phone with the D brand link in the
description hit that subscribe button if
you haven't already and in the next
video we'll be tearing down the note 9 -
check out that massive fortnight ready
heat dissipation system thanks ton for
watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
