messed up iPhone 5c today you can see
that the screen is cracked and is
completely unresponsive due to water
damage it won't respond to any of the
buttons the power or the home button and
I won't even respond if I plug it into a
charger so I'm going to take it apart
and show you a really simple way that
will most likely get your wet phone
working again I've had a lot of success
with water damage devices just by
swapping out the internal batteries keep
in mind that swapping your battery won't
always work but it is a good first place
to start water is pretty devastating to
electronic devices so make sure the
phone is completely dry before starting
this repair because the screen is
cracked I can't use my normal suction
cup to lift the screen off after pulling
out the bottom two screws I'm going to
show you a quick little trick that you
can do with the razor blade just make
sure that you are gently prying up on
the frame of the screen and not the
glass of the screen itself the frame is
much more durable you can see here that
the water damage indicator is red as
well as the screws in the bottom left
corner of the phone are starting to rust
this phone was completely submerged in
water and has been dead for a while once
the screen lifts away from the phone you
can start unscrewing the metal bracket
that holds the battery in I'll link tool
kit in the video description below the
battery is usually what dies first when
water gets inside your phone once that
metal bracket comes off on clip little
latch that connects the battery to the
mainboard it is very similar to a Lego
piece
the battery will be very strongly glued
into the bottom of the phone
you can use a plastic pry tool to gently
pry the battery out of the phone just
make sure not to put any pressure on the
motherboard you don't want to cause any
damage to your phone when you are
removing the old battery you can see
here that the battery is all soft and
mushy I will link good replacement
batteries in the video description below
so check that out
they are pretty darn cheap so you aren't
out very much if it ends up not working
out for you the links are located in the
little About tab right below this video
once you have your new battery you can
see that this one is much firmer than
the old one set it gently in place and
clip that little connector back in it
will click down just like a little Lego
you can see that we have a working
iPhone 5c again swapping the battery has
a good chance of bringing your dead
phone back to life a battery swap will
not fix any screen issues that you are
having though if your phone turns on but
the screen is white or it has lines or
condensation in it make sure to let it
dry in the back of rice for a couple
days and if that doesn't fix it then
maybe swapping the screen will fix that
issue watch my iPhone 5c screen
replacement video to see if it is worth
your time and money to replace that
remember replacement parts are always
listed in the video description
replacing the battery will most likely
fix phones that don't turn on at all or
that don't hold a charge after being
water damaged if the phone does not
recognize a charger then you're going to
need to replace the charging port you
can watch my iPhone 5c charging port
replacement video for more information
on that if you have any other questions
or suggestions be sure to leave them in

subscribe and like the video and I'm
also enjoying this Instagram thing so
