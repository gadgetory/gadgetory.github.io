improved processing a better camera and
a bigger battery it is a fantastic cash
grab for the oneplus team right before
the holidays excellent business decision
it'll be interesting to see how all
these new features got crammed into the
exact same body design of the old one
plus three let's hope that the bright
red box signifies the return of the
iconic red one plus battery it's time to
open it up and find out the only
external physical difference between the
one plus three and the three t is a
slight change in color and now the
oneplus claims to have a sapphire camera
lens I have a few tools for testing
sapphire the first is the diamond
selector tool you can see that the
crystal lens of the 3t is indeed
registering as sapphire if I take the
same tool and press it to the glass lens
of the older one plus three nothing
happens I can check the hardness of the
sapphire with my Mohs pics real pure
sapphire should register as an 8 or 9 on
Mohs scale of hardness regular glass
will scratch at level 6 the point of
having a sapphire lens is to reduce
scratching I can almost feel the level 7
pic catching on the lens but the level 8
pic is where we start to see some damage
this is exactly where my sapphire
crystal Tisa watch scored as well so big
thumbs up to 1 plus for using quality
sapphire now since 1 plus is just
reusing the exact same body and frame as
the 1 plus 3 my durability test still
stands for this new version physically
it is the exact same phone even opening
up this new phone is the exact same
process as the original one plus 3
teardown video I'll link both of those
videos at the end of this one and in the
video description if you're curious as
the back aluminum shell falls off the 1
plus 3t I am met with crushing
disappointment at the lack of red
battery that was so prominent in the
oneplus 2 and the original oneplus
phones the 3t even has a green pull tab
like for real green that's the furthest
from red you can get I don't know how
these engineers sleep at night
side-by-side it would be almost
impossible to tell the phone's apart
just by looking at them the
frustratingly green colored pull tab is
the only indicator that something has
changed both cameras still have oh I
yes and you can see all of the mill
lines of the solid aluminum rear back
panel this is a very sturdy foam when
you get up close and personal with the
batteries though you can see that the
original three has a 3000 milliamp
battery and the new 3t battery has a
3400 milliamp hour capacity
quite the capacity jump with the exact
same physical dimensions even the part
that connects to the main board is the
exact same size the 3t battery does fit
perfectly into the frame of the older
one plus three and the phone even turns
on when connected and functions like
normal with the larger capacity battery
inside the only problem is when I check
the battery capacity with five different
applications they all claim that the new
battery is only 3000 milliamp hour it
doesn't recognize the extra capacity on
a software level so depending on how one
plus has they're charging setup it might
never fully charge the battery all the
way because it's designed to stop at
three thousand to prevent overcharging
this could easily be fixed on a software
level with an update but it's probably
never going to happen
that's unfortunate though because it
would be a fun little upgrade for one
plus three owners who need to replace
their original batteries in a few years
for the record I did reassemble the one
plus three T with the correct battery
and the battery capacity did register at
the full 3400 but it was probably
pulling from the software information as
well either way it was a fun experiment
I don't need to one plus three S which
is an incredibly weird sentence to say
mathematically so I'll be giving away
the one plus three T on my Twitter just
like and retweet this tweet to enter it
has a few scratches on the camera lens
but the Jerry signature adds at least
thirty more megapixels if you want to
see a durability test or teardown of the
original one plus three check out these
videos and follow me on Instagram and
Twitter for all the behind the scenes my
Twitter followers saw the guts of this
phone before anyone else in the world
thanks for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
