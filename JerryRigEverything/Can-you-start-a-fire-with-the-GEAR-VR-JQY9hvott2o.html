if you want to know the answer to a
question literally no one is asking stay
tuned so the sun is shining right now
and we're gonna see if we can start a
fire with the glare from the lens of the
gear so starting it looks like the lens
is just a bit too far away to get a
super solid focal point so let's pop
those lenses out and see what happens
I'm trying to start a match with one of
the lenses from the gear VR and it looks
like the match is smoking a little bit
just need to get it hot enough to light
so we got the matches to burn so we can
see that there's some serious heat
coming from that focal point so let's
see if we can get the paper to ignite so
it looks like even on the base of the
match is starting to start a fire this
is all in real time too it only takes a
couple seconds for it to start smoking
so fun fact usually dryer lint is pretty
flammable let's give that a shot all
right so you have a little pile of
kindling now made from matchsticks let's
see what happens
well the focal point from the Lin's is
hot enough to start a match on fire but
if you already have a match chances are
you don't need the gear VR to start a
fire and it's definitely hot enough to
fry ants or other bugs but at the same
time it's not hot enough to actually
start sticks on fire
I imagine that with a magnifying glass
you have a little bit bigger of a focal
point and it'll end up working out a lot
better so don't expect virtual reality
to solve any actual reality
fire-starting problems that you might
have in the future and bring a bigger
magnifying glass thanks enough for
