the color on the back glass of your
samsung galaxy phone this works for the
samsung galaxy s6 the galaxy s6 edge the
note 5 basically any phone with the back
glass removing the back glass is
probably the hardest part of this whole
project so make sure you watch these
videos very carefully to see how the
glass is removed on your device mostly
all that's required is a heat gun a
suction cup helps and a pry tool once
you have successfully removed the back
glass without breaking it from your
device getting the color off is fairly
easy
I took a razor blade and slid it between
the hard glass layer and the metal film
on the back and you can see that once
you get it started it peels off fairly
easily it is stuck on pretty tight but
with a little bit of force and
persuasion you can pull it right off it
doesn't leave any residue behind either
which is really nice another bonus is
that the glass is tempered so even
though I am using a razor blade the
glass itself is not going to scratch
because it is very scratch resistant one
thing to remember while doing this is
try to keep the glass flat on the table
that you're working on because if you do
flex or bow the glass at all while
you're lifting up it can snap in half
the scratch resistance of the glass does
make it more brittle so a bend will
break it you can see that it peels off
mostly in one piece if it ever does
break just start over again and pull the
rest off now the glass is clear you can
take a little bit of double-sided sticky
tape I will link this in the video
description along with replacement backs
if you do end up breaking yours you can
find all of that stuff linked in the
video description of this video now that
the back glass is clear you can do all
sorts of things one is you just put it
back on the phone again or you can slip
a picture of your girlfriend under their
favorite deity or even your favorite
presidential candidate here's some other
pictures of other people who have
accomplished this same thing thanks a
ton for watching the video hope to see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
