requested that I durability test a
fourth generation Moto G or also known
as the Moto G for pretty inexpensive
compared to most of the phones I test
even though it is rocking an octa-core
processor is a durable though that's
what we're here to find out
as always let's start with the scratch
test the most pics help us see how
scratch resistant the glasses Motorola
is advertising that there is Gorilla
Glass 3 on this phone so it's not
surprising at all when it scratches at a
level 6 this is perfectly normal and
sits perfectly on par with the rest of
the tempered glass screen flagships it's
not invincible against scratches like
sapphire or ceramic would be but it is
very scratch resistant the earpiece slot
is abnormally large for a cell phone
perfect size for collecting dust makeup
or even allowing small rocks to get in
and unfortunately there is no metal
grille inside the glass keeping the
earpiece protected the black part you
see is more like a rubberish vinyl
covering so if you ever need to clean
out this little slot be gentle with it
or the earpiece covering might get
punctured the 5 megapixel camera is
under that same front layer of Gorilla
Glass 3 so you don't have to worry about
it getting scratched up either the back
of the phone is removable but for some
reason it still does not give us access
to the battery this is extremely weird a
removable back with a non removable
battery I'll have to see what's up with
that during my tear down and repair
video if the Moto G 4 survives the rest
of my durability test the back of the
phone is made out of rubber since it is
easily replaceable it's not that big of
a deal so you get scratched up but as
you can see my razor blade still does a
pretty good job of disfiguring the
grippy material scratching on rubber
doesn't have that same satisfying
metal-on-metal sound we all enjoy but I
still manage to draw a happy little tree
I imagine most of you aren't going to
take a razor blade to your phone so I
did test some everyday objects like skis
and coin but neither of them left a mark
rubber is pretty durable and resilient
even if it's not one of those premium
feeling build materials like glass and
real metal
now that art classes with Jerry are
finished we can move on to the sides of
the phone these are plastic all the way
through which is totally fine for device
this price the inner plastic is a
slightly different shade of grey though
any dings or dents would visibly show up
with time so watch out for that the side
buttons are also made of plastic the
volume and power button this phone does
have a headphone jack so for you
practical people who enjoy listening to
music on the go this full-featured phone
would be a fantastic choice there is one
13 megapixel camera on the back
is out at 1080p resolution while
recording video but at least it is
covered in glass so that camera is
protected from scratches as well the
dual colored flash is also plastic but
that's totally fine
since light will get dispersed either
way scratches or no scratches the
Motorola logo is built into the back
rubber panel so there's no worries about
that popping out like on some of the
older Nexus phones and now it's time for
the burn test the Moto g4 has an IPS LCD
under that gorilla glass layer similar
to the iPhone it lasts about nine
seconds under my flame with IPS LCD the
pixels will go black and then turn
completely off but when the heat is
removed the screen or covers completely
the flame from my lighter still burns
away the outer and visible oleophobic
glass coating though so I would
recommend against lighting your own
phone on fire speaking of things you
also shouldn't try yourself it's time
for the bin test
stress testing a phone during a bin test
is a good way to find out how
structurally sounds the build quality is
this phone holds up just fine when I
apply pressure to the screen side of the
device but when I flip it over there is
some major flex to the phone luckily it
still does not catastrophic Lee snap in
half it still functions perfectly fine
even though it is currently identifying
as a banana this phone passes the bin
test and I'll give it a thumbs up as far
as durability goes it's nice to know
that a phone doesn't have to be
expensive to be solidly built since this
Motorola g4 passed the test you can
safely assume that the g4 plus would
also pass since they have the same basic
build quality and structural integrity I
was able to bend the phone back straight
again so there is probably some metal
somewhere inside of the phone we'll find
out during the teardown I'll link
current pricing for this phone down in
the video description right below this
video and I'll also link to tear down
there as well as soon as I get that
finished pick me up on Twitter or
Instagram for behind the scenes and
giveaways and let me know in the
comments what phone you want to see me
test next budget or premium thanks for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
