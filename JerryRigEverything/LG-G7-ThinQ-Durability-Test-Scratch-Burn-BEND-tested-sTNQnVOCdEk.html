think you for the g7 think or something
like that this is the raspberry Rose
version which actually looks pretty
unique it has a softer more elegant tone
to it definitely not the in-your-face
read brilliance of the 1 plus 6 but
still subtly impressive my mom has been
using the LG G 6 for the last year and I
could totally see her rocking a color
like this we aren't here to ogle though
let's get started right off the bat I
get a warning from the phone telling me
not to remove the battery like that's
even an option the phone is sealed shut
and ip68 so it's not like a battery
removal is gonna happen on accident
I guess the phone just knows who's
holding it but don't worry little guy
we won't dissect you yet that's the next
video LG is using Gorilla Glass 5 on
their g7q Corning Gorilla Glass is on
every major smartphone these days which
is fine with me it's consistent and as
shatter resistant as glass can be still
scratches at level 6 which we've come to
expect with the deeper grooves at a
level 7 LG has given us a notch this
year which personally I have no strong
feelings one way or the other it is what
it is the sensors and front 8 megapixel
camera are all covered by that same
Gorilla Glass 5 our earpiece is made
from metal and very securely attached to
the phone it's it's totally flush with a
glass surface no buttons down at the
bottom of the phone but we do have an
extra button on the side the sides are
made for metal as well as the upper
volume button and the lower volume
button both metal our newest friend down
here is a dedicated Google Assistant
button kind of cool I personally would
still prefer a Mew slider or the ability
to change the function of the button if
I wanted I'd probably use a dedicated
camera button more often than I would a
voice assistant it's still better than a
permanent Bigsby though so I'm not
complaining too much at the bottom of
the phone we have our headphone jack
which is awesome for functionality
thumbs up for that and a USB C port over
on the far side of the g7 it's pretty
empty except for a lone power button
which is indeed an actual clicky button
and not just decoration like HTC has
been using and finally up here at the
top of the phone you have a little
microphone hole and our dual SIM card
tray which includes an SD card slot as
well nice work
moving around to the backside of the
phone the g7 thinkyou branding is
permanent and under the glass so it
won't be coming off to be honest this is
really an amazing looking phone mum if
you want an unscratched g7 upgrade I'm
sure we can work out some kind of
homemade chocolate chip cookie exchange
program she watches all my videos
the laser autofocus and flash are
protected under that glass no issues
there the 16 megapixel main camera lens
is also protected with glass as well as
the wide-angle camera lens right below
it
it's nice having two cameras that
accomplish different things there is a
little metal lip around the camera lens
and it all sits relatively flush with
the back panel the fingerprint scanner
is slightly recessed and can be damaged
I kind of like to see how much abuse
phones can handle so we get an idea of
what they can realistically survive in
real life and luckily even with this
damage the LG G 7 fingerprint scanner
still functions perfectly no complaints
the back panel is still made from glass
harder than my razor blade which makes
our class with cherry impossible but the
bird test is still an option
LG used a 1440p 6.1 inch IPS LCD this
time lasting about 7 seconds out of the
flame which isn't as long as most but
still longer than some if you look
closely you can see me grasping at
reasons for this test but the screen
still recovers - the evaporated
oleophobic coating of course structure
and build quality are important if you
want your phone to last a while without
expensive each phone is these days you
don't want to buy a fragile one the bin
test shows us how well the phone is
constructed and with this LG g7 there's
hardly any flex from the front or the
back of the phone plus the back panel is
still secured with that water resistance
intact
nothing is separating it has an
impressive build with that headphone
jack Google assistant and unflexible
let's see what I did there
yeah I'm pretty hilarious coming out
with me on Twitter and Instagram and
thanks a ton for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
