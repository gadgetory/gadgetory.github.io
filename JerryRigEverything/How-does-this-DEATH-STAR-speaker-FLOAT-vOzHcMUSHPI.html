day a levitating Death Star speaker with
the new Star Wars movie coming out I
feel like now would be a good time to
take this thing apart unbox it and see
what kind of force it uses to levitate
let's get started and peel off the top
and inside we probably have some kind of
instruction books a little bit of foam
padding and oh boy the Death Star the
Bluetooth speaker inside of this set and
I think at the very bottom we have this
this should be the bass hole a little
bit of a force there here in the center
and it wants to pull the bass off to the
side like that okay let's see what
happens I'm not sure what this thing is
maybe those instructions were important
after all when you feel a strong force
which is holding the Death Star from the
base this position is the levitation
point release the speaker gently and
take out the floating stand vertically
without any impact on the Death Star
okay let's try that out so I'm gonna
take both hands trying to find the
floating point here in the center oh boy
I think I got it I think I got it nice
whoo okay the Death Star is now
levitating come take a look at this it
is spinning all by itself and there is
nothing below it that's pretty sweet
list of available devices right here is
the Death Star we'll go ahead and pair
with that the only proper way to start
off a Bluetooth star wars speaker is
with ten hours of the cantina band
I mean it's a small speaker so it's not
gonna have the big base of a big speaker
but it's pretty unique it's not bad at
all it's very unique it's a small
bluetooth speaker if you're gonna buy
this you're gonna buy it because it's
Star Wars and not because of the
impeccable sound quality as far as like
the levitation goes it's holding itself
pretty well in the air I mean above
anything's like there's nothing
supporting it it's rocking around a
little bit I'm curious to see where the
mounting points are inside of this thing
like where the force is that's holding
it up and there's only one way to do
that let's take it apart now destroying
the Death Star is actually a pretty big
pain it's almost like it's not designed
to come apart there are no clasps that
come undone excessive force might be
necessary after analyzing the
construction I have detected a weakness
in the battle station but the approach
will not be easy
it will maneuver my saw blade straight
down this little trench right between
the power button and this antique
microUSB port since the Death Star
existed a long time ago in a galaxy far
far away we can let the microUSB sly for
now but any future Death Star's will
need to be equipped with us you see
these little metal windows can pop out
once the plastic surrounding them is cut
you can see how strong the attracting
magnetic forces below the Death Star
finally I was able to chop through a few
of the support channels which are about
the size of a small womp rat we get a
glimpse of the main speaker at this
point it's a small little guy but it
does get the job done there's a few more
screws holding down the speaker to the
base I'll pop those out and continue on
to the reactor core the speaker has
three connections one for the charging
port one for the power button and the
black and red speaker wires themselves
the circuit board has its own four
screws I'll take out those and finally
the board and battery can come loose
from the superweapon the battery is
about one thousand milliamp hours the
magical force that supports the Death
Star is well a magnet it's big circular
and very tightly glued to the bottom
plastic pretty interesting and now it's
time to inspect the empire's foundation
this large circular platform is
protected by a thick
or math I imagine this it to help keep
the whole thing from moving around there
are four screws under that mat holding
the base together there has to be
something super important in here to
help keep the death star stable
balancing free-floating magnets is not
an easy task there are some interesting
circuits inside the base with four
screws holding it all down to the
plastic after removing these I can lift
up the circuits and flip over the whole
contraption exposing the electromagnets
electromagnetic levitation is complex
but essentially provides a balance to
the force the large exterior circle you
see is a magnet and the four circles in
the center are the electromagnets
usually oriented in the opposite
directions because opposite poles
attract the magnet inside the Death Star
is attracted to the large circle shaped
magnet which makes it kind of hard to
place but the oppositely oriented
electromagnets are doing the calculated
repelling as needed turning off and on
or adjusting the power to keep the
Deathstar stable remember this base is
plugged into the wall and needs power to
keep functioning magnets aren't gonna
float by themselves pretty fun stuff and
a major thumbs up to ever design this
Death Star I'll leave a link for this
contraption in the video description and
now you won't need to take apart your
speaker to find out how it floats or how
it works
hit that subscribe button if you haven't
already and come hang out with me on
Instagram
thank you a ton for watching and may the
force be with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
