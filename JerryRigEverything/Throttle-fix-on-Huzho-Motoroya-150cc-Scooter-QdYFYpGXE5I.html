buddy to scooter he bought one of those
crappy Chinese ones that ends up being a
lot more trouble than it's worth
anyway so last night at intersection he
went to go but his throttle stopped
working so the scooter was running fine
though it wouldn't go anywhere so the
first step in fixing this problem is not
buying a cheap Chinese scooter the
second step the second step in fixing
this problem is lifting up the seat
taking out the plastic bin right here
there's two ten millimeter bolts on
either side and then to the mount right
here and you can see right here is where
the throttle connects and so if I were
to spin the twist of throttle right here
you can see that cable right there
coming in and out anyway so what
happened with him is this bolt just
slipped so it's not tight on either side
of this bracket so what I have to do
right now is tighten this bolt this
bottom one first to get it to the right
position and then tighten this one
afterward to hold it there and hope that
this isn't stripped out enough that it's
permanently broken also this is the
throttle right here and the throttle
needs to be able to spin that direction
to give it gas and so we have to wrap
this cable around the back side like
that I can't really see it anyway wrap
the cable around the back side so that
it'll when it's pulled on it'll twist
that direction twist out like that and
there we go now I have these two nuts
the nut on this side and on this side
tightened where this is given when the
throttle is sitting you know completely
open nothing's moving
you didn't see it rotating right there
there we go throttle has its pull back
and it runs and great you won't feel any
