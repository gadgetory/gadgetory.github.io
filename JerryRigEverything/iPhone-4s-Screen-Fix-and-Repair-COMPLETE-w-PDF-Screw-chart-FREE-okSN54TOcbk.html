the screen on the 4 or 4s is staying
organized so I made this sweet little
paper that will help you stay organized
you can download it directly from my
blog by clicking the bottom left hand
corner one little trick I've learned is
it put a piece of tape over the crack
screen it will keep shards of glass from
going everywhere I will link replacement
screens in the video description below
so it's easier for everybody to find the
good ones if you have any questions or
anything leave them in the comments I
respond fairly regularly turn the phone
off if you can and then take out the SIM
card as you can see this tutorial is
going to be pretty straightforward no
fluff as quick as possible
take out the two bottom screws there a
pentalobe screwdriver you can see the
tools in the video description below the
back slides up and then pops right off
I'm going to go ahead and put that on my
handy dandy little paper two screws
holding the battery bracket in and once
that's done grab the little black piece
and you better believe there's a slot on
the paper for this as well keep
everything organized then you lift the
little bracket up and that unconnect the
battery and you pull up on the little
pull tab if the pull tab breaks which
I've had happen before just pry the
battery out it's held in place by a
little bit of glue place that on the
paper and then I just fold the tab over
so it stays out of my way as little
shield holding the charging port
connector take that shield off there's a
spot for the screws as well then there's
the top shield four screws lift that up
and out there's two little slots in the
bottom holding it onto the motherboard
place that on your little paper and then
the camera it's like a little Lego you
lift up on that little bottom piece and
unclips take the camera put it on the
paper and then there's some ribbon
cables kind of like Legos just lift up
and away gently always these are to the
screen that digitised around the LCD and
then there's this little black sticker
covering up this little screw that we
have to also remove once that screws
gone there will be a little gold
piece that we also need to not lose
place it on your paper and another screw
over here for another bracket this
itty-bitty bracket will come up and away
from the board and you have to remove
that before you can start on the
motherboard
another little connector and then we're
going to bend up this other black part
over here just to give us a little bit
more room to work with three more ribbon
cables down along the bottom well in the
center of the motherboard and then we're
going to lift up the charging port
connector just kind of fold it up and
out of our way two screws holding down
the bottom speaker put that on the paper
also little black triangle there's a
slot for everything and then this wire
cable just clips up and away from the
mainboard and then there's four screws
holding on the mainboard once those
screws are done you can just kind of
wiggle it out make sure it's not getting
caught on any of the ribbon cables you
want to be super gentle with those and
then the little circle thingy as well
there is a slot for that on my paper
then there's four screws in the corner
of the phone it's very important that
you remove these because this is what's
holding the screen onto the frame of the
iPhone there's six other screws along
the sides and each of these has a little
washer as well so make sure to keep the
washer with the screw now this is only
for the iPhone 4 unlatch that little
latch and that's for the home button so
you don't tear the ribbon cable on the
home button the iPhone 4s ribbon cable
is not connected to the home button as
you'll see here in a second now the
iPhone 4s screen easily pulls away from
the frame you just want to slide those
ribbon cables through the little hole
sounds it's already broken it's not too
big of a deal if it breaks too the
little heads off but you know be careful
anyway and now you want to get rid of
every little tiny bit of glass that you
possibly can because if there's any
glass in here then the screens not going
to sit tight against the frame of the
phone anymore which is kind of a big
deal
so clean it up as best you can and take
off the little plastic piece on the new
screen and slide it into place you want
to keep those cables up
the top is straight as possible keep in
mind as well that the CDMA and the gsm
have differently space frame brackets
you can see that the ribbon cables up
top are not bent in any way they just
slide straight in if you feel like your
cables are too short chances are you
bent one of them now that it's in place
it sits flush with no glass in between
the screen and the frame and now I need
to get my home button up in there I'm
taking it off of the old screen just
peeling it away getting all the extra
glass off of there and then popping it
right into its little slot and now we're
going to put it all back together four
screws in the corner make sure they're
all tight six screws along the sides
also make sure they're tight with little
washers in place and that the screen is
sitting flat against the frame and then
you take the mainboard and slide it in
the little grooves it'll sit completely
flat against the bottom of the phone
make sure there's no wire cables or
anything else pinched underneath and
then grab your little circular device
and slide that in as well then there's
going to be four screws around the
outside of the mainboard
grab your loudspeaker pop that into
place put the top of the speaker in
first and then drop the bottom of the
speaker down and then you can wrap the
wire cable around be really really
careful when you're putting this into
place when you're clipping it in that
you don't been dizzy of the sides now
you put your little black triangle in
place and then screw both of those in
then you can fold over the charging port
cable clip that back into place
get the itty-bitty bracket on top little
screw hole screw it back in get the gold
bracket next to the camera place that in
place screw it in and get the camera in
there click it in like a little Lego
you'll definitely know when it clicks in
and then start folding over the ribbon
cables these are the LCD and digitizer
cables
and then you have three more start with
the shortest one and then get the other
ones in place and then the top shield
clips in with the bottom two brackets
and there's four screws around the
outside
one more shield covering the charging
port cable lift up your little tab and
get the battery in place make sure not
to pinch any of the cables as you're
sliding it in I like to put the top end
first take that little black bracket get
that into place and then screw in the
two screws holding the battery in place
and get the back on there two screws for
the the pentalobe screws and the phone
works if you have any questions make
