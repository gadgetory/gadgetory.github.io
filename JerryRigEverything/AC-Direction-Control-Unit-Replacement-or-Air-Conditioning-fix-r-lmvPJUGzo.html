right here as I popped off the knobs
pretty straightforward and I have my
replacement one right here so just
pulled out of a used car so all those
wires just cut so I'm just going to take
out those little plugs and then on the
back of this I can just replug those
wires into the back of the other one to
pull this off of the dashboard just get
some little screwdriver just kind of
wiggle it in there just like twisted
apart it's only got these little plugs
holding it into the car that looks like
it's got three on either side one on the
top two on the side s once those are
pulled out the actual control thing
itself has four bolts around it and each
of these are 7 millimeters so I'm going
to take off this one that one and then
the matching two bolts on the other side
and then once that comes apart pop this
face plate off and then I'll take a
sample so now is pop the face plate off
of the old one and I'm going to put the
new face plate on the old one just
because my my buttons are in better
shape than the other buttons that I've
gone this unit that I just got anyways
once I pop that on this part actually
stayed in in with the bezel around the
outside so this part doesn't pop off
which was surprising to me good thing I
didn't try too hard with it and then
there's all those cables that have come
disconnected so it should be pretty
straightforward from here
this is the back of the control panel
to get these plugs off of it because
these wires were just cut right out of
the other car that it was in so each of
these ploys comes out in a different way
this top one needs to be pressed down on
this black part right here and then this
plug comes out this one right here fits
down over these two holes and this
little rubber part over here just needs
to be manhandled off of that little
arrow and this one pretty
straightforward just pinch down the
bottom and it pulls right out and then
this one over here the only part you
need to take off is this blue part so
it's got these two little hooks that are
holding it on and then this part just
sits down right over like that the flat
part of the blue goes up on the top left
corner there we go
I have air conditioning that changes
before we are trying to fix this thing
this would only go on the defrost so it
only pull
we bring the arrow from the top
so it's just a bad switch in this
section by replacing the whole thing
