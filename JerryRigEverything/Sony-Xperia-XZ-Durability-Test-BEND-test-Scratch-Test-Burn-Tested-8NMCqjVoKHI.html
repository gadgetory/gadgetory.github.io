flagship from Sony the Xperia XZ with an
IP 68 water resistance rating dual front
firing stereo speakers and a headphone
jack it has the initial characteristics
of a spectacular smartphone some people
have complained that the phone is too
much of a rectangle these are the same
people who haven't noticed that every
phone is a rectangle
the only other Sony phone that I have
tested on my channel is the Sony z5
premium while it did not catastrophic Li
snap in half the metal rails on the
sides were broken and the camera lens
was actually made out of plastic instead
of glass so it was definitely not one of
the most durable phones from last year
hopefully the new XZ phone fares better
for this year the most hardness test
always comes first
this helps us tell what material the
screen is made out of shatterproof
screens like the galaxy s7 active or the
droid turbo 2 typically have a plastic
screen which scratches at a level 3 the
average smartphone has tempered glass
and will scratch it a 5 or 6 and if any
company decides to roll out a sapphire
screen in the future they will be
scratching at a level 8 or 9 this sony
xperia XZ screen scratches at a level 6
so it should be safe around keys and
coins but it is still always a good idea
to keep a screen protector on it for
those harder minerals and dust specks in
the environment the 13 megapixel front
facing camera is protected by the same
screen glass so it is also scratch
resistant a unique thing about the XC is
that the NFC chip is actually located
right here next to the front camera
instead of the back of the device like
most other smartphones this little
sticker marks its location the top
earpiece speaker grille appears to be
made out a thin layer of plastic it is
definitely more sturdy than the cloth
speaker cover over the Google pixel but
either way it is still pretty secure and
won't be sliding out on its own but it
is unfortunate that it's not a thicker
metal grille like on the Samsung or the
newer iPhone the bottom speaker is made
out of the same material it won't get
punctured unless something is
deliberately stuck into the slot but
sometimes that will accidentally happen
in your pocket or purse on the back of
the phone that thin little bar along the
bottom is made out of plastic you can
tell it's plastic by the way it is which
is pretty neat
the larger portion of the back panel is
definitely metal
then you can add a little body to the
wild hair and look it's Donald Trump
the single colored LED flash is covered
with plastic which is pretty standard
across all the smart phones it is the
camera lens that we don't want to be
plastic and lucky for us Sony did decide
to change their lens to a more durable
and scratch resistant glass definitely
deserves a thumbs up for that you won't
have to worry about your 23 megapixel
camera lens getting scratched or damaged
easily last year's Sony z5 premium
camera lens was made from the more
easily damaged plastic so I'm definitely
glad they changed materials I wonder if
Sony watches my videos the SIM card and
SD card tray is made out of plastic and
surprisingly the side bars of the phone
are made from plastic as well so if
you're looking for a device that has a
premium metal or glass feel from every
surface of the phone this is not the
device for you you can see the color
difference between the painted exterior
plastic and the unpainted interior
plastic scratches or drops would expose
the color difference between the plastic
layers as well over time the plastic
paint tends to wear down up here by the
beautiful and incredible useful
headphone jack the top edge of the phone
is made from plastic and if we flip the
phone around to look at the USB type-c
charging port we find another plastic
panel at the bottom
unfortunately the fingerprint scanner
slash power button is also made out of
plastic the volume rocker and camera
button are both metal though so that
part is at least good the fingerprint
scanner is not available in the US
version of this phone unfortunately
which is strange considering their high
price point it should be included but
you aren't missing out on too much
though after superficially scratching
the fragile fingerprint scanner with my
razor blade it was unable to read my
fingerprint just remember that both the
pixel and LG v 20 fingerprint scanners
were unfazed by my scratches onto the
burn test the Xperia XZ is using a 1080p
IPS display that can last 13 seconds
under direct flame before the pixels go
black and turn off the screen does fully
recover though the display is cool to
the touch within seconds and the pixels
slowly come back to life after the flame
is removed the flame test is useful to
us because we can tell it's time to move
on to the bin test if you haven't
subscribed yet now is the time to do so
it is completely free and you
stay up to date on the latest flagship
smartphone durability I flex the phone
to check the internal build quality and
the overall structural integrity of the
phone you can hear the plastic sidebars
snap in two separate places near the SD
card slot and right there in the center
but the phone does not catastrophic ly
snap in half and still functions
completely I'll bend the phone from the
other direction we get one more small
snap in the center of the side bar right
there next to the power button but yet
the phone does still not snap in half
altogether it maintains its rectangular
integrity and passes the bin test this
phone is definitely not a contender for
the most durable smartphone of 2016 but
it is still alive so as long as you
don't mind the plastic sidebars and the
weaker scratch Abul fingerprint scanner
this phone is worth considering from a
durability perspective my Instagram
followers got the results in real time
before this video was edited and posted
to YouTube so follow me over there if
you want to be one of the first to watch
my durability test I'm all about
reviewing tech from the inside so thanks
a ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
