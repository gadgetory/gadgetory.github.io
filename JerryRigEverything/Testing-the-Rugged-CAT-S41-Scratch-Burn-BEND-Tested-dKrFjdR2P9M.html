phones the name cat had been brought up
so many times as potentially one of the
most durable phones on the planet but I
haven't had a chance to test that theory
until now I have two phones here D s 31
and the asked 41 the smaller s 31 is
SPECT down a bit with a smaller screen
and smaller battery but the same basic
build today we'll focus on the s 41
let's get started
this definitely isn't your sleek
pristine looking iPhone or Samsung phone
this is built for a very specific group
of people a group of people who need
their device to survive no matter what
happens to it the cat s 41 is even
impressively advertised to resist solar
radiation so Starman here could start
swiping tinder on Mars if he had this
phone and he'd still probably have
better luck than the rest of us for
those of us here on earth
cat had designed this phone to survive a
1.8 meter drop onto concrete an
impressive six foot fall but as we can
tell here to gain that much drop
protection there has to be a thick
plastic layer covering the Gorilla Glass
5 which scratches at a level 3 luckily
that laminate layer is included on the
phone and easily replaceable if it ever
does get too messed up I am going to
leave that protection intact and in
place because the phone is incomplete
without it just remember that the screen
scratches at level 3 there are three
physical buttons along the bottom all
ip68 water-resistant and made from
plastic but if you're outside wearing
protective gloves these large physical
buttons can be useful there is a cutout
on the screen protector for that 8
megapixel front-facing camera it's
covered by Gorilla Glass 5 underneath
that plastic and won't be damaged by my
razor the earpiece is plastic but has
holes small enough that metal shavings
or dirt won't easily get inside the
power button is made from black plastic
along with the volume buttons same
plastic material the body this phone is
where things start to get intense
a beastly layer of thick plastic covers
the entire surface of the phone with
rubber grip covering that plastic and
this isn't the cheap flimsy plastic
either my razor blade is severely
struggling with this stuff down here at
the bottom of the phone we have the
charging port flap covering a microUSB
port and it's interesting every other
water-resistant phone I've tested so far
has never been fit for salt water
because the salt in salt water corrodes
metal faster and degrades adhesive but
since all the metal and adhesive is
covered up on this phone with these
watertight plastic flaps this phone is
salt water resistant up to 2 meters deep
over 6 feet there's even a flap covering
the headphone jack with plenty of
plastic and rubber along that edge to
keep the phone damage free now the
camera is where things start to get a
little disappointing the flash is
plastic which is fine no one really
cares about that but the camera lens
itself is also made from plastic now I
get that plastic is more shatter
resistant than glass but plastic
scratches much easier than glass does so
it's something to keep in mind if you on
this phone also the phone does not
record video in 4k it maxes out at 1080p
the camera was apparently not the focus
or the selling point of the s41
our spaceman snapchat game on Mars is
gonna be rather weak on the side of the
phone we have one metal button which is
programmable
to any app with a short press function
and a long press function now that's
useful and we have another flap keeping
the sim and SD card slots watertight the
iPhone 8 is water-resistant to one meter
just for 30 minutes this cat s 41 is
water-resistant 2 meters deep for up to
an hour cats not messing around inside
this phone is a massive 5,000 milliamp
hour battery that cat says has a 38 hour
talk time or 44 days of standby pretty
impressive I did attempt an art class
with Jerry on the back rubber but the
resilience of rubber closes up on my
razor blade slices hiding my beautiful
cat I drew on the cat phone
it's got pointy little ears and
everything the cat logo is embedded into
the rubber but it's pretty solid and
would take some major abuse to ever fall
out on its own so I'll just put this
back good as new
and now the burn test remember we're
working with several different screen
layers here this is
five inch 1080p display and I left the
flame in place for about 15 seconds
before the outer plastic layer started
to bubble up and melt it got a little
crispy and now the structural Ben test
which is surprising I expected the phone
to be a little more rigid than it is
there is some decent flex to the front
and back of the phone this is definitely
not a bad thing of course since nothing
snapped or broke or was even permanently
disfigured everything straightens out
after the Flex but it does have some
bounce to it long story short the phone
is incredibly durable when it comes to
water resistance and drop protection as
long as you don't mind that plastic
screen and the plastic camera lens it
might not be mainstream but the s41 will
survive basically anything if you had to
pick one feature as the most important
on your smart phone what would it be let
me know in the comments and come hang
out with me on instagram thanks ton for
watching and i'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
