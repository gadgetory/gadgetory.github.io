charging power bank slightly more
expensive than your average power bank
of course because you're buying it for
the logo and not for the juice inside
today we're going to open it up see how
it works and more importantly see if
Tesla has integrated the same
cylindrical batteries that they use in
each of their cars this massive chunk of
power is one of these 16 modules that
make up the Model S battery pack each
module has about 400 individual
batteries inside and maybe Tesla has
used those same style of batteries in
this smaller wireless charger there's
only one way to find out let's get
started
wireless chargers are an interesting
piece of technology they use
electromagnetic induction to safely
transfer energy between devices without
wires an unsafe method of transferring
energy is with a short circuit which can
apparently happen if you set something
metal down on top of a bare Tesla
battery pack rookie mistake on my part
for sure I probably just ruined my
chances of ever working at the Giga
factory let's just all agree not to tell
you longer and I'm gonna move this
somewhere more safe all right where were
we
oh yeah wireless charging so this time
around Tesla added a built-in USB C
cable for those of us with Android
phones to get the power bank to start
transferring power a button on the
bottom of the bank needs to be held down
for three seconds and that'll get the
juices flowing same steps apply for the
wireless charging Android phones have
been able to wirelessly charge for the
past five years or so Apple on the other
hand just recently got into the game
with their iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 last
year usually takes Apple a few years to
understand the new technology but better
late than never there is a little rubber
strip across the top shiny black plastic
layer to keep the phone's slightly
elevated from the surface of the
wireless charger this is purely cosmetic
probably so the charger won't get
scratched by any of the camera bumps
that exist on the different phones as
they get set down into place there are
also a few rubber strips on the bottom
for stability my razor knife was melted
in a few different places from its Tesla
battery pack encounter but I'll just
flip the blade around and we'll be good
to go the construction is rather
actually it's just the plain glossy
black plastic layer which is very
securely adhered over the charger body
so with a lot of caution and a little
PTSD from the last battery I'd touch
I'll pry the top away from the housing
exposing a little masking tape and the
thick circular induction coils we still
don't have our answer to the battery
style question yet we still have to see
if this charger is using this
cylindrical 18 650 cells that Tesla has
inside of their cars to get deeper we'll
need a Phillips head screwdriver to
remove the nine silver screws I'll link
all the tools I use in the video
description then we can pull off the
plastic mid plate exposing the upper
circuit board and a pouch style lithium
ion battery that we see inside of most
cellphones
three more screws hold the motherboards
down in place and the battery itself
while not the same style lithium Tesla's
using in their cars it's still pretty
powerful so I'll take special care not
to puncture and short-circuit this one I
actually still want this charger to work
when I put it back together this
wireless charger has a six thousand
milliamp hour battery inside over twice
the size of the iPhone 10s battery one
important thing to remember with
wireless charging is that it takes much
longer for the energy transfer to occur
with inductive charging versus just
plugging your phone in sometimes even
twice as long so if you need your phone
charged fast just plug it in like a
normal person
the Tesla charger also includes a
standard USB port for charging other
accessories wireless charging overall is
pretty cool just a bit slower and
slightly less efficient the circular pad
inside of this power bank transfers
power to the circular pads we've seen in
all of the other wireless charging
enabled cell phones you need both
components in order for it to function
it would be interesting to know if Tesla
has ever looked into charging their cars
wirelessly the coils and induction field
required to charge an entire vehicle
would be massive either way at least we
know Tesla has their eyes on the
technology even if it isn't worth
implementing yet on a vehicle scale at
least we get it for our cellphones
putting the whole contraption back
together was easy enough with its 12
total Phillips head screws and top
plastic adhesive plate it's a very sleek
and simple design with probably massive
profit margin on Tesla's in which I'm
fine with
I'll support an industry I believe in
all day long I'll link the chargers down
in the video description do you think
wireless charging is the future let me
know down in the comments I'm gonna go
make sure my punctured Tesla battery
pack doesn't
John fire but thanks a ton for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
