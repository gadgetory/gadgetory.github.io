skipping the note 6 and having the note
7 recalled I think it's high time that
the note 5 users get a solid upgrade
inside the box we have the microUSB to
USB C adapter that's the kind of dongle
I like saying in a box and then up here
at the top we have a charging cable and
the box includes some headphones talked
about a box packed with essentials let's
see how well this Note 8 holds up under
my durability test
Samsung has been among the most solid
phones I've ever tested I see no reason
why the no date should be any different
but there's only one way to find out for
sure and that's by starting with a
scratch test my buddy mole came up with
this test back in 1812 to differentiate
between different minerals like ceramic
sapphire glass and plastic even titanium
on the essential phone I tested
yesterday the note 8 has Gorilla Glass 5
on the front and scratches at level 6
with the deeper groove at level 7 that's
the solid standards these days for smart
phones and pretty normal the iPhone 7
scored the same up at the top of the
phone we have a plethora of sensors the
iris scanner the front-facing 8
megapixel camera and the proximity
sensor all protected by the same Gorilla
Glass 5 it's no worries about damage
there the earpiece is also solid metal
and looks like whenever fall out on its
own down at the bottom of the phone we
find the same huge slab of glass with no
physical buttons there's one button at
the bottom of the phone though or the
s-pen I made a whole video taking apart
the Samsung stylus and showing how it
electromagnetically communicates with
the phone you can check that out if you
want the important thing for this video
though is that the s-pen is made out of
plastic on all surfaces but thin rubber
chips are replaceable by the way there
are some thicker and softer tips
included in the box if you're into that
kind of thing also the s-pen won't get
stuck if you put it in backwards which
was a problem with the old no 5s this
one seems to be more idiot-proof the
back of the phone has the same solid
slab of Gorilla Glass 5 that the front
has on it so my razor blade will leave
no mark on the surface up here by the
dual cameras there is a small metal ring
between the lens and the back panel that
sticks up just barely enough to protect
the camera lens when you set it down on
a table it's still a good idea to be
gentle though one small rocker speck of
dust and a scratch on your camera lens
could happen the dual lens itself is
glass dome even over the flash Samsung
plopped a telephoto camera into their
phone next to the regular wide-angle
lens which I'm actually pretty excited
about it's much more useful than any
black and white monochrome sensors that
I've seen both lenses supposedly have oh
is that optical image stabilization so I
have to check on that during my tear
down video right next to the two lenses
the fingerprint scanner is the first
thing that my razor can damage stuck all
the way up here at the top of the phone
it's not like anything we'll ever be
able to reach it including your own
fingers but I'll still check and see if
it works
even with the major damage it can still
read and sense my fingerprint only the
same finger I scanned
could access the phone the glass and
ceramic phones keep disrupting my art
class with Jerry but one thing that can
scratch is the solid metal size of the
note 8 and typical Samsung fashions the
middle wraps all around the phone and
includes the quality metal buttons up
here at the top we have the sim and SD
card tray and over on the other side the
permanent best buddy picks B button is
still here awesome the bottom of the
note 8 has the fast charging USB C port
as well as the ever convenient headphone
jack when you need one you need one and
it's definitely nice to have it the
bottom edge of the stylus has metal on
it as well keeping that same premium
feeling all around the edge of the phone
one thing that has accumulated during
this test that might bother some people
is a plethora of fingerprints if you
prefer a naked feeling phone but hate
the look of fingerprints a skin is not a
bad idea Plus glass only breaks after a
defect or impurity like a scratch is
introduced into the glass a skin keeps
those small Nicks and scratches from
happening in the first place laminated
glass is stronger than unlimited glass
if you're not into dragons wood or
concrete though there's always the fiery
yellow color and loving memory of our
previous no7 and I'll toss the D brand
link in the video description so show
them some love for helping make this
video possible
this Note 8 is IP 68 water-resistant 1
whole level above the IP 67 iPhone 7 I
do enjoy bringing that up every time
fire is quite the opposite of water but
this 6.3 inch super amoled 1440p display
is HDR 10 compliant just like the LG g 6
basically that means it displays colors
real good and lasts about 10 seconds
under direct flame before getting
permanently damaged and not recovering
mix B is all up in our business about it
but I'll disable him later
like always we finish off with the bin
test this gives us an over idea on the
build quality of cell phones I've tested
about 75 different phones now it's a
pretty expensive hobby and Samsung has
always been one of the strongest in this
note 8 is no different flex from the
front or the back and it remains unfazed
and fully functional between the s-pen
wireless charging dual cameras SD card
slot headphone jack and solid water
resistance this is definitely daily
driver material I'll be impressed if the
next iPhone has half as many features as
the note 8 speaking of which I will be
testing the iPhone 8 when it gets
announced in a few weeks so make sure
you're subscribed and ready for that
I'll keep Twitter updated
the exact time that the video will be
posted check the description to see what
dbrand has for your phone and thanks for
watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
