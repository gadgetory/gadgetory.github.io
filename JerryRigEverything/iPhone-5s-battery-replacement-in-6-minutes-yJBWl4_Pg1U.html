the battery in the iPhone 5s first take
your pentalobe screwdriver the same
screwdriver that's used for all of the
iPhones and take out the two screws near
the base then take your suction cup and
put as close to the home button as
possible and take a metal pry tool or
anything that's sturdy enough to fit
between the glass screen and the metal
frame I like to use a razor blade just
because of how firm it is it doesn't
bend around and make sure that the
screen comes up when in control so you
can see I'm just barely prying it up
very very gently right here and I'm
going to switch to a plastic tool to not
damage the frame of the screen you have
to be very careful when you're lifting
it up because there is a little ribbon
cable attached to the home button that
you can see right here and there is a
little clasp that you have to lift up
it's just like a little latch so I'm
going to get my little pry tool in there
and just clip it up and you can see it
Bend back just like a little door and
the whole little thing comes off you can
see that it'll detach itself as soon as
I get the ribbon cable unclipped so it's
kind of like a Lego so I lift up and
away from the bottom and it unsnaps and
now we're going to take off the screen
just so we don't damage it while we're
removing the battery it's pretty simple
there's just four screws around the
outside of the little metal bracket
undoing each of those right now make
sure not to bend the screen past 90
degrees or will damage the cables any
parts that you need for this will be
down in the video description below
tools batteries if you need anything
else just ask me in the comments usually
spawn pretty quick so now I'm going to
take off these three ribbon cable
connectors this one's for the speaker on
the screen this next one is for the LCD
on the screen and then this last one is
for the digitizer on the screen which is
the part where you touch and it
recognizes where your finger is now the
screen is off you can just kind of see
the back of it here you have the
earpiece with your cameras and
everything and then you have
your fingerprint sensor on the home
button now to take out the battery there
are two screws holding on this metal
bracket that holds the battery connector
in place so I'm going to take off this
screw keep them separate from the other
screws you took apart earlier just
because they are different lengths and
I'm going to remove this bracket and set
it next to the screws so I know which
one goes in which hole I'm going to take
my pry tool and lift up on the little
latch you can see the three pin
connector right there and now I flip the
phone around and I'm going to start
prying down from the top of the battery
just kind of using the frame as leverage
and pushing my pry tool underneath the
battery so I'm not doing a whole lot of
pulling up on the frame or the back I'm
more just sliding the tool underneath
and that unsticks it from the two
strands of sticky tape that you'll see
here in a second then just kind of
wiggle the battery loose and the battery
is now free from the iPhone 5s the
iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c battery is
interchangeable I will list the iPhone
5s battery below though because it is
the bigger battery it lasts longer
anyway press it down into place inside
the phone make sure it's completely flat
and put the three pin connector back
into place and the metal bracket back on
top screwing it back in if you have any
questions you can either leave in the
comments or you can always hit me up on
Twitter or Facebook I'll put links at
the end of the video for that
now we're going to reattach the screen
starting with the digitizer cable just
kind of clip that into place it's just
kind of like Legos he'll just have to
position it with your finger and you'll
hear a snap as it goes in be gentle
though we want to break the least amount
of stuff possible when we open these
phones up hopefully nothing you can see
me struggle a little bit with this last
one it takes a second to figure out
where the connection actually is and I'm
going to put the bracket back into place
grabbing each of the screws that I laid
out before remembering where they went I
usually lay the screws out around the
bracket next with the hole they go in
once again any parts for this can be
found in the video description below
Amazon is usually the cheapest place to
get batteries and stuff so I'll put a
link there now the fun part the little
ribbon cable for the some print reader a
fingerprint reader is pretty hard to get
back into place you have to line it up
kind of with your finger first and then
take your plastic pry tool and just kind
of gently press it into place it takes a
while you're going to love you're going
to love it so now that that's clicked in
you have your little bracket and you set
that into place just sitting kind of on
top of it make sure it's orient in the
right direction and then you can press
it or clip it back down into place with
your finger takes a second to get it all
lined up and that's what it looks like
when it's all pressed down into place so
it will clip in on both sides and hold
that ribbon cable in very securely then
line the top of the screen up with the
frame and kind of clip it up along the
sides being careful not to press too
hard in the center of the screen we want
to crack it and it will clip back into
place you can see that it's completely
flush with the phone again and then at
this point I like to turn it on just to
make sure everything is working so I
want to jump back in just in case I you
know forgot to connect any cables or
anything like that
if you have any questions make sure to
leave them in the comments section below
and then I also don't forget to get
those bottom two screws in I put a
videos you know pretty regularly I get
my hands on pretty new technology pretty
quick so if you have any you know
