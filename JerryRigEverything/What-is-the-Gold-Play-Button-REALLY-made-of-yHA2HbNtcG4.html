for passing 100,000 subscribers my first
thought was is this real silver is the
gold play button real gold
if only I knew someone who was willing
to destroy their play buttons I can help
you with that so Dan is from the YouTube
channel what's inside and Dan what in
the world drove you to destroy your
buttons it was a tough decision but so
we do we cut stuff open for our channel
so when we got the silver play button we
thought that would be a really funny
thing if we cut it in half and then hung
it back up and it actually signifies our
channel pretty well but then after we
did that and we marched on to a million
subscribers I was a little nervous to do
it but we took it on a trip around the
world so it was a fun trip and we cut it
open in case you nice that's office so
it was worth it but it honestly was a
little sad cutting in half where did you
take this again so we took this thing to
China Japan Guam Australia Dubai the
Netherlands Ireland England Paris New
York Austin Texas it just put this
button like 11 pounds in my backpack the
entire time well I know one place at
this button has not been and that's
inside of this electron microscope what
do you say we toss it in here and see
what it's actually made of it's funny
because if I think think I have you
think that I would be okay with it but
just as long as it doesn't like turn it
purple or like I'm gonna I can't promise
anything but let's do it so here's the
back of the play button this is the gold
one and it looks like there's just a
series of Phillips head screws all along
the back and the back is made of wood
and then we got a wood panel right here
and then a metal plate on the outside
that's it yeah now you've got these four
screws right there but you want to take
oh there's even more sorry there's more
screws you got a screed about okay lift
it up and then the top that hold onto
the back so it doesn't fall out but
because right now you just got the glass
on this side but basically just have to
take this panel off there you go now you
got it hold the frame that's it Will's
our gold button right there
it's super dirty I don't even think I
washed it before I put it back in with
all the fingerprints on it there it is
this thing is so heavy jeez I've dirty
looks like you cut it right along that
screw line there all right so here this
is the electron microscope part of this
microscope you can see the electron
beams comes out of that little silver
thing right there and then what tells us
the makeup of the actual item inside
it's this part right here and this is
the energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry
gizmo and that tells us what the play
button is actually made up of well let's
put it in here and we are good to go
all right down your play button is now
inside of the machine how you feel so
don't turn your back this is legit here
a little purpose inside of this machine
there's a vacuum and it's sucking all of
the air out because an electron
microscope can't work in normal air
there needs to be zero air for it to
function and this is a live feed of
different cameras inside of the machine
so this is top down you can see some
kind of that arrow of the play button
there this is a side profile and this is
a zoomed in shot of the play button
itself and then on this screen we have a
readout of what actually the play button
is made up of so we have this nickel
right here and we also have a little bit
of gold there's a huge chunk of nickel
and then we have the gold right below
that at 15% and then we have the zinc in
the copper and zinc in the copper is
kind of making up like a brass alloy but
on the surface most of it is
nickel and the gold you can see here
that it's evenly dispersed across the
button all of the nickel and the gold or
mixed together or don't test in the top
part of it we just barely pulled out a
machine and rum a little bit surprised
that it's not I didn't see as much gold
as I thought there would be because
right here show them on the bottom there
it says 24 karat gold plated if you can
see it just right there and 24 karat
gold is known as pure gold 100% gold or
99.9% gold so so let's flip it over
we'll stick the back in there and we'll
see if it's plated on the back the backs
not as shiny you can see on there it's
just I was just not as shiny check this
check the front out it's shiny it's
glossy the back is just has these
scratches on it and it's flat so might
be honest oh and then look at this you
can see the shine comes around the edge
right here but then it's not on this
part so yeah let's find out right now
inside the machine we have the back of
the gold play button here and this is
the zoomed in portion of that button and
if we go over here to the graph of the
composition we still see the nickel and
then here we have the gold and there's
actually a larger percentage of gold on
the back of the button than we saw on
the front of the button which is very
interesting the machine we're getting
like a lot of different readings inside
of it we're getting nickel we're getting
gold or getting copper we're getting one
other thing and we're trying to like
decide whether it's just on the exterior
or the interior the only problem with
that is is that the button is too big
for the machine so there's no way to get
a reading of this cross-section inside
of that thing so I'm going to try to
shave a little bit off and see if we can
get enough of a sample to make it work
so I just took a small fragment from
that little screw hole there we're
putting it on this tape right here so
we'll go on the machine that particular
fragment is from the center of the gold
play button right here so we'll be able
to see what's inside of the button
instead of just on the surface there's
that itty-bitty sample inside of the big
machine and we are ready to go here's
the side profile of it and we got the
beam coming down from the top samples
here this is the super zoomed in
electron microscope image of it so you
can see all the
Tail if we come over here to this
monitor it's got the center so the
inside of the gold play button is copper
and zinc and there's actually no gold on
the inside so we know that's all part of
the coating the two most common elements
on the surface of the play button nickel
and gold are not inside of the button so
now we're going to check and see what
the silver button is made of inside of
the Machine it goes so with the silver
play button inside the Machine you can
see right here is the top-down view and
we have the side cross section and this
is the magnified image of the play
button and over here we have this
reading which is actually 100% nickel on
the surface of that play button so it
might be something a little bit
different underneath the surface but the
surface is 100% nickel so as I'm going
to move it on a scratch on the silver
play button and if we look over here it
actually has some copper inside of it as
well so if we jump down here the copper
is 6.3%
and the nickel is 93 so nickel is
definitely 100% the surface of the
silver play button but it looks like
it's an alloy underneath with a little
bit of copper added to it so I was
little bit surprised that there wasn't
as much gold as I thought there was
going to be I mean to YouTube's credit
it 24-karat does rub off easily and I
traveled to probably six different
continents with it so it could some of
it could have rubbed off that's true
because in like your pocket in your
backpack and everything like that and
also on the front of the button where
it's all smooth and glossy there was 15%
gold and like 85% nickel but on the back
of the button where there was those
ridges it was actually more gold and I
think that's because you know wouldn't
rub off as easily probably I mean we did
do the part which I like that we did it
we took off that small speck they didn't
shouldn't have been 24 karat gold plated
and - you got to give YouTube credit
because they could easily send these
things out because the metal that they
send looks like gold already but they
actually plated these gold play buttons
because we saw in the front the back and
we didn't see it in the middle so it's
on there it's real gold there the gold
play button is gold which is cool one
other variable that we haven't
about yet as well is that the electron
microscope when it looks at the surface
of something it's actually penetrating
the surface just a little bit so that
also might be while there's some
variance between the gold and the nickel
on the gold play button so I think would
be really interesting to see actually
how these things are made and what the
process is for getting the gold on them
yeah can you imagine like going into a
building where they make these things
and you just have like a pile of like
hundreds of gold buttons everywhere it'd
be so cool that'd be pretty fun to see I
would just grab one before I had a
million subscribers I would just try to
find the diamond play buttons and take
that home so I can cut it open that will
get it early and if you take a look back
here we have both the gold play button
and the silver play button Zak just
stuffed the silver play button in here
he has no respect for it Oh Matt take a
look at it he put it in backwards you
see that it's a rewind button now that's
what happens and speaking of the silver
play button it's not actually silver and
there was no silver inside of it which
you know was fine it's not plated silver
or anything the exterior was pure nickel
and the inside was a nickel copper blend
we got this in May of 2016 before we
took our trip around the world with it
and what I've seen is that the buttons
that are coming out now are a little bit
different so they've changed the gold
play button a little so Zak's gonna get
it soon you guys are helping him he is
on the way gained like 300,000
subscribers in the last couple of months
Wow it's gonna it's gonna come soon
enough and as soon as you get yours I
want to test that one out see if it's
the same 24 karat plated gold
YouTube probably watching this right now
and they're like oh when we send Zak his
let's put a little bit more gold on that
I'm fine with that
give me as much gold as you want if you
want to see how well traveled this gold
play button is and where some of the
gold might have rubbed off go ahead and
click this video right here and it will
take you to Dan's channel where he
actually cut it open with Casey Neistat
it was once in a lifetime experience
pretty cool video so I'm excited zhuzi
it yours let us know if you want us to
cut it open I think I'm gonna keep mine
in the frame and I'm gonna keep it
facing the right direction if you change
your mind
just see okay thanks stuff for watching
I'll see you around
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
