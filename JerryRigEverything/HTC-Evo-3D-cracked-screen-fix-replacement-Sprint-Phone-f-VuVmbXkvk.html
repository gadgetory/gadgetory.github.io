how to take apart the Evo 3d and replace
the screen on it this screen does have a
crack so basically you know take off the
back take out the battery make sure the
phone obviously will be off I'll put all
the tools and stuff and also the
replacement parts you need for this
project in the video description below
so make sure to check that out there are
six screws around the outside there are
four of them in the corners that are
kind of like the star-shaped screws and
those come with a screwdriver kit that
I'll put in the video description and
then the two that I'm taking out right
now or just your normal Phillips head
and I'm placing the screws in a way on
the mat that'll let me you know put them
back into the phone fairly easily I'm
taking my little pry tool I'm you can
use a plastic or metal one and just kind
of go between the back frame and the
screen just kind of like wiggle it loose
and the back section will pop off just
like that there are two screws on the
motherboard
I'm just your regular Phillips head
they're small silver screws let's put
those over there and then there's four
ribbon cables around the outside and you
can see me taking my pry tool lifting up
the little white section it's like a
little latch that lifts up and once
you've lifted up all four you can take
your pry tool and just kind of you know
pull along the edge of the ribbon cable
there's a little lip right there that
you can press against and it'll pull the
actual cable out from the connector so
once you've gotten those four cables out
and we'll be able to move on to the next
step you also have two options here with
the vibrator you can either unplug it
which is what I'm doing or you can you
know wiggle the vibrate a little motor
out of the the back frame since my
replacement screen is coming with its
own little vibrator I am unplugging it
and it just phase through that little
hole right there
and then once you take the motherboard
bend it back over and lift up the little
heat tape on here there are two more
ribbon cables that you have to unlatch
and then slide out
and they pull out really easily and
there's the bottom circuit board that
also has one ribbon cable in it and so I
unlatch that I removed the tape that's
holding the ribbon cable to the latch
can see me take that off right here and
then once that tape is off then it
slides out like any normal ribbon cable
and then you have your two circuit
boards attached by the antenna wire
there and then the broken screen is out
and then this is the new screen and it's
the LCD digitizer combination I'm not
replacing just the glass and replacing
the whole screen pop the ribbon cable
back into place for the reassembly latch
it and you can put that tape back down
on and if you want the tape does stick
pretty well anyway there's this black
protective piece of plastic they have to
bend over in order to get the ribbon
cables into place this just helps us to
let the ribbon cables you don't get cut
on the board at all you know when you're
working on the phone or when it's in
your pocket then you can use the little
lips on the side of each of the ribbon
cable to press it all the way in and
then make sure to latch it back down
again and then make sure there's nothing
underneath the motherboard as you put it
set it back into place
feeding the vibrator wire through to
plug back in again
and then it's just reattach arriving
cables the same way that you've been
doing it before with that bottom part of
the circuit board press into place and
latch it once again I'll put the links
for all the tools and the screens in the
video description below just click down
there I do all my stuff through Amazon
it's the most reliable and usually the
cheapest
getting everything positioned gs riotous
is pretty difficult if you have a pair
of tweezers that would help out as well
taking the two screws to the motherboard
and putting those back into place
and then make sure the Santana wire on
the side there's a little groove for it
right above the the camera button and
then it just fits right down inside that
corner right there you'll hear the back
housing snap into place all the way
around and then don't forget to put the
screws in I'm just going to turn on the
phone just let you show show you that
all works anyway if you have any
questions make sure leave in the
comments don't forget to like if this
video helped you and don't forget to

expensive electronics on a on a weekly
