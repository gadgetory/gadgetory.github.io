Asus has been flying under the radar for a
while now, but the Zenfone 6 is doing something
so different I couldn't resist buying one
of my own to test out.
The Zenfone 6 has a motorized camera, but
not a pop up.
It's a flip up.
And today we're going to find out how durable
that flip up camera really is.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
Right off the bat this thing is absolutely
crazy.
The amount of engineering involved to make
this action happen is incredibly impressive.
Smartphones with motors are awesome.
The Zenfone 6 is rated for 100,000 flips,
which is 100 times a day every day for 3 whole
years.
It can also be motorized to any point along
that flip arch with the side volume buttons.
Impressive.
Trying to activate the camera with my finger
blocking the way yields some interesting noises.
The camera motor isn't very gutsy.
But manipulating it directly with my fingers
doesn't seem to affect it negatively.
There isn't any grinding of the gears or cracking
sounds.
Manually flipping out the camera is possible,
if you can get a grip on it.
But the phone does not like the camera to
be up top when the camera app is not open.
So I'll put it back down into the phone body.
It's naturally in there pretty tight, and
it'll never be flip flopping around on it's
own.
Asus even has the same auto accidental drop
retract feature that we saw in the OnePlus
7 Pro, where if the phone is dropped with
the camera in the open position, it'll retract
the camera...and actually retracts much faster
than normal into the closed position.
You can hear the motor squeal into over drive
to get the camera retracted faster.
Not too shabby.
If, you know, for whatever reason you wanted
to hold onto only the camera and then try
to flip the camera closed, the internal motor
does not have enough guts to move the phone.
The greater strain on the motor is sensed
as an obstacle, and it just says to make sure
nothing is obstructing the camera.
If I say “fake news,” does the obstruction
just go away?
I was having so much fun with the flippy camera,
I forgot we still have a whole durability
test to perform on the rest of the phone.
We'll get back to the camera again in just
a second.
The Zenfone 6 claims to be using Gorilla Glass
6 on it's 6 inch screen, which scratches at
a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7.
With the flippy camera design, there is no
water resistance, but protective cases are
still an option.
Asus included a clear plastic case in the
box with a large cut out opening in the top
for the camera.
Interesting, and nice of them to include.
I always have a case on my own phone because
protection is a good thing.
The ear piece of the Zenfone 6 is a little
guy covered in black plastic mesh.
The motorized camera has two lenses: one 48
megapixel main camera, and a 13 megapixel
wide angle camera.
Both of these cameras, of course, dual function
as the front and rear cameras since it can
flip back and forth between both sides.
A flippy camera accomplishes two things: the
first is always being able to use the good
camera instead of a lower quality front facing
sensor, and the second is to keep the display
notch free.
The sides of the phone are made from metal,
along with the light blue accented metal power
button.
The volume rockers are metal, and the little
Google Assistant button way up here at the
top...also metal.
The top of the phone where the motorized camera
is located actually sparks with my razor blade.
Super weird.
I can pry open the flippy camera.
It does struggle with me for a second since
the camera app isn't open...but eventually
gives up.
We can see that the large rectangle camera
housing is made from metal, along with the
camera cavity...both metal.
The left side of the phone is completely empty,
except for the SIM card tray, which impressively
has dual SIM slots and an SD card tray.
Can't go wrong with the expandable memory.
You also can't go wrong with a headphone jack.
This phone has all the features, which once
again just proves the point that if you want
features, all you have to do is spend less
money on your phone.
Since the Zenfone 6 is at the $500 mark at
launch, and the phones that tend to be losing
the headphone jack and SD card slot usually
cost around $1,000.
The fingerprint scanner can be scratched but
still senses my fingerprint and unlocks the
phone every single time.
Let's see how much weight this camera can
lift.
It's going to be a negative on the large instruction
booklet, but a positive on the metal pry tool.
And again, another negative on this random
screwdriver.
When we break out the flames, the 6.4 inch
IPS LCD lasted about 8 seconds under the heat
from my lighter before the pixels go black
and turn off, but then fully recover, turning
back on and looking like normal again after
the heat's removed.
Up to this point, we've put some pressure
on the camera motor and seen how much stress
it can handle, and so far it's done a great
job.
But the motor doesn't matter very much if
the hinge itself is weak.
When the phone is laying flat on it's back,
the camera motor doesn't have enough guts
to lift the phone up and hold the camera shut
underneath.
If I grab the camera unit, and do a little
hokey pokey and shake it all about, the phone
gets mad at me for obstructing again.
But the camera unit really does feel much
stronger than I thought it would.
Twisting the camera block side to side, forward
and back, leaves the camera still intact and
not coming off on it's own.
There's definitely a very strong hinge of
some sort inside the phone.
We'll have to get a close up look at the inside
during the teardown.
I'm impressed.
This thing is solid and still moving like
a flipping champion.
The phone itself is pretty thick, with a 5,000
milliamp hour battery inside.
There is zero flex to the phone during the
bend test when bent from any direction.
No damage is done to the frame or the screen
externally or internally.
The Asus Zenfone 6 passes my durability test,
with all the features, power, and motorized
conversation starting gimmicks a tech nerd
could ask for, the Zenfone 6 gets a thumbs
up from me.
It's an interesting phone and I like where
things are headed.
Would you buy a phone with a motorized camera?
Let me know down in the comments.
Like I've said before, motorized cameras probably
aren't the long term permanent solution to
notch-less displays, but I'm sure going to
enjoy the hardware while it's here.
Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already
so you don't miss the teardown, seeing the
motor contraption from the inside.
And thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
