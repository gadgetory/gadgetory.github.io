Reno- the one with the little triangular motorized
pop up camera in the top.
And we're going to see how it really works
from the inside.

Let's get started with the teardown.
[Intro]
A smartphone with moving parts, like this
Oppo Reno, can be slightly more intimidating
to take apart, but we're going to dive in
anyway.
There is no water resistance rating so the
back panel just needs to be warmed up until
it's almost too hot to touch.
Then I can lift the glass sheet off with my
suction cup while slicing through the thin
strip of adhesive surrounding the outside.
The green colored back panel can lift off...
[Zack's conscience] It's blue!
[Zack]...with no ribbons holding it to the
body.
Remember that little ceramic O-Dot that Oppo
added to keep the camera lenses from rubbing
up against stuff?
Well it's actually just a super tiny little
guy, recessed with a bit of adhesive into
the back panel.
Pretty unique.
Taking a look inside the phone, we have eleven
normal Phillips head screws holding down the
top plastic portion to the body.
Once those are out I can lift up the random
black battery flap and remove the top plastics
and NFC coil.
As far as a clear phone goes, this Oppo Reno
might actually be super cool.
We can already see the motor contraption over
here on the left and the gold ribbon extensions
add a nice accent to the circuitry.
I'll unplug the battery like a little Lego,
and then unsnap each of the three gold extension
ribbons from the bottom of the motherboard.
The long ribbons are still in the way of the
battery, so I'll remove the 11 Phillips head
screws holding down the bottom loudspeaker
plastics.
Then I'll pop off the speaker.
It has the normal two rectangular gold contact
pads that allow it to communicate with the
phone.
I'll unplug the under screen fingerprint scanner,
and the charging port ribbon basically falls
out at this point.
The USB-C port is attached to the end of the
long gold ribbon and it's probably the easiest
charging port replacement of all time.
Nice work, Oppo.
It does have a red rubber ring around the
tip to help cushion the constant unplugging
and plugging in of the charging cable.
But keep in mind this phone is not water resistant.
The other two extension ribbons unclip easy
enough, then the bottom circuit board can
come out of the phone with our little buddy,
the headphone jack.
Remember, only the less expensive of the two
Reno phones comes with a headphone jack.
The more expensive 10x optical zoom Reno does
not have a headphone jack, so you got to pick
and choose which features you want these days.
Luckily, there are plenty of phones out there
to choose from.
I'll pop the optical fingerprint scanner out
from under the screen.
You can see the light shining through the
screen from the flash on my Galaxy S8.
Optical fingerprint scanners are pretty cool.
Want to know what else is cool though?
Battery pulls tabs.
Thumbs up for that.
The Oppo Reno is using a 3765 milliamp hour
battery.
Let's get a closer look at the mechanical
pop up camera operation up here.
We've run into all kinds of pop up cameras
this year.
The standard little rectangle that pops up,
then there's the flip up camera, and we've
seen whole phones shift up.
Now we have this weird triangular version.
I'll have to remove the regular rear cameras
first.
It's a 48 megapixel standard camera with a
5 megapixel depth sensing companion...neither
of which have optical image stabilization.
I'll remove the two long wire cables from
the right side of the board, and then unplug
the triangular pizza looking front camera.
Then I can remove the dual SIM card tray.
The motherboard can lift out of the frame.
It has some normal thermal paste on the back
which helps transfer heat to the metal frame
of the phone.
Now for the fun stuff.
The small internal motor of the Oppo Reno
has 3 tiny black Phillips head screws holding
it to the body.
I'll gently lift off the 4 square contact
pads that power the motor, then check this
out.
The way this whole thing works is pretty similar
to all the other motorized smartphone cameras
we've come across.
The miniature stepper motor business is booming
right now.
The motor on the left turns this threaded
shaft, and as the threaded shaft spins, the
stationary metal chunk gets screwed up and
down the shaft, raising and lowering this
piston looking rod, which is attached to the
base of the triangular pizza camera, with
one little screw.
Each time the front camera or rear flash is
engaged, the whole contraption motors on up
to do it's job, then motors itself back down
again.
It can also sense pressure applied to the
top of the pizza.
If the spring on the rod feels any pressure
from the top, it can trigger the return of
the motor so nothing gets damaged by excessive
force.
I'll remove the little screw holding the protruder
rod to the bottom of the camera unit.
Then the whole metal camera contraption can
pull right out of the phone.
Notice this metal lip that secures the camera
on the right side.
Incredibly simple, yet efficient design.
The built in solid metal lip acts as a super
secure fulcrum when the camera is rotating
in and out of the phone.
The camera motor can pull out of the plastic
guiding shaft.
And here's another close up look of it in
action.
It's interesting that the hole for the rod
that goes up to the camera has it's own little
red rubber ring.
It might help keep dust out, and it might
help keep the metal rod from grinding on the
sides of the phone.
Remember, Oppo said that this motor's good
for 200,000 camera raises, which is a pretty
insane number.
If you only use your flash or a front camera
once a day, it would last for over 500 years...after
which, of course, it might be time to get
a new phone.
Let's see what's inside this camera unit.
The rear plastic layer is held on by a thin
strip of adhesive.
I'll fold that up, revealing the dual LED
flash and two screws.
I'll remove those and pull out the 16 megapixel
selfie camera from inside the housing.
And look at that.
The earpiece of the phone is inside the camera
unit.
Did not see that one coming.
The hole up at the top is indeed a microphone
hole.
You'll be surprised at how many messages I
get from people who stick their SIM card removal
tool in the wrong hole and are wondering if
they damaged anything.
The answer is usually always no.
The microphones are positioned off to the
side of the microphone holes where the SIM
removal tools can't harm them.
Still super interesting that the earpiece
is included inside the pizza camera module.
I guess it makes sense though, considering
how large the pizza slice is and how much
space it takes up inside the phone.
The design of the Oppo Reno is much more efficient
than I expected, and it's not at all hard
to take apart.
In comparison, iPhones are way more complex
and difficult to repair and they don't even
have moving parts.
I'll try putting this thing back together
in one piece.
I do like to keep these things alive.
If they survive the durability test, I feel
like they kind of deserve it.
I'll get the motor back into place inside
it's plastic guiding shaft and screw it into
the phone.
Then I can add the motherboard, rear facing
cameras, and make sure the Lego-style connectors
are all clipped in tight.
I can grab the bottom circuit-board and put
that in place, clipping in the under screen
fingerprint scanner and the long charging
port ribbon.
Once the battery's back in it's slot, I can
add the last few extension ribbons and start
screwing in those 22 Phillips head screws
that hold everything together.
Overall I'm impressed with Oppo this time
around.
This Reno phone is built much stronger than
the previous Oppo Find X.
And amazingly, even after being durability
tested, and taken entirely apart and reassembled,
the whole thing still works.
You know it's a good phone when it can survive
both of my reviews: the durability test and
the teardown.
I'm a fan of motorized cameras.
Besides last year's Find X, they've all been
built super solid.

phones you want to see reviewed from the inside.
