are kind of just the same well you're
not wrong it is nice though when
something new comes to market doing
something unique and that's this guy
the flagship gaming phone from Razer
it's a normal rectangular smartphone of
course but with a few extra perks let's
get started
right out of the box one of the coolest
parts of this phone is the light-up LED
razer logo on the back glass made up of
three snakes razer started out years ago
making gaming computer Mouse's and of
course snakes eat mice so the Razer logo
is made up of cool snakes that eat the
boring computer mice that aren't razer
branded the logo is a bit more dim than
I anticipated but it does change to
whatever color you want which is pretty
cool it'll be interesting to see what
the LEDs look like from underneath the
glass inside the box there's a nice
braided cable and a USBC dongle for that
missing headphone jack let's jump into
the scratch test Razer has a few major
perks over other smartphones one being
this 5.7 inch 120 Hertz display 120
Hertz means that the screen refreshes
superfast making it abnormally smooth
the video you're watching right now on
your screen is filmed in 60 frames per
second so it's impossible for you to get
the full experience of the razor -
without actually seeing it in real life
with your own eyes the screen is covered
with the industry standard Gorilla Glass
5 meaning it scratches at level 6 with
deeper grooves at level 7 the razor
phone does have unique looking build
with large front-facing speakers on
either end of the phone tucked up inside
the top speaker we have our front 8
megapixel camera protected by glass and
the sensor array in a little black
circle next to it also protected with
glass the large speaker surface area
makes sense because it's a gaming phone
it'll be held horizontally a lot and the
massive plastic covered speakers give
the user something to hold on to that
doesn't block the screen both the top
and the bottom grills are made from
plastic these sides of the phone are
made from metal standard black anodized
aluminum you can see the silver metal
shining through it's even metal over the
expandable SD card slot the razor phone
- has some unique looking volume buttons
though little circular dollops made from
metal
you would think that a beastly powerful
gaming phone might have some more
aggressive looking buttons but if you
remember Razer bought out the old next
bit robbing startup and took a lot of
the same design cues from the cutesy
plastic phone named after a tiny bird
Razer didn't bring over the headphone
jack though which is kind of weird I
feel like the gamers of all people would
like to use headphones while charging
their phone at the same time which you
can't do with the razer phone bluetooth
sometimes lags wear corded headphones
would not the top and sides are all made
for metal with the power button doubling
as a fingerprint scanner it's very flush
with the side surface of the phone but
hypothetically it's good to know if it
would still function or not with
scratches or damage
luckily for Razer even with some
substantial slices the fingerprint
scanner functions perfectly every time
and has no problem recognizing my thumb
thumbs up for that the bottom of the
phone contains our single USBC port and
some more middle aesthetically I think
the light-up logo design on the back of
the razer phone 2 is pretty awesome
it does seem dim on my very well lit
desk but I imagine it's more stunning in
a darker room or while making phone
calls or getting notifications at night
the whole logo is underneath the glass
so it'll never get scratched off plus
with that back glass panel now the razor
phone 2 does have wireless charging
Razer is also doing it right with the
dual rear cameras one normal 12
megapixel lens with oh is and a
secondary telephoto sensor with 2 times
optical zoom I'm a fan of those extra
capabilities the dual tone flash is
covered with plastic as of this video
Razer is making this phone in two colors
black and black so if you're looking for
any diversity in your life or just want
to get rid of all those fingerprints you
can always customize your phone with
debrand with a ton of vibrant colors
including the delicious bulletproof
banana you have the option of leaving
the logo showing which I prefer or deep
branding your phone entirely either way
I'll leave a link for you in the video
description so you can customize your
own phone and huge thanks to deep brand
for sponsoring this video and now the
test you've all been waiting for
the burn test it's important to know if
your new gaming phone can survive a cozy
campfire during a fortnight gaming sesh
with the extreme heat from my lighter
the razor phone too
lasted about 19 seconds the 1440p LCD
display started going black and turned
off but once the heat was removed that
pixels recovered respawning back to full
health I'll peel off the D brand skin to
keep the bin test fair it's time to find
out if this 800 dollar razor phone 2 is
durable or if it snaps in half like it's
Bluebird predecessor with a substantial
bend to the front there is hardly any
flex to razors flagship it's
surprisingly even more rigid than last
year's first razor phone with zero kinks
in the metal even when bent from the
back
this massive phone is surprisingly solid
the razor phone 2 passes my durability
test with its large screen it's probably
one of the most well built structurally
solid phones I've tested so far this
year I'm a fan let me know if you want
to see me take it apart to review those
LEDs and vapor cooling chamber from the
inside and feel free to customize your
own phone with the D brand link in the
video description hit that subscribe
button if you haven't already and come
hang out with me on Twitter thanks ton
for watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
