apart the Galaxy gear from samsara this
is a watch that connects to the Android
phone first thing we're going to do is
we're going to turn it off make sure
that there's no power going to this
screen before we take it apart and we're
going to have a pentalobe screwdriver
and there's four screws along the bottom
that I'm going to unscrew while I'm
taking those out I also did a teardown
on the Moto active which is Motorola's
watch that can connect to smartphones it
also has a GPS and stuff in it so if you
want to see the teardown of that go
ahead and click the little box in the
corner and that will take you in a new
window to that teardown pretty fun both
watches are pretty interesting on the
insides now that I've gotten all four of
these screws out of the watch I'm going
to go ahead and take my pry tool and
kind of go along the edge of the metal
screen and the plastic body and separate
the two there is a little rubber seal
between the frame and the watch band
itself so you kind of got to pry it
loose just a little bit helps keep it
you know water resistant sweat resistant
once you get a kind of way you'll see
the ribbon cable that connects the
charger to the LCD and other components
on the screen I'm going to take off the
sticker right here give us better access
so you can see right here this is the
little vibrator for the notifications
and that this part right here is where
the doc charges the actual watch itself
so I just lifted up the little ribbon
cable connector to unclip it from the
dock itself and there's two Phillips
head screws on either side I found it
interesting that the dock connector
charges through the the port on the
bottom and it goes to the motherboard
first and then the motherboard has two
leads on it that go down to charge the
battery it seems like a kind of a
complex way to charge the watch itself
but you know that's the way Samsung
wants to do it so right here I'm lifting
out the the dock connector ports and now
the motherboard and LCD are free from
the actual phone itself it's also
interesting that these screws on the
front or a purely for decoration you can
see that they go absolutely nowhere
and then right here I am loosening
there's a little bracket that holds the
battery into place so I just unclip that
and then the battery is actually stuck
down inside the phone as well there's a
double-sided sticky tape on the bottom
that holds it in so you lift up on the
little pool tab be very careful though
because there's still two leads right
here this is what I was talking about
before that connect to the motherboard
to get the power to the battery itself
now that's up and off you can see inside
the frame this is the little rubber seal
that helps keep the water and moisture
out and go ahead and place the battery
back in starting with the feeds the
little connectors there's a little
circular thing on top that helps line up
the connectors and how's it sit right
there in the groove where it's supposed
to be press both of those things back
down into place and then I'm going to
put the motherboard back in as well get
it all lined up and you see right here
on the top and the bottom there's two
sound channels where the microphones are
is you can have a conversation
completely from the watch there's a
speaker and a microphone once
it's a bluetooth to your phone you can
have an entire conversation just from
your watch anyway get the two Phillips
head screws back into the top clip down
that little ribbon cable connector it's
kind of like a Lego deal here a snap
into place you can do that before or
after you screw it in I think before
might be a little bit easier to make
sure it's all lined up
get the middle bracket pinned down just
like it was before and then you can
gently close the screen making sure not
to kink that ribbon cable between the
body of the watch and the LCD in any
weird ways and then just press it down
into place and it should fit flush
completely all the way around the
outside you can see that there's no gaps
or anything and then I'm going to take
all four of these screws and get them
place back in and screw them back in
tight with that same pentalobe
screwdriver that I was using before I'll
link all the tools and stuff that I use
for this project down in the video
description below it's kind of nice to
have a little small screwdriver set
lying around and then any replacement
parts as well I will list in the video
description below
Amazon is usually where I get all my
stuff etrade supply is also another good
spot for parts and that is it the Galaxy
gear is up and running overall pretty
solid build I like the the heaviness the
feel of the watch it's pretty nice if
