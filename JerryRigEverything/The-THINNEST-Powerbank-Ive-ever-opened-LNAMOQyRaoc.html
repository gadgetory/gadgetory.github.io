run all of our portable electronics I've
taken apart a couple power banks
recently and they've all had these large
sand drill achill lithium ion batteries
inside today we have a newcomer a new
contestant the crave plus that is a much
thinner and sleeker profile today we're
going to take this thing apart and see
what makes it different from the larger
syndra local batteries
thanks to crÃªpe for sending this out now
let's see what this thing is made of
like you saw lithium batteries come in
two basic shapes and sizes
from the non-removable square batteries
we see inside of cell phones to this
umbilical batteries we see insides of
charging banks electric cars or even
that massive horn style battery system
powering 30,000 homes in South Australia
batteries are everywhere and lithium
batteries are impressive lithium the
element inside most of these batteries
is found in ignorant water you know the
ones from volcanoes but the largest
producers of lithium in the world is
chili which extracts it from huge pastel
covered brine pools
I'm guessing this aluminum covered crave
plus power bank has a lithium polymer
battery inside which is the same thing
that we see inside of the most cell
phones but fits a 10,000 milliamp hour
battery life in the footprint about the
same size as the iPhone 8 plus so as
most electronics are moving over to USB
see from the micro USB this Cray plus
power charger has two ways of charging
it has a micro USB in along with a USB C
in which doubles as a USB see out to
charger USB see electronics and a
regular USB port for your iPhones and
stuff it does have quick charging for
those phones that have that enabled and
it can be charging the power bank and a
cell phone at the same time let's see
what happens when we bump it up to two
cell phones at the same time we use my
Galaxy s8 and it looks like we are
charging the power bank and charging two
separate devices at the same time that's
pretty sweet some power banks don't do
that lithium-ion batteries have a
relatively high energy density but are
very safe unless punctured
there are no visible
around the aluminum enclosure but
popping off the end caps revealed the
circuit board two screws that I can undo
to remove this silver cap and then I can
slide the whole contraption out the
backside of the aluminum housing these
things aren't meant to be taken apart
it's very tightly glued together and
will never fall apart on its own as we
can see this sleek looking power bank is
using a dual pouch style battery two
batteries stacked on top of each other
which is a pretty efficient use of space
and that's what crave is after making
their power bank about the same size as
an iPhone 8 plus but with three times
the capacity so internally both of these
batteries are built about the same way
if you've ever seen the what's inside a
Tesla battery made by the what's inside
YouTube channel when they hack open one
of these syndra local cells you can see
the anode and cathode layers wrapped
around each other the same build style
as inside of these pouch batteries if
you remember from my note 7 video when I
tore open one of those batteries to see
what it was made of it had the different
anode cathode layers as well the reason
Tesla uses these syndra local batteries
inside of their cars is because they're
way easy to manufacture and mass-produce
and Tesla utilizes the wasted space
around these syndra local batteries by
putting in a cooling system which allows
them to push the batteries beyond their
normal limits for sleek portable
high-capacity travel-size power banks
though I think this pouch style is most
ideal thanks to Craig for sending me out
this Powerbank
to review from the inside and take apart
I'll toss a link down in the video
description if you want to check out the
current pricing or if you want to get
one for yourself if you have any
questions about power banks or batteries
in general leave them down in the
comments and thanks a ton for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
