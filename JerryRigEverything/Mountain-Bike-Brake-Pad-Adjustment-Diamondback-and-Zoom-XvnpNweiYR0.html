and making a break starting good about
two miles up the trail the brakes every
time I press the back brake it
completely does nothing so I'm going to
take off the back caliper right here and
see what's on the inside it was adjusted
fine when I started and it was tight
everything worked great but now when I
pull on the back brake it pulls tight
but the brakes actually don't do
anything so I'm gonna check out the
brake pads and see what needs to happen
so this right here is the caliper and
I'm going to start off with the five
allen wrench and loosen up this bolt so
the cable will slip out and then each of
these two bolts right here are the same
size I'm just going to break those loose
same size allen wrench there we go
now the caliper is out so this part
right here
I'm screws into the back of the caliper
right there this is the back side of the
pad it looks like there's enough pad on
there what I think is what happened is
that the pad had worn down just enough
and I'll show you the padded one down
just enough so that it wasn't rubbing on
the pad anymore right there where the
Allen wrenches it was rubbing on the
sidewall of the caliper which would have
meant that it was you know the kathas
slick surface of the caliper instead of
the grippy surface of the brake pad to
rub against so I can tighten that a
little by little and kind of stick it
farther into the caliper again so I'll
show ya so now it's sticking farther in
obviously I don't want it in that far
I'll just kind of showing you how you
can adjust either side and then with the
other side as you pull that that's
what's actually pulled by the cable you
can see them touch right there and so I
can adjust the cable side of it much
easier than this other side so that's
what was wrong with this that's how you
adjust the calipers on your mountain
bike if you do need new brake pads for
your caliper you can finals on Amazon
and I'll link them for you so you can
replace the brake pads and these things
just take a look in the video
description below if you need those or
just you know new calipers all together
when you're repositioning the brake line
just take the bolt through the brake
line goes on this side of the bolt and
then you stick the nut on and then if
you spin this bolt a little bit with the
allen wrench then that will just go on
right by itself so the back of the
caliper can be adjusted from all it's
still mounted at the bike as well the
only reason you have to take it off is
just a double check to make sure the
pads you know are what you think they
are if they're worn down enough to where
you need to adjust that if you have any
questions make sure to leave in the
