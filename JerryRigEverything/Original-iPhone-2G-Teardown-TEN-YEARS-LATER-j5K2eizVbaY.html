the corner I think it's a good time to
look back and see where it all started
tearing down the original iPhone that
was released in 2007 over ten years ago
do you feel old yet in this video I'll
show how to replace the screen and the
battery and see how much different it is
on the inset from the more recent
iPhones it did survive my durability
test so let's see if it survives a
teardown
there are no visible screws on the
exterior of the original iPhone but
there is a black plastic segment that
with some persuasion can be removed
exposing three Phillips head screws
holding the back metal panel in place
and then you know the SIM card gets
removed as well at some point during
this process preferably before the
teardown starts but better late than
never taking apart your phone does void
the warranty but as we know warranties
don't last forever and sometimes you
just got to fix your own stuff and
that's what I'm here for the back metal
panel is actually really difficult to
remove there's no adhesive it's just
very firmly held in place my plastic
tool did some initial separating from
the metal frame of the screen but my
metal tool had to make an appearance and
do the actual heavy lifting successfully
unclasping the back metal panel and
exposing the high-tech insides of the
iPhone 2g there is one ribbon holding
the back panel to the phone this
controls the vibrator headphone jack and
side buttons it unsnaps just like a
little Lego from the motherboard one
super interesting thing is at the bottom
of the headphone jack is a water damage
indicator smart of Apple to stick it
next to one of the largest holes in the
phone if you peer into the headphone
jack you can see that it's still white
on the inside this means that my phone
has never been wet if it had gotten wet
the red coloring would bleed through the
sticker making the headphone jack pink
inside kind of tricky there are three
white signal wires with their circular
round head connectors just like what we
see in all modern phones all unsnap each
of these with my tweezers and then pull
them off to the side three Phillips head
screws hold the motherboard in place it
was nice of Apple not to use any
proprietary screws to hold this original
iPhone together I wish that continued
that trend their recent phones contain
proprietary screws which make it a
little bit harder to take apart on the
back of the motherboard there are
several connectors three them are the
Lego style ribbon cables that we see in
modern phones today and one is the
longer latch style connector which HTC
lifts use in all of their phones
the most unfortunate part of repairing
an original iPhone though is the battery
it is soldered onto the motherboard and
cannot be replaced without soldering
skills which puts a battery replacement
beyond the reach of the average person
I'm pretty sure Apple changed this with
the next version of their iPhone the
iPhone 3G but I'll have to take that one
apart to be sure this motherboard holds
a whopping 8 gigabytes of total internal
storage the oneplus 5 Android phone
released earlier this year has eight
gigs of RAM phones have come a long way
in the last 10 years well Android phones
anyway the iPhone 7 putters along with
just 2 gigabytes of RAM speaking of to
the camera on the original iPhone has
two whole megapixels of photo quality no
flash and no optical image stabilization
the first phone that implemented optical
image stabilization was actually a
Windows Phone the Lumia 920 in 2012
Android phones like the LG g2 followed
the year after in 2013 and then Apple
caught up in 2014
implementing OIS and just one of their
phones the iPhone 6 plus
now the screen of this phone isn't too
bad to remove it's pretty similar to the
iPhone 4 with 10 screws all around that
outside edge all of these screws are the
same size except for the bottom too but
it's still good practice to lay the
screws out in such a way that you
remember where they go when it's time to
put the iPhone back together once all 10
of these screws are out the front silver
metal frame lifts away from the screen
the actual screen removal is pretty
tricky during this part there is an
adhesive layer under the black top and
bottom sections of the glass so I'm
using a razor blade to slice through
that while trying not to crack the glass
at the same time if your glass is
already cracked you won't have to be as
careful as I am I'll link replacement
screens and other parts in the video
description like always
once that adhesive is cut there are a
series of clasps on both side of the
screen I need to be lifted up allowing
the display to separate from the rest of
the phone I find a razor blade to be
super effective with this part and then
the whole display pulls through the
frame since I'm going to attempt to put
my phone back together again I'm being
very careful with these little ribbons
they can tear like paper rendering the
display useless the loudspeaker is at
the bottom of the phone and now that we
have all the major components removed
it's time to see if it works when I put
it back together I'll tuck the screen
ribbons through the frame first
remembering that these kink and tear
easily once the screen is mostly in
place I'll position that home button
back where I found it a razor blade has
not cosmetically the best choice for
this procedure
the metal frame then sits in place held
together by the 10 screws that were laid
out in an organized fashion earlier and
now the origami nightmare that is the
ribbon cables plugging into the backside
of the motherboard
I found it easiest to fold the battery
over the top of the motherboard since
it's permanently connected and then plug
the three Lego Style ribbons in first
and then on taping the large charging
port ribbon from the back of the phone
allows it to extend up enough that I can
plug it into the latch connector first
lifting up the latch plugging in the
ribbon and then lock
the latch in place after it's in it's
actually not too bad the three screws
for the motherboard gets screwed in
these are different sizes and in the
three white signal rivets all get
connected to their circular slots the
side buttons vibrator and always
convenient headphone jack get plugged
into the motherboard with this Lego
style connector and then the back metal
plate clamps securely onto the body with
the three screws holding it down along
that bottom edge and finally the last
bit of black plastic slides up and into
place
hiding the screws and the rest of the
internal components surprisingly enough
the phone actually turns on thumbs up
for that I've taken apart every single
other iPhone on this channel
besides the 3G so if you're into seeing
technology from the inside you should
grab some popcorn and settle in the
iPhone eight will get the same
durability and teardown treatment as
soon as it's released so make sure
you're subscribed so you don't miss it
paints done for watching and I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
