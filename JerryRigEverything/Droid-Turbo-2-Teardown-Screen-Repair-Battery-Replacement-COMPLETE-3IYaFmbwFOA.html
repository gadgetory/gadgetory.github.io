Z and the Moto Z force I figured it was
time to dust off my old droid turbo -
and do the teardown it's been a while
since I did my durability test on it so
let's get started first thing turn off
the phone and then pop out the SIM card
tray from the top using your SIM card
ejector tool and sometimes there's a
little hole in the top of the Motorola
phones where you can push the backplate
out with little SIM card tool but not in
this one so we're going to use a little
bit of heat to heat up the back and
soften the adhesive it really does help
having a little bit of heat on there but
we're not trying to melt the back so
make sure not to get it too hot I'm
going to use a little bit of brute force
and a razor blade to start removing the
back panel it's not too difficult since
the adhesive has already warmed up a
little bit once I get my tool under
there I could just lift it up and peel
it away from the back
I'll take special care not to hurt the
wireless charging I'll hold it down with
my hands as I pulled it back away so it
doesn't get bent or torn at all I will
link all the replacement parts and tools
down in the video description of this
video I'm using 84 bit but with Chinese
tools the bits can vary a little bit
with each set some people say at t3
works better I'm going to unclip these
two cables underneath the rubber pads
one is for the wireless charging and the
other is for the vibrator motor and
headphone jack that you'll see in a
second there are 17 screws around that
backside remove all those and then the
front screen and motherboard will pop
away from that back panel here you can
see the wireless charging as well as the
ribbon cable for the headphone jack the
vibrator and the flash for the camera
the loudspeakers down here at the bottom
as well and has two little contact
points for the motherboard there's some
black tape over the battery I'm just
going to remove this and put it off to
the side try to keep it in one piece so
you can reuse it later but if it gets
torn it's not too big of a deal
the stuffs not meant to come off easy
there are two screws holding on this
metal bracket I think this is a
fantastic idea it kind of sandwiches the
motherboard between two pieces of metal
making the phone way more rigid than it
normally would be I'm going to clip the
battery then there's a piece of gold
tape over this ribbon cable connector
I'm going to unlatch the end of it and
that will unlock the ribbon so it can be
pulled away from the motherboard and
then this one's more like a Lego just
going to unsnap that from the mainboard
and pull it off to the side
there's a little extension microphone
ribbon down here at the bottom and
remove the battery using my metal pry
tool taking very special care not to
puncture or slice the battery as I pry
up on it it is very important that you
do not puncture the battery during this
process a little bit of heat would help
as well but the battery just pops out on
its own
now the screen ribbon cable is on the
upper side of the motherboard as well
there's this little tiny latch that I
lifted up and then I can slide this
little tiny circuit board off of the
mainboard with my plastic pry tool and
that releases the motherboard from the
frame of the screen there's one more
wire cable at the left side of the phone
as well that I'm going to unsnap and the
front-facing camera unsnaps like a
little Lego from the extension ribbon
cable the front-facing camera is 5
megapixels and sits right here attached
to this extension ribbon cable that also
houses the power button the volume
button and the little contact points the
rear 21 megapixel camera is also
removable it sits right here on the
motherboard with the same latch type
connector the SIM card tray is not
removable it is soldered onto the board
as well as the charging port and this
little extension microphone thing that
we got going on down here
who knows what that's for so this is the
screen the LCD panel sits inside the
plastic and metal frame and it is
impossible to remove without breaking it
so I'm not going to do it in this video
but the replacement screens only come
with the LCD and the plastic shatter
shield thing that Motorola's got going
on so you do have to remove it from the
plastic frame using heat and a pry tool
I'll link all the replacement screens
down the video description just remember
that if you do have to separate the LCD
from the frame it's going to sacrifice
your LCD in the process so only attempt
it if you have nothing left to lose
reassembling the phone putting the front
camera back into its little slot and
clipping it down onto that extension
ribbon and then setting the motherboard
down into place and clipping down that
wire cable making sure that this bottom
extension mic is stuck down into place
where it should be the screen ribbon
also gets plugged in the top portion at
least then making sure that gold tape is
set back down on top as well and that
just keeps it from unlatching in the
future if you ever drop your phone I'm
going to latch the rest of the screen
ribbon into place put the gold tape back
down on top of that as well now if you
just want to replace your shatter shield
screen just that top
plastic layer I do have a video for that
as well I will link that here it's a lot
cheaper than replacing the whole screen
itself batteries in place clip that down
under the motherboard and we'll put that
supporting metal bracket back into place
as well with the two screws on it same
size screws as all the rest of them but
they are different lengths so make sure
you keep your screws organized the back
plastic housing is going to be clamped
down onto the screen frame press that
into place all around the outside and
get those 17 screws back into place
along with the rubber caps for those two
ribbon cables back panel gets set down
into place as well and it actually went
on surprisingly well considering that I
just took it off the adhesive that was
left remaining on the back panel was
actually enough to keep it into place if
I hadn't done my durability test in this
phone you wouldn't be able to tell it's
been opened in the past turn it on make
sure everything's good if you have any
questions leave down the comments if you
enjoyed this video and want to see
others like it in the future hit that
subscribe button it does help me out a
lot as always Twitter and Instagram are
great for behind the scenes and other
projects I have going on thanks a ton
for watching I really do appreciate it
hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
