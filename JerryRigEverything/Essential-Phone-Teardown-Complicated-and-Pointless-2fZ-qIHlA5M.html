the essential phone but with the recent
price drop it's worth delving into and
taking a second look my essential phone
has been durability tested and dropped a
few times to test this ceramic back
panel and well the screen isn't alive
anymore it's time to take this essential
phone apart and analyze it from the
inside rumor has it that this is a very
difficult phone to repair and I found
that to be true kind of it's one of
those phones that's glued shut which
means that the screen is most likely
going to be sacrificed if you ever need
to open it up to access the battery or
charging pit but in my case where my
screen is already destroyed I don't have
too much to worry about it came up just
fine since I wasn't trying to save it
prying isn't too dangerous to the
internal components either though cuz
once the screen lifts up there's a large
metal plate protecting the insides from
damage kind of like we've seen on the
pixel phones heat is gonna be your best
friend
unlike the pixel phones though this
essential phone has zero replacement
parts for sale even now four months
after its release there are two Phillips
screws holding down the Lego style
connector for the LCD panel I would link
to the replacement parts in the video
description but they don't exist which
is unfortunate anyone who breaks their
phone or needs the battery of placement
in the future as Apple could tell you
batteries don't last forever
speaking of batteries the battery is
under this metal plate held down by six
screws there is a cute little heat pipe
on the bottom of the metal panel not
even close to the monstrosity we saw
inside the razor phone it's interesting
that the back of the camera unit also
gets to rest up against some copper I
wonder how hot that gets the 3040
milliamp hour battery has a metal
bracket over at the Lego style connector
and to magical pull tabs underneath
holding it in place
thumbs up for those now the rest of this
phone is pretty unorganized but I'll try
to make sense of it all there are a ton
of brackets holding down each of these
little connectors like this one over the
camera connectors and this one over the
front-facing camera and two screws hold
down this clear plastic bracket another
screw over here for the volume ribbon
bracket and there's a little bit of
black tape over the loudspeaker ribbon
this just tucks into a latch style
connector and of course the SIM card
tray is removed as well and the whole
motherboard can pull up and away from
the phone body it's a bit disappointing
to see the USB C charging port soldered
onto the mainboard
making it not replaceable but to be
honest now that the charging ports are
reversible there are less physically
damaged charging ports from people
accidentally plugging it in the wrong
direction so an attached charging port
is not as big of a deal as it used to be
still not ideal though the fingerprint
scanner is replaceable
but no wireless charging and you are to
be found the dual rear facing cameras
have two screws holding it in place I'll
remove those and we get a close-up look
at the 13 megapixel lenses no wide or
telephoto and no optical image
stabilization on this phone my 8
megapixel front-facing camera popped out
with the earpiece kind of an interesting
looking contraption it's still kind of
disheartening that no one will ever
actually use this video to fix their
phone since replacement parts don't
exist and the screen is most likely
going to get obliterated during any
removal process but at least we get to
see the inside of the essential phone
it's going to be a complex process to
get this thing back together I'll start
with the front-facing camera and the
dual rear cameras and the screws that
hold them both in place before I set the
motherboard all the way down let's take
a look at the loudspeaker and vibrator
here at the bottom of the phone where
the headphone jack isn't with one screw
holding down yet another bracket over
the vibrator motor which seems rather
redundant the loudspeaker can come up
from the frame it has some of that
water-resistant mesh covering a speaker
hole it is nice of essential to add a
little bit of protection even though the
phone itself is an IP water-resistant
rated now that we've got those back in
place we can get the motherboard
situated with the ribbon cables plugged
back in the loudspeaker ribbon and its
little latch cable and the front and
rear facing cameras get plugged in like
little
and of course all of their little
corresponding metal and plastic brackets
there are a total of nine extra little
metal bits and pieces inside of this
phone holding it together making it one
of the more complicated phones to repair
of this year the screws are different
sizes as well adding yet another level
of complexity
I wouldn't recommend repairing this
phone to anyone which is good because
with that replacement parts available
it's going to be impossible anyway the
next video you see on my channel will be
the 2017 smartphone durability and
repair ability Awards 2017 has been a
great year and I'm looking forward to
all the sweet technology we'll get to
see the insides of in 2018 the metal
plate is back on the phone but since the
screen is obliterated and there are no
replacements available it's not turning
on
hopefully essential organizes their guts
next year with the essential - it does
subscribe button if you haven't already
and thanks a ton for watching I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
