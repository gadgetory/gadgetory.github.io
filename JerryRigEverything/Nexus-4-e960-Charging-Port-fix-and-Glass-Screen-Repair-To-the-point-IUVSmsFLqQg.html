e 960 screen replacement this is a
t-mobile phone you can see that the
screen is cracked right there first step
we're going to take out the SIM card
just take a little paperclip pop it in a
little circle hole and out pops the SIM
card on the screen itself is
unresponsive so I can't turn the phone
off but it's not a huge problem there's
a pentalobe screw two of them down at
the very bottom we're going to unscrew
those pop out the screws and then try to
separate the back housing from the
screen right next to the silver part you
see me taking my pry tool and kind of
moving around and all the parts for this
project can be found on Amazon the
screens the charging port everything so
I'll list those in the video description
below this part is actually pretty
complicated the back housing is stuck
very securely with the screen so it
takes a second or two more like ten
minutes to separate them and you kind of
have to get aggressive there towards the
end I found that starting by the
charging port and prying up a little bit
and then using my fingers to hold it
apart while I move down the edge of the
phone works the best you can see it
wanting to separate right there
and it clicks off luckily there's no
wires or anything that connect the back
housing directly to the front so you'll
be just fine pulling it apart
there's 11 different screws around the
back make sure you keep them organized
most of them of the same size except for
the bottom two and the two on the
battery which I'm going to show you
right now be very very careful when
you're lifting this up the part that
connects it to the motherboard is not
very strong at all so make sure you lift
it directly up and don't pry left or
right very much where it will snap off
remove this wire cable by just lifting
up Jared very gently with your pry tool
and then remove the blue tape off the
battery and you'll be able to lift this
wire up and out of your way there are no
screws holding down the motherboard
which is nice just these little ribbon
cable connectors they pop up and off the
motherboard like Legos they're pretty
durable little guys so you can just you
know wiggle them straight up and out
this is for the screen one of them's for
the LCD and the other ones for the
digitizer just lift them up and out of
your way and then the audio port has its
own little ribbon cable right there as
well there's four of them total and the
motherboard just kind of Wiggles up and
out from the housing and just set this
off to the side
now we're going to take out the battery
the very is very securely glued to the
housing and so you just kind of take
your pry tool and just wiggle it under
the flat or the pry tool the better I
like this little red stick so I use it
quite a lot you know you can be a little
bit aggressive with it there's nothing
that you can really damage underneath
there all right to get to the charging
port is underneath this black piece the
charging port is just glued to the phone
itself so you just take the blue part
that was at the bottom there just kind
of wiggle it gently up and then you can
place the new charging port in its spot
it's pretty simple if there's nothing
else really holding it down in place now
we are heating up the front of the
screen so we can separate the phone from
the screen itself I took about 45
seconds to heat it up it's got to be a
little bit hotter like if you touch it
it's going to be too hot to leave your
finger there that's about the
temperature that you want it at I use a
little razor to separate the screen from
the housing you can use whatever tool
you want to just having a really thin
tool helped me separate it be very
careful when you're prying up on the
glass little shards will pop up I would
recommend wearing safety glasses also if
you can't find a tool better than a
razor blade you know more power to you
razor blades are not that safe once I
got the screen pried up a little bit I
was able to take my red pry tool and
kind of you know use it instead worked
out a lot better it's very gently a kind
of pulling away with if the screen is
broken you don't have to worry too much
about you know damaging it anymore the
only thing I would recommend is try to
get it off in one piece because the more
big pieces you can get off the better
and just remember I'm going to scream
that's I buy I get them from Amazon so I
will list those in the video description
below if you just want to check out that
link I'll have the right one all set up
for you
same with the charging port sometimes
you can even get camera replacement
lenses out of Amazon as well anyway so
you can see right here as I was lifting
it up I didn't quite grab the bottom
part of the phone the bottom part of the
glass was still stuck on there so I
tossed that and I got the heat gun back
out and heated up for another about 45
seconds till it was almost too hot to
touch and then I used my super dangerous
razor blade as well as my red plastic
pry tool to kind of separate the glass
from the rest of the phone and you want
to get every single little bit of glass
that you can because when you put the
new screen down on if there's even just
one tiny little speck of glass it makes
it so it is not able to sit flush with
the phone and it might even leave little
pressure marks on the LCD so make sure
you clean it off super well and even get
the excess glue out from around the
edges it's better to take your time so
you only have to do it once more time to
take apart your phone the more you're at
risk of damaging something anyway so now
we have the new screen so we're going to
feed the ribbon cables through the phone
this is for the digitizer and LCD again
and once they're fed through the phone
you got to make sure that everything is
through so that some of the ribbon
cables are not bunched up on the wrong
side of the screen you can see me
pulling off a little plastic protector
right there and making sure that all of
the cables are fed through once I'm sure
that the phone screen will fit flush
with the phone and the ribbon cables are
pulled through I will grab my superglue
and we can also use double-sided sticky
tape if you want I just find that super
glue works just as well and it keeps the
phone sitting with the lens sitting a
little more flush with the phone the
sticky tape kind of leaves a little bit
of space so you can see me putting glue
everywhere except for where the cameras
are and make sure that none of it will
bleed over onto the cameras because once
you've got it on a camera there's no
that I set one din flush with the phone
and I leave the charging port end up
just a little bit so I can still put
some glue around the edges as well as
get some glue down around the base
I'm luckily around the base there's a
lot of room for the superglue so I just
kind of piled it up down there in the
bottom and then I held it shut for
probably about a minute or two your to
kind of let the glue just dry a little
bit and hold it still and now that it's
dry there's a little plastic piece that
works with the upper Mike that kind of
cuts the sound in toward some other
boards make sure that plastic piece is
there that little grate them at the top
and now I'm putting the black speaker in
over the charging port that you just
replaced the charging port is the whole
blue motherboard underneath that black
speaker I'll list it in the video
description as you are putting the
motherboard on to the phone make sure
you have all the little ribbon connect
livened connectors pulled up and away so
they're not underneath the motherboard
remember there's four of them as well as
the one wire cable make sure the camera
is sitting flush inside that little
square then you can kind of see me
pushing down on the ribbon cables
getting them into place it's a lot like
a Lego piece they just kind of snap on
and kind of hear them click when you
press them in then you see the little
wire cable there I'm pressing that and
it will click as well you definitely
know when they are connected again now
here's the battery kit battery connector
remember be very gentle with it clip it
into place and then put the two screws
back in I turned on the phone really
quick just to make sure it was working
before I put the rest of it together now
put on the plastic motherboard protector
and then get all of those screws that
you have before all of the black ones
now that weren't for the batteries
should be the same size and then the two
silver screws go in the bottom right
above the charging port
now the back housings on putting two
screws back in for the bottom the
pentalobe screws
and everything works anyway thanks for
watching if you could subscribe that
does mean a lot to me I do like making
