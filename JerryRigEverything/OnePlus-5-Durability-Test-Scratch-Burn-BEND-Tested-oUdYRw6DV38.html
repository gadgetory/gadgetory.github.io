oneplus is the one plus five oneplus has
been competing with the major smartphone
manufacturers by delivering flagship
specs at a slightly lower price point
and so far they've been doing a pretty
good job I haven't had one of their
phones fail my test yet but since
one-plus claims this phone is their
thinnest phone yet maybe it'll be the
first to fail let's get started
this midnight black 1+5 feels solid
right out of the box it's a slab of
thick glass and cold metal that deserves
be put through my durability test just
like every other phone the most scratch
test is first since one plus is
advertising Gorilla Glass five on this
device we know that the scratch
resistance are going to be on par with
the Galaxy S eight and the iPhone 7
it'll scratch at level six with a deeper
groove Atomos seven the strongest screen
I've ever tested was the sapphire screen
of the HTC u ultra which scored level
eight either way keys coins and razors
will not scratch the oneplus screen
speaking of unscratched while the home
button is made from ceramic a material
harder than glass this means that the
fingerprint scanning touchpad won't be
damaged by anything normal unless of
course your phone is tumbling around in
a bag full of uncut diamonds which would
actually be a fantastic problem to have
until then physical fingerprint scanner
damage is not going to happen the front
16 megapixel camera with electronic
image stabilization is covered by the
Gorilla Glass 5 and while that sentence
probably makes no sense to the average
person people familiar with my videos
know that the camera lens is not going
to be getting scratched or damaged the
earpiece is made from metal no worrying
about it ever falling out or tearing so
far this phone is made from some pretty
solid materials on the back of the phone
we have one of my favorite new features
the dual cameras when I first used a
dual camera phone I thought it was going
to be a gimmick but after using it it's
definitely a feature that's here to stay
for a while the regular 16 megapixel
camera and the 20 megapixel zoom lens
are both covered by the same piece of
glass and are scratch resistant the
flash is plastic but that's normal and
nobody cares now it might have crossed
your mind that this phone looks a lot
like another popular phone on the market
right now and you're not wrong the
iPhone 7 plus and the oneplus 5 are
eerily similar the iPhone does look
slightly more premium with its aluminum
body curving right up to the lenses but
it also has about half the megapixels as
the one plus 5 my buddy sat over a
super-sad TV does some pretty sweet
side-by-side camera comparisons so it'll
be interesting to see what he says about
the cameras I'll link his video in the
video description
the oneplus 5 and the iPhone 7 plus do
have a pretty similar physical footprint
though now
back in the company oneplus first
started making phones in 2014 they
released the oneplus one whose name
might have been based off the exclusive
invite-only system that was required to
buy one of their phones the oneplus 2
was also invite only and finally with
the oneplus 3 they got rid of that
invite system you might have noticed
that I skipped the number for skipping
the oneplus 4 might be out of respect to
some Asian nations who are superstitious
are the number 4 the number 4 is
pronunciation it's very similar to the
word for death nokia has also been
skipping the number 4 with their phones
for the exact same reason and that's a
pretty valid reason nobody else in the
world wants to buy a phone named death
either you also might be thinking to
yourself that a razor blade is a bit
extreme for a scratch test and I agreed
I did try some more realistic objects
like my keys they initially left a mark
but the marks rubs completely off I also
tried a metal coin scratching the
anodized back metal and these marks as
well could be magically erased from the
back of the phone with my finger pretty
darn impressive the anodized aluminum
just like on the iPhones can handle your
basic coins and keys scratching it but
it can also still be damaged by sharp
rocks razors or that sack full of
diamonds we're talking about earlier it
is durable but not invincible the volume
button is made from metal along with the
new switch which is a feature that I
wish was on more cell phones I've come
to miss it on my own Galaxy s8 the dual
SIM card tray and power button are also
metal down here at the bottom of the
phone we have our USB C slot and even a
headphone jack if you don't mind the
lack of water resistance this device has
pretty much every useful tool a person
could want in a cell phone it looks like
the phone is made out of premium feeling
metal everywhere and that makes me happy
time for the burn test the one plus five
is rocking a 5.5 inch AMOLED screen and
lasted a surprisingly long time under
the heat from my lighter it was burning
for about 40 seconds before I noticed a
faint white mark forming on the pixels
the pixels never did recover so like if
you ever drop your phone in a fire try
to rescue it as soon as possible or you
know just don't drop your phone in a
fire and finally we have the ultimate
to build quality the bin test since one
plus was bragging about fitness on this
phone I was slightly nervous that the
phone would break turns out I had
nothing to worry about the screen does
pop out from the frame which shows us
that there is no waterproofing adhesive
like we saw during my iPhone 7 test but
the phone locked out after the pop and
does not bend any farther it's even less
flexible from the front side since that
screen is set down inside the metal
frame keeping things from moving around
at all this one +5 definitely passes the
bin test one interesting thing is that
oneplus is advertising 2.5 D glass on
their phone if you remember the HTC u 11
advertised 3d glass you can tell that
the 3d class has a major curve to it
while 2.5 D is more of a bevel leaving
the glass itself flat allowing it more
give and play during any stressful
situation the rigid 3d glass combined
with that flexible metal frame on the U
11 is what got it obliterated during my
last durability test the oneplus 5 also
has a plastic buffer between the glass
in the middle which will help the screen
survive against impacts or drops these
subtle differences in construction that
you normally wouldn't notice go a long
way the durability of a device but like
always you can flop a case on your phone
and just have nothing to worry about I
always have a case on my phone I'm
pretty impressed with the 1+5 they have
continued their tradition of solid build
quality physically it might look a lot
like the iPhone 7 plus but it's several
hundred dollars cheaper has more
megapixels in the cameras and includes a
headphone jack so get the thumbs up for
me it'll be fun to tear it open and see
if they include a bright red battery
inside like they did in the old days
come hang out with me on Instagram and
we'll find out thanks a ton for
subscribing and thanks for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
