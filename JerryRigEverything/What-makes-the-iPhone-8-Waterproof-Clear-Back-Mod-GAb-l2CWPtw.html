Apple says its ip67 but what does that
even mean and how is it accomplished and
more importantly can we even trust it
it's time to tear the iPhone eight
completely apart analyze all the holes
and find the weakest link phones get wet
whether it's in the pool the toilet
humidity or body sweat accidents happen
all the time and it's good to be
prepared huge thank you to audible for
sponsoring this video it's one of the
most productive apps you can have on
your smartphone from self-help to
fantasy they've got an incredible
selection of audiobooks I'll talk more
about them in a second but first let's
have a moment of silence for this iPhone
it's not gonna survive this test all
right that was good let's get started
I'm going to use the gold iPhone that I
did my durability test video on as well
as the teardown it's had a good life
of course I'll save all the working
components and Frankenstein them into
other broken phones down the road
nothing is wasted here on my channel the
first hole we are analyzing is the
biggest where the screen fits into the
frame there's a ton of black adhesive
between the plastic edge of the screen
and the metal edge of the phone this
seems like it will do a pretty good job
of keeping water out as long as there's
no bends or dents along the frame that
would compromise the seal of the screen
Apple does say on their website that
water resistance is not a permanent
condition and water resistance might
decrease as a result of normal wear so
just plan on your water resistance
getting less and less the longer you on
your phone the earpiece on the screen is
another ingress point for water that
needs to be protected
the European efforts lifted off the
speaker itself as internally protected
with a tight screen the rubber seal
combined with the four tight screws keep
water away from the rest of the phone
the next set of holes to check are down
at the bottom of the iPhone eight where
the headphone jack used to be there are
three giant holes one for the microphone
on the left side which has a pretty
sweet thick screen that's built to let
air and sound pass through but not
liquid this is basically the same setup
that we saw in the previous iPhone 7 the
loudspeaker on the other side the phone
is pretty much the same way it's got a
little niblet at the bottom sticking
itself into the rubber and the mesh
water resistant screen relying on a
tight seal to keep water out before we
get to the charging port the SIM card
tray needs to come out this cute little
guy has a rubber ring around the tip the
little gap in the frame is almost
non-existent when the SD card is shut so
it doesn't need a whole lot to keep
water out and maintain that ip67 rating
here are the sim and SD card trays for
both the Galaxy S 8 and the LG G 6 both
of them have the same style of rubber
ring the camera hole is next popping the
camera out with its optical image
stabilization shows the inside of the
camera unit housing which is laser
welded into the frame of the phone
securely keeping all water on the
outside and the circuits dry on the
inside with the ip67 water easy
rating technically this phone can be
under 1 meter of water for less than 30
minutes
pulling the motherboard out gives us
access to the charging port as well as
exposes the wireless charging the
charging port in my opinion is the
weakest link
in this whole chain the only thing
keeping water from entering inside of
your phone is this little tiny white
rubber ring around the edge literally
this little white rubber band is the
only thing between you and total
complete utter destruction of your phone
by water there is glue along the back
side of the port but that tiny little
band is probably what's keeping this
iPhone at an ip67 rating instead of an
IP 68 like the LG v 30 or the galaxy s 8
remember Apple provides no warranty
against water damage if your phone gets
water on the inside and stops working
that's all on you so it really is better
to be safe than sorry and keep your
phone away from water the last two holes
on this phone are the side buttons and
the back glass panel taking a look at
the power button the electronic portion
of the switch is internal so that's
already protected and the external part
that gets pressed has a little rubber
ring around each leg to seal the phone
against moisture if moisture does get
inside the phone it will eventually
short-circuit and die maybe not right
away some corrosion takes time the
motherboard has no protection against
water once the liquid is inside there
are ways of applying a hydrophobic
coating to the circuit boards this would
effectively waterproof the phone but
needs to be done while the phone is
being constructed and is very expensive
it's easy to tell that this motherboard
has no hydrophobic coating on it because
of the way the water droplet clings to
the circuits if it was coated the water
would beat up and run off not sticking
to anything important the back glass of
the iPhone 8 handles most of the heavy
lifting when it comes to keeping water
out as long as it's not cracked
especially cracked over the top of this
wireless charging hole now that we have
this hole exposed let's try to make it
clear really quick just to see what it
would look like through that window
it's pretty much the same concept as the
clear Samsung phones a lot of scraping
but no paint stripper required on this
one if I were to reassemble the phone at
this point the only thing visible would
be the back of the battery and a small
segment of the motherboard if I left the
wireless charging out not near as cool
some of the Android phones one of my
least favorite parts of the iPhone
eights billed as the way Apple attached
the back glass they could have done it
in a way that was easy to waterproof
like Samsung and easy to replace but
they didn't they made it permanent and
the only way to replace a cracked back
panel is to break it out with force and
that's a lose-lose situation for
everyone involved any accidental cracks
in the back glass will compromise your
water resistance and allow water to
enter in the phone especially above that
wireless charging hole personally I
would treat this water resistance as a
bonus but never actually try and test it
out as long as you don't crack the back
or front glass though or bent the sides
then you can feel relatively safe around
splashes or light rain one guy who would
have loved at waterproof phone is
Captain Ahab he could have used it while
hunting his elusive great white whale I
would say Moby Dick but then I might
lose my youtube monetization well
audible has an unmatched selection of
audiobooks in their library including
the classic Moby Dick by Herman Melville
you get a free month trial by visiting
the link in my description audible.com
slash jerry-rigged all lowercase you can
listen to the harrowing oceanic tale on
your water resistant iPhone or even on a
regular smartphone or computer for free
for 30 days and if you decide not to
continue with your trial after 30 days
you still get to keep the book you
downloaded you literally own the book
and you can share that book with someone
else it's a pretty sweet system I'll
leave a link in the video description so
you can find out who won a hab the whale
or the water resistant iPhone 8 big
thanks to audible again for making this
video possible I'll be listening to my
book as I clean up this mess if the back
glass were replaceable I could have let
the phone live moral the story don't
ever break your back glass and be
careful around
water thanks for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
