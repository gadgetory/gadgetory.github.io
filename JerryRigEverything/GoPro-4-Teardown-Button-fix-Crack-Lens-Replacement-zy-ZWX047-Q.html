Hero for the top button and the side
button do not work during a wreck the
centrifugal force of the GoPro tumbling
messed up the internal components and
I'll show you what they look like here
in a second but without the top button
and the side button you can't record
video and you can't connect it to a
phone to see what you're recording so
the GoPro is effectively useless and
needs to be repaired so let's open it up
and bring it back to a working order
going to slide the battery out of the
bottom and then the faceplate pops off
of the front housing there's a few
little clasps and adhesive holding it
down to the main frame lift it up and
set it off to the side and remove the
button as well it's just sitting on top
of the little mechanism there are four
screws holding the internals into the
frame remove the SD card as well and
then you can slide the internals out of
the back housing there are two cables
along the left sides to be very gentle
when you're pulling it apart one is for
the power the bottom one and then the
top one is what controls the shutter
button and the Settings button on the
side you can see that the connector that
connects the ribbon cable to the
motherboard is just ripped completely
off the board and this is what happened
when the GoPro is taking a tumble
so let's swap out this mainboard there's
one screw on the back two screws on the
front that we're going to remove and
then we're going to disconnect the power
button and LCD ribbon from the back of
the motherboard slide that out a little
slot then there are four screws on the
back of the sensor and the little Lego
light connection that holds it to the
motherboard remove that and then the
front lens will just pop off from the
motherboard you can see here that I have
two broken GoPros the number three and
the number seven I've labeled them
myself and the top latch is broken from
the number three GoPro so we're just
going to swap the motherboards take the
motherboard from the number seven GoPro
and put it into the housing from GoPro
number three going to remove the broken
latch from the ribbon cable here then I
can plug the power into the working
motherboard and plug the ribbon cable
into the working latch on the good
motherboard that's not damaged lock it
into place little latch let's take the
black tape on top so it doesn't come
loose again and then slide the lens into
the motherboard now this is good
information to have
because if you have two broken GoPros
you can Frankenstein them together into
one working one or you can buy broken
GoPros locally off your local Craigslist
or Ebay and splice them together and
make a little bit of cash I'm going to
take the sensor put those four screws
into place and then use the Lego
connection to get back on the
motherboard there are two screws on the
front of the housing and one screw on
the rear
you can also buy replacement LCDs and
lenses basically everything on this
GoPro camera is modular which is very
very convenient for repair guys like
myself I'm going to plug in the LCD
ribbon cable into the back of the
motherboard and latch it down make sure
to put that tape into place as well
because these GoPros are dropped fairly
regularly and you don't want that to
come loose once it's down to the housing
we can take the battery and plug it back
into place
turn the GoPro on and it looks like the
shutter button is reacting I'm going to
put an SD card into the side and double
check and it looks like that solved our
problem that broken connector on the old
motherboard was the issue it was not
receiving signal from the top and side
buttons but now that we've swapped the
motherboard from the GoPro number seven
into the GoPro number three housing
everything is working just for reference
the GoPro number seven was not working
either it had problems with the power
transfer from the battery to the
motherboard but that was part of the
housing and now we have a working GoPro
so it's worth it make sure that power
button is situated in the correct spot
so it lines up with the housing and then
latch the front faceplate into place I
will link whatever replacement parts
that I can find down in the video
