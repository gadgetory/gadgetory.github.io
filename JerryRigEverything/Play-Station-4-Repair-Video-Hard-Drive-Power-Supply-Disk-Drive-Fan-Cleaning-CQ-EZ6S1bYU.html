apart the brand new Playstation 4 we're
going to start with the hard drive if
you've already seen the hard drive
replacement you can just skip ahead to
about the 1-minute mark in this video
right now we're going to pop off the
shiny plastic part you just take your
hands and press down the plastic and
then pull it away up and away from the
actual PlayStation itself and the hard
drive has the one Phillips head screw
with the big one right there that you
unscrew and then the hard drive itself
can pop up and out away from the
PlayStation I'll put a link in the video
description below for bigger hard drives
I believe and get a one terabyte drive
now that will just pop in it doubles
your space for screws around the outside
get the hard drive out of the bracket
then you can just take your new
replacement hard drive and pop it back
in line it up with the holes then you
can screw those black screws back in
again to the same spots now here is
where you start to void the warranty on
the ps4 there are the two stickers that
come out and this is with one of the
little Torx screwdriver heads you'll see
what it looks like here in a second so
I'm peeling off the void stickers and
then there's two black tabs on the very
end as well that you have to peel off
then there's four screws holding down
all the plastic together on the ps4s
we're going to start with the top I'm
just going to kind of lift up on one of
the corners and then the whole plastic
panel is going to lift up and away from
the frame you can see the plastic panel
there and then here's the power supply
so there's three of those Torx screw
heads that we were working on before and
then there's two super long screws that
go all the way down through the ps4 into
the motherboard below so I'm going to
take that out and show you what that
looks like and there's this one on the
other side as well
and then that frees up the power supply
so we can take it out right now I'm just
kind of priming one of the corners loose
start with this side over here to get it
up and away and then you can just take
the whole power supply and lift it up
and out from the little slot that it's
in there is a cable
along that one side you'll see me show
you right here
and I kind of wiggled the connecting
wire into the power supply and the
connection didn't seem too strong so I
didn't take it apart right there I
actually flipped the power supply around
and I released it from the the
motherboard side I just used my little
pry tool and kind of pried up on it so I
didn't put any stress on the cables as I
was pulling it away from the connector
here you see the power supply I will put
replacement parts in the video
description below so if your ps4 stops
working there's a good chance as the
power supply here is the Bluetooth
antenna so I'm going to pop that up and
out of the grooves that it's and it's
just little wire connector so it's kind
of like a little Lego that just pops
into place and then here is the rest of
the antenna there's one screw head that
holds the little metal bracket into
place you can just take that pop it up
and away pretty straightforward now we
have the CD drive this little ribbon
cable connector right here is pretty
interesting actually you press down on
the little metal head of the connector
and then that releases the ribbon all
together then there's three screws that
you have to undo and then the connection
to the power supply below same thing
that the other power supply had just
going to wiggle it loose then pop it out
of the little grooves that it's in the
hold the wires in place and then the
whole Drive just comes up and away from
the PlayStation 4 once again if your
drive goes out or if it stops playing
blu-rays there's a good chance the
lasers fry it so I'll put a replacement
parts in the video description below
make your life a lousier and then this
is super super important to make sure
you take out the rest of this ribbon
it's the same type of connector but the
motherboard is not going to come free if
you don't remove this ribbon cable now
the underside of the PlayStation the two
little red dots are two screws that you
have to undo before the plastic comes
apart now we have the plastic off and
here are the diagram where the screws
are the two green ones are the ones you
already took apart to get the plastic
undone the two red ones
hold the
he sink onto the motherboard and then
the rest of the blue ones just hold that
big metal plate in place here is the
cable for the fan it's little power
connector you just lift it up and away
from the actual motherboard itself and
the motherboard lifts up and then you
pull it back and away from the front
docks and there's the motherboard you
can see the glue from the heatsink on
there there's three screws here to get
rid of this heat shield then you can see
the heatsink right there like I said if
you are planning on taking it apart I
would have extra glue the heatsink paste
a thermal paste to put between the
processor and the heatsink wait before
you put it together again
that way you don't overheat your ps4
there's this little metal bracket you
have to lift up and away and then
there's two screws holding on the fan so
if you need to clean out your fan this
is the very last step in the whole
process and there is the ps4 fan anyway
