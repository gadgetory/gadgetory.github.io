replace the loudspeaker on your iPhone 5
turn the thing off and to replace the
loudspeaker is pretty simple the part
itself is only like 5 or 10 bucks and
think about the bottom two screws just
using your a pentalobe screwdriver which
is the same as the screwdriver that used
with the iPhone 4 or 4s once you get the
two screws out
now you take a little suction suction
cup and you press it onto the screen and
you lift up gently when the screen when
you're pulling up with the screen you
can slide a little object on between the
screen and the frame and preferably prep
plastic so you don't damage anything the
metal one worked well for me even though
it does scratch your phone just a little
bit makes it a little bit easier be
careful with the top ribbon cables now
if you want to take off the top screen
just remove these three little screws
right here and then pop off the ribbon
cables metal make it easier for you to
work with I might just kind of prop my
screen up on this little block so I
wouldn't have to you know do more work
than I needed to
any winters to get to the loudspeaker
there's three little screws on this
metal bracket and you can see me placing
the screws on the piece of paper over
there exactly where they came out of the
phone just so I know how to put them
back in and then to get the loudspeaker
out there's two screws one here in the
bottom corner and then the other one is
on that other side next to the charging
port and then you have to reach over
here and there's this little ribbon
cable that's actually glued to the
speaker so you're going to have to work
at the corners and kind of peel that up
gently make sure you're very very
careful with that because if you rip it
your that's a pretty important cable
anyway once that's off you can just kind
of lift the speaker out and there's a
little plastic clip at the very top and
that's what's underneath the main board
holding it holding it tight anyway once
that's out that's a replacement part
right there so you can just grab another
one the new one and place it back into
the into the foam replace those two
bottom screws
and reattach that ribbon cable is a
little like plastic protrusion that the
little ribbon cable snaps on to anyway
once you're done with that grab the
brackets again with the same three
little screws
I put the middle one in first and that
kind of helps you align the top and
bottom with where they are supposed to
be anyway then you can kind of clip the
screen back into place just start at the
top you can see it clip in and then
you'll hear it clip all the way around
the sides anyway that's it I will make
sure to list the parts that you need for
this operation
in the video description below so check
those out Amazon is usually the best
place for parts anyway make sure to LIKE
this video if it helped you and leave
any questions down in the comments
