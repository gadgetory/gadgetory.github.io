build quality and see how I managed to
pass my durability test so well
depending on west side of the planet
here on Nokia could also be pronounced
Nakia
but either way let's get started I'm
going to remove the SIM card tray first
like I always do and then comes the heat
gun if you remember with the Google
pixel how the screen lifted off first
this is going to be almost the exact
same process which is actually really
smart from a design and repair
perspective because screens they'll
usually the first thing to break on a
phone I'm taking a thin metal pry tool
and sliding it under the glass after the
adhesive has been softened and the glass
warmed up till just about too hot to
touch I'm placing cards under the glass
after it's lifted so that it won't
reappear to the frame again I'm taking
extraordinary care not to touch the LCD
edge underneath that glass layer with my
metal pry tool or the cards because that
LCD has the structural integrity of a
potato chip you'll see what I mean in a
minute normally anyone attempting this
repair will already have a crack
screening and won't need to salvage or
save the old one but since I like to
keep my phones in working condition for
the most part I'm being careful once all
the sides have been slit the screen will
lift off just high enough for me to slip
one of my playing cards underneath the
LCD remember touching the sides of the
LCD with anything is catastrophic it's
extremely easy to break most people will
not be successful in removing a
functional screen on their first try so
if you ever end up replacing anything
inside of the phone just plan on
replacing the screen as well there are
some ribbon cables that you need to
avoid slicing down here these can easily
be cut with a business card or a metal
pry tool so make sure you stay away from
them avoid the home button and menu
buttons to lift upward against the glass
instead of downward against the metal
and now we started to see what makes
this phone so strong a solid metal mid
plate is protecting the rest of the
components I'm just going to double
check and make sure that my screen is
still functional
I wouldn't recommend doing this yourself
it's better just to leave the phone off
the entire time it's open surprisingly
enough though I was successful in my
screen is still functioning
so I'll power it down and move on to the
connector there's one little screw
holding down the metal bracket over the
screen ribbon connector I'll snap that
just like a little Lego and the screens
off the phone
and this is it if all you need is a
screen replacement this is literally all
you have to do you don't need to watch
the video any farther
just grab your new screen plop it on and
you are good to go it's really
incredibly simple remember that the
corners and the edge of the LCD are
going to be the most fragile that's why
I was really happy that LG got rid of
their corners on the LG g6 it does help
with the removal process an experienced
tech who doesn't need to save the old
screen could probably do a whole screen
replacement on this nokia 6 in less than
10 minutes I'll link any replacement
screens and tools that I find in the
video description there's one more screw
holding down the fingerprint scanner and
home-button ribbons so if those stop
working they're also super easy to
replace I'll set these off to the side
and this little guy is the battery
connector it would be smart to
disconnect this before removing the
screen and the home button just so
nothing shorts out on accident I almost
missed it cause it was so small and then
we find wait for it 19 screws
surrounding the middle middle middle 8
some of these are different sizes so it
is very important that you keep the
screws organized as you remove them once
the screws are out I'll slip my pry tool
in up near the top earpiece and lift the
metal plate up like a giant door there
are some latches at the bottom so this
is the best way to go about it and then
we have complete access to the battery
this is a repair guys dream by the way
the battery is out and away from all the
fragile electronic components now so if
prying needs to happen during the
replacement process nothing important
can be broken but look at this
the Nokia 16 has those magical pull tabs
there is no pride to be done at all you
just tug the pull tab and the adhesive
pulls out away from the battery leaving
it completely loose and free to fall
away from the metal plate no force
necessary I'll give all the thumbs-up to
Nokia for this one if Apple and Samsung
don't step up their game this phone is
going to win the most durable and
repairable phone of 2017 easy to
batteries a 3000 milliamp power
here's that metal mid plate definitely a
huge reason this phone is so rigid one
it's made of quality metal and two when
it's screwed into the thick metal tack
housing it forms an indestructible metal
sandwich while we need to take a few
pointers here from Nokia there's one
more middle bracket holding down the
volume and headphone jack connectors
I'll set that off to the side and then
six more screws
our holding down the motherboard to the
frame keep these organized and away from
the mid plate screws then I can unclip
the volume ribbon and the headphone jack
ribbon and this is where it starts to
get kind of tricky now normally I'm one
of the first people in the world to tear
down a cell phone for the youtubes which
means I don't have any guides to follow
as I'm doing the circuit board pulls
straight down and then lifts up out of
the frame
during my tinkering I forgot to unclip
that bottom left wire cable so when the
board finally lifted off the head tore
off the wire incredibly cheap to fix
just kind of annoying that it happened
in the first place
so make sure that your wire is unplugged
before pulling it out of the board
there's one more ribbon cable on the
bottom as well that leads down to the
charging port looking at the motherboard
we can see the two cameras are modular
and the LED flash is built into the
circuits if I pop off each of these
little cameras we can see that the left
one is the rear 16 megapixel camera and
the right little guy is the 8 megapixel
front-facing camera neither of which had
the hardware stabilization for me oh is
or optical image stabilization is super
important electronic stabilizing is
usually not as good as the hardware
stabilizing when it comes to video
quality and since I do a lot with video
it's kind of a deal breaker for me
I hope Nokia includes it in their future
devices following this extension ribbon
down to the charging port we find four
more screws remove those and unclip the
wire cable that we destroyed the other
end of and the microUSB charging port
can pull away from the frame it's tucked
underneath those little metal tabs on
the frame just like the motherboard up
top was it also has a little microphone
down there at the bottom next to the
microUSB port the loudspeaker has its
own special section in the frame of the
phone each metal Ridge or lip inside of
a metal object at strength to the
overall structure so this Nokia six
really is utilizing all the available
space and design tricks I'm pretty
impressed this phone also has the same
circular vibrator motor we saw in the
HTC u ultra when putting the circuit
board back into place remember that they
slip underneath the metal tabs along the
bottom of the frame
I'll get the four screws back in there
and now we can deal with this extension
ribbon it plugs into the bottom of the
motherboard so I'll do that before I set
it down into the frame and when I go to
set the motherboard down it needs to
tuck itself into the top of the frame
first under the metal tabs protruding
from the frame I've never seen a phone
built like such a tank before but I'm
not complaining these boards definitely
are
moving anywhere the volume and power
button gets plugged in next as well as
the headphone jack ribbon these will
both snap into place like a little Lego
you'll feel it click in there's a little
metal bracket holding these down as a
second layer of protection technically
you can screw this in place right now if
the edgar screws organized or you can
just wait till the back metal panel is
in place there are six more screws
holding down the motherboard and don't
forget to plug in that bottom left wire
cable either since mine is broken I'll
just have to live with it for now
until I can get a replacement wire the
battery gets set back into place but not
plugged in yet and finally we can plop
that metal mid frame down to the phone
it has two tabs along the bottom that
need to be set into the frame first and
then the rest of it can be pushed down
and now we get to sandwich the metal
slabs together with the 19 little screws
overkill probably but durable definitely
I'll slide that home button into little
groove routing that wire over to the
plug where it clips in I'll tape it back
down just to keep it secure and then
finally we had to install the screen
it'll clip back in just like the little
Lego connections we've been working on
this whole time and then when everything
is plugged in including the battery
which should be last we can plop the
file to metal brackets into place over
the plugs and we're good to set the
screen down into the frame making sure
to line it up over the home button and
keep it inside of the grooves on the
metal sides I imagine that the
replacement screens will come with their
own adhesive which will help keep them
down and in place overall from a repair
perspective if you have to work on a
cell phone it's glued shut this is
probably the most ideal one to work on
screens break most often on cell phones
and that's the first component on this
device to be removed batteries fail most
often after that and this battery's
located right below the screen pretty
easy access for both repairs I hope that
Nokia six holds its own on the software
and camera size of things because they
for sure have the hardware and build
quality nailed perfectly if you want to

videos on the way thanks for watching
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
