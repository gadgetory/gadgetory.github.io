screwdriver and then a pentalobe
screwdriver it's the same size that
opens up all of the iPhones
I need a pry tool and a suction cup put
the suction cup close to the home button
take your pentalobe screwdriver and undo
the bottom two screws right next to the
charging port place your suction cup
right next to the home button and lift
up with your finger at the same time
trying to put the pry tool between the
frame and the screen I found it a little
bit easier to use a razor blade as it
was more it was more firm so it could
slide down between the frame and the
glass easier lift up gently and kind of
pariah them apart don't stick your tool
in too far though because there's a
ribbon cable that you don't want to rip
lift up gently between the screen and
the frame you can see right here that
little ribbon cable that's where the
fingerprint sensor connects to the main
board so I'm going to do is I'm going to
take my little pry tool reach it in
there and it's kind of like a little
latch so you twist your pry tool up a
little bit and it will unlatch on one
side and I will come apart here in a
second you'll see as I lift up the
little ribbon cable connector and unsnap
it the top part of the latch comes off
which is fine it goes back on pretty
easily as well when I say easily I mean
you're going to hate every second of it
towards the end of the video right here
on this bracket there's going to be four
screws take off each of the screws and
then set them in the location where they
came out and then put the bracket right
next to them so remember where they go
in because they are different sizes
there's the bracket and then right here
we have different ribbon cables I'm just
going to unsnap them just like little
Legos this is for the earpiece and
camera this one right here is for the
LCD and then this one's the digitizer
not that you really need to know what
those are but they unclip and unsnap
just like that now here's the screen we
have the earpiece on this side with all
the cameras and the sensors and we have
the home button with the fingerprint
sensor on the bottom I'm going to show
you how to take apart that first undo
the little screw there's a little little
super tiny metal piece it should stick
to the screw as you unscrew it as Minded
just remember where that goes in the
location of it so you can put it back in
just in case it does pop off then
there's two screws holding on the home
button there's a little metal bracket so
take that off
and then the home button itself is just
kind of stuck on like with sticky tape
type stuff onto the frame of the phone
so you can take any kind of pry tool I
know like my razor blade I find that it
is pretty stiff and sharp enough to get
under on these little tiny seams be
super careful around these ribbon cables
looks if you rip one you know you have
to buy a new part I'm going to show you
how to gently pry up around the home
button just a little bit on each side
until the whole button comes away from
the phone
very gently any parts for this phone I'm
going to list in the video description
below so if you have any questions you
need to make that let me know if you
have a specific part you need let me
know and I can usually find a preachy
for you and there's the home button and
now we're going to take off the earpiece
as well as the front-facing camera and
light sensor so there's the two screws
on either side of the bracket there and
the brackets kind of interesting there's
a little metal clip on the inside of the
bracket that you have to bend just ever
so slightly outside of the bracket will
come come off so I'm going to bend that
out and then the whole bracket comes
away from the phone and you can kind of
see what I was talking about with a
little tiny clip right there so it's
very easily clips back into place when
you're done anyway once it can be super
careful with all these little ribbon
cables Apple didn't mess around and they
were putting them all into one component
right here you can see I'm lifting out
the connector for the earpiece as well
as the light sensor and then you can see
the camera coming away as well in that
same ribbon cable group and then the
whole thing is kind of stuck down with a
little grounding sticker onto the back
of the screen so I'll peel up on that
very gently once again you don't want to
rip any of this stuff unless you break
when opening your foam the better that's
what I always say
there you go now it depends on where you
buy your screen from but you might also
have to switch out the metal plate
there's just those four screws around
the outside now once again that's
completely depend on where your screen
front I'm not going to do it on this
screen just because it is super simple
four screws pop it out good to go and
I'm going to place the group of ribbon
cables cameras sensor and everything
back into place there's only one spot
for everything so you just kind of got
to position it does take a little bit to
get everything in the right spot but
they only fit in one way so it's pretty
simple to figure out got it stuck back
down onto the screen again and then get
the earpiece in there
remember the earpiece acts as like a
little magnet so let's say you're trying
to pick up a screw with your screwdriver
and your screwdrivers not magnetized you
can easily magnetize it on the back of
the on the back of the speaker I'll show
you how to do that once I get this
bracket into place
so my screwdriver won't pick up the
screw so I touch it to the back of the
speaker and then boom the screwdriver is
magnetized and will pick up any screw
almost too well so I'm going to grab it
with my tweezers instead and place it
down into the hole and screw back into
place same thing with the other screw
and you are done with the earpiece so
the home button remember this is where
you need to remember what direction that
little tiny metal bit was going in let's
get the home button pressed down into
place get the bracket over the top of it
and then hopefully your screw is still
stuck in to the top of the ribbon cable
so you can just screw it down into place
I found that it was a little bit easier
to hold it with my pry tool as well as
the little screwdriver like this
and finally got that thing screwed in
again and now to get the screen back on
I'm going to start with the digitizer
ribbon cable clip that into place once
again just like Legos it takes a second
to position it right over the top but
once it's in place you can just click it
down you'll hear a satisfying click with
each connection you'll see me struggle a
little bit with this last one
it's hard to find out exactly where I
wanted to clip in and there we go grab
your little bracket and once again you
should have your screws laid out in a
way that you can remember where they
went I'm going to screw each one of
those back into place once again any
parts for this you know the screen
anything else you might need will be
listed in the video description below
and if you need anything else besides
that make sure to ask me in the comments
or hit me up on Twitter either way hit
me up on Facebook and I can answer any
questions you have anyway here's the
finger print scanner cable that we're
going to try to get back into place
you're going to hate this thing it never
wants to do what you want it to do so I
kind of positioned a place with my
finger and I have my pry tool that I'm
just going to kind of press it in just
like little Lego snaps that we were
playing with before get it in place and
I have a little hinged bracket that I'm
going to slip down on top of there as
well once you get it into place you can
press it down with your finger or with
your pry tool once again it just takes
forever to get this thing position just
right you're going to love Apple anyway
that's what it looks like when it's in
place
and then position the top of the screen
in first and then you can kind of snap
up the edge of the phone make sure to
press only on the edges so you don't
crack the screen again and then clip the
bottom into place as well and then at
this point I like to turn the phone on
to make sure it's working and then I
don't have to undo the bottom screws
more than I need to looks like it all
turns on so I'm going to get those
bottom screws screwed back into place
once again if you have any come any
questions or comments or anything else
make sure leave in the comments below
