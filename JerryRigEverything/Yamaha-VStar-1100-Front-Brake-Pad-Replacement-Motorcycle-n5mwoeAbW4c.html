front brake pads this is a V Star 1100
basically to get the is the caliper
right here this is what the brake pads
are inside us we got to pop this off to
do that we have two 12 millimeter bolts
on right here before you break those off
though and loosen these up basically
it's just a little allen wrench it pops
inside of there and just gotta twist it
around there's a lot easier to break
these loose when it's attached to the
bike still name it's a brake goes off I
say brake I mean loosen up gently anyway
so this side I've already done I'm kind
of see that right there this is already
coming apart already took the brake pads
out of this I'm how you do it you just
pop this out I'll show you in a sec so
with that pull out right there you can
kind of see this whole part swings up
now and that's I get the brake pads in
and out so I already took those out so
I'll show you out for the next ones in
see these ones kind of just balance in
there you can see they're just resting
on that little notch and the other one
goes in the same way once you both in
there and resting you close that lever
down and you can see that these brake
pads still have a lot of wear and I'm
left so I'm gonna attach that bolt right
there and just slide it back onto the
caliper again so one last thing I forgot
to mention these these brake pads didn't
need to be changed but if they do
there's a good chance that well your new
brake pads will be thicker than your old
ones because your old ones are worn down
so to make room for the pads inside of
the caliper you have to compress the
little circle thing that's inside of it
the piston usually you can just grab it
with pair of vise grips and just
compress it in it is pretty difficult so
you know use some force behind it that's
pretty much all you got to do so if this
helped you make sure you like it ask any
questions that you have in the comments
