premium smartphone if you drop your
phone and it cracks the glass how hard
is it to replace the screen let's find
out first off I'm going to move the SIM
card tray since there are no visible
screws on the outside of the device and
then I'm going to use a heat gun to melt
off the adhesive underneath the back
glass panels it turns out the
construction of this phone is kind of
weird and technically you can remove the
screen without popping off these glass
panels but I'm going to show it anyway
and then you can decide which method is
best for you I found that the easiest
way to get under the back glass panel
was to start at the plastic portion of
the frame and dip my metal pry tool
underneath the glass and gently slide it
out once the metal pry tool is in I'm
going to reheat the back glass to make
sure that the adhesive is good and soft
so I'm not cracking anything once the
back glass panel flips up I can just
tear it off and set it off to the side
and repeat the process for the top panel
when you're heating it up you want to
get it just too hot to touch they know
that the adhesive is getting soft
underneath now that both panels are off
I can remove this gold bar on the bottom
section of the phone
this bar is purely aesthetics there is
no structural value to it it's just
there for looks now the reason for
taking off the back panel is that you
can push up gently on the screen from
the backside now and you don't have to
be sticking things deep inside of the
phone like playing cards it gives you a
little bit more leverage and room to
work with either way there is still
adhesive all the way around the edge of
the screen so I'm going to warm it up
just like we did with the back glass and
then slide my metal pry tools around the
black side of the glass making sure that
my tools do not touch the screen where
the display is because metal and
displays do not go well together it will
crack very easily you will see how thin
this screen is in a second
once I have all of the adhesive cut away
from the sides the top and the bottom we
can see how the screen is connected
definitely go slow during this part and
reheat the screen as often as needed
getting the glass just too hot to touch
the part that you have to be careful
with is down here at the bottom of the
phone that's where the ribbon cable is
for the display now if your screen is
already broken obviously you don't need
to be as careful as I am but I'm going
to reuse my screen so I'm taking special
care not to damage it now this screen
has the same Lego light connections that
we see on most every other phone
Samsung's and I
Bonz so we're going to remove the
protective metal covering and then
unsnap the screen like a little Lego
from the motherboard
make sure you stay organized with all
your little parts there's a couple more
components inside they'll be taking out
so make sure they don't get all mixed up
so here is the glass screen it's got the
glass and the display panel fused
together as one and this is what your
replacement part will look like when you
purchase it
although it will probably have new
adhesive surrounding the top the bottom
and the sides of the glass I will link
replacement parts and tools in the video
description below just like always now
let's see what else can be replaced I'm
going to set that metal bracket off to
the side and then pull up this tape
that's covering the battery and the
motherboard set this off to the side you
can try to reuse this if you want but
it's pretty flimsy stuff there are two
screws holding the front earpiece they
are t4 with this particular bit set I'm
going to move these two screws and then
the earpiece can pop up and off of the
phone it has the two little contact
points that rest on the motherboard so
it gets its signal there's a random
plastic piece right here underneath the
side button cable this is where the
power and volume button connect to the
motherboard the battery connection is
down here underneath this plastic piece
will slide this out from the bottom and
then set it off to the side and then we
will unclip the battery snapping it off
just like a little Lego similar to how
the screen was now the battery can be
lifted out from the bottom of the phone
there's nothing underneath that can
really be damaged just the back metal
plate just make sure you don't bend or
puncture this battery lithium ion
batteries can explode as you can see
from my note seven battery explosion
video there are two more screws at the
bottom for a total of four screws in
this entire phone usually there's a lot
more the bottom plastic piece pops up
and out and this just kind of sits
around the charging port there is a
metal plate over the processor in the
memory we're going to pull that off just
so we can see what it looks like there's
really nothing that can be repaired
under here we can see now though that
the charging port is not replaceable it
is attached very securely to the
motherboard so unless you have micro
soldering skills you're just gonna have
to leave it in the phone the rear-facing
camera can be swapped out pretty easily
just lift up little latch and slide it
out similar to how all of the other
cameras are held in place like Samsung's
we can see it has the OIS stabilising as
well it's kind of like a little gyro
that sits inside of the camera unit to
stabilize your videos and your pictures
there is one more big screw holding the
motherboard into place and then
surprisingly the motherboard does not
want to come
from the back of the frame I assume that
it's secured very permanently to the
back I could be a little more aggressive
with it but the more you bend a
motherboard the more you risk cracking
any of the little tiny solder joints
that you see around all those little
resistors and the processors and I don't
want to damage this phone permanently so
we're just going to leave it in the
frame because there's pretty much
nothing here that the common consumer
can replace easily without special micro
soldering tools and microscopes so we'll
put the camera back into place tuck it
down and clip it in reassembling the
phone puts this screw back in as well
the protective plate over the processors
and the memory goes into place and the
little tiny plastic bracket down at the
bottom near the charging port two more
screws for that little plastic bracket
and the earpiece goes into place it'll
click in battery gets tucked down into
place and you can plug it in once
everything else is plugged in on the
board like the little side buttons for
the power and volume I'm going to slip
this little plastic bracket back into
place and this just kind of puts
pressure on to that little connection so
it doesn't pop off if you ever drop your
phone I'm going to reconnect the screen
this is where you'll be using your new
screen if you're doing a screen
replacement just plug it in you'll feel
snap underneath your fingers like a
little Lego and then the little metal
bracket goes over the top of it making
sure that each little clasp
goes inside of the frame so it doesn't
pop out ever if you drop your phone it's
important that this is secure
remember that your replacement screen
will probably have new adhesive so
you'll want to peel off the protective
adhesive covering so that it will stick
to the frame of the phone I'm going to
fold the screen back down into place and
set it down and push it firmly so that
the adhesive will reconnect remember
that bottom decorative metal piece we're
going to tuck that in and clip it down
and then the back glass pieces can go
into place as well if you decided to use
the route that required the removal of
the back glass top glass gets pushed
down in place as well it fits very
securely back here we can put back in
the SIM card tray and we're good to go
if you have any questions leave them
down in the comments don't forget to
like if this video helped you and
remember all the replacement parts can
be found in the video description of
this video
all my behind-the-scenes and future
projects can be found on my Twitter and
Instagram I'm definitely looking forward
to the iPhone released this week the
iPhone 7 should be an interesting
project thanks for watching
hope to see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
