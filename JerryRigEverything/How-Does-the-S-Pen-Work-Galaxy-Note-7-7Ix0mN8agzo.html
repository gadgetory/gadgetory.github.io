style is from Samsung that fits inside
of the note 7 smartphone its little
plastic tips are supposed to mimic a
real life pin as you write
electronically on the screen of the
phone the whole thing is water-resistant
just like the phone itself so let's do
what we always do and see what makes
this thing tick there are a few
improvements over the note 5s pin the
two differences is that the tips are
finer on the note 7 or more pointy ER
and the note 7s pin can detect twice as
many pressure levels so your artwork or
pin Manship will look and feel more
realistic included in the box or
replacement tips just in case something
happens to the originals there are two
types of material used for this tip the
white plastic which is slightly more
brittle than the included grey rubber
type tips replacing the tips is easy
enough pop out the little metal tweezers
that are included with your box and give
the tip a little pull then the
replacement tip can be slid into place I
imagine that the rubber tips will leave
slightly less of a groove in plastic
screen protectors since they are a bit
softer but time will tell so how does
the s-pen work let's find out what's
inside the whole thing is
water-resistant and permanently sealed
so there are not any easy access points
but the usual breaking things in half
approach seems to work just fine now
that we have identified the weakest
point on the s-pen which is right below
that plastic e chrome clicky part we can
see how it works a few people have
complained that there s pin has stopped
clicking which means that it gets stuck
inside of the phone this doesn't seem to
be widespread though with millions of
phones being shipped if you are bound to
be defective the spring mechanism inside
is pretty much identical to any other
style of clicky pin that you can buy at
the store a few Springs and the rotating
plastic piece remember since this pin is
not made to be taken apart if anything
breaks on it or if it stops working
the only option is to replace it fixing
is not an option I will link replacement
pins and replacement tips down below in
the video description if you need them
the shaft of the pin is also sealed by
plastic there is no easy access points
here either
so we're going to have to crush it away
if we want to see what's inside after
crushing it open with my pliers we
expose the main board and before we look
at that though
let's look at the tip now to me this is
the most interesting part of the pin
these coils of wire as we've seen from
the teardown video thus far there are no
power sources inside of the S pin so how
does it receive its power and
communicate with the phone these coils
here are the main event if you remember
from my invisible wireless charging desk
video wireless charging does not need
direct contact in order to work these
copper coils in the phone will still
charge through thin objects so when we
look at the s-pen we can see that even
before the pin touches the surface of
the phone it is already receiving
inductive power through the coils in the
tip and the digitizer inside of the
phone has already detected the
electromagnetic field in the tip and is
ready for the pins contact the main
board in the S Pen is covered in a thick
rubber coating this is probably another
layer of waterproofing under that layer
is a ton of resistors that I imagine
help out with the 4000 different levels
of pressure detection which is quite an
improvement over the 2000 levels of
pressure detection in the note 5s pin I
do not believe this s-pen is a prime
candidate for a reassembly video if you
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
and subscribe so you never miss a future
tear down all of my behind-the-scenes
stuff are usually posted to Instagram
and Twitter thanks ton for watching hope
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
