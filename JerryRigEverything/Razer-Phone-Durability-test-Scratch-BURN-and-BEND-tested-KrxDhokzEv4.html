announced this year is the razor phone
the phone
built by a gaming company for gamers but
also has specs impressive enough to
catch the eyes of the rest of us but is
it durable there's only one way to find
out so once upon a time I durability
tested a phone called the next bit Robin
it didn't do so well
razor went out and purchased the next
bit startup and basically plopped their
impressive hardware into the next bit
body so I'm really hoping some
structural improvements we're also
included the scratch test is always
first with my Mohs hardness picks that
allow us to see what the screen is made
of like most smartphones these days
razor is rocking Gorilla Glass but this
time Gorilla Glass 3 interesting plastic
would normally scratch at a level 3
tempered glass is level 6 and we've seen
sapphire scratch at level 8 this razor
phone is a solid 6 with a deeper groove
at a level 7 so this 5.7 inch display
can hold its own against the other major
flagships the phone does have dual
front-facing stereo speakers hidden
under a plastic grille up here at the
top of the phone we have another plastic
grille with its 8 megapixel front facing
camera protected by a circle of glass
the proximity sensor is under glass as
well
so everything's protected and the
plastic grille is very securely attached
so it's not gonna come loose on its own
the problem so far over here on the side
of the phone we have a sim an SD card
slot that can hold an additional 2
terabytes of storage pretty impressive
I'd like to see an iPhone do that
besides the phone are metal which is a
refreshing change from the previous
totally plastic next bit Robin the
fingerprint scanner is stretchable it's
not invincible like the ceramic of the
oneplus five or Apple sapphire but the
good news is is that even with the abuse
the fingerprint scanner is still able to
read my finger every time there are no
additional ports at the top of the phone
but everything is still metal and over
here on this side of the phone we get
two extremely small circular volume
buttons both of which are metal
the bottom the phone does have a USBC
slot with no headphone jack and honestly
a phone this size with bezels this big
and no waterproofing it should include a
headphone jack unless they were to
include wireless headphones or even a
USBC headphone in the box it's just pure
laziness on the manufacturing end and
the loser is the customer who now has to
go out of their way to do something
normal
I've been scratching the dual camera
lens one is a telephoto zoom lens which
is nice and while they are covered in
glass my razor is leaving permanent
marks on the surface so there is some
kind of coating over the top my razor
blade is about a 5.5 on Mohs scale of
hardness and that's when the scratches
start appearing so while it's not
plastic I would still recommend not
setting this phone down on its back
without some kind of case with a raised
lip to protect that lens a case is also
a good idea for the back metal because
my keys are leaving marks and the marks
don't disappear like we saw with the 1 +
5 t razor has their iconic three headed
snake logo type thing
smack dab in the middle of the phone and
it's inlaid pretty solidly into the
metal my razor blade struggles to grab
an edge and even then it's glued pretty
tight so it probably won't ever fall out
on its own now if you followed Razer at
all they make gaming hardware and their
gaming computer mouse line is pretty
much all named after snakes
since you know snakes eat mice kind of
an interesting connection there so here
we have a cute little mouse friend he
doesn't have a name quite yet so let me
know in the comments what his name
should be he's looking pretty sharp
maybe him and Rex from the pixel to
excel will get along there is solid
metal behind the snake logo so it won't
be possible to add an LED conversion
like we did with the iPhone but there is
a tiny hole through the metal which may
allow wires to pass through
so maybe Razer did think about adding
RGB to this phone either way hopefully
they do it with their next device the
biggest selling point for me though on
this phone is the refresh rate of the
screen normal phone screens can show 30
or 60 images per second but this phone
has a hundred and twenty Hertz refresh
rate making the display super smooth for
gaming and watching videos AMOLED
screens are incapable of achieving this
refresh rate at the moment just IPS LCD
screens and that's what we're seeing
here as the pixels completely recover
from the burn test the display
brightness seems to be lacking though
mine is currently turned all the way up
and now it's time to see if the razor
foam has the same fragile internal build
quality that the next bit Robin did the
initial flex gives us quite a bit more
bender than usual but nothing is
catastrophic Lee damaged yet we do get a
pretty severe kink next to the power
button as I straighten the phone out but
it's still cosmetic and the phone is
still alive during the next flex there
is a snap near the volume button but
overall the phone is still surviving
even with the most extreme of abuse this
damage is superficial and while this is
definitely not the strongest phone I've
ever tested it will stand up to the
basics and it's a huge improvement from
the next fit Robin a case is always a
good idea especially for that camera
lens and keeping the metal clean from
blemishes but it's good to know that the
phone itself is structurally sound I'll
be tearing this phone down to see the
insides and that massive battery so
subscribe for that and let me know what
we should name our mouse friend we can
vote on the best suggestions over on my
twitter thanks dumb for watching and
I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
