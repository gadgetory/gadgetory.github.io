durability of the oneplus 2 it is a
pretty large phone the exact same size
as the Samsung Note 5 this is a fully
functioning phone you can see the dual
SIM card notification up at the top
which is pretty unique just like always
I do durability tests on phones that are
semi practical for real life scratch
tests camera lens tests Bend tests so
let's get started the oneplus 2 ships
with a quality screen protector that is
one of those plastic ones you can swap
out every five or six months so one plus
is either being really nice or they
don't have a lot of confidence in their
Gorilla Glass let's find out it's time
to go under the knife with a scratch
test I just take a razor blade and
solidly press on the screen you can see
the glass flex a little with the amount
of pressure that I'm applying but as
soon as I turn it into the light you can
see the scratches that the blade is left
on the screen do they rub off no they do
not and I can fill a little divots with
my finger
now oneplus has said that their phone
has Gorilla Glass which should be
unscratched full by a razor
but this razor could be scraping off the
oleophobic coating on top of the glass
you can see that my tweezers also left a
mark but luckily my keys did not so it
really just depends on what kind of
metal you are scratching the screen with
as long as you don't do anything weird
with your phone I think you won't have
any issues the camera glass lens must be
made out of a harder material than the
screen because no scratches showed up on
the lens you can see that the glass sits
just below flush with the metal lens
frame which will also help it avoid
getting scratched in the future the
stock back cover the phone feels like a
cross between felt and 800 grit
sandpaper while it can be easily
scratched up and marked the backs are
replaceable so I wouldn't consider this
a negative aspect of the phone the flame
test the oneplus 2 has an IPS LCD
display very similar to the iPhone 6 and
the iPhone 6 plus it is the same
technology when the flame heats up the
pixels enough they shut off and go black
but as soon as they cool back down again
to a normal temperature the pixels will
turn back on and look as if nothing has
happened to them I got the same results
with the iPhone 6 and the Samsung Galaxy
phones if you've enjoyed this video so
far hit that subscribe button I'll keep
making these videos for every new phone
that comes out onto the bin 10
I feel like this is one of the more
important tests especially for the
hipsters who thinks it's okay to put
their phones in the back pocket of their
skinny jeans this is me applying full
force to the phone the phone does have
an aluminium magnesium mid frame which
helps give the phone rigidity but it
still flexes quite a bit it will never
been completely or snap in half like the
HTC m9 did or the iPhone six-plus but it
can be flexed the sketchiest part was
after I straighten the phone out the
screen lost its sensitivity for about 20
seconds and wouldn't respond to my touch
which hasn't happened before with any of
the other phones I've done been tests on
but then it forgave me and started
working again after that overall is
definitely a solid phone for the price I
wish the screen was more scratch proof
but at least the phone is easy to repair
speaking of which check out the repair
video I made for this phone I'll link
some of the other durability tests I've
done as well like the HTC m9 the iPhone
6 plus and the galaxy s6 thanks ton for
watching you have any questions leave in
the comments I do respond fairly
regularly hope see you around
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
