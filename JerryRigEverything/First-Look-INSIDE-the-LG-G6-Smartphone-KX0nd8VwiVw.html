their brand new LG g6 and they actually
left me alone in a room with the phone
and while the phone does look pretty
cool on the outside I'm here to see what
it looks like on the inside let's get
started in front of me I have the LG G
six in two different colors a brushed
metallic silver and a glossy black
version these phones feel heavy and
solid in my hand and like I've mentioned
in previous videos that's a very good
thing my favorite thing about this phone
so far though is the screen size with
that ratio there is so much room for
activities the phone is completely flat
too no camera bump no fingerprint
scanner bump and no earpiece hole and no
curved screen edge which is also nice
when gripping a phone with a curved
screen like the s7 edge the palm of my
hand always touches the curve making the
phone hard to use with just one hand so
I'm glad LG is staying away from that
type of design but seriously I hope this
widescreen trend continues this is the
best-looking phone I've seen in a long
time but I'm also about that inner
beauty so thank you to LG for sponsoring
this video and letting me analyze this
thing from the inside remember this is
not an activity that you want to attempt
on your own the phone has an IP 68
water-resistant rating which means that
the back is sealed shut with adhesive
this is great for keeping the water out
but also makes the phone a bit harder to
work on warming the phone up softens the
adhesive I also use a suction cup in my
thin metal pry tool to lift up the
bottom edge of the glass and split my
pry tool inside the rear glass panel has
a slight curve to it so I'm using a soft
paper business card to slice through the
adhesive while not putting too much
pressure on that curve of the glass once
the back panel is off we can see the
golden contact points for the
fingerprint scanner the golden pads just
rest on top of the motherboard to
transfer signal the back panel is made
out of Gorilla Glass 5 and it's
surprisingly thin and very lightweight
the black and silver coloring on the LG
g6 comes from a light coating on the
underside of the glass this coating can
be scratched off
but remember I'm scratching underneath
the back panel right
on the exterior surface of the phone
will not scratch like this the letters I
just scratched into the back are
completely see-through which is a good
indication of real glass and it's
actually surprisingly resilient it held
out the two solid hits from my tweezers
before I resorted to a pointy
screwdriver bit to help me out and here
we see that the back glass panel is
indeed 100% glass once the back panel is
off the rest of the teardown is pretty
simple there are 11 Phillips head screws
holding down the mid frame plastics once
these are removed I can lift off the
wireless charging pad wireless charging
is currently only available in the u.s.
at the moment so depending on where you
live your LG g6 might be a little bit
different wireless charging does not
work through metal phones which is one
of the reasons why the g6 has a glass
back you can see the golden contact pads
from the wireless charger that rest up
against the motherboard the loudspeaker
is attached to the bottom plastic
section this uses the same golden pads
to communicate with the mainboard it's
also interesting to note that the
speaker is completely sealed off from
the rest of foam so if water were
somehow to get inside of the speaker
through the frame which I'll show you in
a second the liquid would not get into
the more important components of the
phone the battery unsnaps easy enough
but there are no magic pull tabs like
I've seen on some of the other phones
luckily some gentle heat softens the
adhesive under the battery and a little
gentle prying can get it out notice I'm
using a plastic tool for this part
puncturing the battery with metal is
very dangerous I'll just straighten the
adhesive out so I can reuse it when I
reassemble the phone
good as new one thing I notice right off
the bat is that the sides of the battery
are completely straight up and down if
you remember Samsung said one of the
reasons their battery failed in the note
7 was because of the curved corners
causing a short between the diodes with
the completely straight sides on this LG
battery that particular fail point
shouldn't be an issue LG did tell me
they have multiple fail safes in place
to ensure the batteries do not
overcharge and overheat which will help
ensure long term battery safety lithium
batteries like this do pack a lot of
energy and power though LG did not give
me permission to perform my next test
but since I have a pair of 20 tweezers
even though the battery clearly says do
not puncture instructions have never
been my strong points
watch closely even though I purposefully
introduced a metal impurity into the
lithium there are no sparks or flames
like we've seen with other phones and as
you saw from the beginning of this video
this battery had almost a full charge
when we started at 81% that's impressive
a little bit of smoke but no sparks our
fire since the battery has been
punctured though I will not be
installing it back inside of the phone I
am at LG so I found a spare and I'll be
using the good unfunctional other board
from the phone Ilan snapped the screen
ribbon the charging port ribbon and the
front-facing camera ribbon each of these
are just like little Legos that unclip
from the board then that SIM card and
removable SD card tray comes out I
should have removed this at the
beginning of the video but I also just
want to point out that this
water-resistant phone has expandable
memory that deserves a thumbs up for
sure flipping over the motherboard we
get our first look at the thermal gel
that lies between the main processor and
the copper heat pipe the processor is
the hottest part of a working cell phone
and there are several things working
together to keep it cool first of all
the frame of the phone is metal and that
processor is located directly in the
center of the phone and since metal is a
good conductor of heat the foam body
itself is working at the heatsink the
bulk of the cooling is done by that
thermal gel and the copper heat pipe
though this is even more effective than
the metal frame the copper is wicking
heat away from the processor and pulling
it towards the edge of the phone away
from the mainboard battery now I've
always been curious as to if these heat
pipe contraptions actually work so I set
up a thermal imaging camera with two LG
g6 phones in front of me the one on the
left with the circle sticker has no heat
pipe inside of it and the other on the
right is a normal LG g6 with a heat pipe
inside and now that we are looking at
the visible fax it's easy to see that
the phone with the heat pipe is
performing much cooler and a cooler
phone means it will last longer and
improve the lifespan of your device a
longer-lasting phone is always a good
thing now I always perform durability
tests on my cell phones and while this
is indeed an official LG g6 it's still a
pre-production device so I'm going to
wait and test the actual retail version
I could still analyze this device though
this bottom corner has the
water-resistant screen that helps keep
water out of the phone
LG hasn't failed one of my durability
tests yet so I'm pretty confident in
their structural integrity there is a
lot of metal inside this device up here
at the top we find our headphone jack
with its gold contact pads the corners
of this phone are pretty thick and the
antenna lines for signal strength can
also be used to absorb the impact of
corner drops since plastic is more
malleable than the middle I don't want
to pick on Apple too much right now but
this Android phone has a headphone jack
removable memory wireless charging
water-resistant and a screen the size of
Texas it's like comparing a Swiss Army
knife to some fingernail clippers there
are two cameras inside of this LG g6 the
main camera has the optical image
stabilization which means that the
camera physically moves around inside of
the phone like a gimbal to stabilize
your pictures and video the wide-angle
camera lens is solid it's only the main
camera that has the OIS on it I'll just
snap these components back into place
like little Legos and then I'll move on
to the charging port this little
component has both the USBC charging
port on it and the microphone you can
see the adhesive on the microphone
stretches as I pulled away from the
metal frame this adhesive is part of the
waterproofing the charging port has a
yellow rubber ring around the tip that
helps keep water outside of the phone
now the average person is never going to
attempt any of this but it's still
interesting to see how all of these
components are assembled the front
screen also has adhesive all around the
edge I was able to push up on the glass
from underneath the frame to start a gap
and then slide my pry tool all along the
edge to cut through the adhesive I
noticed the corners of the LCD aren't
actually corners they are round it this
is interesting because it eliminates one
of the most fragile parts of the LCD the
corner hopefully this small change will
help keep the LCD itself from cracking
underneath the glass layer if it's ever
dropped it's also interesting to note
that the metal frame is shaped like an
i-beam the same structural shape is used
to add strength to the metal beams
inside of skyscrapers assembling the
phone is easy enough just pop the LCD
back into the slot a new LCD would come
with additional adhesive but I'm just
going to reuse the old one after the LCD
is in place I can get the charging port
back in the motherboard is tucked
underneath the ribbon cables then I can
snap everything back into place like
little Legos including the new battery
the back black plastic clicks in as well
and the 11 Phillips head screws holds it
all in place huge thank you to LG
letting me borrow their phone for a few
minutes I'm looking forward to using
this phone in real life all of the
behind the scenes for this video we post
