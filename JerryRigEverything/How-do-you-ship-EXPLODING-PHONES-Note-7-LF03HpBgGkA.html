seven devices and at this stage in the
game about 96% of them have been
returned that's what they said two days
ago anyway but how do you ship exploding
phones and is it safe let's find out
it's crazy that 96% of people have
returned their note 7 that part is
impressive it's crazy that 4% of people
have not returned their note 7 they're
walking around with a phone that could
hurt them and there's even a fine if you
fly on an airline in the United States
with a note 7 of a hundred and eighty
thousand dollars I can think of a couple
more things that I would rather be
spending that money on so this is the
box that Samsung sends you when it's
time to return your note 7 and in the
box there's this little note right here
and I think it's cool that they say that
safety is our highest priority we
realize that we did not meet the
standards of excellence that you expect
and deserve with the note 7 for that we
sincerely apologize that's really cool
they also go on to explain a little bit
about what's inside of the box and I'm
going to show you that right now so
inside of this first box we have box
number 1 and inside of that box we have
a couple more instructions
these ones are visual we have some tape
to seal the box after we're done we have
a plastic bag to put the note 7 in
before we put it in the box and we have
these gloves and why would we have
rubber gloves when we ship a note 7
because of this white stuff right here
so there's white stuff which is what
we're going to be testing in a second is
called ceramic paper normally ceramic is
resistant to heat to about a thousand to
1,600 degrees Celsius so it should stand
up to normal flames inside this white
coated box we have one more box and
inside of this box we have probably
guess it one more box so it's kind of
like the Russian doll of boxes here or a
box inception this is the last box and
this is where your actual note 7 goes if
you take you know 7 put it in this bag
put this bag in the box close that put
it in this box
and put those boxes in this box and this
is the box that we're actually
interested in with a ceramic paper isn't
so this box was made by a company called
Americus here in the United States it's
got a couple of warnings on there for
the shipping because this is the actual
box that goes to the carrier for it they
can't fly in any airlines it's only
ground shipping America does make an
even bigger box that can hold up to nine
phones at a time and this is what you
know the retailer's get like t-mobile
and Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T the ones who are
sending it back to Samsung in bulk and
it also has the same type of ceramic
paper around the inside it just has more
compartments for cell phones but this is
the box you'd get if you're a civilian
so if you remember from my galaxy note 7
explosion video the one I manually
exploded it lasted the flame lasted for
about 30 seconds or so so we're going to
see if this box can handle 30 seconds
worth of flame
so right now there's a direct flame
right on top of the ceramic paper and
it's turning black but it's not starting
on fire which is which is good when
you're shipping exploding phone
right now the hottest thing in this box
is my thumb from holding this lighter
I would successfully say that this box
can withstand a note seven starting on
fire because it's not necessarily an
explosion it's more of just you know
constant flame coming out of the device
there's a little bit of smoke and black
stuff but it's not going to keep on
burning so we've seen what happens with
the boxes that are specifically designed
for the recalled note 7 let's say the
box was accidentally shipped in a
regular like Amazon box like this one if
the phone was shipped in a regular
Amazon box the minute that the phone
starts on fire the box would also start
on fire and this is not super convenient
for the shipper like FedEx or UPS who is
in charge of shipping this thing I think
I've made a very big mistake mob mob so
airlines are not required anymore to
give that spiegel about the note 7s
being illegal to fly with probably cuz
most people have returned their phones
by now and super huge thumbs up to
Samsung for owning up to their mistake
and allowing these phones to be returned
as quickly and safely as possible I'm
pretty impressed with the box that's
been designed to return those notes
Evans did you have a good experience or
a bad experience returning your notes
Evan let me know down in the comments
give this video a thumbs up thanks ton
for watching and I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
