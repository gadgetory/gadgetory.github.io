thermoset on a Jeep Grand Cherokee it's
a is the thermostat part right here
basically all this does is when the
radiator fluid heats up to a certain
temperature this allows the coolant to
go inside the engine so the Komen comes
in here through the radiator radiator
and then this part allows it to pass
through with the the place where it's
stationed is right here I already took
the wire off that goes to the
temperature sensor there's two bolts in
the top one right here and one at the
bottom I'm being kind of lazy I want to
take a part of the whole radiator or
take off the fan valve so I'm just kind
of working around those two things you
can see right there
it's starting to come far so I got those
two bolts I'm done and right inside of
that side of the camera right inside of
that is the thermostat that we're going
to replace so I got to do is take that
out and pop the new one in so I will
show you how to do that alright so I got
this part that's what that looks like
inside and outside you can see the two
bolts and right instead of there's our
thermostat if you go down right here
I have the bucket underneath we're
catching all the radiator flip that's
coming out so now a whole lot comes out
but you know enough you want to catch it
all and then you definitely want to do
this when the engine is cool I just
barely got back from the mechanics wall
to the parts store and yeah this thing
is freaking hot right now for that part
right there just comes right out sorry
about the camera angle there
all right so much for trying to do it
the easy way this little guy fell down
in the bottom bolt sorry on the little
mechanism here that keeps in the
thermostat filled down between my
pulleys so I had to pull off everything
anyway so so much for the being lazy far
but it's better now because you can kind
of see you know where the thermostat
goes if you just take the thermostat
this is the old one just kind of chilled
right there has a little groove usually
that kind of guides in where it sits and
you can use that just depends on what
type of thermostat you have so just a
quick run-through how to get to this
point if you do need to take off
everything the fan sits on this you
unscrew the four fan bolts the fan comes
off and then you pull out the plastic
shroud this guy with the fan at the same
time and then there's a little metal
pulley looks like this that sits on
those four bolts and pull that off well
you actually have to loosen up the
steering pump pulley first I do that as
there's two bolts down there in the back
of you loosen up they'll take them out
I'll just loosen them up and loosen up
this one right here and then there's one
right down there at the bottom that you
unscrew to just let this slide down a
little bit and the whole belt is able to
become loose and you can pull off that
pulley so now gives me a much better
access to this anyway so I'm kind of
glad I did make sure you take a scraper
of some kind I just have a whole paint
scraper laying around and get off the
old gasket on both the motor side and
the other side on here
in kind of see is this kind of cool is
where the temperature sensor is a
temperature sensor goes right inside
there so if you're going to replace that
that's pretty simple as well there's
another temperature sensor on the
backside of the engine and both of those
are important like one goes to your ages
the other controls other things so
okay got everything back in place got
the hoses all snap back on all just
about itself to finish off this guy yeah
I'll see how it runs I'd usually put up
a couple videos every week so don't
forget to like if this helped you and go
ahead and subscribe as well thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
