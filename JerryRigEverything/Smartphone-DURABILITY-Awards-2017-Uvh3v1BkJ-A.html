of the phones that were released last year
and pick the most durable and the most repairable.
I don't have any awards to hand out like MKBHD
did.
He made a fantastic video about the 2017 smartphone
awards.
I'll link his video down in the description.
My video is going to focus on durability and
repair-ability.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
Let's start 
with the most repairable smartphone of 2017.
While the vast majority of smartphone manufacturers
are gluing their phones shut, which makes
it pretty hard to repair, with the right YouTube
video to follow, pretty much anything is possible.
I would say that the most repairable smartphone
screen-wise for 2017, has to be the Google
Pixel 2.
Because when you're replacing the screen of
this phone, A) it's the first thing that comes
off, and B)
there's a metal plate underneath the screen,
making the repair pretty fool-proof.
You can't damage any of the fragile electronic
components underneath the screen as you're
pulling it off.
Now, the screen does not usually survive this
process, but if you're replacing the screen
anyway, it doesn't really matter.
There are replacement parts available for
the Google Pixel 2 and they usually cost less
than the insurance deductible.
So the Google Pixel wins the most repairable
smartphone for 2017.
Now, phones break.
Accidents happen.
Cellphones are some of the most abused pieces
of technology on the planet.
And that brings us to all 3 of the iPhones
that were released this year from Apple.
Not only are each of these phones made from
glass, but the back panels are not replaceable
by consumers or by Apple themselves.
It's an incredibly poor design choice.
For a quick example, if I took this LG V30
and popped the glass back off, I could replace
it for about 15 dollars right now.
The glass on the iPhone 8 is not replaceable
â€“ A) the adhesive is permanent, and B) the
camera lens is welded onto the metal frame
beneath the glass, sandwiching the glass together.
Without AppleCare, the glass replacement for
the iPhone 8 is $350.
For the 8 Plus it's $399.
And for the iPhone 10, it's $549 to replace
the back glass panel.
Glass breaks, and so these broken back glass
panels are going to be pretty common with
iPhones.
And if you're out of warranty, or you didn't
buy AppleCare, it's going to be cheaper just
to buy a new phone, which is exactly what
Apple wants you to do.
With Apple throttling all of their older phones
and making their new phones impossible to
repair, it's their way of motivating you to
buy new products.
Pretty annoying in my opinion, but if you're
into that kind of thing, that's what makes
the iPhones of this year the least repairable
phones of 2017.
Like I mentioned earlier, most of the smartphone
manufacturers this year have released glass
backed phones, which makes my choice for most
durable smartphone for 2017 pretty difficult
since glass is glass.
Glass is fragile.
And as any drop test on YouTube can testify
- glass breaks, sometimes from very short
drops.
My choice for the most durable smartphone
of 2017 is a metal phone coming from Nokia.
The Nokia 6.
This was the most rigid phone I probably have
ever tested on my channel, and I've tested
a lot of phones.
A metal phone is much less likely to crack
in general than a glass phone.
Some of you might be asking, but wait, Jerry,
the Pixel 2 was not a glass phone.
Why isn't is the most durable smartphone of
the year?
For two reasons: 1) the Pixel 2 did have a
crack right next to that power button.
And the Pixel 2XL is still made out of the
same material that the Pixel 2 is.
It has that soft, thick exterior coating on
the surface that can scrape away or discolor
from the jeans that you're wearing.
Definitely not a durable material.
The runners up for the most durable smartphone
of the year though, are glass phones.
The LG V30, the Galaxy Note 8, and the Galaxy
S8 basically all have the same style of construction,
very rigid, but have that glass panel on the
back.
Each of these glass panels...$15 for the LG
V30, and about $20 for the Note 8...are replaceable
fairly easily, in about 15 minutes.
So while they might not be extremely durable
to start off with, at least they can be repaired,
and repaired for pretty cheap, making that
back glass panel pretty much a nonissue.
Apple could have done the same, but they want
you to buy more phones.
I have this place called a Shelf of Shame
where phones go that couldn't pass my durability
test.
There were only a few phones this year.
I think manufacturers are getting better with
time.
I hope my videos have something to do with
that.
The Honor 6X was one of the few phones that
did not pass my durability tests this year,
along with the BlackBerry KeyOne.
During the bend test, the screen on the BlackBerry
KeyOne popped off, which isn't a characteristic
that most of you are looking for in a smartphone.
I'll talk more about the BlackBerry KeyOne
in a second and why it didn't win the least
durable smartphone of this year.
The HTC U11 is the weakest smartphone of 2017.
For one, it's glass on both sides and during
the bend test the screen was obliterated.
And this happened for two reasons: 1) HTC
added that new squeeze feature to this phone,
where the frame of the phone is a button basically
when you squeeze it.
This also makes the frame of the phone more
flexible.
The second problem is the glass of the screen
is in direct contact with the flexible metal
of the phone.
So any flex or drop transfers the impact directly
into the glass.
And as we learned earlier, glass is glass,
and glass is fragile.
It's a little disappointing because on some
of HTC's other phones, they put a plastic
layer in-between the glass and the metal,
which kind of absorbs any impacts, drops or
bends, and keeps the energy from transferring
from the metal layer to the glass.
It's a much better design, HTC just didn't
do that with the U11, making it the weakest
smartphone of 2017.
But it's not bad news if you own one of these
phones, a simple case would solve all of those
issues.
It's just something to look out for.
The more you know, the more you can protect
against it.
That brings us to the most improved smartphone
of 2017.
And that is the BlackBerry KeyOne.
Now, I was pretty excited when this phone
came out, but during my durability test, the
screen of this phone popped completely out
of the frame.
I've never seen that happen before.
It's definitely not normal.
It turns out many other people were having
the same issue with their BlackBerry KeyOnes,
but BlackBerry, after my video, was very quick
in rectifying the situation, going as far
as to modify their design, actually gluing
the screen in, and fixing it for all of their
customers.
Huge thumbs up to BlackBerry for acknowledging
and rectifying the situation, and taking care
of the people who had purchased these phones.
After BlackBerry fixed their design flaw,
I can 100% recommend the KeyOne as a durable
phone in 2017.
The most innovative phone of 2017 was hard
to decide.
It was kind of a toss up between the Razer
Phone 120 hertz display, or the Essential
Phone using ceramic back panels and titanium
sides in their build, that's impressive, or
HTC with their sapphire display U Ultra.
None of which have headphone jacks, but you
win some and you lose some.
I had to go with the HTC U Ultra creating
a sapphire panel as big as the screen on this
phone is incredibly impressive.
Not many companies can do that, in fact, some
companies claiming to use sapphire are using
a version not as pure as the one HTC used
on their screen.
I have a set of Mohs hardness picks that differentiate
between the different materials.
We have plastic screens like the one on this
Moto Z2 Force, that usually scratches around
a level 3.
And the vast majority of all of these phones
are using tempered glass on their screens,
which scratch at a level 6, with a deeper
groove at a level 7.
But this HTC U Ultra sapphire edition has
a much harder material, completely different
than glass, that scratches at a level 8 on
Mohs scale of hardness, making the screen
resistant to scratches from pretty much anything
but diamonds.
Sapphire is incredibly hard to create.
Apple hasn't even gotten it right yet.
So I'm very impressed with HTC.
If you're looking for a durable phone on the
cheaper end of the spectrum, I would recommend
the OnePlus 5T.
It has that same bezel-less aesthetic display
that we've been seeing in 2017 with most of
the flagships, but the price point is way
lower.
If you want something even cheaper than the
OnePlus 5T, go with anything in the Nokia
lineup.
Even the cheapest phone in Nokia's lineup,
the Nokia 2, passed my durability test.
It'll be interesting to see what Nokia comes
up with this year.
When I'm picking a smartphone for my personal
use, I want something that's functional that
has features.
I don't need a headphone jack every day, but
when I do need a headphone jack, I want a
headphone jack.
So I pick a phone that has one.
I found myself using the Galaxy S8 Plus more
than any other phone this year.
Yeah, it's glass on both sides, but I always
have a case on my phone, so the durability
is much less of an issue.
A case is pretty important.
It will protect your phone against the vast
majority of damage that can happen.
We've definitely covered a lot of information
in this video, and I appreciate you hanging
around till the end, and watching art class
with Jerry, and taking a look at all of the
clear phones that I've been making throughout
the year.
2017 has been a blast and I'm super excited
for what 2018 has to offer.
There are plenty of new phones to get inside
of.
Give me a thumbs up if you're glad that my
phones have been tested so that your phone
can be protected.
Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you
around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
