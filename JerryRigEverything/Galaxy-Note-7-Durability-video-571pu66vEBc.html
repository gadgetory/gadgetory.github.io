Samsung note 7 Samsung decided to
straight up skip the no.6
to catch its Note series of phones up to
the s7 and s7 edge line up it's good to
keep things organized and now they all
have similar names I test cell phone
durability so you know what to expect
before you spend almost $1000 on a
pocket computer most phones survive my
durability test but I've also had a few
catastrophic failures that I stick on my
shelf of shame I'm an Android guy and I
carry around the Galaxy s7 edge as my
daily driver so I've been looking
forward to the note 7 for a while now
and I'm very interested in its new more
shatter resistant Gorilla Glass 5 screen
I have a set of pics that tell me how
hard or scratch about the front glass is
on Mohs scale of hardness most of the 30
smartphones that I've tested so far on
my youtube channel don't scratch until
level 6 I usually take it to a level 7
just for kicks and giggles but on this
phone I was around the level 5 pic and I
noticed something different and after
holding the phone up you can see that
this phone starts scratching at a level
3 while this Gorilla Glass 5 might be
more shatter resistant than the Gorilla
Glass 4 it is only one step above
plastic on the hardness scale if you do
not have a screen protector on your note
7 you will start seeing scratches on
your screen very soon after your
purchase remember I'm not here to
degrade Gorilla Glass or the note 7 I'm
here to help the consumer protect their
devices for the long term if you know
what to look out for you can protect
against it and this phone simply is not
a scratch resistant as its predecessors
like the note 5 or the Galaxy s7 or even
the iPhone I tried wiping off the
scratch marks but even the level 3 mark
is permanent just for reference I took
the level 5 pick that didn't scratch the
galaxy s7 edge and held them
side-by-side remember the note 7 is
going to be more shadow resistant and
this is awesome just get a tempered
glass screen protector and you can have
the best of both worlds scratch
resistance and shatter resistance so
let's move on the front camera and the
iris scanner are both under the same
front glass so they're still better
protected than the HTC m9 s front
plastic camera lens I scratched the home
button to check the durability of the
fingerprint scanner most cell phone
fingerprint scanners will still function
after being
we scratched the LG g5 kept working the
Nexus 5x the Exxon seven even the Moto Z
kept working
but after heavily scratching the note
seven scanner it spazzes out and never
functions again so try to keep your scan
or scratch free the home button
functionality is fine
only the scanner portion is out of
commission to correct this in the future
Samsung should start using a glass
button like the 1 + 3 or on the iPhones
besides the phone are made of pure metal
which is good it definitely has a
premium metal feel to it even the
buttons are made of metal and it will
definitely last longer than if they were
made of plastic premium materials are
always a good thing the 12 megapixel
rear camera lens is made of glass not
many smartphones have a plastic camera
lens but sometimes manufacturers will
try to slip one through like with the
BlackBerry Prive plastic can be
optically clear but glass will hold up
better against scratches and general
wear and tear much longer professional
cameras use glass for a reason the
single colored LED flash is under
plastic but that protective layer isn't
quite as important the s-pen pops out
easy enough it is lightweight and you
can see that the shaft is made of
plastic and the top portion is plastic
as well covered in a plastic Chrome the
button is made of metal though so that's
interesting before we burn the phone and
bend it I did a quick test with my level
5 pic on the back glass and it scratched
there as well onto the burn test the
note 7 has a quad HD Super AMOLED
display and like the galaxy s7 it does
burn this phone lasted eight seconds
before the pixels started turning white
it pales in comparison to the Moto Z's
50 second perseverance but let's be
honest flame isn't going to be something
that normal people have an issue with
it's just an interesting comparison one
thing that is awesomely impressive with
Samsung and their Galaxy series is how
strong the phone is when it comes to
bending this Galaxy Note 7 is a tank
even when I flex the phone from the
front and the rear there are no kinks or
permanent damage anywhere even with this
large size while I definitely don't
recommend or endorse sitting on your
phone this one can probably handle it
you can check out my shelf of shame
playlist for a few phones that couldn't
in summary I'm pretty impressed with
Samsung they've done a lot of things
right with this phone the major
complaint I have is with the scratch
resistance of the screen while it's nice
to have the extra confidence that come
with the shadow resistance it's
unfortunate that we have to lose three
levels of hardness when compared with
Gorilla Glass 4 but even a simple cheap
screen protector will take care of that
if you haven't subscribed yet it is
completely free and you'll be notified
when I upload my future tear downs and
durability tests I review tech from the
inside bonus points for following my
behind the scenes stuff on Instagram and
Twitter thanks for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
