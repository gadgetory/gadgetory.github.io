got the cable and the two little
mounting screws down at the bottom so
the wiring harness comes with these
little adapters right here that help
plug in the lights to the harness itself
sticking it in the circle end of the
plug clamping it down with pliers and
that'll make it easier to plug into the
harness when it's underneath the car I'm
going to push this bolt through the
bottom of it when you flip over the
light fixture it's just going to wrap up
underneath like this and that bolt is
going to sit inside of there and it's
not going to turn when you put the nut
on the bottom of it because the edges of
that groove are going to hold it steady
and you can take the two nuts in there
line those up with these two grooves in
the side of this bracket then you can
position it and angle the light however
you want alright looking at the wiring
harness can be a little bit intimidating
at first you can see we have the main
relay right here with these two
connections and it's just kind of ease
off and two separate legs it's actually
pretty simple so I'm explain what's
going on so this is the main part of the
wiring harness you have a fuse in there
that kind of regulates how much
electricity gets to the light and then
these two connections right here the
black and the red they're what's going
to go to your battery terminals black
goes on the negative R it goes on the
positive and will work with the black
leg first it just goes to the lights
themselves you have these two black and
white cables they're going to go to one
of the lights and that's going to go to
the other LED light on the other side of
the bumper so this particular wiring
harness has two legs when you're
installing two lights now the other leg
that comes away from the relay is this
white leg and it's for the switch so
what happens here is the switch itself
obviously you click it on and click it
off the black wire is just going to go
to a ground so basically any screw
that's attached to the frame just stick
it in there and screw it down onto the
frame and then the red one needs to go
to the battery itself without a good
ground and without that being on the
battery the switch isn't going to work
in the whole wiring harness isn't going
to work so keep that in mind everything
for this project you'll be able to
find in the video description below this
wiring harness the lights everything so
check out the video description below
for the parts what's sweet about these
connections that I just installed is
that these clear rubber parts go inside
the blue plastic and it's a pretty much
a watertight connection already I'm
probably gonna put electrical tape
around it anyway just to be double sure
but they fit pretty snugly black to
black white to red so I have dry wired
everything together it looks like
everything's working now that I know
everything works I'm going to go ahead
and mount it to the car itself and
organize the wires I'm going to stick
the LED light right here in this little
hole a little fit perfect right in there
I'm going to bolt it right down through
the plastic here there's a little metal
bar right behind it that'll also get a
little more stability this bumper is
pretty solid so I bet if I went straight
through the plastic as well it'd be just
fine so the bolt that goes down through
the lamp into the bumper has a 13
millimeter bolt I'm also going to take a
locking washer and metal plate and stick
it on the bottom as well to give it more
stability inside of the bumper it's down
inside there though so I'm not I don't
have a good camera angle so I'm going to
skip that part in the video and it has
the two screws in the back holding it to
this metal plate and that will allow it
to just up and down somehow you have to
get this inside of the cab of your car
so you can turn the lights on and off
from the inside now every car is a
little bit different but this particular
car has the little hole right there
inside of the firewall where some other
wires are going through so I'm just
going to have to maneuver my way through
this plastic sheath and get my
controller inside of the car if you get
super desperate and you can't find a
little hole through the firewall you can
always drill one but that's a little bit
dangerous as well so the plastic
connector was a little too big so what I
ended up doing was feeding the black and
the red wires through cutting the white
wire and splicing it back together again
once I fed it through the backside so
that little white plastic connectors on
the other side of the firewall so I have
it all wired up now I'm gonna explain
really quick so you got the from the
switch got the wires coming through the
firewall this is that ground I was
talking about earlier there's just a
screw on the frame that was already
grounded to something else
the ground in with that if your lights
are dim or they're not functioning
correctly it might be because the ground
is not good enough so make sure there's
a clean ground anywhere on the metal
frame of the car you might need to
scrape away some of the black paint to
make it a better connection then with
the battery I had the two red cables
that go to the battery the one black
cable that goes from the negative to the
relay and then I found a pre-drilled
hole in the frame that I just had an
extra bolt and just stuck the relay
screwed it in and then you have the
other two lines coming down here one
goes to that light and the other one
comes to this light right here which I
am going to install right now now I just
need to organize the wires make sure
they're not ever going to touch anything
hot inside the car and we're good to go
and there she is installed I'll do some
nice shots so you can see what kind of
distance the lights through the camera
isn't doing justice to the LEDs but you
can see that they go straight forward
and then kind of up into the trees as
well so it gives you more of a kind of
like a bright effect and then here's the
brights on with the car as well so
between the LEDs and the brights the
LEDs definitely go farther but the
camera's not showing the depth
perception and that is it you have any
questions be sure to leave them in the
