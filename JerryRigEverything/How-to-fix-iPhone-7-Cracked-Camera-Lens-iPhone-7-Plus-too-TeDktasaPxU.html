replace a cracked camera lens on an
iPhone 7 and 7 plus the process is the
same for both phone models and you don't
even have to open up your phone only
attempt this project if you're cracked
camera lens is keeping you from using
your camera several things can go wrong
during this repair which I'll explain as
I go and you really don't want to risk
anything unless you have nothing left to
lose now we have that out of the way
let's get started I am using a bonafide
hardware glass camera lens replacement
for this project I will link these down
in the video description
they are pretty inexpensive and you can
find them on amazon bonafide hardware
sells two versions of this lens one with
the frame that is way harder to install
and this glass only version which is
what we're going to use today it is
incredibly small but it is precision cut
for the iPhone 7 now we start one of the
hardest parts of this project removing
the old cracked glass feet is going to
be your best friend during this process
if you have hair you can use a blow
dryer as for me I'm going to use a heat
gun I'll warm up the lens until it's
just barely too hot to touch with my
finger as you're pulling the glass
chunks out from the little circle make
sure nothing falls into the camera
itself the camera that you see
underneath this broken lens is very
fragile in more ways than one first it
can scratch very very easily which means
if any of the glass chunks brush up
against the actual camera unit you'll
lose your focus ability also there are
moving parts inside of the camera that
are part of the optical image
stabilization and these moving parts can
get jammed up by glass dust so you want
to keep the inside as free from dust and
glass bits as possible I like to use a
sturdy sharp razor blade to remove the
glass chunks but you can also use a pair
of metal tweezers you'll probably want
to warm up the lens about every 30
seconds or so since it does cool down
pretty fast the adhesive gets tough when
it cools down you can hold the phone
vertically to help keep the glass and
adhesive from falling down inside using
gravity to your advantage you do want to
clean off that entire inner Ridge if
there are any dust or adhesive pressure
points left on that little ledge when
you install the new lens the new glass
will be more prone to breaking you want
that surface as flat as possible now we
have that inner ledge pretty well
cleaned up this looks big on your screen
right now
but in real life it is incredibly small
this is like a repair project for ants
you can see how the camera moves around
inside of the frame this is part of the
mechanical stabilization that I was
talking about earlier
thumbs up for Apple finally implementing
oh is also at this point the camera can
still take clear pictures and focus just
fine even without the glass in place now
to install this lens I'll need some
clear silicone this can be purchased at
literally any hardware store and is dirt
cheap I will link some in the video
description along with the lens this
clear sealant is made for aquariums
sinks tubs and anything that might come
in contact with water so technically
your iPhone 7 will still keep its water
resistance with the new lens installed
but I still recommend avoiding water
either way this adhesive is also rubbery
so it allow the lens to fluctuate with
any temperature changes and not crack
I'm going to take a wooden toothpick and
gently dab some of the rubber sealant
all around the inside shelf of the lens
frame go slow don't let any stray
silicon strands drape like a spiderweb
over the camera unit because it'll be a
nightmare to clean up inside of that
hole go slow and be careful this stuff
doesn't dry very fast so you have plenty
of time to make sure that the silicone
is evenly spread around the edge now the
bonafide hardware lens replacement for
the iPhone 7 has two sides to it
one is glossy and the other side is more
of a matte finish you want the glossy
side facing outwards the camera will
still function if you get the direction
wrong it's just more aesthetically
pleasing if you get the shiny side
facing out I'm going to remove the
plastic cover over the masked side and
then gently set the lens down into the
hole that we cleared and added silicone
to I'll press it into place firmly but
gently keep in mind that it is still
glass as long as there's no glass dust
or bits of heart adhesive under that new
lens it shouldn't crack under any
pressure the bonafide hardware glass is
just as thick as the original if your
lens does not come with the protective
plastic shields just make sure that it's
clean on the underside before you
install it it takes about 45 minutes for
the silicone to get super tacky and a
full 24 hours to fully cure or dry so
hold it in place with your finger for
about a minute or two before wiping off
the excess silicone silicone is very
easy to cleanup when it is wet it just
wipes away unlike super glue which would
be a royal mess make sure the lens is
flat inside of its little frame and try
not to disturb it for at least two hours
or better leave
overnight my focus ability is still
intact after replacing the lens it would
be difficult to tell that the lens was
ever cracked in the first place it's
kind of fun that you can fix the camera
lens on your iPhone 7 with just some
fish tank sealant a toothpick and some
replacement glass speaking of which I
have a spare lens just to show that the
bonafide lenses are indeed real glass
and here is both lenses side by side on
the Left we have the original piece of
Apple iPhone glass and on the right side
is the bonafide hardware glass both of
the same thickness and pretty
inexpensive it might be smart to buy two
lenses just in case something goes wrong
with the install hopefully this video
was helpful you can always find my
behind-the-scenes stuff posted on
Twitter and Instagram
let's see who's still awake and made it
to the end of the video tell me what you
had for breakfast in the comments I had
a bowl of chocolate Cheerios with a
scoop of protein in it which actually
now sounds kind of weird when I say it
out loud I do read all of the comments
even if I can't respond to every single
one of them thanks for watching I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
