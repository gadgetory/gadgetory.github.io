the oil every 7,000 miles depending on
how hard you ride out to do mine every
3,000 that's pretty simple all the parts
for this oil changing it down below in
the video description so go ahead and
click on those are from Amazon you knew
an oil filter and then you also need
message for the oil plug in a 10
millimeter allen wrench sometimes you
can change the oil screen when you do
the oil change this Ducati says and you
do like every three oil changes I'm only
going to video how to do that I'm warm
up the bike first not so that a super
hostile burning but still so that the
oil will be liquid enough to pour out so
there's the oil plug and you kind of see
the oil just draining out of there and
it's about three quarts of oil so just
be prepared prepared for that see that
wire going into the engine right above
my hand and to the right that's where
the temperature sensor and the oil
screen is this is the oil plug and that
is a magnet right there so clean up all
the little metal shavings if you have a
significant amount of shavings I would
recommend to you know changing the
screen right now mine was pretty good
here's the oil filter you can use a
wrench to get that off once again the
oil filters down the video description
they're pretty inexpensive they're a
little bit more oil will pour out when
you're removing the oil filter
also keep in mind that the the oil will
not drain completely out of the bike
unless you tip it upright so tip it up
and let the oil kind of go towards the
drain plug because the drain plug is on
the upper end of the bike which is
interesting anyway before you put the
oil filter in take a little bit of oil
and put it around the seal this will
help that the oil filter will stick
tight and not leak once you have it on
there just like this and then screw it
in tight remember if you are going to
use your wrench don't tighten it as hard
as you can with the wrench because it
will destroy the oil filter with me I
just tighten it in as hard as I can by
my hand that's what's remaining the past
nothing looks out oil filter never comes
off just tighten it as tight as you
possibly can with your hand all right
test to see how much oil is in the bike
mine took exactly three quarts but make
sure the bike is on a level service and
you can tilt the bike towards you so
that it stays straight up and down and
you can see the oil level line between
those two lines
all right
there's once you get all the oil in
there and there's two ways of doing it
one is get the oil in turn on the bike
let it cycle through the oil will go
inside that filter and then recheck the
oil after the bikes been on for about a
minute or two so after the oils done
site then you can also just put the
before you put the oil filter on you can
also just pour some oil inside of that
before you screw it in but you know
either way I usually do mine just fill
it up at the bike run for a second then
recheck it the oil levels after I've
written around a little bit anyway if
you have any questions petroleum in the
