battery in my Apple watch this
particular model is the Sport Edition 38
millimeter but the process will be
similar for all of the Apple watches for
this project I'm going to use a sturdy
pry tool that you can find linked in the
video description you'll see why you
need something sturdy later on in this
video
removing the band's is easy enough just
take the tool press the back buttons and
slide off the band's I will link the
replacement bands in the video
description as well
make sure the device is turned off there
are no external screws for this watch so
the screen itself needs to lift off
using a heat gun I gently heat the watch
up until it's too hot to touch and then
I take my razor blade and slide it
between the metal frame of the watch and
the screen making sure not to go too
deep inside of the device you'll see why
in just a second just stay along the
outer lip of the screen and the metal
frame of the watch and we should be ok
make sure not to put too much pressure
on the screen itself especially with the
higher-end Apple watches using the
sapphire glass sapphire glass is super
brittle and will shatter with too much
pressure in one place as I do this I'm
making sure not to damage the adhesive
so I can reuse it later
now that the screen is a little bit
separated from the device I can take my
plastic pry tool and slide it between
the glass and the metal frame this is a
little bit safer than using a metal
object and now we can get a glimpse into
the inside of the device this little
metal cover over the screen connections
is a super huge pain the latch does not
want to come off a little persuading
down by the little tip towards the
bottom of the watch you can get it to
eventually separate the little screen
ribbon cables underneath the latch can
also be snapped off using the same
plastic pry tool they are very similar
to little LEGO pieces
try not to kink herb in the ribbon
cables too much because they are pretty
fragile so here's the screen for the
Apple watch sport edition the Sport
Edition is made of ion X glass the more
expensive Apple watches have the
sapphire glass which ranks at about a
nine on Mohs scale of hardness ion X
glass sits about a seven or eight on
that scale still very scratch resistant
but not as brittle as sapphire which is
a good quality on a sport watch remember
when I said not to slip your razor into
the watch too far there are a ton of
ribbon cables right there next to the
edge
the screen that can be sliced so watch
out for them if I can find replacement
parts for this watch I will link them in
the video description if there are none
linked in the video description you
might just have to buy another broken or
locked watch and Frankenstein them
together to make one working unit here
is where the durable pry tool comes into
play the batteries glued down to the
back of the watch so you have to pry it
out and unclip it from the watch body it
is a two hundred and five milliamp
battery for reference the Android
SmartWatch the Moto 360 it has a 300
millimeter you can see the taptic motor
here this is what you feel vibrating on
your wrist when you get notifications
and is actually surprisingly strong
instead of a rotating motor like you see
in most smartphones this one pulses back
and forth to get a stronger buzz
clipping the battery back into place is
relatively easy the watch side of the
connector just folds up to allow you to
pinch the battery back onto it then the
whole contraption just folds back into
the watch like some kind of origami
masterpiece clipping the screen ribbons
back down is a lot harder the Lego
connections are itty bitty and you have
to get them just right for it to click
into place I'm going to test the screen
before I put the little metal latch back
on so I don't waste time with that tiny
little thing and the screen works great
so it is time for the latch making sure
to turn it off again before I slip the
metal object back inside the electronic
device it is a nightmare but with just
the right placement and the right amount
of force I can get it to click back into
place again
I personally am just going to use the
same adhesive that was already in the
watch to put back down to screen but you
can always use a strong thin
double-sided tape as well if you're
worried about it coming loose I will
link that in the video description as
well the screen does snap down when you
press it into place so I'm not too
worried about it coming off and it works
the watchbands click back into place as
well and we are set follow my Instagram
if you're bored I promise I keep things
interesting here are a few of my other
teardown videos as well thanks a ton for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
