particular iPhone color variant
intrigued me the most out of Apple's
lineup mostly because it's the only one
that came with its own warning its
surface is equally as hard as other
anodized Apple products however its high
shine may show find micro brigands with
use and then get this Apple actually
suggests using a case to cover it
something I'd never thought I'd see
sohow scratch Abul is the jet-black
iPhone 7 let's find out
the phone is incredibly shiny and smooth
it feels way more like glass than it
does metal the super high-gloss is an
incredible fingerprint magnet leaving
behind almost perfect replicas of my
finger this is a brand new phone it's
never left my desk or been in my pocket
yet but I did subconsciously wipe the
back of the phone off on my shirt as I
often do with my glass Samsung phones
and I noticed this little mark on the
back it must be from a particle of
something left on my shirt it is
incredibly minor but it's there
so now I'll take some everyday objects
and see how the phone finish holds up
let's say you go out to dinner and after
leaving the restaurant you slip a
toothpick in your pocket even with heavy
pressure this toothpick doesn't leave a
mark so we're off to a good start now
let's say that your girlfriend made you
take her to a fancy restaurant and now
all you have left to your name is a
single solitary penny and your iPhone 7
cuddled together in your hipster skinny
jeans here's where we run into multiple
problems the copper penny has left
circles of permanent love all over your
iPhone 7 so you throw the penny away and
get to your moped only to find out that
you are out of gas
and now penniless your date starts to
walk home alone unfortunately your keys
and phone end up in the same pocket as
you chase her leaving physical scars on
your phone almost as deep as the
emotional scars on your ego
now penniless moped lists and
girlfriendless you decide to turn your
life around and get a job as a
construction worker on your first day of
work the iPhone 7 ends up in your tool
bag and get to royally screwed in more
ways than one so now your phone has been
pitted keed screwed and shirts packed
and to make it all worse you
accidentally slip your jet-black iPhone
7 into a purse full of razors
okay so maybe that last part was a bit
of a stretch but at least we learned
that the jet-black iPhone 7 can indeed
easily be scratched by everyday objects
and now you can decide for yourself
whether or not to heat Apple's advice
and get a protective case for your super
shiny phone my Instagram and Twitter are
folded behind-the-scenes stuff on my
channel so head over there if you want
to see more constructive carnage and if
you haven't subscribed yet better do it
quick or you might end up like the guy
in today's story thanks for watching
hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
