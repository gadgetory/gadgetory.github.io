released a video on a durability test of
the BlackBerry key one where the screen
popped off the device two days after I
made that video BlackBerry issued a
statement saying our teams are actively
examining additional adhesive measures
that might further strengthen and
eliminate any possibility of display
separation occurring if a customer does
experience this however they're
encouraged to contact us for a device
warranty replacement I think that's
really cool blackberry to issue a
statement like that so soon after the
issue presented itself my screen wasn't
the only one popping off there was
multiple before I even made my video the
only problem is one month later I was on
Twitter and I noticed that people were
still complaining about their screen
popping off so I asked him what was
going on and BlackBerry replied assuring
me that additional measures are already
in place and rolling out now yesterday I
went on Amazon and purchased another key
one it's been two months since the
original issue and they've had plenty of
time to fix it so let's take a look
inside of this and see what new measures
are in place
before I jump into the boxes let's get a
close-up look at the original screen
that fell off my phone two months ago
normally on any other smartphone there
would be some sticky residue left over
from the adhesive after a screen removal
but on this blackberry key one all the
surfaces are smooth
there's no tackiness to be found not on
the screen nor on the phone body itself
without any adhesive the screen can fall
away from the phone now taking a look at
the retail boxes they are essentially
identical the new box that forgets
yesterday's on the left and the old box
I bought two months ago is on the right
even down here on the sticker the model
numbers are the same
along with identical PRD numbers usually
if a physical change is made to a device
something will be added to the box to
differentiate them like the recalls no
7s and that circular sticker that
Samsung added to the barcodes these
boxes look the same though the phone
itself looks as sleek as ever personally
I like the design I enjoyed having a
physical keyboard while using my old
Blackberry pearl back in the day looking
close at the new screen there is no
visible gap or lift
so if blackberry did add more adhesive
under the display there's no way to tell
physically from outside the phone with
my old key one the screen was weak
enough to pull away from the body with
my fingers but so far with this screen
it's staying in place like it should so
far so good we'll jump right into the
bin test which is a pretty solid
indicator of build quality my hands
placed below the screen should allow it
free access to pop away from the device
if it's going to pop off at all
surprising to me though there is no
screen failure honestly I assume that
BlackBerry's initial response was
corporate coverup and damage control but
it looks like they actually did
something to the screen to hold it in
place better there's only one way to
find out for sure though and that's by
opening up the phone and taking a look
from the inside remember I purchased
this phone myself blackberry has not
contacted me directly outside of that
one response on Twitter when they said
they rolled out some physical updates
now normally to remove the screen of a
phone you would turn it off and use heat
to soften the adhesive making it more
pliable and then separate the display
from the body carefully with some pry
tool I assumed that this would be the
same with the BlackBerry key one but it
is not the adhesive is not softened by
heat it is permanent and my pry tools
obliterated the display underneath the
glass trying to remove it
extreme brute force is now the only way
to remove the screen and the screens not
going to survive this is quickly become
a very expensive project but at least
now we get to see inside the phone we
went from having the screen fall off to
easy to a screen so attached its
unremovable I'm totally fine with that
though since to access the internal
components of the key one like the
battery you'll go in from the back of
the phone and not the front so a
permanent screen on this device is just
fine with me
and a huge thumbs up to blackberry for
stepping up and taking care of their
customers they're still no tackiness
from the adhesive but the new BlackBerry
key one on the bottom has that rough
texture from the extra black glue added
to the display the smooth blackberry key
one at the top is the one that arrived
with no adhesive and the screen fell off
I'm very impressed that blackberry
stepped up and corrected their fatal
design flaw and now that it is fixed I'm
more than happy to remove blackberry q1
and I could fully recommend it as a foam
that will stand the test of time if you
want a phone with a physical keyboard
this is indeed a good option I'll leave
a link in the video description if you
want to check out the current pricing
and follow me on Twitter for future
updates thanks ton for watching and I'll
see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
