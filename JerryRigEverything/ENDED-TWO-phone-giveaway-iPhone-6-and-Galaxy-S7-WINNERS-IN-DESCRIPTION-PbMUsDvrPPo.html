my smartphone tear downs and durability
tests I've kind of amassed a large
collection of smartphones and I think
it's time that I gave some away it's
been a while since I've done a giveaway
so today I'm gonna give away two phones
the iPhone 6 and the galaxy s7 each
phone is gonna have their own contest
for the iPhone 6 in order to win head
over to my Twitter follow me on Twitter
at Zach's jerry-rigged and retweet this
tweet I will pick one random retweet err
and then ship the iPhone out one week
from today that's when the contest will
end this particular iPhone 6 is for
Sprint but you can always turn around
and sell it and get something you really
want the galaxy s7 the rules are a
little bit different head on over to my
Instagram at Zach's jerry-rigged find
this picture and tag two friends in the
comments so follow me on instagram and
tag two friends in the comments I will
pick one person who's tagged both of
their friends and send them this galaxy

teardown video this contest will also
end one week from today I will include
more information down in the video
