scale for finding the relative hardness
of different minerals among other things
it does a great job of showing the
difference between plastic glass pure
sapphire and diamonds for more specific
and precise measurements the scale is
not ideal with real science any
particular test or experiment would be
performed multiple times across multiple
devices eliminating any statistical
outliers but since I pay for all of my
own devices it's not financially
feasible to bulk purchase phones after
my initial scratch test on the note 7 I
did purchase the second no 7 to
double-check my results since they did
seem kind of strange and the second
device scored the same scratching at
level 3 so at that point I felt
confident in publishing my results to
youtube I did not think that my most
picks would be the inconsistent and
incorrect variable when purchasing this
hundred dollar set of most picks they
come extremely sharp since you need a
sharp object in order to perform a
scratch test obviously this particular
kit that you see me opening on screen
right now was purchased after my note 7
scratch test and before the release of
the iPhone 7 it's important to note that
the iPhone 7 screen and camera lens test
were performed with a brand new set of
Mohs picks this new set of picks will be
repeating the scratch test on this note
7 I'm fairly dedicated to reviewing
smartphone durability and I'm equally
dedicated to accurate results during my
tests with this new set of picks and a
new phone the Gorilla Glass 5 scratches
at a level 6 and again at a level 7
these results are perfectly on par with
previously tested smartphones so why was
my previous note 7 scratch test so
drastically different it actually took
quite a while to figure out my
investigation and this update video was
slightly hindered by the worldwide note
7 recall but here's what happened
included with the most kit is a
sharpening stone this is meant to keep
the tip sharp so they can perform
scratch tests but as this stone is used
little fragments of the sharpening stone
become embedded in the pick tip this
stone is made from a combination of
aluminium oxide and silicon carbide both
of which are around an 8 or a 9 on Mohs
scale and since these little fragments
of stone are microscopically stuck in
the tip of three instead of the three
being a three the three becomes an eight
and since a level eight is out
side of the normal glass realm the glass
get scratched this wouldn't be a problem
in the real world of testing rocks and
minerals and concrete hardness but the
contamination is clearly an issue with
glass scratching my picks failed me
during that first test and in turn my
results were skewed the Gorilla Glass 5
definitely does not scratch at a level 3
as I erroneously stated in my previous
video Gorilla Glass 5 is the same
relative hardness as other tempered
glass screens like Gorilla Glass 4 in
the future I will not be sharpening any
of my picks with this stone
I'll just purchase a new most kit when I
need to remember none of my previously
tested phones including the iphone 7 or
the iPhone 7 camera lens were scratched
with contaminated pics this testing
issue only affected the tests on the
note 7 this is my daily note 7 that I
used without any screen protector a case
for about a month just daily riding
around in the pocket of my jeans so
depending on the phone design and what
materials the screen comes in contact
with during everyday use the glass can
still get scratched it is not invincible
also remember that we are looking at
these scratches in perfect light on a
high quality 4k camera so in real life
these micro abrasions aren't as
prominent especially when the screen is
turned on nevertheless a screen
protector is always a good idea the note
7 is literally my favorite phone and my
current daily driver while scratching
may seem like a non-issue compared to
the exploding Fiasco it is still
important to me to have the correct
information to compare with the rest of
my previously tested phones the Gorilla
Glass 5 scratching super early on Mohs
scale is not a problem with the no 7 so
keep that in mind if the phone ever goes
on sale again as my channel has grown in
popularity I have a responsibility to
maintain accuracy especially since I am
the only person on the Internet
systematically testing smartphone
durability as always leave any questions
or comments down below the video and
thank you for watching I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
