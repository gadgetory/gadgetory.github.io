you can fix a cracked cell phone using a
windshield repair kit naturally even
though it was April 1st I was intrigued
and I decided to try it on my own even
if it didn't end up fixing the cell
phone at least I got to learn the basics
of car windshield repair the iPhone 5c
is 100% functional except for the
cracked glass on top of the screen and
the repair kit comes with a glass Risen
and plastic shields that help the resin
cure smoothly over the crack in your
windshield first I'm going to go ahead
and clean the screen off the point of
windshield repair is to get the resin in
between the glass chunks inside the
glass itself and this makes the crack
effectively disappear normally on a car
you would use some suction cups and a
pressure pump to squirt the resin down
into the chip or crack but with a cell
phone the added pressure might crack the
LCD so I tried to V down into the crack
with a little razor blade hoping that
the resin would absorb in once the resin
is applied I can put the plastic curing
strips over the top this helps cure the
glue when placed under sunlight with UV
light from the Sun the glue will dry or
cure within 5 or 10 minutes with this UV
light from my shop it'll only take about
two or three minutes to cure after the
glue is cured you can peel off the
plastic and scrape the hardened resin
off with a razor blade the windshield
resin did not hide the cracks completely
but it did make the cracks much smoother
it also made the phone smell toxic so
that's a plus when holding it up to your
face so it looks like the myth is more
or less busted a windshield repair kit
works well on windshields but not on a
cell phone
one thing I would do differently if I
try to do this again and see if I get
more pressure on the glue to force it
down inside of the crack and help it
hide better either way it was a fun
project I learned something new and
hopefully you did too hit that subscribe
button if you haven't already hope see
you around
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
