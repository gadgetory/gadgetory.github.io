durability testing phones for quite a
long time now
most phones survived my tests but out of
the six phones on my shelf of shame that
didn't survive
kwame owns two of those slots I like you
in phone survived the Huawei's history
makes me a little nervous for just mate
nine let's get started
the phone is a bit bigger than I thought
it would be slightly larger than my
Galaxy s7 edge but one thing I do like
seeing on this phone are the two screws
at the bottom not only is this a bonus
for repair ability but also for
durability
since the screws are physically
attaching that rear panel to the frame
making the phone more structurally
secure Huawei has included a built-in
screen protector on this phone
personally I always have a screen
protector on my daily device so this is
good news and it's a nice gesture but it
does make me wonder if this was included
by Huawei to hide inferior glass the
only way to find out is the scratch test
my set of most picks are used to check
mineral hardness normally smartphone
glass will scratch at a level 6 plastic
screen scratches level 3 and real
sapphire scratches at an eight or a nine
teasing coins normally won't do damage
to a level six screen which is good news
because this mate nine scratches at a
level six these are the same picks that
I use with the honor 6x that scratched a
little four and if you understood what
all those numbers meant you've been
watching my channel for too long and you
should probably go outside the front
camera is protected by the same screen
glass so no worries about that
scratching and the earpiece is made out
of metal with really small holes that
will keep out dirt and rock so it sums
up for that now it's time to find out
what material this phone has really made
up the blade of truth reveals the
wonderful sound of metal on metal which
is one of the premium materials included
in most flagships
one neat little life fact that most
people don't know about is that you can
turn any Android phone into an iPhone in
just a few seconds this might be a
downgrade in some cases but you really
can't even tell a difference if I move
up to the dual camera lenses on this
mate 9 you can see they are covered by
glass and that glass is not scratched by
my razor blade this is good news
the laser focus is off to the right side
of the camera and this is covered by
plastic plastic does scratch but it is
still slightly protected by that raised
lip of the camera lenses so I wouldn't
worry about this too much the flash on
the left side is also plastic but it's
still protected by that same camera lip
as well
and won't ever be rubbing directly on a
desk or flat surface the fingerprint
scanner is pretty easy to stretch it's
not made of glass or ceramic
unfortunately I've had multiple phones
survive heavily scratch fingerprint
scanners like this but this mate 9 is
not one of them
this is still not something to stress
about though and it's not a deal-breaker
the scanner itself is recessed into the
phone so it won't be easily damaged it's
mostly just interesting to see which
phones survive and which ones don't the
sides of the phone are made of metal
it's nice to see that we don't have any
material switching going on that cold
premium metal feeling surrounds all
sides of the phone and even the buttons
are made of metal so choice the only
place that plastic appears is the top
and bottom of that back panel this is
for the antenna to the phone plastic
allows the signal through where metal
would not you can see the color
difference between the shiny silver
metal panel and the gray plastic bar at
the top we'll see if that plastic
affects the build quality in just a
second even though the back of my mate 9
might currently look like an Apple
product most people will realize that
it's not actually an iPhone when they
see that it has useful features like the
headphone jack or the IR blaster that
turns your cell phone into a universal
remote control it's got to be nice
having a phone that actually does stuff
the may 9 does have a 1080p IPS display
though very similar to the real iPhone
and this display lasts 9 seconds under
the intense heat for my lighter before
dying but after the heat is removed the
pixels will turn back on and function
like normal this is mostly just cool to
watch it's time we find out how saw the
phone really is been test check the
structural integrity and build quality
of the device
only six of the 50 phones that I've
tested have catastrophic we failed the
maintenance of Ives the first round of
the bin test you can see the front
screen lift out of the rear panel a bit
but the whole phone is still intact
those screws at the bottom are keeping
the phone together and the back panel is
adding support to the frame they're
working as a team unlike the honor 6x
after my extreme abuse there is some
minor flex to the phone frame but that
can be corrected while the device is
still surviving so this phone passes the
bin test and overall this device gets a
thumbs up for me it'll be fun to see
what it looks like from the inside
during my teardown video what else would
you like to see me do to these phones
during my durability test let me know in
the comments and hit that subscribe
button if you haven't already turn on
the notifications so you know whether
your next phone is durable or not before
you go out and buy it and share this
video with any mate 9 owners to let them
know they made a good phone buying
decision thanks for watching I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
