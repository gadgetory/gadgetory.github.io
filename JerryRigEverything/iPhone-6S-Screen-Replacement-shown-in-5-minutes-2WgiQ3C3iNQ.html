to replace the screen on the iPhone 6s I
will also have repair videos on how to
change the charging port the battery and
the rear cam run you can find those in
the video description first things first
turn off the phone you can find tools
listed in the video description below I
will link where you can buy those you'll
take your pentalobe screwdriver and take
out the bottom two screws on the phone
and then you'll want to take a suction
cup and lift up on the screen as you
slide a tool between the metal frame and
the screen of the phone there is a thin
layer of adhesive all the way around the
bottom of this phone as well as around
the side so I found it was easier to
take my little plastic pry tool and
separate that adhesive before really
prying up on the screen make sure you
only pry up on the metal frame of the
screen and the metal frame of the phone
if you lift up on the LCD of the screen
you'll end up breaking something there's
a little metal plate here held down by
four screws I will link a PDF chart in
the video description for how to keep
your screws organized it will be very
helpful remove that metal plate and then
detach three ribbon cables this is for
the LCD digitizer and front camera after
those cables are up the screen will
detach from the phone here is the screen
there's a good chance when you buy your
screen it will not come with all of
these goodies attached like the earpiece
and the home button so you'll have to
move them over from your old screen
starting off with the earpiece there's
three screws that hold down that top
piece lift up that metal bracket and
there's a little lasso that reaches down
and surrounds that metal bit on the
screen down there so make sure not to
rip that lasso part off I don't know
what it does but it's probably important
then the earpiece pulls out from
underneath the cables and you can lift
out the proximity sensors from their
little brackets and then this little
gold piece down here as well and that
releases the front camera and all the
sensors that go along with that like the
proximity and the motion sensors I will
link this part down in the video
description as well so here's the screen
of the phone the metal plate is held
down with three screws one screw and
other three screws on the other side and
then one screw down by the home button
so it undo all those screws in the metal
plate will lift off after you remove
this adhesive that's hold
get down to the top of the screen now
the metal plates gone we can remove the
two screws that are holding down the
home button take away that metal bracket
unlatch the home button cable here it's
just like a little Lego you just lift it
up and out and there's a little bit of
adhesive holding down the home button
and holding down the little circuit
board down there for the fingerprint
scanner so I'll do that and then you can
lift that out so there's a good chance
you'll have to remove these plastic bits
as well and transfer those over to your
new screen so pop those out from that
frame be careful not to break them and
here is the screen itself so this is the
part you'll most likely get when you
order I will link these down in the
video description below and it will most
likely come with the home button cable
down at the bottom ready to attach to
your home button if not I'll make
another video on how to replace that
getting the home button put back into
place
most of little ribbon cables have a
little pin that they sit down inside and
that will help you guide where to put
the ribbon cables get the on button put
down into place and the two screws
holding down a little metal bracket then
you can take the back metal plate tape
it down onto the screen and get all of
those screws there's eight of them screw
it in around the back side take your
little plastic bits or installing these
on your new screen now you don't need to
glue them in it's actually dangerous to
use glue or because the glue might get
on the lens itself it's actually pretty
easy to get this ribbon cable
contraption put back into place as well
start with a little gold unit down at
the bottom and then line up these square
pieces up at the top just kind of tuck
them into a little plastic bracket push
them down into place so that they're
flush with the phone and then you can
see little niblet right there on the
earpiece just tuck that down into the
hole you'll feel the little niblet go
down in place here are four little gold
circles that go on to the top of the
earpiece and that's how the earpiece
receives its connection now we're going
to take the metal bracket after the
cameras put down into place and we're
going to reattach the lasso around the
metal piece and then get the three
screws that go on to that bracket tuck
that in and we can plug the screen back
into the motherboard be very very
careful make sure it lines up exactly
over the little Lego connection and then
press it down you'll feel it kind of
snap into place if you look closely in
the high-definition you can see mine
latch down and then before I put the
metal plate on I'm going to fold the
screen down and just see if it works
really
quick now if you have lines through your
screen or if it's just like a white
screen you're going to want to unconnect
the cables and then reconnect them again
and that might fix any screen issues
you're having lucky for me all of my
cables are connected correctly so I'm
going to go ahead and lift up the screen
make sure to turn the screen off before
you lift it up and then set that metal
plate down into place and put the four
screws in they are different sizes so
make sure you have them in the correct
order now the best way to put the screen
down is to make sure the top is lined up
first tuck that into place and then you
can slide your hands down the sides of
the phone and latch it all the way down
make sure to put those two screws down
to the bottom as well hopefully I was
able to help you out if you have any
questions them down in the comments
