the RAM, or the memory, on your MacBook Pro.
The same process can be applied towards any
of the Apple computers though.
RAM stands for Random Access Memory.
To explain it simply, it’s what your computer
uses to remember what you are currently working
on, or what is displayed on your desktop.
Let’s say you’re browsing the internet,
listening to music, maybe watching a movie,
all of that information is stored on the RAM
that’s inside of your laptop.
The less RAM you have, the less your computer
is able to multitask.
The more RAM you have, the more things it’s
able to think about at the same time.
So in this particular MacBook Pro, it’s
a 2011.
There are 4 gigabytes of RAM inside.
I’m going to take out those two memory sticks,
which are these two, and put in two larger
memory sticks.
Each of the new sticks will be 4 gigabytes
a piece.
The awesome thing is that this whole project
would only take about 5 or 10 minutes.
I’m going to link two things down in the
video description below.
One is Apple’s website so you can know exactly
what kind of RAM to buy for your particular
computer.
And the second thing is Amazon.
Amazon is where I like to buy my computer
parts.
You’re more than welcome to buy anywhere
you want, but check it out, their prices are
pretty good.
So check down in the video description below
for those two things.
Remember, you take all responsibility for
opening up your computer.
Attempt this project at your own risk.
So here you can see on the computer itself
how much memory I have.
That total is 4 gigabytes and I’m almost
using all of it.
There are 10 screws along the back side of
the computer.
And make sure the computer is 100 percent
off when you’re doing this, otherwise you’ll
mess something up.
Pop that back off after you get rid of the
screws.
And then the RAM is sitting right here.
Just lift out those two little tabs and the
RAM will pop up and you can just wiggle it
out of its slot.
And then pull the second pair of tabs and
pull out the other RAM stick.
Make sure to tap the edge of the computer
once before doing this to dissipate any static
electricity that’s built up on your body
before touching the sensitive electronics.
Then you can grab one of the RAM sticks and
put it down in the slot and press it into
place.
And make sure the RAM only fits in one direction.
So make sure that groove next to the gold
pins is in the right spot.
Push down the second stick and you are set.
Screw down the back metal plate using those
10 screws.
Then you can see right here, now I have 8
gigabytes of RAM and I have a whole lot more
memory free, which leaves so much more room
for activities.
Thanks a ton for watching.
