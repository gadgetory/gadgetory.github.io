looking phones so far here in 2017 HTC
has been pushing the boundaries a bit
with this phone with new features like
ip67 water resistance dual stereo
speakers and something new called edge
sense where you can interact with your
phone fifthly by squeezing it I'll try
that feature out here in a second I'm
here to test the durability of this
brilliant black version of view 11 I
tested the previous HTC u ultra a few
months ago and while it passed my test
and it's technically still alive it's
not going to win any durability Awards
the special sapphire Edition though was
pretty impressive it uses real sapphire
crystals in the display making it
essentially scratch proof HTC has done
some pretty cool stuff lately let's see
what happens to this you 11
when setting the brilliant black HTC u11
next to my midnight black Galaxy s8 both
of them look pretty fantastic you can
clearly see the coin reflecting in each
of the back panels the psychedelic
colors achieved with HTC's optical
spectrum hybrid deposition we've no one
questioning what phone you are holding
it is incredibly unique and eye catching
so let's start with the scratch test my
most picks allow us to see what the
screen is made out of HTC is advertising
Gorilla Glass 5 so we shouldn't see any
marks below a level 6 pick HTC has
proven that it's capable of producing
sapphire screens like on the HTC u ultra
that I showed earlier sapphire wouldn't
scratch till level 8 and even though
sapphire isn't being used here on the u
11 hopefully we get to see more of the
Sapphire in the future as expected the U
11 scored a respectable level 6 on a
scratch test right up there with the
iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S 8 keys and
coins will have no effect on the glass
but pockets and and other common
minerals will still scratch it so a
screen protector is never a bad idea the
fingerprint touch pad has the same
glossy feel at the screen does it is
definitely scratch Abul it is slightly
recessed below the glass so this level
of scratching would never happen during
normal use but it's still good to know
that even with excessive damage the
fingerprint scanner can still sense and
read my finger every single time the
earpiece is also recessed way below the
front glass it has the same fabric
material that HTC has used in the past
and while it won't fall out on its own
be careful not to damage it if you ever
have to clean it out unless you want one
of these strands tickling the inside of
your ear for the next ever normally I
prefer having a metal grille for the
earpiece the front camera is hidden
below the Gorilla Glass 5 so it is very
well protected against scratching the
last time HTC used a plastic camera lens
was on the HTC 9 that I tested a few
years ago there is no plastic on the
rear camera lens so it's always good the
flash is still plastic Samsung managed
to tuck their flash onto the glass panel
which I think looks and feels a little
bit better but a plastic flash is not a
big issue there is a metal lip around
the camera lens so hopefully that will
keep it scratch free far into the future
and now the side
pure metal the volume button is also
metal and the easy to find in your
pocket textured power button is also
metal up here by the sin tray and the
pink car tray is metal but there is no
headphone jack which is disappointing
one good thing to know is that the
Bigsby button doesn't exist here either
down at the bottom we have one of the
two loudspeakers and the USB charging
port one feature along the sides that is
completely unique to this phone and no
other device is the ability to squeeze
the phone and have something happen
we're going to find out if it still
works after all my scratching apparently
the squeeze feature can be set to work
with any function or app so I'm going to
try this with the audible app I kind of
wish Samsung's dedicated Bigsby button
was programmable like this one it would
make it more useful with just a few
clicks I had the edge sense linked up to
my audible app and now any time that I
squeeze the phone like a magic wand
audible will pop up while we're on the
subject of magic audible has every
single Harry Potter book in its library
and I can get you a free book and a free
month of audible if you head to my link
in the description audible.com slash
jerry-rigged all lowercase and sign up
for the free trial it's way easy if you
already have an Amazon account which
most people do you get to keep the free
book even if you don't continue the
subscription so it's a win-win either
way audible works with any phone Android
iPhone iPad and even works for all three
of you Windows Phone users out there if
Harry Potter isn't your thing audible
literally has an unmatched selection of
audio books to choose from audible also
has something called whisper sync which
can have the book read itself to you on
your phone or computer and you won't
lose your spot when you switch between
devices it doesn't get much more magical
than that I grew up with the Harry
Potter series as it was being released
so it'll always be one of my favorites
and I'm glad I get to offer you a free
copy the Burgess lasted only eight
seconds before the pixels went black and
turned off the 5.5 inch LCD display did
completely recover though and now the
bin tests you 11 almost have the same
basic build and design a view ultra with
one fatal difference when applying
pressure from the back the flexible and
squeezable metal frame allows the device
to bend more than it should and that
becomes a real problem when it flexes
from the front
and it's dead this means that the HTC
u11 will join its friends on my shelf of
shame the back glass appears to be
totally fine the back glass is resting
on top of the frame so it's adding no
structural support and was not under any
stress during the Flex the front glass
however is shattered along with the LCD
right below it and since my channel is
all about cell phone durability and
repair ability let's analyze and figure
out why this phone didn't survive
personally I enjoy it way more when
phones survive my test so I'm glad that
most phones do when the u ultra visited
my channel a few months ago it survived
the bin test this is because the U ultra
uses a flat glass panel on the screen
inside of a plastic frame the U 11
implemented a new 3d curved glass screen
that is more rigid and also left off the
plastic buffer between the glass and the
metal so when pressure is applied to the
phone
there is no err for the stress to go and
the glass shatters this would not be a
problem if the U 11 had a more rigid
frame Samsung had a rigid frame and
curved glass and that phone survives
just fine but the combination of curved
glass and a flexible frame is a disaster
in an accident or drop which does happen
to everyone the glass and the LCD of the
U 11 will fail before the frame does
rendering the phone inoperable as you
see here curved glass is much less
flexible than flat glass a rigid case
would solve this issue but since the
phone is designed to be squeezed you
would lose the squeeze function if you
keep this phone in your front pocket
you'll probably find just don't sit down
with it in your back pocket or you might
have glass stuck in unimaginable places
if you really want a durable HTC phone
go with last year's HTC 10 that was my
overall top pick for the most durable
phone of 2016 I really do think it's
awesome that HTC is pushing the limits
of design and creativity with u xi but
on a structural and durability level I'm
giving this one a fail the flexi frame
and the no headphone jack is a step
backwards in my opinion but let me know
what you think in the comments would you
take a beautiful design over durability
and some loss of functionality it's a
tough decision I will be performing a
teardown on this thing I want to see
what kind of pressure sensors I can find
inside the frame and since the back
panel is still intact I'll also try to
make a transparent the phone may be dead
but the autopsy should be interesting
don't forget to grab your free book from
audible I'll have the link down in the
description and thanks for watching I'll
see you around
