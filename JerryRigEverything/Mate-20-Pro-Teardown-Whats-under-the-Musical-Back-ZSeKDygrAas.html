musical phone the huawei mate 20 Pro
also the winner of mkbhd s blind
smartphone camera test the mate 20 Pro
is a powerful triple camera flagship
that's not even sold in the United
States today we're gonna be taking apart
this beast of a phone and reviewing it
from the inside it's packed with quite a
few unique little quirks let's get
started while we cause this back panel
hyper optical and it has a special
textured musical glass and a pretty
vibrant psychedelic color scheme that
stands out quite a bit
you can always stealth mode the phone
with AD brand skin which sticks to the
textured glass panel just fine so if you
need a little less vibrancy in your life
or just a more professional-looking
design that mate 20 pro might not be
coming to the US but the brand ships
internationally and includes free
shipping to India with orders over
$20.00 check out the D brand link in the
description thanks addy brand for
sponsoring this teardown
let's get inside did you remember for my
durability test the tolerance between
the glass and the metal frame is super
tight and that's true for even the back
panel using quite a bit of heat it was
still really hard to get my razor blade
to slip between the metal and the glass
the super-strong ip68 adhesive
underneath didn't help much either
eventually I was able to use my suction
cup and metal pry tools to completely
separate the back panel from the phone
revealing the rather aesthetic insides
of the may 20 pro a clear version of
this phone would be pretty phenomenal
metals covering all the inside camera
units and the thick copper wires are
also musical and can receive and emit
wireless charging super impressive there
are eight screws surrounding the top
metal plate I'll keep these organized as
I set them off to the side tool kits in
the description there is one little
ribbon cable attached to the camera LED
that needs to be unplugged then the
whole wireless charger is free it has
some little gold contact pads on the
back that allow the power to flow to and
from the internal battery for wireless
charging speaking of which I'll unplug
that battery along with the four other
ribbon connections down on the bottom
row the mother
they all unclip like a little Lego the
top of the motherboard has another row
of four Lego style ribbon connectors
once those are released the whole board
can pull away from the phone body
revealing some of that bubblegum style
goopy thermal paste the May 20 pro uses
the metal frame of the phone as a
heatsink
there's no copper heat pipes one of the
major selling points of the May 20 pro
is the triple camera setup on the back
it has the full menagerie of wide-angle
telephoto zoom and normal camera lenses
all of which are located in a single
combined metal housing only one of which
though has optical image stabilization
the 8 megapixel telephoto camera is the
only camera that compensates for
shakiness the 20 megapixel ultra wide
and 40 megapixel mainland's have no
physical stabilization the top earpiece
is pretty unique it has one little screw
holding it in place the interesting part
is that the bulk of the speaker is
placed far below the small grill
location which is actually a good thing
bigger speakers allow for better sound
and Huawei is just utilizing that extra
space below the grill one thing that
most smart phones don't come with these
days is an IR blaster literally just a
remote control built into your
smartphone it's got an infrared LED
built directly onto the motherboard this
shines through the opaque plastic circle
on top of the phone to communicate with
your TV VCR or DVD player let's make our
way down to the bottom of the phone
another seven screws holding everything
in place down here I'll pull out the
unfortunate proprietary Huawei nano
memory card tray then I can pull the
bottom loudspeaker up and away from the
phone the fascinating thing about this
speaker is that it emits sound directly
out of the USBC charging port literally
injecting its sound out through the
watertight mesh into the charging port
canal itself which is fine in theory but
what happens when you want to charge
your phone and listen to music the
charging port literally plugs your
speaker up and makes it sound like music
is playing out of a tin can plus there's
no headphone jack the may 20 pro is all
kinds of musically stupid except for the
back panel of course
the world's smallest coin style vibrator
motor is over here on the left let's
take out the battery there are some gold
colored pull tabs over here on the left
but I don't read Chinese I'm not really
sure what they're for I do know number
one and two make four lousy pull tabs
it's the middle number three that's the
only worthwhile pull and the removal
isn't too bad the huawei mate 20 Pro is
using a massive 4200 milliamp hour
battery can't complain about that the
next cool thing to look at is the under
screen fingerprint scanner remember this
little guy stopped working after my
screen cracked during the durability
test so let's see why it's a fairly
large rectangle hidden under the display
now that the battery is removed and
light can shine through you can see the
outline of the rectangular fingerprint
scanner hidden under the screen itself
it cannot be pulled out or removed like
on the oneplus 60s in screen fingerprint
scanner so the technology is definitely
different with the two phones and in
this particular case the mate xx Pro is
much more fragile and less resilient to
damage oneplus wins this round I'll put
the battery back in over the fingerprint
scanner overall it's not a bad phone to
take apart yeah the back glass is tight
but other than that once I'm inside most
everything in the phone like the battery
charging port and speakers can be
replaced with minimal effort I'll make
sure all the Lagos Style ribbon cables
up top are lifted up and out of the way
before sliding the motherboard into
place below them and then clipping them
all down into place
the bottom ribbon cable highway gets the
same treatment with the battery ribbon
always getting plugged in last the LED
flash is plugged in and the whole back
panel and wireless charging pad can flop
over on top of the motherboard and
battery with its eight screws up top
holding everything tight I'll slip our
musical back panel over top of the
components and press it down and get a
little drumroll going before turning on
that thing I'm always a little nervous
about this part especially when there is
a million people watching but luckily
for me everything still turns on and we
have yet another successful teardown
yeah the screen cracked during the
durability test but technically it's
still alive would you buy this phone or
is the funky loudspeaker with no
headphone jack situation weird enough to
turn you away let me know down in the
comments hit that subscribe button if
you haven't already and thanks a ton for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
