the most anticipated and requested
budget phone of this year we should poke
around on the inside for a second with
massive specs and a super cheap price
point it's easy to see why it's so
popular let's get started getting inside
the polka phone f1 is pretty simple
there is no waterproofing gluing
everything together it just has the two
T three screws down at the bottom and a
screen that pops out of the back panel
like the older iPhones used to do the
screens pretty tightly situated inside
that back housing though which is why we
didn't see the screen pop out of the
housing during the bin test it's tight
after removing the SD card tray I was
able to eventually detach the 1080p
display and Hardware away from the back
panel as it detaches we get our first
look inside the poco phone with the
fingerprint scanner ribbon attached to
the inside of the polycarbonate back
plastic panel I'll switch my screwdriver
bit to a normal Phillips head which I'll
link below and remove the ten screws
holding the black plastics above the
motherboard once those plastics are
removed we get a glimpse at what looks
like a complex smorgasbord of connectors
but it's actually pretty simple I'll
unplug the battery first so there's not
any power running through the phone
while we continue to operate then we'll
get the fingerprint scanner and snaps
like a little Lego and set the entire
back panel off to the side there's no
making this one clear since everything's
plastic but at least we got an art class
with Jerry out of it a quick disconnect
of the side buttons and black signal
wire connector and the extension ribbon
for the charging port leaves us with two
silver screws holding in the motherboard
I'll keep these separate from the other
12 screws we've already removed and then
the screen ribbon cable gets unplugged
the whole motherboard can now be pulled
out of the phone body exposing the tip
of shammies f1 liquid cooling system a
copper heat pipe with a dollop of
thermal paste on top which helps to
transfer the heat away from the
processor keeping things running more
efficiently we'll find the other end of
the copper pipe in a second first the
motherboard appears pretty interesting
we have the front facing 20 megapixel
camera with an infrared illuminator next
to it that works in tandem with the
infrared camera for the face unlock
feature there are two rear cameras
facing the opposite direction each with
their own individual Lego style
connector and both cameras are situated
in the same metal housing lined up
perfectly
so they can assist each other with photo
detail while taking pictures
the main 12 megapixel sensor does have
some movement to the lens but it's
probably just for focusing as the poco
phone does not include optical image
stabilization on either of the rear
cameras which is a little disappointing
but it is still a budget phone the last
thing I want to point out is that inside
this phone there are water damage
indicators on every single surface
including both sides of the motherboard
they are currently white but turn pink
if your phone is around water or even
steam from the pool or the shower so
keep it dry and away from moisture this
massive advertised four thousand
milliamp hour battery has the same
capacity as the thousand dollar note 9
and over double the capacity of an
iPhone 8 thankfully it does come with
its own pull tab and manageable adhesive
the battery has a rated capacity of 3900
milliamp hours and a peak of 4,000 now
the batteries out we finally get a
closer look at the other end of the
copper heat pipe this time around it
doesn't include a large copper plate
like we saw in the Samsung Note 9 but it
looks to be about the same length I'd
compare the two side-by-side but I kind
of chopped the note 9 pipe into bits
either way in the poco phone f1 the
copper heat pipe conductive ly pulls
heat away from the processor ended a
slightly cooler area underneath the
battery Xiaomi calls this a liquid
cooling system with industry-leading
thermal performance boiling down the big
words it really just means it's a copper
heatsink with less than a drop of water
inside a vacuum-sealed pipe if I pop
open the pipe quick enough you can see
the water evaporate out of the vacuum
into the air
these little fibers inside the pipe help
with the water to and from the heat
exactly like we saw in the galaxy note 9
it's definitely a cool system and
especially awesome to see inside of a
budget phone like this poco phone f1
definitely deserves a thumbs up for that
I like seeing that the competition and
the budget realm drives bigger
innovations with the major flagships
I'll just you know close this back up
perfect let's see what kind of vibrator
were working with seven screws hold the
black plastics over the charging port
daughterboard
including two sweet looking blue screws
never seen that before
the plastics pop off including the
loudspeaker along with its two golden
contact pads still zero signs of
waterproofing I'll remove the black
signal wire and you can see another big
white water damage indicator right next
to the charging port hole the red stuff
underneath leads through the white
portion when it's wet the charging port
board has some adhesive holding it to
the frame there is no rubber ring around
the charging port itself so once again
this thing has no protection against
liquid whatsoever
the circular vibrator is in the bottom
right corner and he's a tiny little guy
overall I'm super impressed with
shammies new poco home project I haven't
always been a fan of shammies build
quality since they do have a few phones
on my shelf of shame but they've taken a
huge step in the right direction with
this durable yet extremely powerful
budget phone
I'll get the two silver screws back into
the top of the motherboard I always have
my fingers crossed when it's time to see
if these phones still work after a
teardown I'll make sure everything's
plugged in including the fingerprint
scanner and the battery before putting
the black plastic plate with its ten
screws back into place finally I'll
pinch the two halves of the poco phone
back together and this phone is a winner
hit that subscribe button I have a lot
of fun videos on the way
would you consider buying this poco
phone what's your next phone going to be
thanks ton for watching and I'll see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
