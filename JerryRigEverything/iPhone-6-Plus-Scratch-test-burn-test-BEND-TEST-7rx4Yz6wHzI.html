test on the iPhone six-plus these are
the same type of practical durability
tests that you've seen in some of my
other videos tests that can relate to
everyday life first off we'll see how
the back of the phone holds up against
sharp objects now common sense dictates
that if you scratch your phone with
something sharp it'll leave a mark and
this is indeed the truth with the iPhone
6 plus the redeeming quality though is
that if the object is not sharp like
keys or coins the marks can just be
rubbed off as you can see here I can
just take my finger and rub off the soft
marks from the keys that I was
scratching the phone with and they
disappear entirely as long as your phone
stays away from sharp objects you'll be
just fine a surprising number of people
have watched my iPhone 6 camera lens
replacement video so let's find out why
the camera lens is actually made of
sapphire glass which is incredibly
scratch resistant you can see that my
razor blade leaves absolutely no mark on
the lens due to the extreme hardness of
the lens though it leaves the circle of
glass extremely brittle and I can
imagine that this is why so many people
are looking into the camera lens
replacements it can handle sharp objects
just fine but the brittleness can't
handle a hard drop replacing the glass
lens though is actually pretty easy you
can check out that video if you're
interested now the glass screen of the
iPhone 6 plus was rather disappointing
the razor blade left some pretty hefty
marks on the glass whether the blade is
actually carving into the ion
strengthened glass or just the
oleophobic coating it's hard to know for
sure but either way there are marks on
the screen and they don't rub off this
is a sad day for Apple fans now the burn
test not entirely practical but still
fun to watch iPhones have an IPS LCD
display which does an awesome job of
displaying colors while the Super AMOLED
Samsung screens might be more vibrant I
feel like the iPhones IPS display are
more true to life either way they both
stand up to heat about the same the
extreme heat from the lighter pretty
much turns off the pixels until they
cool down enough to turn back on pretty
much unaffected you can see this same
effect with the Samsung's AMOLED screens
as well as with the HTC and LG screens I
have videos where I burn all of these
phones hit that subscribe button if
you've liked what you've seen so far now
onto the bin
after the initial bending with my hands
you can tell there is a slight curve to
the body of the phone this is not
surprising and is pretty much old news
with the whole bendgate Fiasco what is
surprising to me is how much pressure it
took to get it to bend this much when I
applied the same amount of pressure to
the HTC m9 which is HTC's most recent
phone it folded in half so in reality
the iPhone 6 plus is holding up much
better than I expected the minor initial
Bend could be straightened out pretty
easily but I'm not here to play
pattycake with the iPhone though so
let's keep going after a lot more
pressure I finally got the screen to
break the discoloration in the screen is
most likely from the LCD ribbon cables
ripping up along the top of the phone it
looks like the weakest points on the
device are right where the buttons and
the SIM card slots are along the edge
you can see a nice little crease from
the bottom of the volume button all the
way over to the SIM card itself so if
Apple wants to strengthen their phones
in the future they should probably focus
on these points well there you have it
the iPhone 6 plus durability video feel
free to check out some of my other
durability videos that I've done with
all of the latest phones let me know
what you think down in the comments what
phone would you buy thank you for
subscribing hope see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
