Huawei this year is really making some waves
with its new periscope camera.
While not available for sale in the USA, it's
quite possibly one of the best phones on the
market so far this year.
It's definitely not cheap though.
Huawei is calling this color Breathing Crystal.
Personally, I think it looks more like a Unicorn
Sneeze with it's pearly pinkish blue coloring.
It's time to see if the P30 Pro is durable.
Let's get started.
[Intro]
Right off the bat, the phone feels and looks
pretty sleek - on par with other 2019 flagships.
It does have one tear drop notch up at the
top.
And while the back is unique, I'm struggling
to decide if it reminds me more of a soft,
cloudless morning sunrise, or Will Smith in
the new Aladdin.
Maybe by the end of the video we'll get used
to it.
The main selling point of the P30 Pro is the
quad camera set up on the back, but we'll
get to that in just a second.
Let's start with the scratch test.
Smartphone screens can be made from a few
different materials, not immediately discernible
to the naked eye.
Plastic scratches at a level 3.
Glass scratches at a level 6.
And sapphire scratches at a level 8 or 9.
Diamonds are the only thing that can scratch
at a level 10.
It looks like Huawei is falling in the footsteps
of all recent flagships and using tempered
glass on their screen, where we can see scratches
at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level
7.
One thing that Huawei does really well is
cameras.
The front facing camera on the P30 Pro is
a 32 megapixel beast, and pulls off some really
good pictures.
You might be feeling like something is missing
up here at the top of the phone, and that's
because the P30 Pro has no earpiece.
It's taken a pages from the LG G8 and gotten
rid of the physical earpiece speaker.
It uses vibrations on the acoustic display
to project sounds into your ear.
I'll show you what that looks like from the
inside if this cupcake frosting colored phone
survives the durability test.
The sides are made from metal, which is what
we would expect from a flagship this expensive.
The power button has its usual red painted
inlay.
The paint can be scraped off.
The aluminum sides have a subtle blue shine
to them.
You can see it better up here at the top...which
is also made from metal.
The top has an infrared LED for changing channels
and volume on TVs.
Pretty cool feature.
The other side is also made from metal.
No buttons or anything over here.
No headphone jack can be found when we turn
the phone over to the bottom.
The paint job is crazy on this thing.
There is a USB-C port down here that can do
40 watts supercharging, along with a loudspeaker
grill and SIM card tray – all made from
metal.
Huawei does include a clear case in the box
which is nice of them.
Inside the SIM card tray we see that the P30
Pro does have expandable memory, but only
with that proprietary nano memory card slot,
which is basically the same thing as not having
expandable memory.
It does have a red rubber ring around the
opening to help keep water out.
The P30 Pro is ip68 water resistant.
Underneath this scratch resistant glass panel
is a wireless charging coil that can do the
same power share thing that the Huawei Mate
20 Pro started, and Samsung also implemented
with the Galaxy S10.
It can charge up other wirelessly enabled
gadgets just by resting them up against the
back baby blue panel.
The main selling point though isn't the wireless
charging or Smurf colored glass, it's the
quad camera setup.
With the top 20 megapixel ultra wide camera
and 40 megapixel main camera there in the
center, followed by a square camera lens that
I'm most intrigued by.
A telephoto with 5 times optical zoom that
can be bumped up to a 50 times digital zoom.
Accurately described by MKBHD as creepy.
The only way to truly appreciate unique hardware
is from the inside with a teardown.
So be sure to subscribe to see that component
taken apart.
Hopefully we get to see the reflective mirrors
and off-center periscope pathway that Huawei
is using to achieve the 5 times optical zoom.
There is a 3D time-of-flight camera here as
well.
I'm excited to see this implemented more often.
Eventually it's going to be great for virtual
reality.
3D scanning and printing, and digitally measuring
objects.
If you're not a fan of the My Little Pony
vibe of the P30 Pro, there's always more sleek
and aggressive options over at dbrand.
This is what it looks like with the Swarm
skin installed.
Quite a bit more modern and professional than
Blue's Clues over here.
I'll leave a link in the description so you
can dbrand your own phone.
Skins can also be as temporary as you want,
so no judgments if you ever decide to switch
back to something that looks kind of like
a Pokemon.
Okay, just kidding.
I'll stop.
I'll just 'let it go.'
The Breathing Crystal colored P30 Pro has
a 6.47 inch 1080p OLED display.
And when hot flame's applied for scientific
purposes, I assure you you're just going to
have to trust me on this one.
This is tremendously scientific.
While I'm sciencing with the flame, it lasts
about 22 seconds before the pixels start to
go white and never recover.
The screen did briefly stop responding to
my touch after the heat was removed, which
would have been pretty embarrassing for Huawei.
But after a brief turn off and turn back on
again, it started working again just fine.
The P30 Pro does have an under display optical
fingerprint scanner.
I'll quickly set up my fingerprint and then
scratch the surface with the deeper grooves
of a level 7 pick, just to make sure the basic
functionality of the phone can handle years
worth of abuse and scratches.
Even with the damaged fingerprint area, it
still scans and reads my thumb just fine.
The last of my standardized durability tests
is the bend test.
This quickly shows whether there are any structural
build quality issues with the P30 Pro.
Huawei's P20 Pro from last year cracked during
the bend test, which was unfortunate.
This P30 Pro seems to be more structural and
rigid in design.
That 3D curved glass edge makes this version
much more solid and won't allow the glass
to flex and crack like last year's phone.
The curved glass does make the phone more
prone to damage during drops, but structurally
the P30 Pro is much more solid.
So good job, Huawei.
The P30 Pro passes the bend test.
Would you want to rock a phone that looks
like cotton candy?
Let me know what you think of Huawei's new
color scheme down in the comments.
I'll be leaving the dbrand link down in the
description if you ever want to spice up your
current phone.
And come hang out with me on Instagram and
Twitter.
Thanks a ton for watching.
I'll see you around.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
