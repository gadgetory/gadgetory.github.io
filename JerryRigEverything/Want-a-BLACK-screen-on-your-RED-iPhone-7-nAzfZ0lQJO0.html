7 this goes hand-in-hand with their
product redline that donates a portion
of the profits to AIDS and HIV program
with the hopes that eventually we will
have an aids-free generation charity is
always a good thing especially from one
of the largest businesses in the world
when you buy the product read iPhone it
comes to white screen and while that
does look pretty darn good I think a
black combination would look even more
dope let's give it a try I turn the
phone completely off and then remove the
bottom two silver pentalobe screws while
I don't recommend attempting this
project yourself since it is pretty
difficult I will be linking all the
tools and replacement parts that you
might need in the video description as
we know the iPhone is water resistant
which means there is a thin band of
adhesive running around the edge onto
the screen I'm going to use a heat gun
to one of the glass until it's just
barely too hot to touch then I'll use a
large suction cup to lift up the edge of
the screen enough to slip my thin metal
pry tool between the plastic edge of the
screen and the blood-red metal body of
the phone now this part is kind of
tricky is where most people will damage
their displays there are some very
fragile ribbon cables along that right
side of the phone so as you are cutting
through the adhesive it's important to
keep the tool from penetrating too deep
inside of the phone and slicing that
important stuff
you also can't lift the bottom edge of
the screen very high or I'll put stress
on the ribbons as well you'll see what
I'm talking about in just a second the
screen comes away from the device by
pulling down ever so slightly on the
display to release the top clip and then
the whole thing folds open like a little
book a very good-looking red book I
think the inside of this thing looks
better than the outside the anodized red
color coating is all throughout the
device and not just the exterior I'm
definitely a fan so the nice step I'll
switch to my white triple-zero bit since
Apple likes to use weird screws inside
of their phones there are four screws
holding down the metal plate over the
battery connector fingerprint connector
and LCD ribbon connector I'll set that
off to the side next to the screws to
help keep them organized now we need a
Phillips head double zero screwdriver
for the top screws next to the earpiece
and front camera if you think it's weird
that Apple has three separate screw
types inside of their phone you're not
alone I think it's pretty strange as
well after the two screws on the top
bracket are off I can unclip the front
camera and the earpiece ribbon
and the screen is free from the iPhone
body now depending on where you get your
screen from there might be a few more
steps if you buy the replacement screen
link in the video description you'll
have to transfer over your earpiece back
metal plate and home button to your new
screen I show that in my iPhone 7 screen
replacement video for the sake of time
though for this video I'll be using a
screen and a home button that I pulled
off a fully functioning matte black
iPhone 7 it's already got all the
components attached to it so it's a
direct swap and slightly easier i'll
start by plugging in the ribbon cables
from the black screen there are two down
by the battery and then one more up at
the top each of them will clip in like a
little Lego make sure to plug the
battery cable in very last it's safer
that way the two metal plates go over
the top of little connections and then
the six screws hold everything tight
remember each screw is different so keep
them organized and put them back in the
same hole that came from
the phone will fold shut just like a
very expensive book and then the top
edge of the screen gets tucked up into
place before the rest of the display
clicks down I'm going to use the black
screws that I pulled from my other black
iPhone 7 for a cleaner look replacement
screws are also pretty easy to find I'll
link some below the video as well and
it's time to turn our ultra good looking
one-of-a-kind cell phone on and here's
where we run into the first problem
Apple has a thing where if you ever need
to fix or replace your home button they
just kill the functionality of it all
together it's incredibly frustrating
from a repair perspective but that's a
story for a different day apple claims
it's for security reasons which is valid
but there are other ways to protect your
device besides killing functionality the
last warning that popped up was to tell
me that I have to use the on screen home
button now instead of the physical
button and that's kind of annoying while
I love the look of the all black on red
I'm not about to lose functionality
solely for aesthetics it's time to
reinstall the original home button the
white one the iPhones and their home
buttons are paired at birth and remain
together for the entire duration of
their lives like some kind of weird
National Geographic documentary instead
of a cell phone to remove a home button
there are four screws and then the home
button unsticks from the plastic frame
and drops out from the front of the
phone then I'll have to do is tuck the
white home button back up into place on
the black screen and then use the same
screws to hold it in and that's it to
the home button it's still definitely
white but this time it's functional and
there are no error messages now one way
around this would be to take the
mainboard from the black iPhone and blow
but into the red frame that way the
black home button would remain paired
together with the black screen but I
would recommend against that because the
more components you remove from the
phone the higher chance you have of
something breaking and going wrong and
it never working again when you put it
back together I might compare this
project to Legos during the video but
it's slightly higher risk than that the
simplest solution is to just get a small
black skin and put it over the white
home button incredibly inexpensive and
at least the skin isn't covering the
whole display now I don't have any skins
at the moment but I know a guy who does
I'm going to send this phone over to
mkbhd to let him work his magic on that
home button the phone is his to keep or
give away totally up to him what color
combination do you think looks best do
you like the white screen or do you
think Apple should have made a black and
red iPhone variant let me know in the
comments luckily I was able to grab two
of these red phones I'll be testing the
scratch resistance of the new color in
my next video so if you haven't
subscribed now it'd be a good time my
Twitter followers got the inside look at
this phone as it was happening so follow
me over there to stay ahead of the curve
and thanks for watching I'll see you
around
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
