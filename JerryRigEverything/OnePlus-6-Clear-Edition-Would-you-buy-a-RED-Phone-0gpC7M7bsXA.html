fan of the super reflective mirror black
coloring I kind of want to take a closer
look at the design and you know clarify
some things let's get started in the
past back with the 1 plus 1 and the 1
plus 2 1 plus had their iconic red
battery inside the phone for us all to
enjoy during the teardown it was
visually impressive to the few of us who
ever opened up their phone but then they
stopped I'm going to use a lot of heat
to soften the adhesive under the back
mirror black glass so we can see if the
1 plus has a recent change of heart and
put some red back into the interior
design I'll use a suction cup to slip in
my thin metal pry tool and start slicing
through the adhesive under the glass and
then I'll use the instruction booklet to
help keep the adhesive from reott
hearing to the frame after it's cut
I guess instructions do come in handy
every now and then I should also say at
this point that opening up your phone or
doing any mods voids all the warranties
on every single level and oneplus won't
be able to help you if something goes
wrong so maybe don't try this at home it
is harder than it looks
finally with all the adhesive cut away
we get our first glimpse of the battery
and it's not read don't worry I think I
can still fix this the fingerprint
scanner and plugs under this metal latch
which has a nice red rubber accent which
looks cool and I'll unclip it with my
red pry tool which also looks cool but
I'm unplugging a non red battery and
it's just not as cool the green pool tab
is convenient for easy battery removal
how do you like that design I'll do the
full teardown review of the oneplus 6 in
another video though I thought we bring
back the red battery on our own I asked
Dee brand for a solution and they came
to the rescue with some extra red phone
skin material this video isn't sponsored
at all tweeting Dee brand is a lot like
asking out a girl you either get a yes
or brutally rejected publicly either way
somehow they both still end up with all
your money I peeled off the adhesive
backing on the skin and lined it up with
the top edge of the battery without thin
and flexible this material is I doubt
it'll put any stress or add any heat to
the battery itself I'll flatten it out
and chop off some of the excess along
the edges and fold it over so we have
the bold red battery from the past never
settle right
I'll get the battery all situated back
up in the foam body and funny enough
oneplus actually includes stickers in
the box with they're translucent rubber
case I'm not sure if I like the big
white sticker in the middle but I'll
leave it on for a second while we assess
our options before anyone can truly
enjoy the interior design of the one
plus six we have to make the glass clear
I'll use a little heat to soften the
adhesive holding the fingerprint scanner
in place then I can pull that off along
with the dual camera lens frame and the
LED flash diffuser the rest of the
process is pretty simple
oneplus has added a thin layer of film
onto the glass to give us some sense of
depth and reflection once I get the peel
started with my razor blade I can pull
it away in big chunks or even a glass
pretty clean underneath there are subtle
curves along the glass side so I'm
taking special care not to put any
pressure on those glass is glass after
all getting an up close to look at the
underside of the film there's almost
some hints of deep blue mixed in with
the black and that's probably what helps
out with that depth effect luckily I was
able to get the rest of the black layer
of reflective black film to pull off all
at once which was strangely satisfying
this is the sound of the phone losing
all of its manufacturer warranties the
oneplus logo and bottom text remained on
the glass which i think is pretty cool
the logo said to ride over top of our
newly red battery and I feel like the
white sticker now is rather distracting
so I'll just pull that off and stick it
on something else later a little bit of
glass cleaner to get rid of any
fingerprints and then I can stick the
camera lens back on along with the flash
diffuser and finally the fingerprint
scanner with its super long ribbon cable
a little bit of double-sided tape around
the edges to pout best once I set the
glass into place there's definitely no
water resistance anymore but you win
some and you lose some I'll plug in the
fingerprint scanner and latch it down
with this tiny metal tab in red rubber
accents and then the phone and the glass
gets safely sandwich back together and
in my opinion this just might be the
best looking clear phone I've ever made
bold and beautiful the red and black
combined with the high-tech internals of
the oneplus 6 just looks pretty good
tossing on the included case from
one-plus turned it more translucent kind
of like HTC's u11 but I'm sure there's
other cases out there that are more
transparent you can choose from those as
well I'm the type of guy who always has
a case on my phone
for this one I might make an exception
it deserves to be shown off everything
turns on and works like normal what do
you think of this clear color option we
can call it the 1 plus 6 subtracted
addition because you know we just you
know subtracted the color I think it's a
good idea my Twitter followers got a
sneak peek of the phone before this
video went live so come hang out with me
over there to join in the fun and thanks
a ton for watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
