Huawei phones on my channel and most
have survived the durability test even
if only barely Huawei has never been a
contender for the most durable cell
phone award in fact the Nexus 6p was one
of the very first phones on my shelf of
shame back in 2015
interestingly enough it's smashed
sideways in the box like a jukebox coin
slot now that it's out it's time to see
how this newcomer holds up I'll be
announcing a phone giveaway at the end
of this video so stick around let's get
started the back glass of this phone is
absolutely incredible the reflections
are not uniform which gives off an
extremely psychedelic 3d kind of vibe if
you're the type of person who rolls
around without a protective skin or case
this phone is going to turn some heads
it's heavy too which I really like and
the glass has a cold quality premium
feel to it speaking of glass it's time
for the scratch test as always my most
picks tell me where the hardness of the
screen falls plastic scratches at a3
glass scratches at a 5 or a 6 and real
sapphire will scratch at an 8 or a 9 on
their website Huawei advertises that the
glass is a thick piece of 2.5 D glass
which means that it has a slight curve
along the edge most smartphones scratch
at level 6
but this foam scratches at a level 5
this phone is using Gorilla Glass 3
which is definitely an older version of
the glass that might not have the same
hardness properties as Gorilla Glass 4
or 5 the set of most pics I am using
have never been sharpened so there is
zero chance of contamination on the tips
and this set has been used on previous
phones as well so any contamination
would have manifest itself before now
one further test against contamination
is using my razor blade on the front
glass my razor which should be about a
level five or five-and-a-half on Mohs
scale can damage the glass as you can
see in this video which means that the
glass is softer than a level 6 slightly
softer glass on a smartphone screen is
not a deal-breaker
it is a relatively small problem that
can be easily fixed by simply installing
a screen protector the earpiece of this
phone is metal which is infinitely more
durable than the earpiece stickers we
saw on the BlackBerry D Tech 50 or the
strange cloth speaker we saw covering
the Google pixel so thumbs up to wall
way for using metal now the back glass
of the phone is interest
ding apparently the glass is made up of
15 different layers which makes it
incredibly trippy to look at light is
being reflected in directions that seem
to disobey the laws of physics
I tried scratching with my level 5 pick
and nothing happened only my level 6
pick would leave a mark so there's less
to worry about here on the back as far
as scratching is concerned this is
really good news for the duel 12
megapixel camera lens is up at the top
since they are also protected by this
same piece of glass my razor blade is
unable to leave any marks on the flush
surface the rear fingerprint scanner on
the other hand feels more like a smooth
rubber coated plastic it doesn't scratch
as easy as the galaxy s7 fingerprint
scanner but it can still be scratched
unlike the ceramic home button on the me
mix even though the fingerprint scanner
has been heavily abused it still
functions at 100% there is some kind of
metaphor for life in there somewhere I'm
sure but either way my fingerprint gets
read every single time I try and that's
a good thing the sides of the phone have
a refreshing metal-on-metal sound to
them even the power button and volume
rocker are made of metal we can meander
down to the USBC charging port and the
headphone jack and we find even more
cold hard metal premium materials do
cover every single surface on this phone
let's take a look at the screen fire
gives us the answer as to what type of
screen it is an LCD display will turn
black and then completely recover where
an AMOLED screen will turn white and
usually not recover from flame so this
screen is obviously in LCD similar to
what the iPhone has the owner eight
lasted about 11 seconds before going
black and then recovering if you haven't
subscribed yet make sure you do it's
time for the bin test and you would
think that since the phone is made
entirely out of thick glass and metal
that it would be super rigid but it does
have a little bit of a flex to it if
you've watched any of my other videos I
do not go easy on anyone and now this
phone has a slight S shape to it even
when bent back from the other direction
it flexes a bit but it still does not
snap in half it's not quite the same
rigidness of a samsung phone but this
glass and metal Huawei device is also
about half the price and it's still
definitely not ever going to snap in
half like the older Nexus 6p after
bending it I was able to straighten it
out completely and look it's like
nothing ever happened
overall I am very impressed with this
phone price and everything even the
color is super awesome I'd love to see
all the colors side-by-side thank you so
much for watching I do really appreciate
it and because this phone did so well on
the durability test I will be giving
away a brand new phone not this one
a brand new phone in the gleam link
right below this video it's a link that
you can click on and it makes sure that
you're following me on Twitter and
Instagram and subscribe to you're on
YouTube each one of those things get you
an entry into the giveaway so you have
three chances of winning the contest is
international and it will end one week
from today and remember that it's
completely random so telling me that
your cat has cancer will not improve
your chances of winning thanks for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
