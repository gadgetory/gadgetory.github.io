this guy with its two ports in here and
we have got light the keyboard issue is
fixed but now we also need to plug in a
mouse and some more peripherals but I
think I got it figured out because this
guy has an extra USB port of which I can
plug in my mouse into so I'll get right
back to you guys
so yeah this works but I have got a
better idea because this mouse is
Wireless so let's try to find the
wireless part which is yeah it's right
here
simple enough and let's just plug it
into this instead we have made the mouse
wireless the wireless puck is plugged
into the keyboard works perfectly fine
and now we have got two spare USB ports
and I'm gonna use those for that bad boy
which is the focusrite scarlett 2i2 USB
interface and also a music instrument or
well a MIDI keyboard this guy so this is
gonna turn out awesome but of course I
don't find the cables for these two
devices so I'm gonna have to search
around all of this mess for some of
those cables I'll be right back
alright guys if I don't find one of
those cables in here or about two of
those cables in here I will have to go
and purchase them instead so let's pray
that those are in here and if not then I
will take you guys to a bus ride to the
city
all right you guys I'm now back home
back home from store the store in the
city and I got myself two of those
cables needed which is a USB type B
cable I basically needed one cable for
the Focusrite Scarlett want and one
cable for my MIDI keyboard so let's
start off by plugging in the Focusrite
Scarlett right now so the folks at
Scarlett's gonna be right here I think
maybe like down here at the bottom yeah
that's it and then plug this guy back up
here in the monitor it that is now
working with these headphones let's
place them a little bit to the side
maybe and put this down like DS like a
song looking nice now all we need is a
keyboard and then we are pretty much
done alright guys so the project is kind
of now complete the full video will come
up in a couple of weeks as I said on
Instagram but to give this video a
little bit more meaning I'll go through
each and every part of this setup for
the USB interface we have a scarlett 2i2
from from focus right up top we have the
Samsung fast charge wireless charger and
connected to the desk scarlett 2i2 we
have the audio technica ath m50x s and
the rode nt1-a microphone which is on a
boom arm the keyboard is a Corsair
strafe RGB
the mini keyboard is an the m-audio key
station 49 the main monitor is a Delpy
24 16 d the mouse is an rog spatha
wireless mouse which is going to be
charged here boom that's now charging
and the laptop is of course the awesome
Seon based laptop it's a Dell Precision
55 10 with 16 gigs of ram a cm processor
a 4k touchscreen and 512 gigs of SSD
storage and the NVIDIA M 1000 M graphics
card so that is the full ultimate set up
