Tecna now and today we are going to be
talking about the LG v10 and five of its
most unique and cool features the v10 is
the Frankenstein of mobile phones just
like having the tech ninja set because
it has things that no other phone has it
has multiple cameras in the front it has
two screens just a lot of things that
normal phones do not have so which of
these features are the most cool
features well let's take a look so
starting off the list we have the two
front facing cameras on the LG v10 now
why would you want to have to well one
of them is a standard 80 degree lens and
the other one is a crazy 120 degree lens
it's actually pretty close to being a
fisheye lens but there's not too much
distortion so you know having two
cameras in the front it's actually
pretty damn cool so moving on we have
the second screen now this might be very
very weird to hear but yes there's
actually a separate screen right over
the main screen now why the hell would
you need a second screen why can't you
just make one that is bigger right well
this second screen sports a few new
features you can see your most recent
used apps and switch between them you
can see your notifications there so it
doesn't interrupt your main screen and
that's the future that I really like and
when you have the main display off the
second display will keep being on and
show you the time battery percentage and
a few notifications so that's pretty
cool actually but you know it's not a
deal-breaker if a phone does not have
this thing it's just a very cool thing
to have because it's something new and
something that you pretty much don't see
on any other phone on the market right
now another cool feature that is
certainly not new but it's very well
seen upon is the interchangeable battery
and the availability to add a microSD
card
now you guys do not need much
explanation on this we have for sure
seen this before but today it has been
slowly fading away so it is a very cool
thing to see that the LG v10 is doing
this but then again if you don't care
about that it doesn't really matter but
for some people it's still a very cool
thing to have moving along we have an
internal 32 bit DAC is this a gimmick or
just actually make a difference yes it
makes a difference now the speaker on
this phone is actually rubbish it's
nothing compared to the Nexus 6p or
things like that but let's not talk
about the speaker let's talk about the
internal 32 bit DAC that can power your
headphones so how do you turn this thing
on well all you gotta do is plug in your
headphones pull down the quick settings
and click on the high five button and
it's on so how can this audio quality be
better well it doesn't sound like my
headphones are up high quality but it
separates the sound so it sounds more
clear and crisp so you can hear each
individual instrument play which is
really cool and that's basically that
you know there's not that much to it but
we have to factor in that this is a
smart phone there's no other smartphone
on the market today that offers this so
it's a very interesting thing moving on
to the last cool feature of this phone
we have the much-talked-about manual
video mode now it's not a new thing to
be able to take photos in manual mode
but video it definitely is you can
basically get DSLR like controls on this
phone you can choose your video
resolution like 4k 24 frames per second
etc etc so this is also definitely a
very very cool feature and I will leave
a link down below to a person that
showed this very very good so that's
basically that for the video my review
of the LG v10 will be out in a couple of
weeks thanks for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next one peace
