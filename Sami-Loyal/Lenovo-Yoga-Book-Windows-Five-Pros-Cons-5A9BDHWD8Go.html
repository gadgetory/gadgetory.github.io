laptop slash tablet in a super portable
form factor it's available in both an
Android version and a Windows one in
this video we're taking a look at five
clothes and cons of the windows-based
yoga book so without any further ado
let's get into the pros this thing is
seriously portable it practically
weights nothing and v with ease anywhere
you put it you have the touch based
keyboard which saved on thickness and
the plastic used instead of metal to
thank for that
so yeah Lenovo has done a great job at
designing this yoga book to be portable
and easy to carry around the yoga book
comes in only a 64 gig option although
there is a micro SD card slot on the
left hand side supporting up to 128 gigs
of extra storage it's a nice dock
because of its weight the yoga book
unlike other 2 in 1 laptops is easy and
actually enjoyable to use in tablet mode
and I guess even more so with the
Android option the touch display is
responsive and strolling through
webpages is smooth but those vessels
they're huge more on them later
this next pro is the yoga books main
feature note-taking on real paper and
getting it digitally as well in the box
there is a pen with a few replacement
tips and paper place it on the keyboard
and press the pen icon and everything
you write onto that paper gets drawn
with high precision in an app like paint
or any other spider supporting one while
the yoga book cannot edit your next
feature film it still has enough power
to run daily tasks like browsing
emailing video washing writing and
taking notes with ease so with the pros
done let's take a look at some cons so
as mentioned before and as you can
probably see the yoga book has some huge
vessels around the screen if you put the
yoga book next to something like a Dell
XPS 13 2 in one yeah it looks old
in terms of charging the yoga book and
connecting devices to it there is just
one microUSB port which seems odd if
they want just one port they should have
opted for a USB type-c one because that
way the end user can get an adapter to
be able to connect multiple things at
the same time and I really do hope that
they include that
in the next yoga book because it would
really tie things together this is not a
device for people who write a lot
there's just no way you're going to be
writing an essay or report on this
keyboard there's no tactical feedback
instead the whole device vibrates with
each click this is just a compromise you
have to make if you want the note-taking
feature and the device to be as thin as
it is the speakers are really really bad
and so is the trackpad it's drivers
don't seem to work properly
it feels very stuttering and not smooth
overall the placement of left and right
click does not help with that in any way
either
those were my five pros and cons with
the Lenovo yoga book let me know what
you guys think in the comment section
