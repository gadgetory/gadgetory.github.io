starts I just want to give a huge
shout-out to dot tech domain for
sponsoring the channel go ahead and go
to WWE Tech to register your own Tech
domain for only $2.99 a really good
price so go ahead and do that
after the video your what is up guys
Toby here from Tech me now and in this
video we are going to be taking a look
at the second generation aura box from
the boom now renamed to time box it's
like a Bluetooth speaker and alarm clock
with an LED light panel and it retails
for about $59.99 US dollars the unboxing
experience is pretty much identical to
the older generation now don't take that
in a bad way I actually love the
packaging it's sleek it's well-built and
tells you everything you need to know
about the product inside so in the box
you get this speaker itself an aux cable
and the micro USB charging cable so
what's actually new compared to the old
era box the time box now have a higher
pixel count of 121 while the ARRA box
only have 100 those individual pixels
can now show 256 different colors and
the aura box could only show 8 including
black the box has 8 12 frame animation
design while the aura box could only
support 8 frames the time box has a
built-in FM tuner where you can listen
to local FM radio but you should attach
the aux cable for a better radio signal
you can also record voice messages with
a built-in microphone and you will be
able to share your own pixel art with
other time box owners but this function
will be coming soon as it's not quite
ready yet
the tiny box have different housing
colors to fit different tastes and
environments you can now change this
startup logo to your own logo or
animation you can also leave a voice
message the time box have over 30
presets sleep aids and
or alarms with high quality sound and
animations the time box now have many
more equalizer and light effects the two
speakers share the same speaker hardware
so the audio experience is quite similar
however the time box is slightly better
tuned with a digital sound processing
technology comparing the two the time
box is more refined as a desktop clock
most importantly the time of application
has a bigger flash built-in which means
that the boom can now upgrade this
software by just pushing out an update
that will allow additional functions and
features to be implemented into the time
box itself in the future now in the end
this is still a speaker so how does it
actually sound well judge for yourself
so in conclusion the divan time box is a
quite unique speaker and alarm clock the
LED light panel really makes this
product shine literally thanks for
watching make sure to smash that like
button if you enjoyed the video and I
will see you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
