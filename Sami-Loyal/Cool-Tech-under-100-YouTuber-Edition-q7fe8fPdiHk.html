today I'm collaborating once again with
the B take HD and this time we are doing
a cool tech below hundred dollars
youtuber edition and after you have
watched this video make sure to go to
beat tech hd's channel and subscribe
take it away b.tech so this is a 15
millimeter 1.8 lens now if you want some
amazing bokeh for your shots this is the
best lens to go with if you're on a
budget you can pick this lens up for
also just around a hundred dollars which
is a steal considering the other 50
millimeter 1.4 is almost around four
hundred three hundred fifty dollars so
if you want some nice detailed book
alysha shots this is the lens to go it
and no doubt you can definitely see the
bokeh is real and it definitely gives
out an awesome shots when you're taking
video this is the Samsung mute your
microphone currently this goes for 60
bucks on amazon it's a really portable
microphone it's small it's good-looking
it has great audio quality and there's
even a headphone output so that you can
monitor your audio it comes in various
different colors such as chrome matte
black and matte silver and overall this
microphone is just great I'm sorry but
yes lifx is here again now you may
wonder why are you featuring lifx color
1000 in your video once again well good
question sir as you can see by the title
this says youtuber edition and to be
honest I actually use these light bulbs
to light up ninety percent of my shots
but why well first of all it's cheap and
you can control it via the app where you
can actually change white balance which
is perfect for video lighting you can
make it glow stronger or less strong
it's just a very nice companion to have
when you're trying to lit up your shots
as good as possible so yes lifx is here
again so number one thing that needs to
be correct in a video is going to be the
audio you don't want your audio to be
bad or so
Stairway your audience so my lack of
choice is going to be the blue Yeti now
this is the blue Yeti blackout edition
but there are other colors and it is an
amazing microphone for the price now on
this mike i do also have a pop filter
which isn't necessary but just for five
to ten dollars will make it even better
i am using this right now for this video
and you can see it's really good
microphone you can pick up this mike for
right around a hundred dollars so
definitely check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
