watch the keynote you know most about
the new features in this phone
everything from wireless charging to the
all new a 11 Bionic SOC and how crazy
powerful it is but one thing you
probably didn't know is that the iPhones
feature fast charging to get you from 0
to 55 percent in 30 minutes that's an
entirely new thing for iPhone and yet
Apple didn't talk about it in their
keynote here's why opening up the box
were greeted with the same wall adapter
and lightning cable that we have been
getting since the iPhone 5 it's a 5 watt
charger and it's and it's slow to
actually take advantage of fast charging
you have to buy a separate 29 watt wall
adapter and cable and ok sure it's Apple
they wanted to buy cables but it
shouldn't be that expensive though right
that's what you're thinking so what you
need is the 29 watt USB type-c macbook
charger paired with the USB type-c 2
lightning cable add that to your cart
checkout and what $75 for charging my
phone faster come on Apple everyone else
and I mean everyone else who has some
sort of fast charging technology whether
it be Qualcomm quick charge or -
charging by 1 plus supplies its
customers with the right adapter and
cable in the Box no extra fees I've got
to say though once you've got fast
charging on the iPhone you don't want to
lose it
it's great finally having it as it's
long overdue and all that so nice job
Apple but what the hell
75 dollars for the required adapter to
use your new feature that's weird so
this was a very quick video what do you
guys think about all of this let me know
in the comment section down below and
also make sure to let me know if there's
any specific tests or things that I
should mention in my final iPhone 8 plus
an Apple watch series 3 reviews with
that said please like this video if it
helped you subscribe if you want more
content like this and I'll see you guys
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
