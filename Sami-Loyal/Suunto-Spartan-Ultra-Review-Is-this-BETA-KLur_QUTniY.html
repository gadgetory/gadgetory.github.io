more exact
it's the pseudo spartan ultra stealth
titanium HR yeah that naming is quite a
mess so let me break it down for you
Suunto is the brand name they are a
company based in finland and are very
well known for making premium sports
watches and diving equipment barton is
the washes name and ultra means that
it's the highest end model in the line
there's also the sport model which has a
smaller battery and a mineral glass
display instead of a sapphire one which
you can find on the ultra model stealth
is the color of the watch it's also
available in white black copper and all
black and titanium means that the watch
sports a few small pieces of titanium
around the watch it's the bezel buttons
and strap clasp and lastly HR means that
you get a chest bass heart rate strap in
the box so with the obscure naming out
of the way let's take a look at the
watch itself the build quality is pretty
good as expected for the price but not
top-notch it's made out of a plastic
like material which saves on weight but
it doesn't feel as premium on the wrist
as the garmin phoenix lead us wearing
the watch everyday is a charm
even with its big and chunky size you
forget that you are wearing it after a
while
this silicon watch band feels fantastic
on the wrist and it's of high quality if
you do break it however you cannot just
replace it with any band on the market
you will have to purchase one of Suunto
which cost fifty US dollars the wash is
using a trans reflective screen
technology which is fantastic and i
think that every sports watch just has
to have this it saves a lot on battery
consumption and makes the watch easily
readable even in direct sunlight so how
does it do this well it's quite
complicated but I'll try to explain it
on a basic level so that everyone gets
it traditional screens have their own
backlight which is turned on at all
times this screen technology absorbs the
light around it and uses that as a
backlight the downside to this is that
if you happen to be
in a dark room or place the watch still
has to use its own backlight to light up
the pixels so if you haven't noticed
it's actually a touchscreen to which I
find completely useless on these types
of watches this is a watch that will get
very sweaty and be used under water so a
touch screen is not a good idea in my
opinion there are buttons on the watch
that can be used for navigating the
software though so you should be fine
either way the display itself has a
pretty crisp resolution of 320 by 300
it's not a huawei watch like quality
display but for a sports watch it does
the job very well and in terms of
battery life you can expect around 4 to
5 days which is definitely fantastic
now this software is a mixed bag it
looks good and it's very easy to use but
it's locking some features and it's just
overall laggy and glitchy for example if
I want to go here and then go back
quickly I cannot do that it stutters and
makes me wait until it renders the
picture and as for features missing take
a look at daily activity tracking it
literally just gives you your daily
steps and that's that
I mean I'm expecting distance sleep
steps calories and all that kind of
stuff out of a $700 watch it's not like
the watch is missing the necessary
hardware to do this except maybe a risk
based heart rate monitor soon so just
haven't implemented it into their
software yes the absence of the risk
based heart rate monitor means that if
you happen to forget your chest strap
you have no idea whatsoever of how many
calories you have burned throughout your
workout and day this software it just
feels like it's on a pre-release stage
and I gotta say so far this has been the
overall experience of the Suunto Spartan
it feels through the least now this
feeling spaced over to the mobile
application as well it is very simple in
a way that it doesn't show you much
detail for example you cannot see your
history of daily activity which is weird
it also does not give UN
information on things like sleep
calories and all that kind of stuff the
only thing this app shows you is your
previous activities and on that aspect
it's actually pretty good it gives you
all the information you would ever want
off your previous activity so the
conclusion for the app is much alike the
one for the watch the experience is
incomplete and one thing I like however
is that when you are connected to your
phone it will send you all your
notifications over to your watch as well
which gives you a decent SmartWatch feel
alright so that is the app now there's
only one thing left to take a look at
and that is of course fitness tracking
this is where the studio Spartan shines
it can track every single activity that
we can think of and that is everything
from running to freaking cross-country
skiing its accuracy is fantastic and the
information you get is also unlike
everything else in very high detail and
logging on to GPS and pairing the watch
with a chest based heart rate strap is
extremely quick so fitness tracking on a
watch 10 out of frickin 10 but there is
one major flaw in my opinion and that is
that the moves count platform is not
that fun to use and there's not many
people using it so you will probably
have to export your workouts and upload
them to something like Strava
you now of course if you're not that
much into this social aspect of Strava
the moves count platform will work
perfectly fine as a place to take a look
at your previous workout so as a
conclusion overall the Sutro Spartan
feels to me as a beta product it has all
the hardware it needs to be almost these
perfect sports watch the only thing it
needs is better software across the
board including the phone application
also its pricing is a little bit on the
high side for me so there you have it
that has been my review of the studio
sport and ultra stealth titanium HR I
