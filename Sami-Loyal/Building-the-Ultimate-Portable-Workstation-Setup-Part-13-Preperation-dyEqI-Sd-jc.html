with another video filmed on the Samsung
Galaxy s7 edge because my main camera
the Lumix g7 from Panasonic is actually
broken it's not here because I have a
sent the camera to a service center in
Poland to be repaired and it's supposed
to get back to me probably sometime next
week but what we are going to be doing
today is a little bit different we are
going to be taking in this Dell
Precision 55 10 laptop and we are going
to make it the most ultimate mobile /
portable workstation setup right here on
this white desk and I am basically going
to show you guys the process of doing
that so the plan is actually to take my
del P 24 16 D monitor this one it's a
1440p monitor take that and then also
take the scarlett 2i2 and my rode
microphone and this keyboard the mouse
and maybe the mouse math not too sure
but these headphones and basically make
it a dope-ass looking portable
workstation setup so let's get right
into it and on a different note these
two shelves are starting to be a little
bit cluttered a bunch of packages a
bunch of stuff coming in here nowadays I
got this case yesterday I'm cool looking
but I have so many things here I have a
bunch of memory cards a bunch keyboards
we got the scarlett 2i2 we got some
microphones yeah I've got each surface
we have got some lenses the Samsung has
to match the while we watch the Nvidia
shield tablet two of those mice iPad
Mini HyperX
clawtooth - iphone six-plus boxes some
speakers microphone box any bunch of
packages yeah this needs cleaning up so
that will be another video and this
needs to be cleaned up as well I'll just
put these to the side the hell is this I
don't even know what the hell this is an
aux cable why I don't know your random
quote low case alright my camera bag
should not be here as well you know it's
getting quite cluttering here I gotta
tell you that and here we have a bunch
of deer and microfiber cloths Nvidia
shield case I don't need that put that
to the other side this is messy guys
it's messy
alright so what do you guys think should
I put the laptop on that side or on that
side I'm leaning towards the right side
because then because then I can have
this one
here because that would look the best
obviously and this cable would just go
back here and into there I think that's
the plan
stay up there you go that's time to put
this bad boy on the desk and of course
you fell down that's of course that
happens right that is now connected now
we need to find an HDMI cable god this
is messy in here HDMI
perfect get out of here boy get out of
here right we got that done now so we
haven't we have the HDMI cable here now
let's put this bad boy over here yeah
something like that
let's open it up for the viewers sake
all of this is so hard doing with one
hand I'm sorry guys this is turning out
but this is turning out to being barner
cleats freakin DIY gasps there you go
perfect
let's sign in oh nice now let's connect
that bad boy to power and I'll get right
back to you guys okay guys we have to do
a few interesting things today because
this laptop only has two USB ports and
we are going to be connecting a USB
interface a keyboard what else the
keyboard a mouse a lot of things that
require much more than just two ports
but I do believe that this guy has a USB
hub on the back and if it does I'll be
very happy oh is that the USB port I
hope it is can you focus I don't see
 yeah those are you speak words
perfect
perfect we got everything we need
perfect okay guys so I think I have
fixed the USB problem so well so what I
did was I plugged in this USB cable and
plug that into my my PC here and then
and then this monitor is supposed to act
as a USB hub so we have one USB here and
then three on the bottom here so that
should solve our problem I huh I really
do hope it does so so let's try to
connect our keyboard mouse and
microphone and see if it all works as
it's supposed to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
