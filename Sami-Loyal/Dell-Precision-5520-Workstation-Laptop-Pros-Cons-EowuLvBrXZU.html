seen the XPS lineup of laptops you're
probably asking yourself why they switch
the naming schemes to precision
well they didn't this is something else
a workstation in form of the XPS 15s
body so instead of an eye serious CPU
you've got AC on and instead of a
GeForce graphics card you've got a
Quadro but that doesn't mean it's the
right laptop for every professional not
at all in some cases such as video
editing the XPS 15 95 60 is probably
going to be the better choice but for
all of you out there who knows that your
work benefits from science and Quadros
this laptop is for you so to sum up the
introduction this is a workstation
laptop with the build of an XPS one and
that's definitely not a bad thing the
XPS 15 is as you long time followers
know an amazing laptop that I've been
praising for such a long time now and
one of the reasons for all that praise
has always been because of its awesome
build quality and design which obviously
is identical right here on the precision
5520 so in this video I figured instead
of making a regular old boring review
I'll talk about some of the pros and
cons that came up during my use of the
laptop so I'll start with the
aforementioned Pro its build quality and
design and to be honest I could really
go as far as to say that this is one of
the best built and designed laptops in
the Windows market it's got that
beautiful bezel s infinity edge display
which is available in two variations
you've got a normal 1080p one and then
also a 4k touch one both are IPS panels
and the colors on them look great
the 55:20 has aluminum top and bottom
panels and soft touch coating on the
carbon fiber design visible after
opening the laptops clamshell so it's
definitely a futuristic or at least
modern looking laptop I also like the
keyboard and trackpad actuation on the
keyboard is on point
it's got media control keys and a nice
spacious layout however I would have
liked it to have a deeper press but you
can't have everything can you and ask
for the trackpad it's good but not great
and as far as I'm concerned no windows
laptop out there has a great trackpad
those are for the moment sadly exclusive
to the Apple platform but if we're not
comparing it to an Apple device and just
windows ones I've gotta say it's without
a doubt one of the better ones battery
life is also pretty good that is if you
opt for the one with the 1080p display
I've heard that battery life on the 4k
touch option is horrible and that's
logical the laptop has to crunch four
times the pixel count and also respond
to touch moves but it's beautiful so
you're in quite a dilemma here as to
which display to choose but I'll try to
narrow it down for you your decision
depends on whether you want a much
better battery life or if you want a
much cooler display now that's your call
personally I choose the battery life
because the 1080p display is already
looking pretty good and for the last pro
I'll mentioned let's take a look at the
i/o but before we do that I wanna
mention that these are by no means the
entire list of pros nor cons and you
will notice more when you've got the
laptop yourself however I feel like
these I'm mentioning in the video are
the most important ones all of the other
stuff is just mid picks
so the i/o on the left you've got power
in super speed USB HDMI USB type-c with
Thunderbolt 3 and a headphone jack
spinning around to the other side you'll
find a Kensington lock a battery life
LED indicator another super speed USB
port and an SD card reader so yeah this
laptop basically covers everything
you'll need and if there's doubtedly
anything you miss you can need to be
added with a Thunderbolt three adapter
now let's get into the bad stuff about
the precision in order to make the top
bezel so small they'll have to make a
compromise the webcam it's placed on the
bottom bezel to the left and if the
placement of the webcam making your
colleagues look into your nose wasn't
enough it isn't all that good in the
first place and that's honestly the main
con I have with this laptop there are of
course smaller net pics such as the fact
that the screen hinge is way too stiff
to be open with one
and and the carbon fiber on the inside
shows fingerprints easily I mean it's
nothing huge at all so yeah those were
my pros and cons with the position 55:20
let me know if you guys have any more
questions or concerns regarding this
laptop and I'll try to answer those to
the best of my ability and with that
said I'll see you guys in the next video
