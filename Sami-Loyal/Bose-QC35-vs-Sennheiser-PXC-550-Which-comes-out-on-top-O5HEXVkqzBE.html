market for a pair of wireless noise
cancelling headphones the fact is that
you cannot go wrong with either the
Sennheiser PhD 550 or the Bose QC 35
because they are just so darn good the
Sennheiser PXE 5 fixes though are fifty
dollars more expensive than the QC 35 so
the question here is is that price
reflected in the quality and experience
of the products itself now right off the
bat just looking at a spec and feature
list will give you the answer yes but
the follow up question here is are those
features needed wanted or even justified
in the product price tag so let's take a
look at the extra features that the phd
550 have but not the QC 35 the PXE 550's
feature touch media playback control on
the right ear cup this lets you swipe up
and down to increase and decrease the
volume respectively if you tap the
headphones will either play / pause or
answer / and call depending on the
situation when swiping left and right
you'll be able to go to next and
previous track so yeah it's pretty cool
but that's not to say that you can't do
the same thing with the QC 35 because
you sort of can just with buttons
instead of touch control so another
feature appearing on the PXE 550 is a
smart pause now this feature is cool but
also kind of gimmicky this feature
automatically pauses through our media
when you take your headphones off and
resumes it when they're on again
so with these features out of the way
let's compare the real important stuff
in terms of comfort it's a time they are
both very easy to wear for longer
amounts of time without fatiguing your
ears or head in terms of quality though
I would have to say that the QC 35 feel
better built and more security this can
be seen on for example the headband
where the QC 35 s have a very cliquey
field
the Sennheiser's on the other hand is
also supposed to have a clicking feel
but in reality they kind of feel mushy
now but to realize why's these
headphones are both extremely good and
you can literally listen to both of
these headphones the whole day and you
will be totally fine
the Sennheiser's do come out on top
though with five more hours over the
already great 20 hours found on the bose
qc25 so let's talk sound quality both of
these headphones are really good but
when talking just sheer out-of-the-box
sound quality though the Bose QC 35 do
sound more punchy and louder as well you
can however adjust the EQ settings on
the Sunrisers to make them sound
practically the same so yeah both of
them sound fantastic they are definitely
the best in their segment both the
Sunrisers and the Bose have what's
called a MC which is active / adaptive
noise canceling and both of them do it
very well though I do feel like they
both headphones isolate me more so I'm
gonna have to give the noise cancelling
wing to the Bose QC 35 in terms of
wireless range both of the headphones
are about the same you can go about 10
meters away before you start
experiencing hiccups in the audience now
in terms of value like what you get in
the box they are tied here as well
because both of them give you a nice
carrying case with an airplane adapter
and arc table so yeah ty here as well so
as you could hear during this entire
comparison video these headphones are
loaded very good and there's nothing
about any one of them that makes me
think you should purchase the other so
in my opinion the best thing to do would
be to base your purchase of which of
them you think looks the best so that's
it
which do you guys like the most let me
know in the comments down below and I'll
see you guys in the next video please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
