another video and today we are going to
be doing something a little bit
different we are actually going to be
doing a walkthrough in tech Smith's new
editing software this is Camtasia Studio
9 and the videos that I'm going to make
about this software is going to be split
up into three parts this first part is
just going to be me just taking a look
at the software you know that kind of
stuff
and then the next video is going to be
me editing a video from scratch and then
the final video is going to be my review
of the software basically what I like
about this after what I don't like and
some suggestions for change so let's
open up the software TechSmith were nice
enough to give me a key for free so
thanks to them for that now here is this
software this looks a lot different to
their old software the actual
functionality should be the same it's
just a different UI and it actually uses
64 bits instead of 32 bits so you can
utilize your system a lot better alright
so the usual style we have our timeline
here we have a media bin here of which
you can get in your media files and all
that a library here and we also have a
record button here so click that and you
will be able to record your own screen
with with audio and camera and all that
stuff that works phenomenal - so this is
an all-in-one thing right here in terms
of the library you have got some very
nice stuff actually so we have got some
backgrounds like these we have God
pretty much great backgrounds that I
think would be good for me yeah
companies and stuff like that we have
got a lot of icons like this one
suggestion though for TechSmith is that
i would like to see the actual kind of
like a thumbnail for
for the content here so that you know
exactly what you're doing is so that you
so that you don't have to open it that
would be a great thing but you have got
a bunch of icons here and some motion
graphics like these intros and stuff
like that looks very cool actually
we have got motion graphic graphic said
we have got lower thirds which I'm going
to be using a lot like this to show
things like specifications etc I like
that a lot
very nice to see oh and I should also
tell you that you can do a lot of very
very cool things with these icons so
let's say that we want to bring this
icon down slide that down and then we
want this icon to and then let's say we
want a monitor okay so and on this track
let's say we want it the house to have
some kind of animation so we have
different types of things that we can do
and those can be found in either the
behaviors tab or the animations tab at
the animations tab is mostly just
zooming in like this and then the
behavior tab is very cool so you can get
the thing to popping and pulsate like
this for example so now we have added
that behavior to this thing and now that
and now let's play that back so as you
can see that looks very interesting very
nice actually so let's say we then want
them the office building to have a
reveal
and then we want the screen here to have
a jump and fall and now that has has
those animations applied to them BAM
right there looks very interesting and
then BAM
out and in comes that one and fades like
that pulsating like that and in comes
that one so you can do a lot of
interesting things like typography for
example which is very nice to see I have
been missing that in Camtasia Studio we
have got transitions you know the usual
stuff this is pretty much the usual
stuff that we have seen before with the
TechSmith Camtasia Studio 8 these are
pretty much fine there's no problem but
they're not amazing either but I gotta
say I do really like the behaviors and
the animations tab those are very great
to have I like it
next up you can have cursor effects so
when you click you can have it you know
click basically a voice now voice
narration and here you can do a lot of
interesting things actually so here you
choose you choose with microphone you
want to use here is the volume for that
microphone and here you can actually
write your own script like hello guys
Toby here back with another video and
when you actually start recording you
can just read off that script one thing
that I would really like to see though
is to make the script more like a
teleprompter so you can set the speed of
the text and then just read it in in
much bigger letters that would be pretty
damn awesome except you have got audio
effects which is basically noise removal
a leveling fade in and out and clip
speed visual effects you have got things
like shadows and borders around
their adjustment you can do remove a
color so you can remove the green of the
green screen colorize and do hot spots
and clicks click click to Spain alright
and then we have got captions and
interactivity which you are not going to
be using with YouTube and up here we
have got the share tab and here you can
choose to either directly upload it to
things like Google Drive YouTube Vimeo
screencast.com or you could choose to
get it at a local file or a custom
production but that is the main parts of
the software this is basically the the
overview and then in the next couple of
the weeks you guys will also get a video
of which I edit an entire video on the
Camtasia Studio 9 software which is
going to be very interesting to see how
that all pans out
I will then of course render that video
in 4k and see the final result and see
how fast it renders it's going to be
very interesting to see thank you for
watching thank you tech Smith for
providing me with the review key and
I'll see you guys in the next video
peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
