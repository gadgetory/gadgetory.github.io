techne now and today we are going to be
taking a look at the LG v10 the LG v10
is unlike any other smartphone on the
market today it's just like having the
tech ninja set the Frankenstein of
smartphones the v10 was set to be LG's
flagship smartphone better than the g4
and frankly they've succeeded they took
what was great about the g4 and made it
better they bumped up the RAM they added
their long-awaited fingerprint sensor
and they also ruggedized the body and
yeah that's the main deal of the v10 but
wait there's more
LG did some innovation and added two new
things that really hasn't been seen in
any other smartphone before the second
screen and the two front facing cameras
so what's the deal with these the second
screen is basically a multitasking
assistant and a notification Spang and
when the phone's main screen is off it
shows the time date battery and a few
notifications pretty useful stuff right
there
and for the two front facing cameras to
put this short one of them is a standard
view and the other one is a wide-angle
view but more on days later in the video
so let's talk specs the v10 sports a
Snapdragon 808 processor four gigs of
ram and an Adreno 418 GPU it has a 3000
milliamp hour battery which features
quick charge 2.0 and that will allow you
to charge the phone from 0 to 50% in
just 14 minutes
it has a 1440 by 2560 IPS display with
Corning Gorilla Glass 4 the camera
sports a 16 megapixel sensor with laser
autofocus and optic image stabilization
it can record up to 4k in 30 frames per
second the two front facing cameras are
5 megapixel one of them is a standard 80
degree view and the other one is a
wide-angle one
120-degree view but how does it perform
in real life the four gigabytes of RAM
makes his phone a multitasking Beast
I've never had the v10 slow down at any
point it has always been a snappy and
responsive phone especially after I
installed the Google now launcher which
is my preferred launcher
it has gaming well but gets a little hot
to the touch but it was nothing that
bothered me in terms of the actual build
of the device I am impressed looking at
pictures I thought that this would just
be another sheep Oh feeling Android
phone but no not at all the phone feels
sturdy and premium it has a nice weight
to it and the back material actually
isn't as cheap of feeling as it looks
good job LG the v10 has a removable back
which is something that has been slowly
fading away over the past few years so
it's still great to have it so yeah
that's cool too the display is awesome
it may not be an AMOLED display but
colors do still pop and the screen is
well saturated and vibrant it gets
fairly bright and viewing angles are
good but I have noticed a small amount
of backlight bleed a little now and then
but still nothing that bothered me and I
got really surprised when I saw that
after five days of use and no cleaning
the screens still looked perfect it's
really good with finger pins because
there's barely any on there I don't know
what you did LG but it's working all
right let's talk 2nd screen what's it
all about
like I said before it's more of an
assistant and a utility screen than
anything else it shows through
notifications which is great because it
doesn't get in the way when for example
gaming or watching videos it has two
most recent apps so that you can
multitask like a boss and there's a few
utilities as well like when your phone
is off you can swipe left to reveal a
few controls such as a flashlight Wi-Fi
settings and more so how are the cameras
I have some mixed feelings about them
the main camera is decent but I thought
that it would be better
speaking in auto mode but when we go
over to manual video mode and do some
tweaking the footage looks amazing I
will make a separate video about
how good the LG v10 camera is so
subscribe if you don't want to miss that
the two front-facing cameras are okay I
guess but there's nothing flashy to see
here other than the really cool
wide-angle one the fingerprint sensor
took really long to set up but once it's
all set you won't face any problems with
it it's snappy and accurate and that's
all you want in a fingerprint sensor
really and as you have noticed there's
no buttons on this side like other
phones the buttons are all on the back
and that's both good and bad when
reaching the phone from your pocket you
can easily start it up and get into the
operating system within like two seconds
but if the phone is laying flat that's
another story the LG v10 has an inbuilt
digital-to-analog converter which is
pretty cool it may not be a huge
difference but it makes this sound a bit
clearer and crispier oh and speaking
about sound the speaker on this phone is
rubbish
it sounds tinny and gets distorted at
higher levels but once you connect your
own headphones the the inbuilt DAC will
take great care of them and I guess
that's about it for the review if you
feel like I forgot anything please tell
me in the comments down below and I will
give you guys my written review of it
thanks for watching make sure to
subscribe if you like the content also
like the video while you are at it and
I'll see you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
