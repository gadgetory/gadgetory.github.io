another video and today I am going to
show you how I benchmark stuff so asked
you guys have probably seen in the last
couple of videos I have used two types
of software to benchmark video games to
show the gaming performance and stuff
like laptops and PCs and graphics cards
and that kind of stuff and today I'm
basically just gonna show you how I did
that and how I do that on a regular
basis so first up I use two types of
software so the first software that I
use is called fraps and that software
has an inbuilt benchmarking thing so
what I do is I use that and then I grab
the data from that and put that into a
software called smart draw or which I
can and make a graph out of that data so
let's get right into showing you guys
how all of this comes together so first
off this is the laptop of which we are
going to be testing it's called the Dell
Inspiron 15 75 59 yes a long name but
here are the specifications in terms of
CPU it has an Intel Core i7 6700 HQ
that's a quad core chip for graphics it
has lead the 960m 16 gigs of ram 128
gigs of SSD and a one terabyte
mechanical hard drive and the screen is
a 4k touch IPS display of which we are
not going to be using we will be testing
at 1080p let me bring up this screen
recorder and get right into showing you
guys how all of this works all right
let's show you guys all of this again I
actually tried to start a screen
recorder but that would not work because
I was using fraps and a screen recorder
at the same time and those would not
like to cooperate so
I'm sorry about the about the video not
being as sharp as it might have been
using a screen recorder instead so what
I do is right here I start this software
called fraps look something like this
click on the the FPS tab and I'm gonna
choose the benchmark settings to be min
Max and average FPS what that will
basically do is give me the data of the
minimal fps in that instance the max fps
and the average FPS altogether and I
choose to stop the benchmark after 180
seconds which is three minutes and I
have the benchmarking hotkey to numb
Enter so let's start a game that we want
to benchmark we can start a game let's
start rocket League okay we are now
inside of the game I'm just waiting for
the actual game to start before I can
before I can start the benchmark perfect
now what I do now is I click the
benchmarking hot key which is num enter
now and now now now I can just play the
game just like I would play it any other
time I'll just play the game just like
someone else would play the game nothing
too spectacular and the fraps software
is in the background benchmarking how
well this game is being displayed in
terms of fps all that jazz min max
average all that jazz
let's just play for three straight
minutes and I'll be right ah crap that
was Oh
alright that was kind of a kind of a bad
move there but perhaps will let us know
when it's done with its benchmarking
okay so the benchmarking is now done you
can see that because the actual FPS
number has popped up again I'll leave
you alone now I'm sorry about that this
is for a video so what you then do is
you go into fraps and you click on the
view you then get this this file here
and you click on the fraps log and now
here you have your your past log of all
of the games so what I do now is I bring
out an NST card and I plug it into the
Rd actual PC okay
aye-aye-aye copy the benchmarking and
folder and I bring it into the SD card
like this copy/paste and now I will be
right back on my main PC because that is
where we are going to do the actual
graphs all right you guys I am now at my
main pc and i'm gonna show you what i do
right here so i have imported the
benchmark file right here so what you do
is you can open it click on the fraps
log and here you will get each game it's
time being benchmark its frames and it's
and here you will get its average of yes
followed by min FPS and max FPS in each
and every game that you test it it's
it's simple so what you do now is get to
your
to the graph making software that you
you that you yourself want to run me
myself I use a a software called smart
draw and turn price addition yep and so
what you do now is go to click the bar
graph and we will start off with a game
no as a first off we will make our
benchmarking a folder on Windows click
so right click new my bench marks 960m
so now what we will do here ace we will
start off with the rocket league as you
can see up here so let's bring this down
with a rocket League 1080p medium
settings to v2 alright and now we are
gonna hire or we are gonna make the
maximum fps a lot higher so what what's
our maximum it was 133 so let let's make
the maximum here 840 like that alright
and now we're gonna choose all of these
categories and things like that we are
actually going to have to delete these
three and we're gonna remove that
serious oh wait not that serious we're
gonna remove the actual category so
remove that category and remove that
category and remove that category and
then here add serious perfect so now we
are gonna change these colors as well so
this is gonna be min fps and we will
choose the color right here so we so
let's choose that as blue let's choose
the the average FPS as orange the max
FPS as
Yello all right so now if you look at
rocket League up here we can see that
our men fps was 40 so you can either
drag this to 40 or just type it out but
drag it to 40 and the oh and also here
in the side here we can show them what
we mean so here blue is men fps that is
average FPS not DPS and that is max FPS
okay so our average FPS was as you can
see here ninety-five point four so 95
there we go
and Max was a hundred and thirty-three
133 and now the category here down below
we'll just say 960m and now this graph
is done so what we can do now like now
you can just play around with the
background some stuff like that like
other colors and all that but to make
this one simple I am just going to make
it white and now what you do is you pick
a file save as
and choose the benchmarking folder and I
want to save it as a PNG file save as
rocket League and save now you can
choose the scale with the width and
height so I'll choose 1280 by 528 that
will be perfectly fine okay so now that
gets in here and now we have that file
here but that is how you do that and you
and you do the same thing over again
until you have each and every game in
here with the stuff that you want to
show basically so that is how I create
my benchmarking results and tests and
it's also how many many other people do
it the only real difference is maybe
some other people use different graph
making a software and there are of
course free versions available of graph
making software's so just search that
online but the links to fraps and to
smart draw software will be down below
in the description so you don't have to
search around for that so that's how I
do it and once I'm all done here I will
be left with a folder with all of these
that I can import into Sony Vegas and
show you guys it's just like this thank
you for watching please leave it like if
you enjoy the video and I'll see you
guys in the next video have a good one
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
