announced their new g-force now game
subscription this service is going to
transform your Mac or PC into a GTX 1080
gaming machine you'll be able to play
games like The Witcher 3 on him act with
inbuilt graphics so let's try to explain
how this works the actual gaming power
sits in the cloud on Nvidia's servers so
what I mean by that is that the game is
actually being played on NVIDIA servers
who are then transcoding that image and
sending it to you the transcoding
happens at 1080p and 60fps and at the
same time you use your mouse and
keyboard to control the game this means
that you can bring out your 12-inch
MacBook and play battlefield 1 or The
Witcher 3 at max settings now if you're
already a gamer and have your own game
library you can actually sync your Steam
battlenet origin and so on accounts to
play them outside the house on an
underpowered laptop using the GeForce
now service you can also download and
install free games such as League of
Legends and of course if you don't have
any games yet you can just go on Steam
or something like that and purchase them
because the games are owned by you and
not by Nvidia so when it comes to
storage you have got up to one terabyte
of storage for your games we don't know
yet if that one terabyte is SSD or hard
drive storage though so a really cool
thing about this is that it's going to
look like you are running the game on
your local machine because when
launching a game you literally just
click on the icon on your desktop and it
will start up just like it was on your
own computer right now you can sign up
for free for early access but you have
to be a resident of the United States I
do hope that they come out with it in
other countries as well in the final
release but it's the u.s. for right now
so in terms of pricing we are looking at
a pretty steep price of two dollars and
25 cents per game our so personally I
would not pay that much I would rather
just save the money and buy my own
gaming PC so what do you guys think
please let me know their comments down
below and I'll see you guys in the next
video
yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
