best phone Samsung has ever made it
might even be the best film ever made
overall but as per usual no piece of
tech is perfect in this video we're
going to be taking a look at five things
I like and dislike about the all-new
samsung galaxy s a the SH display is
fantastic now to get the full experience
of this 2960 by 1440 display you have to
actually set it to that resolution
within the settings the s8 actually
ships with Full HD plus enabled to save
battery life but once you have the
display set to its native 29 60 by 1440
resolution it's the best display I've
ever seen the blacks are inky the colors
are very vibrant punchy and just crispy
overall and the smaller vessels also
make the display feel more immersive so
yeah overall it's just the best display
I've ever seen on a smartphone
even though Apple and some other
big-name smartphone manufacturers have
decided to ditch the headphone jack
Tommy I actually still has one on there
s8 while keeping the same IP water
resistance rating and actually cramming
more features into the phone this is for
me at least a major plus fun fact
Apple ditched the headphone jack mainly
to free up space for the vibration motor
to use with the touch sensitive home
button the SI it has very similar tech
below the screen and yet they still
managed to keep the headphone jack
without sacrificing on water resistance
or build quality you've now got two
biometric ways of unlocking the S a
fingerprint and a new iris scanner it's
supposed to be even more secure than the
fingerprint sensor and with its
placement the iris scanner might feel
like a more viable option to some people
it's actually very quick and accurate as
long as you hold the phone right which
can feel a bit weird at first but when
you've used it for a while you'll have
no problems using the iris scanner on a
daily basis and no you cannot unlock the
phone with a picture of you the s8 has
the water resistance rating of ip68 just
like the s7 before it this means that
the phone can be submerged in down to
1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes this
gives you kind of a sense of security
that if you happen to drop the phone in
like a pool for example it will be
totally fine keep in mind that this is a
water-resistant phone and not a
waterproof one the s8 is not intended to
be used for
like taking pictures on the water it
probably works but it's not recommended
nor Intendant the camera on the s8 is
hardware-wise
not a big upgrade from the s7 but with
some software tweaks and optimization
it's better than before these pictures
and video speak for themselves so with
the life out of the way let's take a
look at some of my dislikes of the essay
for the record no one of the dislikes is
not going to be able to fingerprint
sensor location because I actually don't
mind it but I do mind this speaker
though it's rubbish it sounds tinny it's
easy to muffle in landscape mode it has
no base and doesn't even get that loud
the most optimal speaker setup on this
device would be dual front-facing
speakers on those tiny top and bottom
vessels that would be hard to pull off
at this thinness and with all the
sensors up top but yeah the sole speaker
is the essays biggest issue in my
opinion but if you can live without a
great speaker
this phone is golden with the infamous
note 7 Fiasco last year
Samson played it safe and got a
relatively small three thousand milliamp
hour battery in the s8 nonplussed model
and with a big screen and very powerful
hardware it might not last as long as
you would like you to I've heard some
people with the s7 having its battery be
good in the beginning but gets worse
with time I'm not sure if that's going
to be the case for the s8 though but if
so it won't last a day the phone did
however last through the day of use
right now with auto brightness enabled
but definitely not more than that
vixie is Samsung's own version of Google
assistant which one is better is yet to
be seen but there is a hardware change
because of big speed there's a new
button dedicated to just big speed below
the volume down button now sure a
dedicated button is convenient if you
actually want to use it but I imagine
many people don't really use any voice
assistant on a regular basis and would
like to map the button to something else
but you can't so that's the hardware
button gone useless the s8 has an 18
point 5 by 9 aspect ratio this makes the
display taller than usual it's not as
tall as the LG G 6 is 19 by 9 or
basically 2 by 1 aspect ratio but but
it's still
notable while watching videos you can
click on a button to resize the video
although that crops it in a bit so it's
not perfect the benefit to this aspect
ratio though is that you've got more
space in scrolling apps such as Twitter
Instagram and so on personally I don't
mind the small dark bars in videos but I
just wanted to mention it for anyone not
aware of it
my last dislike with the s8 is its price
if it's unlocked it cost around $800
that's almost double the price of a1
plus 3 T which is a same nominal phone
at just for $49 but yeah with the s8 you
do however get a much better camera
display and some all new tech like the
iris scanner if you plan on getting your
s8 on a monthly payment rock on its the
best Android phone you can get right now
but I wouldn't recommend buying one
unlocked it's just a lot of money
alright so that's it those were my 5
pros and cons with all new Samsung
Galaxy s8 what do you guys think let me
know in the comments down below and I'll
catch you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
