5 and with it costing just around 400
euros it's looking quite good spec wise
the phone is featuring a Snapdragon 636
SOC which during my couple of days with
it so far has provided enough power to
the level that I hadn't noticed that
much of a difference in speed compared
to my one plus five and it's also really
efficient so it doesn't consume a lot of
power and it doesn't get that hot either
it's paired with either four or six gigs
of ram the Agena 509 GPU a 6.2 inch 1080
by 2246
IPS display 64 gigs of storage and a
3300 milliamp hour battery it's of
course running Android 8 darou
and it's got dual a I cameras one with a
normal view and one with a wide-angle
lens and more on those later now let's
just get this out of the way first yes
it does look a lot like the iPhone 10 it
has a very similar looking notch a glass
back and the camera is placed vertically
just like on the iPhone 10 now I like
the design but with it being so similar
to the iPhone I think it lacks
creativity now don't get me wrong it
does feature some design traits that are
not from the iPhone like for example
this sunburst effect centering in on the
fingerprint sensor and while also the
fact that it does have a headphone jack
but I just think they could have made
something a little bit more original
overall though I have loved the time
that I've spent with it so far the
display with its tiny surrounding
vessels is awesome even though it is an
OLED the colors are great it gets fairly
bright outdoors and thanks to the small
bezels it's much more immersive than a
phone with big bezels the knotch was a
little bit weird at first but after a
couple of hours with it
I stopped noticing and caring about it
now battery life so far has been pretty
good the phone has been able to get me
through a day with about 20 percent
charge left now I'll talk more about the
battery life in my review of this phone
as the first couple of days aren't
really
good indicator of what the long-term
battery life will be in terms of speed I
am satisfied now for the price this is a
great performer it has been able to do
everything I have thrown at it so far
without any crashes or hiccups and just
breezing through the OS is also a
pleasant experience I wouldn't call it
flash of speeds but it'll certainly fit
most people's needs so what's this AI
camera all about well what it does is it
recognizes the kind of subject that
you're taking a photo or a video of and
then adjust the settings automatically
to make it a better shot tailored to
that subject the actual recognition
works quite well with normal subjects
like the sky food and pets and it does
choose good settings to make your shot a
bit better looking but sometimes it
really gets things wrong like here when
I pointed the camera at my watch it
suggested it was food and tell me if I'm
wrong but I don't think my watch is
edible so I'd suggest that the camera
only does it's a I think if it
definitely knows for sure what the
subject is because when it's for example
senses that a watch is food it does
change the settings according to what
would be best for food and instead of
making this shot better it'll make it
worse
so yeah it's cool technology but it
isn't revolutionary now I'll talk more
about how the camera performs in the
review of this watch but so far it's
been good for the price not quite on the
level of flagship phones but not too far
away from those either it's pretty cool
that you can get a lot of the trendy
features that you would mostly see on
flag shapes on a mid-range phone so it's
got the small bezels and the dual camera
setup and a really premium glass on
glass design if you want to know more
about this phone I am going to be
reviewing it in a week or two so make
sure you are subscribed to not miss that
and also if you have anything in
particular that you would like me to
test or talk about in that said review
make sure to leave a comment down below
and I'll do my best to help you out so
with that said thanks for watching feel
free to leave a like if you
this video useful and I'll see you guys
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
