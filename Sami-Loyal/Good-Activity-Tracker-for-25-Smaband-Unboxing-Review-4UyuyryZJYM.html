domain name for your tech business well
you have come to the right place go to
WWE tech to register you own dot tech
domain for only 299 for the first year
so go ahead and do that after the video
and use the coupon code tech me now all
the info is down below hey what's up
guys welcome back to another video today
we're going to be taking a look at
something there oh it's already on well
that's interests we're going to be
taking a look at and activate chucker
and fitness tracker with a heart rate
monitor it's called this small band guys
can you guess this price while you
probably can because of the title but
yes $25 for this bad boy let's unbox it
and give you guys my review of it on the
box here it says heart rate and an
activity tracker heart rate I to the
tracking calling messaging sleep
tracking alarm alerts sedentary alert
and tile loss it has an 80 million power
battery it runs using bluetooth 4.0
resistance rating of ip65 and now you
can purchase this watch of a website
called gear Bescom let's get right into
the box and see if this guy is actually
worth the money you know guys the fact
that this guy has a heart rate monitor
by itself kind of makes it worth 25
bucks well that is if it works so let's
open up the box decently premium
packaging for 25 bucks and really enough
this guy is already turned on anyway
okay here is our our not I was about to
say micro USB charging cable but this is
obviously not a micro USB cable we will
have to take a look at this
so here's a watch that actually feels
great and this it doesn't use in normal
watch class but this button thingy
instead alright so let's pull this out
and let's take a look so this is not a
touchscreen but it has some capacitive
buttons here okay so let's take a look
at the UI alright so here is the UI we
have the date-time battery and and and
bluetooth followed by heart rate
followed by steps followed by kilometers
followed by calories swallowed by the
time again that is very simple but that
is also how it should be in my opinion
awesome now let's pair this to our phone
and I'll get right back to you guys with
some information oh and by the way this
is the charging cable it charges the
watch like this pretty awesome there is
your heart rate monitor which I have
never seen turned on yet but and I also
noticed a very interesting thing just
that when you have this bad boy on your
watch and you pull it up okay it
automatically displays this stuff
alright so down and up that's awesome
anyway let's spare this thing up and
I'll be right back alright k so this is
the connected application it's called
small health open that up and you have
got a goal of 20,000 steps that's
interesting anyway so first up you have
its have called sport and here you will
see your steps calories and distance
today yesterday the day before that etc
on sleep you have your sleep tracking so
it will tell you how much or for how
long you slept deep sleep ly sleep awake
time
on here you have got your heart rate so
if you wanted to take your heart rate
you can tell it to do that here or to
take a photograph yeah so now that took
a picture and here we have notice you
can tell it to talk to you when it has
been lost so that's called empty lost
you have got SMS notification turn that
on alarm you can set a new alarm so this
actually does have a vibrator in it well
not that kind of vibrator but a
vibrating motorized thing yeah you have
is sedentary warning so that is
basically it just tells you to get up
and get moving as opposed settings on
here you can do a firmware upgrade you
can disconnect etc etc etc so it's a
very simple application but it works and
that's the main thing it works and I
gotta tell you it works pretty damn good
so I have used this now for but a day
and I gotta tell you the tracking is
kind of spot on the heart rate monitor
is not too good but but also not too way
off and also this button kind of style
that you do that is kind of annoying and
I feel like it would just you know but
them and just fall off my wrist
sometimes but that has never happened
but I do feel like that can have so if I
were to rate this bad boy I would rate
it a nine out of ten mainly because it
costs twenty-five dollars it has a heart
rate monitor it feels good it's of high
quality the charging cradle is good
really you can't go wrong with 25 bucks
this is a great fitness tracker for
anyone looking to chapter step 60 so I
really do recommend it go to the
description down below if you will if
you would like to buy it
and yeah it's pretty awesome so thanks
for watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video Pizza</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
