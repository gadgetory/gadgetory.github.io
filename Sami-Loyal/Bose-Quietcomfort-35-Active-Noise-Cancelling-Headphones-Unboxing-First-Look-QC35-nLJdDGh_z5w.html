with another video and today we are
going to be unboxing the Bose
QuietComfort 35 active noise-cancelling
headphones and these are the new
versions the old versions were the quiet
comfort at 25 and those were not
wireless but now we have wireless
connectivity through bluetooth and you
can also pair it with NFC so
everything's all good this is a review
unit although it is brand new so it has
the plastic wrapping around it so I just
figured why don't we do an unboxing of
this guy because it is a $350 headphone
and it looks very nice this is not the
black version as you can see it's the
it's the silver version so we got both
wireless more toward us and Swedish bows
brownie other side we got on the back
here it says powerful sound wire free
world-class noise cancellation quick
pair via NFC and Hans headphones with
bose connect app noise rejecting mic for
calls up to 20 hours per charge wireless
and 40 hours in Wired mode so they do
include a cable as well so that's the
box and now let's get right into that
machine
it's obviously probably a fake leather
but on the back here you have got your
pouch let's open this up and get right
in the box so there you have it there
are the headphones so here is your aux
cable if you do want to use it in Wired
mode this one is in great colors so
that's interesting to fit with the
headphones and here you have your
charging cable and my in micro USB I
think also great and here is some wrap
wrapping around around the headphones to
keep them safe during transportation get
that out of the way they are
surprisingly lightweight very flexible
too so that's interesting if you have a
big head this will not be a problem I
think it's made of plastic but it feels
a rather high quality plastic if that's
the case up top here on your headband
you have what's called Alcantara you can
usually see those things in that in cars
in premium cars this material here here
is the noise cancelling microphone on
that side and here is another one and we
have more here they're in there and down
below here we have some controls so
that's plus minus here is our charging
cable on the other side we have nothing
but an aux port if you want to use it in
in Wired mode we have these vans here so
it has a click you feel to them alright
let's see if these have some juice in
them and we will get right into and we
will get right into try these out so
this is the power button or power switch
so now they are on you know what let's
try the NFC connecting instead so I'll
turn out NFC son and let's put it on
prep not Instagram and let's put it on
to the NFC tag right here probably boost
yes I'll pair that Harry it says
connecting and it's connected so the NFC
worked very well I like that now let's
actually try these things I haven't
tried them yet just wanted to connect or
to download the bose application that
are for these headphones now let me just
try these behind-the-scenes and I'll get
right back to you guys with my first
impressions I'll be right back alright
guys these things are very interesting
um I haven't been able to test out the
noise cancelling because I don't let it
in a very noisy environment but in the
final review which will come up in maybe
a week or two I will obviously test that
too so maybe I'll go for a bus ride or a
train ride somewhere I will definitely
take these with me but speaking just
about the audio quality I can definitely
tell you that they sound phenomenal they
have a lot of bass but not too much so
that they they overpower the treble and
instruments and all that so i'll have to
do some more testing on these for the
next couple of days and i will get right
back to you guys with a final review
video in a couple of weeks so maybe next
week or the week after that i'll see you
guys in my next video thanks for
watching peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
