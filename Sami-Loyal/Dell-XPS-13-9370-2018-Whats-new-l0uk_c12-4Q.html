naturally the successor to last year's
CES release the 93-60 which I did get to
test although I did not review it and
while those two laptops look very
similar there are some differences so
let's talk about those so what's new on
the outside well they basically reused
last year's overall design language
however it has been refined a bit so you
will notice it's a tiny bit shrunken
it's thinner too
the webcam has been moved to the middle
of the bottom bezel which by the way is
still not a good placement Dell and next
to that webcam there is a face
recognition sensor which is nice to see
and the bezels have actually got an even
thinner than before the 3200 by 1800
display option has been replaced with a
4k panel that is a bit brighter has
better viewing angles and displays
colors a bit better and lastly the last
change on the outside the port selection
has been modified so we went from a pair
of full-size USB type-a ports with one
USB type-c turnable three ports a
full-size SD card reader and a headphone
jack to a pair of USB type-c Thunderbolt
3 ports one USB type-c 3.1 port a micro
SD card reader instead of the full-size
SD card reader and we do get to keep the
same headphone jack now this change does
limit your options a bit when it comes
to peripherals
but Dell has been nice enough to at
least supply it with a USB type-c to
type a adapter out of the box which is
something that Apple would never do
however the real difference is on the
inside and here we get the latest of
Intel CPUs that being the eighth
generation paired with your choice of
surprisingly still ddr3 RAM up to 16 gig
status your choice of SSD up to one
terabyte of super-speedy m2 SSD and the
battery has actually been shrunken from
61 hours to 52 and so with that battery
change we do lose a few hours of use but
it should still last an entire day
which during my testing it has been able
to do so that wasn't a whole lot right a
few changes on the outside a new Intel
CPU the same Ram and SSD options and
actually a smaller battery yeah it
doesn't sound like much but the new
Intel CPU is amazing we're going from to
physical and for a logical course to for
physical course and eight logical ones
that's that's double the core count this
opens up a bunch of possibilities in
terms of what you'll be able to do with
this laptop that we've never before seen
in such a small and portable machine you
will be able to do photo editing and you
will be able to do some basic video
editing as well which I did try on the
last generation model and that was just
horrible with those two cores but now it
works just fine so that's a huge
improvement and so the only few
compromises that I see with this new
update are number one the battery life
which has been slightly degraded number
two the port selection and more
specifically the removal of the very
useful full-size SD card slot and lastly
number three the price it is a bit more
expensive so please do let me know what
you think about this laptop in the
comment section down below also feel
free to let me know if you have any
questions about this laptop also of
course in the comment section down below
and while you're at it also feel free to
subscribe and like this video if you
enjoyed it and if it helped you and with
that said I guess I'll see you guys in
the next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
