another video and today we are going to
be taking a look at the Alienware
graphics amplifier or the GM as I like
to call it it has this striking
aggressive game rail look with a fan up
front a 460 watt power supply a four
port USB hub and a PCIe slot for
installing a graphics card but let's
rewind the tape a bit why would you
install only a graphics card here is the
concept get a small Alienware PC like
the Alpha or some Alienware laptops and
then connect that to the graphics
amplifier to get desktop like graphics
performance with that said you might be
wondering why not just get a bigger PC
well because portability the Alienware
alpha that I have is super small and
does actually have pretty decent specs
in terms of graphics it has a desktop
960 graphics card so what you do is you
take only that small PC to LAN parties
and when you are home you have got this
beefy desktop graphics card so how do
you get it up and running well just open
up the case and remove these two screws
then just get the GPU into place and
just pop it in and once that's all done
get those two screws back into place now
you need to connect the GPU to power get
the needed pins and just connect them
then close the case and connect your
monitor USB peripherals power and the
cable that connects the graphics
amplifier to your alien work PC now just
turn on the PC and the graphics
amplifier will turn on with it if you
want to disconnect it and then reconnect
it however the connected PC has to be
powered off because it cannot hot-swap
between two different graphics cards I
wanted to see the difference between
using a gtx 980 inside of a normal PC
versus using it in the graphics
amplifier and here are the results
so as you could see the performance is
not exactly the same sometimes the PC
gets about 10% better average fps in
games but sometimes it's the exact
opposite so expect a 10 to 15%
difference between a normal PC and the
graphics amplifier in terms of cooling
it's great the graphics card has its own
vent on the side and on the front is a
fan so cooling is definitely on the good
side the only problem with the fan
though is that it is very loud and
because it's only a 2 pin fan there is
no way of controlling the fan speed so
what you have to do is basically just
pull out the cable if you want the
quieter system as a conclusion is the
graphics amplifier worth the $200 if you
already have an alienware PC that
supports it yeah definitely it gives you
easy access to upgrade your graphics
card if you already have a normal
desktop PC just buy a better graphics
card and you're pretty much all set
alright that's it thanks for watching
please leave a like if you enjoyed the
video subscribe if you want to see more
like it and I'll see you guys in the
next one
peace out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
