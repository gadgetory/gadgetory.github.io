with another video today we're doing an
unboxing of the new dell XPS 13
two-in-one edition so this is not the
normal Northcliffe this is a two in one
computer so it can be used as a tablet
and also as a normal laptop so without
any further ado let's just get into it
this is obviously a review unit so it
has been used before by someone else by
other reviewers so it's not a fully new
sample but that is obviously okay with
just going to be testing it we haven't
purchased it directly from dell in
ireland actually okay so first up this
is a USB type-c to see full-size you
speak so that's an adaptor its life that
they include this in the box and unlike
apple warranty and safety information
and wow this is a very small power brick
I like that that is very portable here
is the laptop in its own packaging there
it is
it's a very light laptop fantastic XPS
and as usual extremely well built so ask
for ports on the the left side don't
know if you can see that very well but
we have a charging port which also
doubles as a USB type-c with a
thunderbolt 3d interface we have a
headphone jack and the dell battery life
indicator we have a what looks to be
like a Kensington lock we have another
USB type-c port not sure if that one has
a thunderbolt three compatibility and we
have a micro SD card slot and our power
button the display for this particular
unit is the 1080p touch display so not
4k or anything like that let's check the
specification so control panel the intel
core i7 7y 75 at one point three
gigahertz this is a low power chip not
sure how well this thing actually
performs but we will have to check that
out in the final review which comes out
in a couple of weeks and ask for RAM we
have eight gigs the webcam is placed
here as per usual with these XPS devices
now that they have the infinity edge
display which have is super small and
thin bezels so there's no place to put
the actual webcam and this can be a
problem if you are a person who attends
business meetings via Skype or anything
along those lines in terms of storage
for this particular unit we have got let
me check a 256 gig PCIe SSD down here we
have a fingerprint sensor so that can be
used for logging in which i think is
great and other than that there's not
much to say at this moment but please
stay subscribe or get subscribe
if you are interested in the final
review of this dell XPS 13 2 in 1
convertible laptop so that said thank
you guys for watching please leave a
like if you enjoyed this video and I'll
catch you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
