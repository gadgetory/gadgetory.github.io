me now and today we're going to be
taking a look at some awesome tech below
fifty dollars this video is a
collaboration with VTEC HD so if you
want to check this channel out the link
will be down in the description below
let's get right into this so this is a
three-in-one charger by yourself now
what is cool about this charger is that
it is an all-in-one charger meaning if
you want to plug it into an outlet you
can do that but also you can pull out
this little section and it will become a
car charger it will also come with the
USB in case you want to charge your
phone on the computer so a really handy
piece of tech and if you want to pick
one up you can pick it up for right
under thirty dollars so instead of
carrying three different charges you can
just have fun this is the Bluetooth a
Bluetooth beanie from case Co it
connects to your smartphone it's pretty
much the same as a pair of bluetooth
headphones but the headphones are
actually inside of the beanie it makes
for a very discreet look and if that's
what you're going for this is the
perfect choice it may not have the best
sound quality but it's ok now this item
is for all your photographers out there
so this is a lens set by mozi Atlantis
for your smartphones it is a
three-in-one lens so you can shoot some
amazing wide-angle shots you just can't
be with a normal smartphone camera it
will also be able to take macro and even
some fish I shots so it is a really
awesome piece of tech that is just under
sixteen dollars and it will also throw
in a cleaning clock and a carrying pouch
so that you can keep your lenses safe so
definitely check out those legs steps
for your smart phones this is the life x
color 1000 is smart Wi-Fi enabled light
bulb it usually goes for 60 bucks but
right now you can get this for 4999 you
can control the lights from an
application in your smartphone it's
intuitive sleek and good-looking and
very much future pack it's just all
around a very nice light bulb
