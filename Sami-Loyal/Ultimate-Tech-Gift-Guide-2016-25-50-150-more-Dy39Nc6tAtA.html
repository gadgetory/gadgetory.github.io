with another video and welcome to the
ultimate tech gift guide I'm also
bringing in my friend Sammy to help give
you guys some more awesome tech gifts
now this video is going to be covering a
lot of different kinds of price points
and on your screen right now there will
be some time codes just click on the one
that you want to watch or just watch the
entire video for the full gift guide
experience now the links to all of these
products will of course be down below in
the video description so Sammy take it
away man hey whats up guys so starting
off with tech under 25 one of the best
things that I could imagine getting
would be a tracking device for my keys
wallets or really anything I wouldn't be
able to count the amount of times that
I've lost those things and wish that I
had something to track them with so the
tile may find there will be an awesome
gift for almost everyone it comes in at
24 99 each and has a sleek minimalistic
design which i think is a pretty good
deal next up we've got the anchor Astro
50 200 million power portable battery
pack and this is going to be super handy
for when you're out and you're running
low on juice it's really good value
right now at $16 and from using it
myself for a few months I have
absolutely no complaints this battery
size will also mean that you can charge
most phones almost two times over and
all of that in a pocket-sized form
factor it's pretty dope now one of my
all-time favorite bits of tech is the
google cardboard because it lets you see
into the whole world of VR just using
your smartphone and right now it's eight
dollars which is just crazy if you're
not familiar with how it works all you
do is slip in your smartphone with the
cardboard app downloaded and you just
hold the cardboard box up to your eyes
and that's it now this is the version
too so you also get a strap for this you
don't actually have to hold it and if
you don't even know what this does
essentially it makes your screen acts
like a bit of a cinema I guess and it
tracks your head where you're moving and
things like that so you basically get a
VR experience using your smartphone and
a cardboard box holding it up with a
magnifying glass it's pretty cool
definitely worth checking out an honest
price point it's pretty hard to say no
so the next price point that we are
going to be taking a look at is under 50
US dollars so first up we have got the
amazon echo dot it costs 39 US dollars
right now and it's a hands-free voice
controlled device that uses Alexa to
play music control smart home devices
provide information read the news set
alarms and so much more so next up we
have got the anchor sound core Bluetooth
speaker now this speaker usually costs
80 US dollars but right now it goes for
under 50 it features superior sound and
build quality with an amazing 24-hour
play time so next up these are the sony
MDR said x 110 and see ya long name
anyway these are some great looking and
sounding noise cancelling headphones
that right now costs just below 40 bucks
so next up we have got the Amazon fire
TV stick with the LX enabled voice
remote is basically just like a
chromecast so what you do is you just
connect the device into a TV or monitor
and you essentially transform that
monitor or TV into a smart TV that can
play netflix youtube and all that kind
of stuff so the next and final item on
this price point costs just above the
fifty dollar price point but it's well
worth it it's the Garmin vivofit
activity tracker this thing tracks your
steps distance calories burned and all
that kinds of stuff it also has a
one-year battery life which is
phenomenal going over to the under 150
range the Fitbit charge HR it's a lot
like the government that we covered
earlier but it also comes with a heart
rate monitor which will give you a more
accurate reading of calories burned
prices do very honest but it's going for
around one hundred and ten dollars on
amazon com now if you're looking for a
solid smartphone choice the Nexus 5
comes in at 149 99 and it will give you
that beautiful pure Android experience
that a lot of people love it's also
great value for a smartphone built this
well so definitely worth checking out
next up the ACSM watch 2 is a great
SmartWatch to get into the SmartWatch
market add-on only ninety dollars it's a
lot better than the other competing
smartwatches at this price range now if
you really have someone to impress this
list of products over 250 are our
personal favorites which we're sure that
you'll love
starting off with the Google pixel this
is arguably the single best smartphone
available right now acting as a
benchmark for all other smartphones to
come for at least a couple years
something really interesting about this
is its camera quality which is one of
the best available on smartphones
England comparable to those expensive
DSLR cameras so if you know someone into
photography this is also going to be a
good choice and lastly we've got a
curved widescreen 29 inch gaming IPS
monitor from LG for 280 999 this is
going to be absolutely awesome for
gaming with that wide screen and being
an IPS monitor it's also going to have
great colors and viewing angles but guys
that's it for me thank you so much too
Toby for having me on your channel if
you want to see more from me definitely
check out my channel as well and I'm out
peace so my personal favorite piece of
tech right now is the panasonic lumix g
7 4k camera now this thing is a total
beast it has the quality of its bigger
brother the gh4 which costs a lot more
and the g7 is also smaller and lighter
than the gh4 which is grits next up we
have got an amazing deal on a very good
gaming laptop this is the alienware 15
are three it packs a quad-core i7 CPU 16
gigs of ram 128 gigs of SSD and a one
terabyte hard drive and a graphics card
is a GTX 1060 now this laptop usually
costs 3,800 US dollars but right now
it's on a 59 percent off deal so you can
get the laptop for just 1,500 bucks now
that's what I call a good deal so thank
you guys so much for watching I hope you
got some good gift ideas in this video
