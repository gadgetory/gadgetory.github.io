now and in this video we are taking a
look at the Dell XPS 13
9350 first of all I do want to thank
Dell for sending this review unit out to
me although I cannot keep it and my
review will be super honest so it comes
in a simple black box with only the
laptop a few documents and a charger the
version that I have right here is the
one with the i7 6500 u 8 gigs of ram 520
graphics 256 gig SSD and the qhd+ touch
display and that is 3200 by 1800 in
resolution the top and bottom is made
out of aluminum and on the inside there
is carbon fiber with soft touch coating
and on the left hand side there is the
charging port a USB type-c port a USB
type a port a headphone jack and a
battery indicator and on the right side
there's a Kensington lock a USB type a
port and an SD card reader so let's get
into the review for this review I
stopped using my beefy setup and only
use the XPS 13 for the entire test
period which was two weeks but I of
course went to my desktop when I needed
to edit my videos the Dell XPS 13 is
right now the world's smallest 13-inch
laptop thanks to the tiny vessels and if
you compare this laptops dimensions to
let's say an 11 inch MacBook Air the XPS
13 is almost as small but with a larger
screen and that's definitely an
advantage I often found myself sitting
in the couch or in my bed when using the
laptop and the experience was great each
time doing smaller tasks such as
browsing the web checking emails etc was
blazingly fast and did not slow down at
any point and watching movies and videos
was awesome thanks to the gorgeous 3200
by 1800 vessel s display oh yes the
display its viewing angles are
phenomenal colors are vibrant and poppy
the small vessels make it a very
immersive experience and all of this
combined makes it the best display I've
ever seen period although everything has
its flaws
here's the ones for this display so
because of the amazing display with over
4.4 million more pixels than HD it draws
a lot of power so the display really
brings the XPS 13 down in the battery
department but if you're that kind of
person who values battery over the
screen Dell has a full HD option as well
and I would definitely recommend that if
you're one of those people the screen
also has no anti-glare coating so you
will see a lot of glare when using the
laptop outside or in direct sunlight so
if you're one of those people who likes
to use their laptop outdoors I would
still purchase the full HD version as it
actually does have anti-glare coating oh
yeah and my version has touched too and
I gotta say it's a very nice add-on but
it isn't anything that I see myself
using too much the laptop is very light
and portable coming in at around 1.2
kilograms or 2.6 pounds the aluminum
body and shattered edges really gives
the XPS 13 a premium feel and look and I
also love the touch of carbon fiber on
the inside it's very soft and feels
great when typing and using the touch
pad the displays hinges are pretty stiff
so you can't open it with one hand and
there's also really no point to grab on
to when opening the laptop so yeah it
can look a bit awkward at times typing
on the keyboard is as expected but it's
doing a great job for being a laptop I
got used to it within a few hours and
now I type as fast as I do on my
mechanical keyboard
it also has lightning behind the keys
and that's of course good for typing in
the dark and when you stop typing for a
while the keyboards backlighting will
fade out and then when you start typing
again it will light up again it's a nice
touch to save battery so I'm very
pleased with the keyboard in fact I
wrote this entire review on the Dell XPS
13 the trackpad is huge for such a small
laptop and I'm happy with it although
there are some apps that work worse than
others for example two finger scrolling
works better in edge than in Chrome
where it can be a little Skippy at times
in terms of row
for months it scored a 699 in a nova
bench which is respectful for a laptop
this size I also tested it in 3d mark
skydiver where it got a score of 3661
which is decent for integrated graphics
and I also did some testing with playing
games on the 520 graphics and here are
the results playing csgo was
surprisingly smooth I set the quality to
low and the resolution to 1080p and
still had about 50 to 65 FPS which is
definitely playable and then I tried
some League of Legends and I was
surprised again the FPS s were over 100
so this is not an underpowered laptop
and I could definitely see people using
this for light gaming as well as work
and school related matters the Wi-Fi
performance was great it was very stable
at around 80 megabits per second on my
100 megabit per second network and I did
not face any problems with it whatsoever
so alright all this gaming and power
using it must really eat up the battery
right ah yeah man battery is not the
best although I do think that it is
decent with this small form factor so
what I'm trying to say is that although
it does not have the best battery life
that's expected with a laptop of this
size and components especially the
screen so I got about 6 hours with
normal use and 2 hours when playing
games so like I said before go for the
full HD option if you want to have a
better battery life but do keep in mind
that the full HD option does not have
Gorilla Glass which makes it look a
little bit less premium but if you are
not bothered with that then go for it
personally I'm okay with the somewhat
lower battery life in exchange for a
better screen so in terms of
connectivity the XPS 13 has it figured
out to USB type a ports a headphone jack
an SD card reader and a USB type-c port
you can use the USB type-c port with
Dells adaptor to get even more
connections like Ethernet HDMI use
and more the webcam is located at the
bottom of the display which will look
pretty weird like you're staring at
something in the distance but in fact
you're just looking at the screen the
webcam is 720p and I mean it looks fine
it's just a placement that bothers me
but of course they have no place up top
because of the super thin vessels these
speakers are not front-facing but I
still think that they are pretty punchy
and have some bass to them
I like the speaker's because they sound
clear and not tinny like other speakers
but once again it's just the placement
that is maybe enough all right yeah that
pretty much sums it up so in conclusion
the Dell XPS 13 offers a versatile
laptop with a premium feel and premium
components all in a small but powerful
package it's better life may not be
appealing to some customers but they can
be pleased to know that there is a full
HD option which will significantly
increase the battery performance thanks
