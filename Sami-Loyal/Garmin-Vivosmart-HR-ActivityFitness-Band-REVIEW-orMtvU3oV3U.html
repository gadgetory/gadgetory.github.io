so the links will be down below in the
description if you're looking for a
fitness tracker with a heart rate
monitor and SmartWatch features the vive
smart HR from Garmin may actually be for
you so welcome to my in-depth review the
watch is pretty plain looking with one
button a touch display and not much else
the display has a plastic surface on top
of it that is quite prone to scratches
it looks very much like any other
activity band rubber and plastic in
terms of putting the watch on it uses a
normal watch clasp it's very comfy to
wear as it's extremely light and not
bothering at all the heart rate monitor
sticks out a little bit but
interestingly enough it doesn't make the
watch feel weird when wearing it or look
ugly it's totally fine the watch has a
battery which obviously means that you
have to charge it it doesn't use a
normal cable though like microUSB but
that's probably to help with it's 50
meter waterproof rating the watch lasts
for about 4 days but that can increase
and decrease depending on usage it takes
about an hour or so to recharge the
battery breezing through the operating
system is very easy as you just swipe up
and down to move between pages of
information if you want you can change
the orientation of the watch by going to
the app or the web dashboard the main
page shows you the time date an alarm
clock if you have that on and a half
moon if you have it in do not disturb
mode swiping down you'll see your steps
followed by floors climbed in ten thirty
minutes combined calories distance music
control weather smart notifications and
heart rates so let's take a look at
these more in-depth the watch face is
very plain but easy to read it shows you
the day the date and time of course
sadly the screen is not in color
I would love for garment to add more
wash bases and or the ability to make
your own and download others like the
Kinect IQ system that they have for
their hire and GPS watches below the day
and date you'll find the alarm clock if
you have it on to enable it either go to
the app or the web page and choose it to
your liking the watch will then vibrate
very strongly to wake you up if you have
it in do not disturb mode you will see a
half moon next to the alarm clock what
this does is it basically stops the
vibration when phone and notifications
come in to turn this setting on press
the physical button click the half moon
and choose on moving down we have your
steps in the middle you'll find your
step counter for today and below that
your goal the gold automatically adjusts
each day according to how active you
were the previous day below your goal
you'll find a bar to show you how close
you are to hitting your goal I found
that this step counter is pretty
accurate but there's one flaw and that
is that it only starts tracking steps
when you've walked for about 10 seconds
or so and that's about 30 steps lost not
cool Garmin I do like the auto adjusting
goal though as it gives you a pretty
actionable go to meet not too hard and
not too easy next up we have a very
similar page to the steps page and this
one is for floors climbed it has a daily
goal of 10 floors but the accuracy on
this one not so good there was one time
where I climbed up and down a five-story
building and it only tracked two floors
climbed I don't know if there's
something that I'm doing wrong because
that's obviously not accurate next up we
have intensity minutes and this is not a
daily goal is a weekly goal of 150
minutes although I have changed that
through the web dashboard to three
hundred and fifty minutes accuracy with
this one is spot on it uses the inbuilt
heart rate sensor who sends whenever
you're doing intensive stuff the only
thing though is that you have to do it
for at least 10 minutes for it to count
towards your goal if you're doing even
more intensive stuff so that your heart
rates goes up by a lot it will double
the minutes gained I think that this is
a much better fit
his tracking system as it shows you how
many minutes you're actually working out
or doing intensive tasks great job on
this one Garmin next up we have calories
and I am NOT an expert on this but what
I do know is that the watch takes
information like steps in 10 30 minutes
and your heart rate to measure how many
calories you're burnt I don't know how
accurate it is though as I have no way
of testing that next we have the music
and this one would be so great if it
worked for streamed music like Spotify
but sadly it doesn't it only works with
your library but I do believe that if
you're using it with an Android device
you actually have the ability to use the
controls with the stream music like
Spotify so that's great if you have an
Android phone if not well it does
nothing unless you have a lot of stored
music next up we have weather where it
shows you the temperature max temp for
the day and a picture for what kind of
weather to expect you know sunny cloudy
rainy etc it basically takes the
information from your phone and displays
it on the watch if you tap you'll see
the forecast for a couple more days it
doesn't show you a picture though only
the temperatures the next page shows you
your phone notifications and if you tap
on one it will let you read it or trash
it very simple interface but it works
fine keep in mind though that you have
to be connected to the app to get
notifications on your watch next up is
heart rate it shows your current heart
rate and average resting heart rate if
you tap on a page you will see a chart
for the last four hours so now that we
have gone through the main pages let's
take a look at the pages you get to when
you press the physical button first up
there's a workout button if you click it
you'll get to choose what activities
you're doing right now it only supports
running cardio and other if you pass on
one you'll get to start the workout by
pressing the physical button and the
workout will then start and show you
information like heart rate distance and
time and you can change these info pages
in the Garmin Connect app or in the web
one thing that really sucks is that it's
not a GPS watch and it can't use your
phone's GPS so what that means is that
you can only use the vivosmart HR to
track running accurately because it
tracks distance by the movement in your
arm and if you out cycling it's not
going to track distance at all next we
had the Do Not Disturb mode where you
basically tell the watch to not disturb
you and that's that next up is the alarm
clock where you can see at what time and
days it will alarm
sadly you cannot change these settings
on the watch you have to do it in the
app or in the web dashboard next up is
Bluetooth where you can simply turn it
on and off pair a new device
notifications on or off and connect
alert pretty simple things here next up
is this sync button click this and the
watch will sync to your phone keep in
mind though that you don't have to do
this every time as the watch will
periodically sync data to your phone
next up is the where is my phone button
click this and it will send a noise to
your phone so that you can find it
obviously though it only works if it's
in the range of Bluetooth after that
there's the archive where you can take a
look at past workouts and after that
there are settings and then some general
information like battery life serial
numbers and more so that is basically
the vivosmart HR and if you want to know
what the app looks like I can do check
out Jeff resource video the link will be
down below so in conclusion the
vivosmart HR is a great fitness tracker
for most people although it doesn't fit
my needs as I needed to have built-in
GPS for my cycling and other activities
I will still use it though as I think
it's a great wash to see general health
stats and phone notifications thanks for
watching make sure to smash that like
button grab your own tech domain and of
course subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
