precision 5510 got a score of it's got a
cpu score of 833 and to put that into
more context my into the core i7 4770k
got a cpu score of 866 which basically
tells us that these two processors the
Xeon and the i7 desktop CPUs are both
pretty similar in terms of those things
in Geekbench let's see here what I have
typed down because there's a lot of
things to keep in mind
so in Geekbench you got a single core
score of 4274 and a multi-core score of
13,000 634 and that also puts it
somewhere in between VI 5s and the I 7s
and the gtx 760 s and the 960 s which is
great for this small of a laptop alright
now let's get into some Cinebench and
see how that performs so for the
processor of course it's the Intel Xeon
CPU III one of one 505 m at two point
eight one gigahertz it has four cores
and eight threads in hyper-threading hmm
and it's running Windows 10 but this but
it was configured with Windows 8 it's of
course 64-bit and the Quadro M 1000 M a
quadrille GPU is installed now let's
first of all let's run the cpu test
alright so let's begin these Hinna bench
r15 benchmark with a cpu benchmark so
run that and it will start rendering out
a picture mmm
let's just wait for this to render out
and see what score we get in the Dell
Precision 55 10 which is a very
expensive laptop but it does have about
the same performance as other
desktop PCs have and this is a laptop so
that's very very interesting to see last
bit here and it puts itself right below
the i7 4770k and right above the i7 3770
that is a great score because that
literally means that this will have the
same amount of rendering score as pretty
much an i7 4770k or the i7 3770 which is
very interesting to see all right now
let's get into some GPU benchmarks so
that's OpenGL let's load that up and see
how this performs now please guys do
remember that this PC is of course
running everything in 4k 3840 by 2160
resolution so that may have a bit of a
difference in performance compared to
1080p so it's basically just rendering
out this car sequence in cinema 4d
alright so that car goes to the side and
explodes as usual and this guy parks up
here and there's the cinema 4d logo
perfect and that puts us at a very very
interesting score amongst the top in the
MOBA Quadro GPUs which is very
interesting to see take a look at this
our Quadro m-1000 got got a an average
FPS I believe of 88 point 96 and the
quads okay 4000m got a score of 67 point
71 that is very interesting now let's
get into some more some more practical
things like video editing because I know
a lot of people who purchase this laptop
is going to use it for video editing and
so am I so we are going to be opening as
sony vegas pro 13 let that open and as
you can see the timeline is very smooth
if you play it everything is smooth and
acid supposed to be no stuttering etc
now let's render this and then we will
of course choose our 4k and that is of
course 3840 by 2160 in 25 fps and we are
going to start it by by rendering with
only the CPU and then we will see if
there's a difference between rendering
with only the CPU and the cuda cores and
then also OpenCL so let's begin with the
cpu and i'll be right back alright so we
are nearing completion in about 10-15
seconds or so and that leaves our final
final time about 24 minutes
let's see now it's done in exactly in
exactly 24 minutes alright now let's
test the exact same thing but let's
let's do this render ass and let's
instead of this let's choose in a to
render using CUDA if available so ok so
we had 24 minutes before now it's going
to be rendering with CUDA as well
