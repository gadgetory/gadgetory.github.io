was almost the perfect smartphone it was
very well-built had a phenomenal camera
had ip68 water resistance a crispy quad
HD AMOLED display and a whole bunch of
other very nice stuff but the overall
experience of the phone degraded with
time that your life went to crap and it
suffered from occasional crashes and
hiccups so what about the s8 this is the
best smartphone right now for sure it's
a perfect no but they're getting really
really close so welcome to my in-depth
Samsung Galaxy s8 review this particular
model I have is the non plus one in
arctic silver if you want to know the
difference between the s8 plus and the
non plus model here this the s8 plug is
$100 more expensive it has to be bigger
but same resolution display and it's got
a 500 milliamp hour bigger battery that
being 3500 milliamp hours over the three
thousand found on the normal s8 it's the
extra $100 you need to pay to get the s8
plus is worth it or not is up to you
me personally I got the non plus model
because I wanted to use the phone in
just one hand so with that said let's
take a look at the build the s8 keeps
the glass design of last year and that's
a good thing
it's such a good-looking phone this year
however the back has a slight curve
making the phone easier to hold and
operate in one hand the glass is
supposed to be very durable and in one
way it is scratch resistant and in
another not so much draw resistance
Samuel oil a fellow youtuber friend that
dropped his s8 2 to 3 feet and it
cracked so yeah I do recommend a screen
protector another difference from last
year is the aluminum trim which is
glossy over last year's matte one in
terms of buttons and i/o the layout is
the same with the power button on the
right side and the volume rocker on the
left side however there is a new port
below the volume rocker for samsung's
new voice assistant bixby more on bixie
later the buttons are made out of metal
and have a nice click to them however I
would have liked if the Bigsby button
has
kind of pattern on it to help you more
easily distinguish between the volume
rocker and the Bigsby activation button
giving us the ability to be map the
button to another application or voice
assistance like Google assistant would
also be much appreciated although it
doesn't look like we'll be getting that
anytime soon
in terms of ruggedness and overall build
quality I urge you to watch jerry-rigged
everythings video where he tests various
different things like stretch and bend
resistance up top is the sim and microSD
card and a microphone between 2 and 10
aligns down below you'll find a
much-appreciated headphone jack USB
type-c charging port a microphone and a
speaker also between the same antenna
design as up top on the back you'll find
the flash and the S health center next
to that is the camera and next to that
is the much controversial fingerprint
sensor in my opinion the fingerprint
sensor location is not an issue on the
non class model especially if you have a
case to help guide your finger I would
imagine it being more of a struggle
though on the SH Plus as the SH plus is
a much taller phone location aside the
sensor is quick accurate and has a few
cool features like swipe down to pull
down the notification tray however that
feature has to be enabled within the
settings menu above the display is a
whole plethora of stuff most important
to notice is the IR light which aids the
iris scanner the earpiece and a
front-facing camera oh and speaking of
display wow this is the best smartphone
screen period spec wise it's a 29 60 by
1440 AMOLED display with an 18 point 5
by 9 aspect ratio because it's an AMOLED
display the blacks are black and not
gray like on LCDs the colors are also
very vibrant maybe a bit over the top
but man it's good looking if you're not
very tech savvy you might not know what
to benefit to AMOLED displays are so let
me tell you their sin which gives the
manufacturers more space inside of the
phone there are also more
energy-efficient which is the main
benefit on smart phones as mentioned
before the s8 has a rather unusual
aspect ratio of 18 point 5 by 9 this
means that the display is taller than
the usual 16 by 9 aspect ratio that's
a pro and a con it displays more
information in application to which you
scroll a lot like in social media and
web browsing apps however when watching
video you'll see some small black bars
on the top and bottom of the display
there is a button in supported
applications which gets rid of those it
does cross the image though so it's not
perfect the essays has an always-on
display feature which I really do like
it lets you view things such as time
date and notifications all without
needing to unlock the phone also because
it's an AMOLED display it doesn't
significantly eat into battery life at
all spec wise the new s8 is a beast it
features the all-new Qualcomm Snapdragon
805 SOC in US markets and their own
Exynos 88-90 five internationally these
CPUs are the best out there right now
there are not a whole lot faster than
the old snapper than a 21 the main
selling point with them is that they are
25% more energy efficient which plays a
huge role in smartphones in terms of
other specifications is featuring 4 gigs
of RAM which is definitely enough
although not as much as on the 1 + 3 T
which has a whopping 6 games
the s8 comes in only a 64 gig option
which seems a little bit odd but
thankfully they have kept the microSD
card slot for expanding storage the s8
is also the world's first device to ship
with Bluetooth fired on its main feature
is streaming the same audio to two
different speakers at the same time and
a longer range if you're interested in
Bluetooth 5.0 watch mkbhd Sybilla you're
on it the link is down below if not tell
me in the comments down below as I might
have forgotten to add it so with all
these spec talk what does it translate
to in real life
well a heck of a performer touch with
lag is completely gone which is great to
see and overall the phone is smooth
powerful and very responsive thumbs up
speaking of TouchWiz which is now
renamed to Samsung experience let's take
a look at its UI features speed and also
bixby performance wise it's fast they
have finally managed to eliminate the
lag in Samsung phones and that's it for
performance the UI has gotten a big
purification so to speak
now don't get me wrong it's still a
sampling scheme on top of Android just
not as obnoxious as the old ones I
really like this change as it's just a
lot cleaner as two big speed the voice
features do not work yet instead we just
get this card's overview very similar to
Google now which I guess is kind of
useful but but I've actually never
gotten to using it I'll make a big view
review as soon as the voice assistant
works though features there is a bunch
so let's start to go over some of the
cool ones as quick as we can
all right the app jar can now be
accessed by swiping up or down on the
home screen the notification tray can be
pulled down via a swipe on the
fingerprint sensor this has to be
enabled within the settings you can have
multiple apps open at the same time by
going to recent apps and clicking this
button you'll then get to choose which
other app you want to use and then
you're done the back and recent apps
buttons can now be swapped you can
change the background color of those
buttons there is a secure folder which
is like another installation of Android
you can install specific apps store
photos videos and other files that do
not appear outside of the folder there's
a performance mode which increases the
maximum screen brightness by 10%
the home button or should I say area on
the screen is a lot like apples force
touch home button it senses you pressing
it and gives you a nice vibration which
feels a lot like in normal click the
home button can be pressed even though
it's not displayed double-click the
power button to open the camera if you
purchase the deck station your phone can
transform into a desktop computer those
were just some of the features found on
the s8 there is a lot more if you're
interested in a video showcasing them
all let me know in the comment section
down below and while you're at it leave
it like and subscribe if you haven't
already the phone keeps last year's ip68
water resistance rating this rating
means that the s8 can be submerged in
down to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30
minutes I would see this as a good sense
of security that lets you use your phone
near water without having to worry about
it it's great to see them still packing
the same rating even though the phone is
crowned with
all that tech including the headphone
jack camera wise the s8 has a very
similar sensor to last year's s7 which
had arguably the best camera of last
year only beaten by the Google pixel
this year Samsung includes similar
software optimization of which the pixel
uses which does render the s it's camera
one of the best if not the best camera
on a smartphone right now so I said
let's take a look at some pictures taken
on the s8 in auto mode and with no
editing applied
the estate also has a much higher
quality font facing camera so let's take
a look at some pictures taken on that as
well the aforementioned 3000 milliamp
hour battery might seem too small for
such a powerful device but actually it's
been lasting very well for me if you
watched my 5 pros and cons video of the
essay I said that the battery life was
average but for some reason it has
actually gotten a lot better it gets
through a day of use without around 25
to 45 percent left that's with the
brightness set to auto mode and the
screen set to its native 29 60 by 1440
resolution as to charging the phone it's
done via the USB type-c port and takes
about one hour and 15 minutes not as
fast as only one plus three T's - charge
but it's still quick enough
this old speaker on the SAT is bad it's
easy to muscle when washing videos and
it doesn't get very loud the nor sound
good the most optimal speaker system
would obviously be two front-facing
speakers however that is not a very
Samsung II thing to implement so we're
just going to have to live with a single
speaker this year as well a feature
which came right off the exploding note
7 on the s8 is the iris scanner this is
the next level stuff it's quick and very
accurate as long as you hold the phone
correctly which is learned with use and
yes it works at night in my personal
usage the iris scanner is a backup I
mostly use the fingerprint sensor but
when my hands are wet or dirty I use the
iris standard it's a feature I expect to
see or at least want to see in many
flashes phones moving forward Samsung
advertises AKG tuned headphones included
in the box and they're supposed to be
worth $100 they have got a nice
high-quality feel to them and to be
honest I could see these things in
stores for 100 bucks
so the SX has something nailed it they
sure have it's an all-around
of a smartphone it looks gorgeous it's
powerful and responsive the UI is much
improved the screen is just the best
there is the camera is up to par with
the Google pixel it's not even better
and it packs a whole plethora of new
features such as the iris scanner so

s8 let me know what you guys think in
