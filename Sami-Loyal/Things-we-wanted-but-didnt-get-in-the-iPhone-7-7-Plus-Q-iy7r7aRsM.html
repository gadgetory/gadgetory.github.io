another video today we are going to be
talking about the newly announced apple
iphone 7 and mainly what we wanted to
have in this phone but did not get so
first up wireless charging and yes i
know the iphone 7 has a metal design and
that makes it hard to put a wireless
charge inside but come on Apple so many
people have it already and it's so
awesome so what this means is that you
have to buy a wireless charging capable
case or accessory to get it to work and
I mean that's just another thing to buy
and keep track of it's just annoying
next thing that we wanted but did not
get this year is NFC beyond Apple pay
pretty much every Android phone has NFC
so why can't Apple devices have it to
another thing that I personally wanted
is a bigger and better display with
AMOLED technology and a 1440p resolution
but with the same body size just get rid
of those ugly vessels and give us a
better and bigger screen now that would
be awesome next up is a thing that I'm
sure that everyone would love and that
is a bigger battery and yeah we got a
somewhat bigger battery but it's still a
very small battery compared to their
Android counterparts so what they should
have done in my opinion is to make the
phone just a tiny bit thicker and use
that excess space to put in a bigger
battery Apple why are you making your
phones thinner and thinner each and
every year it's annoying next up is the
sign and personally I think that the
best design was the iphone 5 but when
talking about this six and seven we have
had the same rounded apple design now
for about three years and it's getting
really dull and boring like come on
Apple why can't you give us something
new for once so the next thing that we
wanted but did not get is a headphone
jack now
Monday's the headphone jack is going to
be seen as a feature in phones instead
of a standard really weird stuff I would
be okay with this move if wireless
headphones were actually good and
affordable but they're just not the good
ones are very expensive and the more
affordable ones they just suck next up
is a thing that did actually go obsolete
with the main manufacturers a couple of
years ago but has now returned and that
is expandable storage the microSD card
like who does not want this is there
anyone in the right mind who does not
want expandable storage come on anyone
no I don't think so so why can't you put
it into your phone Apple the last and
final thing that I wanted in the iphone
7 is fast charging and I know that you
can use an iPad charger to charge faster
but it's still nowhere near close to the
android phone for example the LG g5
takes half an hour to get to fifty
percent and that is also with a bigger
battery than the iphones have it's a lot
faster and it's pretty damn awesome and
i think that every new phone should have
some kind of fast charging so please
apple iphone 7s fast charging come on
Apple I think you can do that all right
guys those were the main things that I
wanted in the iphone 7 but did not get
thank you for watching please leave a
like and subscribe if you enjoyed the
video and if you did not enjoy the video
please comment down below on what I did
wrong and how I can improve and I will
see you guys in my next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
