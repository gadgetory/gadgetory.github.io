part of HP's highly marketed a new omen
series of gaming pcs this particular
model is called the W 2 or 3 and O and
5c latest and greatest from Intel and
NVIDIA that being the quad core cable
ache i7 7700 to HQ and an extremely
powerful and video gtx 1070 graphics
card with eight gigs of VRAM it's also
got 16 gigs of fast ddr4 Ram a half
terabyte of next-level speed nvme SSD
storage and a 1080p IPS display with
g-sync
so what did I do to test it well I went
to Dreamhack summer 2017 the world's
largest land party now this video is not
supposed to be an extremely in-depth
review covering each aspect of
everything this laptop is made of
instead it's supposed to give you a nice
understanding of who these lots of is
for if it's good or not and therefore if
it's actually worth getting one so let's
begin by taking a look at the design its
game ring to say the least it's a little
bit more so than something like the
Alienware 17 but still people will know
you're rocking a gaming laptop from
quite far away it's got sort of a
carbon-fiber look-alike plastic casing
with some red accents around the
keyboard with illumination and The Omen
logo on the back personally I'm not a
fan of the design instead I appreciate
the industrial design of the Razer Blade
pro if the design is of please to your
eyes so you'll be pleased to note that
it's decently well built although not as
well built as a razor blade series of
laptops with their aluminium builds the
keyboard feels sturdy however the
display can be a little bit wobbly while
typing on the keyboard it also acts as a
fair bit so I'm not 100% sure and how
well that's going to hold up
but the hinge is made out of metal so no
issues there this laptop is heavy which
is to be expected of such a powerful
device but you know compared to the Asus
G 702 VI the razor blade Pro and the
Alienware 17 it's a little clumsy
if you can live that though it's a fair
bit cheaper than the aforementioned pcs
for the same specs all right so the
keyboard is a good well actually for
being a non mechanical keyboard I quite
like it it's got a numpad and media
controls and it clicks themselves feel
quite quickly as you can
we feel when the button has been
actuated it's sadly not RGB though so no
race the track side has got this
stretched out look and I'm not a fan
compared to the Dell XPS 15 and MacBook
Pro track path that I've been using for
the past couple of months this one sucks
and just listen to those clips
what is this 2006 but yeah anyway this
is a gaming laptop and therefore no one
will actually use the trackpad so it's
not that big a deal
the display is as mentioned before a
g-sync 1080p IPS panel and it looks
decent it's no 10 bits perfectly
calibrated IPS panel but for what it's
supposed to do it's pretty good colors
are decently vibrant but sharpness isn't
as good as other dialogues get 16 for
what it is so a display to be used for
playing games it's pretty good thanks to
the G sync technology smoothing up the
already great gaming experience by the
gtx 1070 and speaking of gaming is the
1070 powerful enough definitely throw
literally any game at it and it will
handle it with ease and yes I said any
game there which is the battlefield on
Crysis 3 and so on it's fine it can do
everything it's also powerful enough to
perform demanding creative tasks like
video editing animation graphics designs
and more as well so overall I like it
it's not as well as built as others it's
not a sleek as others its display isn't
as good looking after 4k one found in
others but it sure is as powerful and
capable as the other laptops in this
segment so if you feel ok with not
having the best of the best in those are
for mentioned aspects while getting the
insane performance at a lower price bias
I recommend it so what do you guys think
of the HP omen 17 let me know in the
comment section down below and I'll
catch you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
