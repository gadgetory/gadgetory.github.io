another video and today we are going to
be taking a look at a pure workstation
laptop this is the most powerful laptop
that I have ever laid my hands on meet
the Dell Precision 5510 so before this
video starts I just want to give you
guys some information that I think would
be good to know
Dell sent me this laptop to review
although I cannot keep it and my review
will be super honest of course also this
entire video was made on the Dell a
precision 55 10 so how did I test this
laptop well what I did was I turned off
my main desktop computer and moved the
entire tech miuna operation over to the
55 10 laptop and that means editing
drifting uploading rendering and
watching videos solely on this laptop
the box that the laptop comes in is the
usual Dell packaging you get the laptop
itself some documents the charger which
lights up to help finding a dark and a
USB type-c to Ethernet adapter now to
start off this review we are going to be
taking a look at who this laptop is for
its specifications its ports and the
actual build of the laptop we will then
move over to some more practical things
like the keyboard trackpad and display
and once we are done with that we will
do some testing such as benchmarks and
video editing and more so with that said
let's get right into the video
so who is this laptop for well not
gamers not people in school and not
normal people this laptop is for what I
like to call creative professionals
so basically filmmakers musicians
animators photographers and everything
along those lines or just people who
want the most powerful laptop that they
can get their hands on because yeah the
precision 5510 packs a punch
so CPU Intel Xeon e3 one 505 mv5 at 2.8
gigahertz Ram is 16 gigs storage we got
512 gigs of SSD the GPU is the Nvidia M
1000 m2 gig guardo GPU and the screen is
a 3840 by 2160 which is 4k infinity edge
touch display whoo yeah crazy specs
right there all right
ports so on the left hand side we have
got the charging port USB 3.0 HDMI USB
type-c and a headphone jack Apple nice
on the right hand side we have got a
Kensington lock battery indicator USB
3.0 followed by an SD card reader
awesome now in terms of build we have
got the same exact build as the Dell XPS
15 and that is definitely a good thing
we have got this beautiful aluminum top
and bottom with Shatford edges and soft
touch coated carbon fiber on the inside
up front we also have an LED light that
shows if the laptop is charging and oh
my god they display its the affiliate 4k
touch display with practically no
vessels it's beautiful but it's covered
in glass though which makes it prone to
glaring and fingerprints but that's fine
it looks too good to even care and the
colors are poppy and immersive the
viewing angles are OK and the screen is
very sturdy at the screens hinges are
also a little bit
too stiff though so you can't open the
laptop with one hand but that's also to
be expected off a touch display because
you do need it to be sturdy and not
flopping around and talking about touch
display is the touch functionality
actually useful yeah definitely
also because it's such a bright and
high-resolution display it draws a bunch
of power and that definitely shows in
battery life all right let's take a look
at the keyboard it's the best laptop
keyboard that I've ever tried in fact I
wrote this entire video script on this
laptop the keyboard looks good and the
buttons are tactile and feel good and
the layout is fine up top you have got
some controls too as usual and those
include music control screen brightness
and more alright that is the keyboard
but what about the trackpad the trackpad
itself feels good it's big and the
buttons feel good and tactile but the
gesture controls don't really work
properly to finger scrolling is a hit or
miss sometimes it works good and
sometimes not so much and zooming in
just doesn't work this is obviously not
a deal-breaker but I just thought that
it was kind of weird given this laptops
price the Dell Precision 5510 just as
the Dell XPS lineup has its webcam on
the bottom of the display the webcam
itself is decent but the placement
bothers me it's practically unusable
alright that is the laptop itself let's
get into some benchmarks and show you
how this guy performs
that leads us into our conclusion if you
edit videos make music animate or
anything along those lines this laptop
is for you
with its seon CPU 16 gigs of ram
quadrille GPU SSD drive 4k touch display
great build quality it's the best laptop
I have ever laid my hands on period and
for that the Dell Precision 5510 gets
the first ever tech minal top tech award
if you ever see me giving this award you
will know that the product is amongst
the best if not even the best so thank
you so much for watching thank you Dell
for sending the laptop and please leave
a like if you enjoy the video and I'll
see you guys in my next video peace out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
