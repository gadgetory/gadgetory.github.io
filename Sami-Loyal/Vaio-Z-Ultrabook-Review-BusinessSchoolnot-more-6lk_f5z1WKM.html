business / school laptop with a hefty
price tag it's available in two
different variations the cheapest one
costs $1500 and features a dual core i5
CPU paired with 8 gigs of ram and a 256
gig PCIe SSD its display is a full HD
mass IPS display the higher end model
costs $300 more and that gives you a
dual core i7 CPU the same amount of RAM
and SSD storage and a 1440p display
instead of a full HD one in this video
we are taking a look at the highest end
model in terms of connectivity we are
looking at two super speed USB type-c
ports an HDMI port headphone jack and a
card reader in my opinion the port
selection is just fine but I wish that
they would have changed the horrible
charging board to a USB type-c port
instead its 2017 we need a universal way
of charging our laptops just like we had
micro USB with our Android phone so you
might be wondering what's the bad part
about the charger well the actual power
brick is very small and portable which
is fantastic they also have a USB port
to charge something like a smartphone at
the same time as your laptop the thing I
don't like is that you have to push
quite hard to get it into place the same
goes with taking it out as well it just
feels quite old to me so next time
please use a USB type-c port instead in
terms of build quality its screen and
keyboard has a lot of flexing which is
the result of using a plastic-like
material instead of a full metal design
it has an aluminum panel on the back of
the display and on the inside of the
laptop but the rest is really just
plastic it is very lightweight though so
yeah it all comes down to your
individual preferences the keyboard
feels in my opinion quite nice it has a
very small child distance but it makes
up for that into actuation because of
its metal panel you can feel each click
very easily so it's quite easy to get
fast as typing on this keyboard in fact
I wrote this entire review script on it
I thing I don't like though is the quick
tool it just has volume and screen
brightness adjustments it should have
and pause and all that stuff to the
trackpad is of a decent size however I
do not like the surface of it it doesn't
feel smooth and continuous like some
other laptops to do in this price range
it's got all the windows gestures like
two finger scrolling and zooming in but
because of its harsh feel I'm not very
fond of it I like the screen though its
bezels are a little bit too big for me
but other than that the screen is sharp
with its 1440p resolution and gets
fairly bright the colors felt a bit warm
at first but that's probably because
I've been using a macbook before which
tends to have a cooler color temperature
now because of its small size and high
resolution you have to use Windows dpi
feeling which if you've used it before
know that it is really bad in some apps
text and images look surprisingly blurry
or pixelated while in other apps it
looks fine
in terms of battery life bio is
advertising 13 and a half hours which
gleaming will never actually happen in a
real life scenario me myself I got about
7 hours of use when writing and
listening to music and about 5 hours of
video playback now if you're looking for
a high performer this is not the laptop
to go for because of its small size they
have to put a smaller battery in the
laptop which in turn means that they
have to use a lower performance
processor instead eventuates got a score
of 364 which is definitely fine it's not
a slouch but it cannot do things like
video editing without getting extremely
hot and loud and with its 4 megabytes of
cache it can't do that much at the same
time without slowing down significantly
so it's mostly a business / school and
media consumption laptop the PCIe SSD is
extremely quick which feels amazing in
Windows everything is just so smooth in
terms of raw performance I use crystal
mark to test the disk speed where the
SSD got a read score of two thousand two
hundred megabytes per second and a write
score of one thousand three hundred so
as a conclusion the BIOS set is a decent
all-arounder for people looking for a
school or business laptop it's got a
great screen and keyboard and the PCIe
SSD makes the laptops feel super quick
at all
it is expensive though and it definitely
has got some competition such as the
Dell XPS 13 which I reviewed almost a
year ago if you would like to watch the
review of that click the card in the top
right corner of this video so with that
said what do you guys think about the
BIOS sets let me know in the comments
down below and I'll see you guys in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
