looks like a Dell XPS 13 it has the same
metal housing except in a more darker
color the screen has the same blueprint
and a yes the webcam is still on the
bottom of the display so yeah on the
outside it's practically the same with
some minor differences but not on the
inside the latitude series of laptops
are using the Intel Core M processing
units while the XPS is using the iSeries
the m1 is of course less powerful but at
the same time more energy efficient they
have a lower TDP rating which in turn
means that the laptop produces less heat
and wastes less power and that's why
there's no fan in the laptop whatsoever
plus it does not have any kind of moving
parts inside the system which makes it
quiet and I mean quiet there's no sound
coming from the laptop whatsoever except
the speaker's of course so now that I've
given you a small introduction to the
latitude series let's take a deeper look
at the hardware that makes this laptop
actually go as fast and smooth as it
does so inside you will find the
aforementioned M processor this exact
unit has the m5 paired with 8 gigs of
RAM and as for storage we have got a 256
gigabyte PCIe SSD we also have a 13 inch
full HD infinity edge IPS display which
is 1920 by 1080 in resolution now the
top level specifications are the m7
processor 512 gigs of PCIe SSD 16 gigs
of ram and the qhd+ infinity edge
display with a resolution of 3200 by
1800 on the top you will find the dark
aluminum housing along the sides you
will find some beautiful shaffer edges
and in terms of ports there is two USB
type-c ports both capable of charging
the
laptop besides that there is a micro
HDMI port and a SIM card slot and
there's also an SD card slot if used in
a business environment on the other side
you will find a Kensington lock a
full-size USB port a headphone jack and
a micro SD card slot anyway on the
inside there's the usual stuff except
that there's also a fingerprint reader
that can be used for Windows hello and
more the inside surface is made of
plastic but that does not make the
laptop any less premium the body itself
is very sturdy and there's not much
flexing going on at all
the latitude has the usual keyboard
layout except that there's of course no
number pad above the keyboard there are
two microphones and on the top right
side of the keyboard there's the power
button now the actual keyboard is great
it has a short travel distance with a
satisfying click and the actual keys
feels sturdy and I actually wrote this
entire script on this keyboard the
keyboard backlight automatically turns
off after some time being enacted to
help save battery life I'm talking about
battery life you know it's the usual
stuff nothing too spectacular and not
too bad at all either but I'd say that
it's above average though thanks to the
lower watch CPU the webcam is good but
it's not in the best position really
which kind of makes it unusable but then
again the infinity edge display is too
awesome to even care the small vessels
are awesome and the screen itself has
great colors and viewing angles the full
HD option has an anti-glare coating on
top of the display which makes it great
outdoors but the qhd+ option does not as
it has Gorilla Glass instead the screen
can also fold back extremely far which I
guess is a plus for some people the
fingerprint reader works great with
Windows hello you can use your
fingerprint to log in and access files
etc now the touch pad is great it has
the usual Dell gestures like two finger
scrolling right-clicking and more the
surface is a little harsh though so
the best for smooth operations but then
again in that case you would just use a
mouse in terms of pre installed
applications there's not that much bad
stuff that you would never use so yeah
that's great
one program though the Dell audio
manager is really annoying so when you
connect headphones it automatically
adjusts the audio to to a more bass
heavy signature which sounded so bad
like there were no mids and highs at all
so I really do suggest turning that off
now let's take a look at a benchmark
before ending this review obviously it's
not a gaming device so I will not even
test that but let's do a general
benchmark like nova bench in nova bench
it got a score of 588 which is
respectful for an EM processor but
anyway in conclusion the latitude is an
amazing laptop I can't really wrap my
head around the fact that this M
processor is just as fluid in everyday
tasks as the I serious the display is
one of the best in laptops right now as
long as you can get around the minor
disadvantages like the webcam placement
and the so-so battery life I think that
you will be very happy with this laptop
now if you would like to buy it there
will be a link down below to both this
latitude laptop and also the XPS liner
which is more geared towards normal
consumers and not the business consumer
