bat I've gotta say this is one hell of a
phone for $300 and on paper it doesn't
look all that promising though it's got
a Snapdragon 625 SOC paired with either
three or four gigs of RAM but to be
honest I've never actually noticed any
difference in performance compared to my
Galaxy s7 edge which has the Snapdragon
820 and that is because the CPU is the
same as in the s7 edge it's called the
cortex a53 and the only difference
between the two is a clock speed the s7
edge has a 300 megahertz boost over the
zenfone 3 so yeah don't worry about the
on paper specs it's all about the
real-life performance so let's take a
look at it so as you can see everything
runs very smoothly without any hiccups
at all and the same goes for games as
well and also just a heads up the phone
does not have a physical home button
it's capacitive just to let you know now
this cell phone 3 is a great looking
phone and with its 2.5 deglass paired
with aluminium size it has a fantastic
in-hand feel the phone has a pretty big
chin and forehead though so it's not
quite there in terms of one-handed
operation the version I have here is
called the moonlight white on pictures
it's signs happen to look very gold but
in real life it's much more subtle
it looks more like champagne rather than
gold in terms of buttons and
connectivity there are some very tactile
power and volume buttons on the side of
the phone and and trust me tactile
buttons make a difference in the overall
experience I actually had this Nvidia
shield tablet before and it's buttons
were super mushy and just so bad they
kind of ruined the hardware experience
so anyway on the bottom of the phone
there's a USB type-c charging port which
is a great thing to see at this price
point and another great thing to see is
that they decided to keep the headphone
jack
despite a lot of other phones getting
rid of it on the back of the phone you
can spot the fingerprint reader which in
my tests worked fantastic it's not as
fast as something like the new iPhone 7
but it's quick precise and just dust
wise supposed to do without any hiccups
along the way the phone screen does have
those kind of
blackbar surround it I'm not sure as to
why it's actually there but now you know
at least the screen itself however is
actually great
it's a 1080 by 1920 IPS plus display
with great viewing angles and colors the
display is a little bit on the cooler
side in terms of colors but you can
easily change that to your own liking
within the settings the screen uses a
gorilla glass panel on top of it which
is a very resistant to scratches in
terms of software is running on android
marshmallow the phone is however
supposed to get the new nougat update
any time now in terms of skins I don't
like the Asus one like at all but of
course that's just my own individual
opinion it's not like the skin is bad
performing or anything I just happen to
not like the layout and style but
fortunately because this is Android you
can easily change the scheme to
something that you prefer instead the
battery is a two thousand eight hundred
million power one and to my surprise it
actually lasts quite a while in my
testing I got through about a day of use
with about 10 to 25 percent left
depending on the usage for that day in
terms of charging it doesn't have any
quick charging technology so it's going
to fill up at a pretty average speed in
terms of camera quality I'm going to
give you guys an unedited comparison
with the s7 edge which has arguably one
of the best cameras
the speaker is located on the bottom of
the phone which immediately makes it not
as good as front-facing speakers however
it is one of the better sounding bottom
mounted speakers it sounds good as long
as you don't muffle it with your finger
though which is a pretty easy thing to
do so with that said let's do a quick
pro's and con's rundown and then
conclude this review pros it's very well
built and premium feeling it's quick
even though it has a 600 series SOC the
battery life is surprisingly good the
screen is beautiful its price is
fantastic and it has a micro SD card
expansion slot cons it doesn't have that
good of a camera it doesn't have a quick
charge technology and the speaker is
located on the bottom of the phone so as
a conclusion the zenfone 3 offers
amazing value it's quick pass a
beautiful screen and great build quality
and in this range which is $300 the
phone is certainly on the top so what do
you guys think about the zenfone 3 let
me know in the comments down below and
I'll see you guys in the next video
