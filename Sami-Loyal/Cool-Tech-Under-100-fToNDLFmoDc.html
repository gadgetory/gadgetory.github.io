with another video today we are doing a
cool tech under 100 US dollar episode
together with in crunch all the links to
these products featured will be down
below in the description so without any
further ado let's take a look at the
cool tech so the first item on this list
is called the gatekeeper and it's
basically just a very small USB dongle
that you can connect to your pc and then
there's this thing that you put on your
keys and what these two things do
together is they automatically lock and
unlock your computer based on how close
you are to it now you can also customize
the distance needed for it to lock which
is definitely a plus too I really like
the fact that the USB dongle is
extremely slim so it's not annoying or
bothersome in any way so how much this
is cost you may ask well its retail
price is sixty US dollars but right now
on amazon you can get it for under 50
alright everyone the next product here
is a fascinating bumper case for the
iphone 7 first off the design is
absolutely fantastic and especially with
this matte black color which matches
perfectly with the black case and all
the ports and all these cutouts are
absolutely perfect they look good and it
blend really well in with the design of
the iphone 7 now the back of the case is
open because it's of course a bumper
case now how strong is this case exactly
now i have never done any personal tests
on this any drop test because this is my
personal phone and i don't want to risk
damaging my only phone i have however
I'll leave some links in the description
where you can clearly see youtubers drop
the phone from humongous distances
alright so how much this is fantastic
case cost well well amazoncom you can
get this for only 24 99 and that is
insanely cheap for an amazing case like
this and do not worry if you do not have
an iPhone you can also get this
fantastic bumper case if your own a
Google pixel or Google pixel excel as
well as your Samsung Galaxy S
alright so the next product we have here
is called the divan tine box and you've
probably heard about this if you watch a
lot of tech reviews this is essentially
a bluetooth connected multifunctional
box the list of what it can do is
endless you know trust me it can do
everything from being an alarm clock or
your FM radio or displaying some awesome
animations or designs or playing games
on our receiving notifications on it I
personally use this as my clock so I
keep it on my bedside and I can easily
look at what time it is and easily
switch modes to see the current weather
I also love the fact that I can receive
notifications on this even though it's
not really detailed and won't tell me
exactly what it's about so as I
mentioned this retails for 5990 on
amazon com if it's worth it really comes
down to if you're going to use this
product if you're not going to be using
at least two of the amazing features on
this product you might as well not go
for this product and you know just buy a
normal alarm clock or something the next
product on this list is right at the one
hundred dollar mark and it's well worth
it this is the valve on video mate 638
it's a fluid head tripod that you can
get some very nice shots with like this
one
or this or even this one
its maximum height is 171 centimeters
which is definitely plenty the tripod is
also very sturdy and at the same time
lightweight as it's made out of aluminum
I have been using this tripod for the
last eight months and it has been
working great so it gets a big
recommendation from me alright everyone
so the final product here is amazing for
all you iphone 7 users out there these
are essentially ultra portable bluetooth
connected earphones made by a company
named a mixture don't worry this is not
any cheap ass chinese company this is
actually a reliable company based in the
US all right so either way here are the
earphones and from the first look you
can see that it's made of plastic and
metal I wouldn't call this the most
dirty headphones in the world however
these do the job well the design is not
clunky at all and it fits me really
really well so just like any mainstream
earphones or headphones you have the
volume controls now this is not on par
with Jaybirds or sun heiser earphones
however for 1999 you really cannot
complain these are at least better than
the included lightning earphones with
the iphone 7 so should you buy this for
1999 you cannot say no now the only
drawback it has is the base which the
earphones kind of struggle to deliver
but again for only twenty dollars you
really cannot complain thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this collab with in crunch if you liked
