it's a sports camera competing against
the very famous GoPro series of cameras
and to do that the verb does pack a few
tricks up its sleeve but before we get
into those let's take a look at the
camera and some of its specifications
immediately after taking it out of its
box I notice it feels very durable well
built and definitely up to par with its
main competitors I also like the red and
black color scheme and that the camera
is so small and light which obviously
makes it great for mounting on for
example a helmet or on a chest strap
along the top you'll find your speaker a
left button for navigating the menu
which also acts as a power button when
held in and next to that is a right
button which also acts as a Wi-Fi and a
blur the big round button to your right
is of course the shutter button for
taking pictures and the sturdy switch on
the side of it is for taking videos on
the right side you'll find the switch
for opening up the battery and micro SD
card compartment which is located at the
bottom of the camera on the other side
there's the charging and USB
connectivity port and also a mini HDMI
ports on the front you have two LED
lights blinking green when the camera is
turned on and not doing anything and
blinking red when it's filming racing
through the menu of the verb is very
easy it's also responsive and the UI is
quite intuitive when the camera is in
it's 40 meter water resistant case the
Afra mentioned left and right buttons do
the job just fine but the touch function
still work just not as good now swiping
from the left gives you access to some
quick tools regarding resolution frame
rates and what mode you're in such as
slow motion and time-lapse swiping from
the top gives you access to enable Wi-Fi
Bluetooth connect a compatible Garmin
watch as a controller and also connect
sensors such as a heart rate sensor to
show your current heart rate in the
video recordings which is very cool and
lastly swiping from the bottom gives you
the main menu where you can change the
settings more in detail now the price is
400 dollars it can shoot video at 4k and
at
FPS at the maximum but if you favor
frame rate over resolution it can also
shoot that 2.7 K at 60fps and also 1080p
at a whopping 96 frames per second which
is great for slo-mo now at the full 4k
resolution deciding to enable
stabilization is grayed out so if you
want to stabilize your shots you're
gonna have to record at 1080p or 1440p
however I did not find filming at 4k to
have a lot of stabilization issues
anyway because the camera's lens is so
wide and therefore you will not notice
bumps and shaking as much as you would
on a camera with a more standard focal
length the thing that really sets the
Garmin VirB cameras apart from the
GoPros is the gene metrics feature which
uses the cameras inbuilt GPS and various
different sensors to determine things
like speed distance and altitude it can
also show you a map of where you've been
and a really cool thing with this is
that if you download the app or program
on your computer you can add that data
as an overlay on the video showing your
viewers exactly what's going on as it's
happening in the video if you connect
the camera to your phone you can also
even livestream this video feed to
YouTube which is very cool now with
everything said let's take a look at the
compilation of some clips I took with
the verb 30 it was snowing outside so I
didn't want to go out and run and kill
my lungs but I took a few video shots to
show you guys and the actual quality of
the verb 30 so without delaying this
video anymore let's roll the footage and
amount peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
