best phones of last year and as all you
guys know it's blew up a not so good of
a way the s8 of this year however has
been a pretty big success and it gives
us a good view of what's to come with
the enthusiast phone in note 8 in this
video we will be taking a look at some
rumors of the design specs and special
features so without any further ado
let's get into it
the phone will be released sometime in
the fall of 2017 and looking at past
releases it points towards the early
part of fall this year however as we
have seen with the s8 launch it could
happen at the later time as well the
note 8 will truly be a flagship phone
and therefore a flagship phone pricing
comes with it
I'd guess around 850 to 950 dollars with
tax in the US design-wise the note 8 is
going to look very similar to the s8 as
it will have the same core design that
being a glass back panel small vessels
taller aspect ratio curved glass and
display and so on it will be bigger
though and feature the s-pen for
ultimate productivity and efficiency
we'll probably see a few new features in
the big s-pen feature set from the note
7 but I'm not 100% sure as to what we
will see specifically in terms of the
fingerprint sensor we have seen some
rumors of it being included in the
display although that has in no way been
confirmed so don't be surprised if it
isn't there and just placed right where
it is on the s8 the note 8 is going to
be a true flagship phone and that's why
we will see some of the best specs in a
phone yet the screen is rumored to be at
4k AMOLED one with a big 6 point 4 inch
size and small surrounding vessels this
resolution bump will not be noticed in
everyday use however it is a pretty big
upgrade in the gear VR suite from the
usual 1440p resolution that we are used
to denote a display is also rumored to
feature a pressure-sensitive layer
similar to 3d touch found on Apple's
iPhone 6s s and newer phones personally
I was never a fan of 3d touch but let me
know what you guys think in the comment
section down below next to that like and
subscribe button camera wise we're
looking at the dual lens
consisting of 1 12 megapixel wide-angle
lens that being the exact same one found
on the s8 and a 13 megapixel 3x optical
zoom ii lens this setup is obviously
very similar to the iPhone 7 plus s dual
camera lens system but I'm not 100% sure
on how you'll be able to use the two
lenses in the 7 plus you can't use them
both independently so it would be a
great feature to see in the note a the
cameras will both feature optical image
stabilization and the front camera will
see an upgrade in negative suicides and
auto focusing will be added like on the
si the battery was the main flaw of the
note 7 of last year it was too crammed
into the body and that way it was easier
for it to get punctured and therefore
catch fire or even explode this year
with the note 8 I am expecting a pretty
decent size 30 500 milliamp hour battery
it will most likely get you through the
day but it will end there this is easy
to understand because of what happened
last year
something just can't have anything like
that happen again the note 8 is going to
be powerful and that's why Samsung is
going to be using this snapdragon 835
chip and the extra not eighty eight
ninety five in the UK and Europe it's
the same processor found in the s8
however we might see a bump in clock
speed and RAM size going from four to
six or maybe even eight gigs with more
RAM comes the ability to have more apps
and features rolling at once this is an
obvious advantage for the note 8 packing
all of its extra features that do eat up
a big amount of RAM the note series is
famous for its big lineup of exclusive
and innovative features and this year
will be no exception I expected to have
the iris scanner maybe a fingerprint
scanner built into the display and the
s-pen with even more functionality than
before I've also catched some rumors
suggesting another partnership with AKG
to tune the speakers on the phone itself
and also include the same AKG tune
earphones as found in the s8 packaging
Walter assistants will of course also be
a feature on the note 8 just like the 7
the s8 and the S
before--the so what do you guys think of
the rumors so far I think that if
Samsung posters off nicely they might
just have made the best smartphone of
2017 so with that said thank you guys so
much for your time please leave a like
and consider subscribing if you enjoyed
this video and I'll see you guys in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
