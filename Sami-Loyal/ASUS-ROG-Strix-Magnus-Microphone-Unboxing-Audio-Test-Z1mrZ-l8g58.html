to be unboxing and doing a quick audio
test of this new microphone by asus a
republic of gamers this is called the
Strix Magnus Magnus that's a pretty
weird name for a microphone especially a
gaming microphone as it says here but
yeah it looks pretty cool it's it's
smaller so I guess that's a plus and it
also has and it's also got the mandatory
gaming RGB lighting all over the place
which as I say is mandatory nowadays so
without any further ado let's get into
the box and take a look at the Strix
Magnus the box is a very high quality
and looks very nice as as usual with
ASUS here are some of its features we're
gonna take a look at those later alright
we've got ourselves first edition manual
I don't know yeah a big nice manual of
high quality I love this great oh and we
got a hard carrying case I think and in
the box we got ourselves to the VIP
member warranty notice and I guess
nothing else yep this is what you get in
the box now I mean this microphone is
not cheap I think it's around $200 so
yeah you kind of expect these these
premium things alright and there is the
Magnus let's take a look the microphone
itself it's it's pretty wide and it is
made out of metal because it's very cold
here we got ourselves a very nice and
very long braided USB cable I appreciate
that
always it's got a pretty weird end I
think that's for the microphone isn't it
yeah it's for the microphone
alright and lastly we got ourselves a
adapter I believe so that you can can
mount the microphone on
a special stand for microphone stands if
you would like to go more professional
with it so let's take a look at the
microphone itself a little bit closer
and then we will end the video with a
sound test so it's wrapped up in plastic
let's try to remove that so I guess this
is the front side because here you got
all of your controls you've got the
audio the volume for the audio you've
got a mute switch a lights mode setting
maybe and this is the USB port that
connects to your PC you later with the
weird port that we saw earlier and on
the side here you have got you to a
switch for the different modes the most
above one being cardio cardioid the
middle one being stereo and the last one
being the electronic noise cancellation
feature here is the gain for the
microphone itself so that's basically
the volume here is a USB hub so you do
have an extra port I don't know for what
but yeah and here is the aux-in if you
would like to transfer the audio from
your PC through this and then out here
so that you can both hear your PC sound
and your own voice connected to the aux
port here so without any further ado
let's get into the audio test of the ROG
Strix Magnus and before we do that we're
of course gonna have to connect the
Magnus to the PC and see if there are
any special setup needs of this
microphone or if it's just plug and play
which I hope it is so let's take this
weird end I guess you connect it right
here - like that perfect let's place it
like this and then connect it to our PC
we do have a light down below here okay
and we've got some lights great it's
it's flashing I don't know what that
but it's flashing on windows obsessed
the the device is ready for use so let's
just open up the the audio settings and
let's just fix the settings here so
we're gonna use the cardioid mode
because that is the the one you're
supposed to use for voiceovers we're not
muted of course it lights up if it's new
too and now we are switched to the ROG
Strix Magnus microphone I am about one
feet away from it let me know in the
comment section down below how this
sounds and I will see you guys in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
