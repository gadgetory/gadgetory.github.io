And in this video we are going to be taking a look
At a few microphones that work great for YouTube
And voiceovers
We have 4 microphones to show
All within different tiers
So without any further a do
let's go!
So this is the first microphone
It's the Samson Meteor
And it retails for about 50 bucks!
It's a cardiod condenser microphone with USB
And this means that it's plug &amp;amp; play
And doesn't require more equipment than the microphone itself, to work
I've used this micophone in the beginning of this YouTube Channel
So let's take a look at an Audio Sample
This is the Samson Meteor microphone without any kind of Audio Editing
This is the Samson Meteor Microphone with a little bit of equalization
And as you could hear...
It sounds very clear and detailed
So let's move over to the next microphone
This is the Antlion Mod Mic 4
If you're not the type of person who wants a HUGE microphone up your face
This is your best bet.
It goes for 55 dollars which can seem expensive for a headphone mounted mic
But the mod mic is really as good as it gets in this tier
So let's take a look at the audio
This is the Antlion microphone without any kind of audio editing
This is the antlion microphone with a little bit of equalization
So next up we have the Audio Technica AT2020USB+
This one goes for about 130 dollars and it's really good!
This microphone produces beautiful recordings and a good thing about it is that it's also powered via USB
Which makes it really easy to use
So here's the Audio Sample
This is the Audio Technica AT2020USB+
without any kind of audio editing
This is the audio technica AT2020+ with a little bit of equalization applied
So the next microphone is our last one on this list
But it's also the best one
This is the Rode NT1-A Studio Bundle Microphone
It goes for $230 and comes with a shockmount an XLR cable and a pop filter, plus they're smacking a 10 year warranty on it.
The only downside to this mic is that it requires 48v phantom power
Which means that you have to buy some kind of interface to connect it to.
And I have the Scarlett 2i2 which costs $99
And here's the audio sample
This is the Rode NT1-A Microphone without any kind of audio editing
This is the Rode NT1A Microphone with a little bit of Equalization applied.
So there you have it, those were the 4 best microphones you can get for YouTube....
...and voiceovers
So if you want to buy one of these
Go to the description down below
And there will be a couple Amazon links
Thanks for watching and I'll see you guys
In the next video...
peace!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
