tech me now today we're going to be
taking a look at my setup tour of early
2016 let's start with my recording desk
the desk is a matte white linman from
Ikea it's perfect for video behind this
desk I have some LED lights also from
ikea i'm swedish ok and on that desk i
have a desk lamp with a live faceculture
1000 smart light bulb in it and i
actually use that light bulb for video
lighting i plan on getting another
identical ones so that i can get
delighting more even so this is
basically where I do my Bureau most of
the time so the desk and stand right
beside us to that I have my router some
nvidia boxes and i usually store my
camera gear there but right now the
camera gear is obviously in use speaking
of camera gear my main camera is the
nikon d 3333 for art's lens but if i
need to get some wider shots i go to the
kit lens but i'm also planning on
getting a sigma 17 250 f 2.8 lens for
when I need the higher quality
wide-angle shots so on the desk that is
right besides of my actual setup desk I
store product boxes that I think look
cool and that's also the place of which
I store my watches and a few souvenirs
on this desk I do my homework and that's
about it moving on these are my two
shelves I mainly use them just to store
things that i will need in the future
such as review units cables and more
this is a guitar now don't get fooled by
this my brother gave me this I
definitely can't play guitar he gave me
this guitar because he was going to
Chicago to study and obviously he
couldn't take it with him and I kinda
just put it here because I think it
looks super cool moving along to the
more interesting stuff this is my actual
setup my main monitor is actually a new
edition it's the dell p24
16d and I will hopefully be doing a
review of it in a couple of weeks it's a
2560 x 1440 IPS display and it looks
beautiful to the right of that we have
something a bit less beautiful this is a
benq g 2 250 a 1080p VA panel and it's
nothing compared to the dell display my
keyboard of choice is still the cursor
gaming case M&amp;amp;E Cherry MX red switches
keyboard yeah and I pair that up with
the coarser m65 RGB mouse and for audio
I have the HyperX cloud tues my phone is
the iphone 6 plus right now I'm rocking
a matte white deer and skin on it but
I'm planning on buying some slick wraps
for it because I think that their
designs look much better especially the
Justin Mahler ones for my computer
speakers I have some logitech c4 to buy
one speakers they're definitely not that
powerful but they do sound good actually
I'm not that big of an audio file anyway
my microphone is 280 2020 plus x audio
technica it's a great USB microphone if
you don't want to be mainstream and by
the blue Yeti despite this because this
sounds exactly as good if not even
better and I also think that it has a
much more professional look to it and I
use this microphone with a pop filter
and a boom arm that's very much
important let's move over to the last
part of my setup the thing that I use
most you guess right my keys just
getting my computer of course it's
sports on I 7 4770k with the 16
gigabytes of ram and a gtx 760 for when
I want to do some CS go for cooling the
cpu i use the hyper 212 evo my
motherboard is the C 97x gaming three
from gigabytes for storage I have a one
terabyte seagate hard drive and a 120
gig samsung SSD and all of this is
housed in a fractal design define r4
case
so that is basically my set up if you
liked the video make sure to go damn
Daniel on that like button and I'll see
you guys in the next one peace thirsty
