surface pro styled PC but with a real
laptop keyboard and poor selection they
managed to put all the most vital
components behind the screen giving it
the ability to transform into a tablet
by just latching the screen from the
keyboard and when the keyboard is
connected you have access to a massive
battery and I dedicate a graphics card
you can latch and unlatch without
needing to restart the device so yeah
it's a super cool computer but as per
usual every piece of tech has its
up-and-down sides in this video we're
taking a look at five of those so let's
start with the likes the surface books
display is phenomenal its vibrant and
punchy the contrast is good and it's
extremely crispy at the 3,000 by 2,000
resolution if you're a techie you might
have noticed that that resolution is a
little bit odd that's because it's a
three by two aspect ratio display it's
the best aspect ratio for a smaller
display like this one it gives you a lot
more screen space I love it the keyboard
is also a major plus on this device I
don't know what it is specifically but
it just feels so great
typing on his keyboard right besides the
delete button is the unlocking button
hold it and the screen will unlatch from
the base this is in my opinion in great
design as it's very ruggedly built and
secure the battery life on the surface
book is fantastic it's the best I've
ever seen on a Windows device with the
base attached to it it could easily hit
about seven to nine hours of writing and
watching movies or videos if you're just
writing I'm sure it can last even above
10 hours but in tablet mode however it
just lasts around 2 hours which is
understandable as they had to fit all of
the components behind that screen and
therefore there's not that much space
for battery left over the charger is not
only convenient in one way that being
its portability but it also has a full
size USB port for charging another
device at the same time this is very
useful when you only have one wall
outlet to work with I also love the
build quality of the surface book the
hinge mechanism is robust the Pens
magnet is strong but not too strong and
the screen and keyboard has little to no
flex it's made out of aluminum all over
the place and therefore it feels like an
overall solid and tight package so with
the pros out of the way let's take a
look
five cons as mentioned before the
battery life in talat mode is bad really
bad you get two hours at max there is
really nothing Microsoft could have done
about it though there's just no place to
cram in a bigger battery and so
therefore about your life in the tablet
mode is just a compromise you have to
live with I am not very fond of the
headphone jack position it's on the top
right corner of the display now sure I
get that a headphone jack on the tablet
portion itself is needed but Microsoft
could have at least added one on the
left side of the keyboard base to
because it just looks and feels awkward
having it up there on the corner as I
said before every component like
motherboard CPU Ram SSD and so on is
placed in the tablet portion making that
heavier than a usual laptop with just a
display derp this is not noticeable when
the laptop is on a desk but once you
want to switch things over and actually
use it on your lap feels a little bit
top-heavy and like it could fall over
not a big issue at all I'm just
nitpicking here with Dells XPS laptops
having super tiny vessels the surface
book looks a little outdated
absolutely not by much but if they
shrunk down the slice of the vessel the
whole laptop itself could in turn have a
smaller footprint and therefore being
more portable and easy to carry around
USB type-c Thunderbolt 3 ports are
taking the laptop market by storm and
many big laptop manufacturers like Apple
Dell Asus and Acer are on the bandwagon
but Microsoft is not I'm not saying that
Microsoft has to go all-in like Apple
did but adding one or two of those ports
would not hurt at all so there you go
those were my five personal pros and
cons of the Microsoft Surface books let
me know what you guys think in a comment
section down below and I'll catch you
guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
