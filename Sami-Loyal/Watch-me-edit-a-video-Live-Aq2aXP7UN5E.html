let me close OBS and let me see like
we're streaming now yeah that all works
fine so the stream is actually going to
be started it was supposed to be started
to be started in 15 minutes but I'm just
starting it earlier to get some people
in so that they can watch and everything
so I know boss hello and chart a s
what's up how are you all doing welcome
to the stream tonight well not tonight
today where we are really just going to
be editing a video and what I'm going to
show you how i edit my videos on a Mac
in Final Cut Pro it's going to be a
review of let me see this laptop right
here if I can't get it up for you guys
this it's the vaio said bye Rosie flip
Lexor yes i am swedish no boss it's a
macbook pro 2015 15 inch so it's it's
got the quad core i7 but no dedicated
graphics it's pretty good actually i do
like mac i had a custom built pc before
and it was great but for media yeah for
the stuff that I do which is very basic
video editing Final Cut Pro works
fantastic so that's why I i basically
prefer
Final Cut Pro and mac / windows when it
comes to to media production but when it
comes to gaming up to it to gaming of
course it's going to be windows so like
so thank you very much thank you for the
compliment if you're if you're not
Swedish Lexor bit like so basically said
that in a very nice channel to me so
thank you very much and now before this
the this dream I I actually recorded the
voiceover for this review here in if in
a software called audacity it's actually
a a free software so you can download
that for yourself if you're interested
chardy s you deserve more subs thank you
very much I I appreciate that a lot so
before we start the video editing let's
edit the audio first basically oh I have
to to to also check with OBS the desktop
audio I'm not sure because you're
basically going to hear me twice like my
livestream and my recorded voice so let
me see here oh the playback device all
right playback device it's going to be
this a sleep port now that multi output
device a sleek portable laptop with a
trick up its sleeve the laptop is
available in all right you have a nice
accent thank you very much I guess Jace
JCP now JC VP 11 you how are you doing
I'm doing great sir thank you for tuning
in I never I have never used a macbook
but i would like to buy one yeah it's
awesome I'm I'm actually only 15 years
old many people think that's weird I
don't know why but i'm i'm 15 years old
this is the vaio said flip a sleek
portable laptop with so what we're you
know we have to fix the audio a bit
because it is some at first the audio is
a little bit too low and also we need to
cut so we need to so we need to compress
it and we need to put an equalizer on it
both for the for the base and for the
treble so what we're going to do is
we're going to click alt look control
all and we're going to click effect and
we're going to click compressor and
we're going to just leave it as it is
and compress this will make the audio
you have a higher like volume do you
ever speed the audio no I never speed up
the audio wow you look 16 to 17 low and
that's a compliment okay thank you I
guess so now we're going to do the
equalization so we're both going to be
doing a treble boost and a bass boost to
make the audio seem a little bit more a
podcast or radio like so we are going to
start with treble boost so here at in
the Select curve we are going to be
choosing a treble boost okay and now
we're also going to be choosing here we
are going to be choosing bass boost as
well you use a DSLR to record the video
footage it's not it's not a DSLR it's a
mirrorless camera it's this one is the
Panasonic g7 which looks like a DSLR it
is it pretty much a DSLR but the the
sensor is a mirrorless sensor slyfox
what's up bro how are you doing partial
what's up welcome to the stream so now
we have basically finished the audio
editing
so so let's so let's hear it this is the
vaio said flip a sleek portable laptop
with a trick up its sleeve the laptop is
available in three different versions
the cheapest one starts at 1799 yeah so
that's that's how I do the audio editing
and that sounds pretty good in my
opinion so let's export that so export
audio and let's put it into our desktop
and that should be vaio said flip review
and we're going to save it as vaio said
flip a voiceover save and okay just
gonna check so it's actually there this
is yep it's there all right now we can
close a audacity and we can shut off
this as well no so now we are going we
are we are going to go into final cut
pro which is the editing software that I
use now a couple hours ago I did shoot
some footage for this laptop i'm not
sure if i have enough so i might
actually leave some parts out because i
have to shoot more of it but i think i'm
going to give you a general
understanding of how i edit my videos
and that's the goal really so let's just
import the voice-over to Final Cut Pro
and we we could also use some music
right there's some background music but
we will do we will do that afterwards
because it's easier to do the voiceover
first and skip everything else so so
guys if you had like if you don't
understand anything I do or have any
questions regarding what I do in this
video's review let me know it in the
live comments and I'll try to
do my best to answer this and the laptop
that I'm using is the macbook pro 2015
15 inch and the laptop that i'm
reviewing is the vaio said flip it's the
US version so we have now imported the
let me see here the the voiceover this
is the so there you have that I guess
I'm just gonna I don't know it I don't
know if the audio is too high or too low
up its sleeve the laptop is available in
three different versions the cheapest
one starts at one I'm not sure if that's
actually too loud or too low so let me
know in the comments in the live comment
and I'll see if this audio is too much
or too low 1799 US dollars and gives you
a dual core i5 CPU paired with eight
gigs of ram and that should do it for
you guys so anyone just tell me what you
think of the audio say my name Jacob a
pill topped I don't know if that name is
Swedish Norwegian right or like anything
else but in a Swedish I'd say jakub up
we'll tuft so good it's good great now
let's try to import the footage to our
timeline don't know which shot to begin
with we have a lot to play around with
it Swedish okay good great we have a lot
to play around with here that I shot but
for the intro let's do kind of like an
overview shot of everything so let's
just import that and remove the audio
from it and let's make sure to not this
is the bios to just make sure to do the
panning right there now let's play that
this is the vaio said flip oh I I
up the focus there
in that shot the focus is on is on is on
the keyboard and not on the screen
portable laptop with a trick up its
sleeve I mean I guess it still works
yeah I'll have it you delay the laptop
is available okay blah blah blah let's
just take some shots for the intro how
much time does it take to edit a video
when you are not explaining everything
it doesn't take too long it's basically
just importing all the footage to to
with the timeline and just making sure
that what i'm showing in the actual
video pairs up with what i'm showing or
or what i'm talking about in the
voice-over it's it it's not hard it's
easy when you get when you get used to
it and doesn't take that much time it
takes maybe one hour at no not even an
hour like 45 minutes maybe but the thing
is i usually don't have all the shots i
need so i usually have to go back there
and shoot some more so yeah not too sure
how long it takes but we're just gonna
you know import all of these two
actuality timeline be different versions
dieci eps one starts at 1799 US dollars
you know here i would like to give the
viewer oh i would like to give the
viewer a picture of what they will get
for the price basically so that they
know what it's all about so i'm going to
take a screenshot of the bio a website
to show them the specs they get for the
start for the starting price and also
for the other price
or the other configurations so down
below here we should see that somewhere
yeah here so 1799 US dollars let's
screenshot this portion and import that
into our video editing software so save
image this just import it here on top
and make sure out that that's too big
obviously so transform and make it
smaller put it here maybe laptop is
available in three different versions
the cheapest z1 starts at one thousand
oh I should continue this on 799 US
dollars and give okay we should change
the this thing now we should do another
shot not sure which one I see fit but
let's just do like this one it's an easy
shot doesn't show anything special just
the laptop overall yeah let's do that so
seven hundred and ninety-nine years
dollars if you see a dual core i5 CPU
paired with eight gigs of ram and a
blazing-fast 256 gig PCIe SSD did you
buy it or did you get it for review so
you will have to return it yes I will
have to return it i got it for review
they actually contacted me and asked me
to review their products and so I said
yes and they sent me it and I have to
send it back in a couple of weeks you
paired with eight gigs of ram and a
blazing-fast 256 gig pcie SSD two
hundred dollars more upgrades to cpu to
this is where I six gig PCIe SSD this is
where I
stop that picture and I go back into our
note not pages into google chrome and
click the next configuration which is
two hundred dollars more which i say in
the video and I just screenshot that
portion as well my laptop the fans are
turning up really high now but that's
obviously because I I'm both streaming
and video and video editing 4k video at
the same time not too sure if it likes
that but it seems to work decent at
least a little bit the start stuttering
maybe finding episode and take
candleholder Noah tips Oh Bora the whole
circuit valid manga tech soccer the
hammer so yacht testable I'll take some
TP our videos poured on Latinos and it's
um CA hooliganism DNT embody our bro use
a comer your bro use nationally clear
and Commonwealth that you can move a
little video madness time we can comment
on some highest in telephone to example
and men do we have a bra useful ok guys
so that was some Swedish PCIe SSD to my
role is more upgrades oh that's there
that's the wrong picture isn't it that's
the wrong picture it's just the right
now this right picture this is your my
picture ok I got I got that wrong now
let's transform this as well make it
smaller to show everyone what you get
for two hundred dollars more CP
obviously there's a gap there that
should not be there
you know two hundred dollars more
upgrades to cpu to an i7 instead of the
i5 another and this is where I do the
next configuration to show to show them
what what you get for the price wishes
two thousand four hundred dollars like
like that's a lot that's a lot of money
for a two-in-one laptop I mean my
macbook its price was nineteen hundred
dollars and that has a quad-core i7 do
you live near PewDiePie no i don't
PewDiePie lives in in the UK if you did
not know but in terms of where he lived
when he was in Sweden I think it was a
Gothenburg and now I am nothing in
Gothenburg I'm in in the South school
honor even though I don't talk with a
Scottish accent I live in squalor this
out the southern part of Sweden 40 what
microphone would you recommend for
streamer with a two hundred dollar
budget 200 our budget that's you know my
microphone is on is an XLR microphone
and those tend to be more more expensive
plus you have to get a sound card to
plug it into which you have to add maybe
maybe one hundred dollars more and
that's like the minimum so in terms of
USB microphones those are usually much
more easy to use and setup and they're
just plug and play just go with either
like a blue jetty or something like the
audio technica at2020 USB that was my
old microphone it's fantastic i love it
that's tho tho those are some great USB
plug and play microphones
an i7 instead of the i5 another 400
change up the shot a little bit he
dollars on top of that gives you double
the ram and SSD storage so yeah there's
definitely no doubt about it it is one
chicken nuggets PewDiePie lives in
England yes he does black panna I'm
black one expensive that's great another
thing that I like it out about shows it
looks it's beautiful except that huge
forehead god there's always oh so
another thing that there's no doubt
about is it should change the shot here
do something a little bit more
interesting a little bit more
captivating so to speak but I need a
shot that shows its big forehead because
this this laptop has a huge forehead it
looks really out of place you see the
bezels here are huge but maybe that's
just because I'm used to the Dell XPS
lineup which has to infinity edge
display which is like super small but
let's choose a good shot that shows the
huge forehead maybe this one I guess
this shot works I do dank memes for a
living well that's fantastic no doubt
about okay no doubt about is it looks
it's beautiful except that huge forehead
god there's always something anyway is
it worth it well let's find out okay the
version I am taking a look at here is
the hyacinth maybe like this shot
okay well let's find them oh yes the
version I am taking a look at here is
the highest end one it costs a whopping
two thousand four hundred we can take
that shot again there or that picture on
top of here to show them the specs and
also the cost your dollars in terms of
connectivity oh now it's time for i/o so
now we need to what am i doing okay so
now I'm going to show the people the i/o
which is the porch selection so now i
will take those shots to show them that
so it's quite easy it's not a big deal
really it's just putting everything
together and making sure it it looks
nice and that that the video represents
what you're talking about has to super
speed USB type a ports and actually my
port oh now it's time for the other side
so it's the hdmi side now why did i do
that there you go let me see here
headphone jack and a college i need to
yeah looks good to me
headphone jack and a card reader so if
you guys have like a question just let
me know it's live so I can answer that
question live it's what makes it great
the build quality isn't all that great
it does have now it's time for build
quality all right so what could we show
in terms of build quality well not the
keyboard obviously not the screen what
could we show that represents build
quality hmm maybe well this is where I
need to shoot more footage so what I do
is I just continue leaving this spot
blank and then when I'm done with
everything else I know what I know what
shots I need so I'll go back there I'll
take out the camera and shoot some more
video and then I'll just pop them in to
the blank spaces and you know that's
that are a few metal panels but that is
not the same thing as having a full
metal design that's why the keyboard and
screen flexes a bit but it's also why
it's so light so in this regard it all
comes down to your own preferences in
terms of battery life now it's time for
battery life this is a spot where you
don't have to show anything special just
show the product and that's fine you
know so we'll just choose a random shot
like this one maybe I I do not like that
shot that's no I uh I got that shot was
not good you know the thing that is
funny with my videos is uh I try to make
the lighting as good as possible but
it's quite hard so you guys eat you
guys may not know this but the light
thing that i use for for liking my
videos are not soft
boxes or something like that its actual
it's light bulbs it's light bulbs that's
what I use for making my videos and yeah
that is quite ghetto it is but sometimes
it sometimes it actually works
phenomenal and sometimes it just does
not work i do think i need some some
soft boxes maybe so what camera do you
use for filming the computer the camera
that i used for filming the computer in
this video was the panasonic g7 with is
Sigma 30 millimeter f 1.4 lens it's a
great lens and a great camp of course 4k
you gotta have that 4k nowadays all
right I great it does the light so in
this regard it all comes down to your
own preferences in terms of battery oh
yeah we were at battery life sure but to
real life we could I guess we could show
just something like this something easy
it's a screen recorder what is the
screen recorder I'm not sure what you
mean but I guess something used to
screen recorder your life value is
advertised is in 11 and a half hours
which which will never act well era had
two witches which which is not good I'll
have to zoom in and remove that let me
see here which which which will never
act or switch switch
which switch with half hours which will
never video issue solved where are you
from I am from Sweden oh it's
advertising 11 and a half hours which
will never actually happen in real life
i'd say about seven hours of browsing
the web and browsing the web i could use
this shot this is one big shot one big
piece of footage okay please subscribe
I'm not going to subscribe to you sorry
anyway
Wow the fans are allowed on the macbook
pro I've never heard them the this loud
why well because I haven't seen your
content not sure sure if it's actually
good web and videos but not more than
that the keyboard is so now it's time
for the keyboard time to show them the
keyboard so that's this shot is good for
that now why am i assuming that there I
tell you what's up crap Co how are you
doing it's bad well that's that's too
bad try to make better content try to
make better content then if it and
getting you if you think it's bad just
try to make better content used to it is
a charm it's got backlit keys
surprisingly yellow a tinted ones but
it's there it's also got a few okay and
getting used to it is a Tron it's got
backlit keys surprisingly yellowy tinted
ones but it's there it's also got a few
quick tools like adjusting with the
quick tools now I need to show them the
quick tools of the keyboard which I
don't have a shot on which means that i
have to leave another spot blank for me
to shoot some videos later a screen
brightness and volume but weirdly enough
there is no media controls why the flip
mechanism so now it's time to show the
flip mechanism I think I have a pretty
decent shot here of me flipping the
screen around that is overexposed I
can't use that I can't use that oh yeah
I do have a shot maybe this one yeah
this one is I guess decent for that let
me see here where I do the flipping it's
funny how it says activate windows on
the laptop
I guess that's weird anyway this is
where I do the Flip mechanisms so that's
what I'm going to show the peeps now
volume but weirdly enough there is no
media controls why the flip mechanism is
quite genius to be honest with you just
like a switch and flip the screen around
it does look pretty badass the pen do
you like the macbook pro I I love Apple
but I don't have any products from them
I will get an iphone 5 and fall when my
mom will buy herself an iphone 8 do you
mean the iphone 7s well i do love my
macbook pro I really do it's fantastic
but I was actually a kind of a gamer
before now I can't play any games and
and I and I don't have the money to buy
a custom built pc so I'm just going to
buy a playstation 4 pro which is also
kind of interesting instead if lift
mechanism is quite genius to be on but
yes i like my macbook pro it's great the
iphone 5 is also great i had i had that
phone before loved it it was great nice
with you just like a switch and flip the
screen around it does look pretty badass
I mean iphone 7s s s chicken nuggets
nice dream thank you the thanks for
tuning in to get with the laptop is
quite good the pen that you get rid of
them is quite good all right let's show
them the pend and where do I have the
pen the pen is here yeah looks good to
me
looks good to me is that that was not
the post there's nowhere to put it but
when actually using it it works great
and if you're drawing for example and if
you're drawing for example palm
rejection works phenomenally okay let's
show them palm rejection then palm
rejection there we have palm rejection
now I meant the iphone 8 they're going
to be three phones released I'm not sure
about that if those are rumors um we are
not sure if there's going to be three
phones released not sure can you have
final cut pro for windows no you cannot
use Final Cut Pro for windows this is
only imagine that's a great palm
rejection job the screen itself is a
quad HD IPS touch display I think yes
there are Mac emulators for sure but it
isn't there the full experience I tried
one with my old custom built pc but i
was not very fun of it it did not run
that smooth ass as I think Mac should do
it's viewing angles are good it's sharp
clean punchy and just beautiful overall
I think I don't like however are those
huge vessels it looks straight out of
2007 well no actually the vessels were
smaller in 2007 this is where I need to
show them some pictures of vessels in
2007 so Rio 2007 just to give them an
idea of the fact that the bezels were
actually the same size in 2007 why don't
they make them smaller it's we are 10
years ahead but the vessels are still as
big around the screen I don't like that
so let me just take a picture like this
one okay save and let's import it here
of course we're going to make it smaller
as well of course so let me see here
like however are those huge vessels it
looks straight out of 2007 well no
actually the vessels were smaller in
2007 then there you go my mom has an old
sony vaio i don't know what here or
generation / model whatever yep we
actually have a very old sony vaio as
well it was decent back then but now
it's pure so we are smaller in 2007
the vaio said flip is a very portable
lab laptop indeed laptop indeed I mean
you can take it anywhere it's I think
this is where I need to do some other
shots to show them the portability of
the of the laptop and I don't have a
shot of that so so I will just have to
do that that that after the live stream
not so let's leave a blank space there
as well you can take it anywhere it's
light it's small it's quiet it's the
perfect on-the-go oh there are some my
pop filter is not working workhorse
given that you don't do any hardware
taxing work it's still a dual core
machine so video editing no video
editing no it cannot do that I'm sorry
yeah the laptop needs to be empowered to
work for some time well that's
interesting then then it's not a laptop
it's not it's not a laptop Evie if it
needs to be plugged in obviously I
thought that that is the issue with old
with them owned laptops the battery life
is really very bad video editing no 3d
modeling no music production no graphics
design maybe maybe
not too sure about that day here maybe
this one looks decent to me what do you
think about YouTube's new update I don't
know about any new updates of YouTube
please let me know what's going on it
isn't it annoying to edit a video like
this with questions no it's not annoying
it's awesome I like answering questions
signing tax forms yeah that probably
works so what about the new update I
have not heard of any updates of youtube
yet with so let me know you know sick
jokes out of the way no it's not that
bad if you're just the average new
layout on the pc i have not seen a new
light on the pc maybe that's because i'm
in sweden maybe they haven't rolled that
out yet but i have not seen a new layout
on the pc though doing document work
media consumption emailing web browsing
this laptop is quick AF quick AF i'm
opting it let me know in a minute if
it's sleek how do you update youtube on
a pc it's a website you can update a
website anyway looks like I've got some
updates 00 on windows maybe it's the you
mean the app for Windows yeah no I don't
use windows so I have not seen that
update at all AF and that's thanks to
its pcie-based SSD yeah
windows yes the app all right well now I
have not seen it because i don't use
windows pcie-based SSD storage working
at over to tap i will send megabytes per
second on the read side and one thousand
three okie dokie inside and 1300 on the
right side so hundred on the right side
i mentioned before that this laptop is
fantastic for media consumption but so
now we have more when you're up when you
update the chrome browser youtube
sometimes up to sing well or maybe just
great timing maybe that's just great
timing or maybe I just haven't update
updated youtube or chrome because I
don't see a new layout not on my side
which will never actually happen in with
plastic for media consumption but that
was maybe that was maybe it again I need
to fix that audio issue I said the same
thing twice that doesn't look good maybe
that was me maybe I was maybe but that
was me but that was me but that was that
that was maybe that was
media consumption be that was maybe well
that does not sound right sumption but
that was maybe that was maybe it that
was maybe that was maybe be that was
maybe a little a little let's just do
this instead no let's not do that but
that was made a little bit come on what
am i doing wrong this is the annoying
part be that way was maybe be that way
but that was maybe a little bit there we
go finally Wow Final Cut Pro animations
are sleek Apple his lake yes Apple is
very sleek that's that's what they're
known for hide and 1300 on the right
side I mentioned before that this laptop
is fantastic from media consumption I
guess this shot works why not this
laptop is fantastic for media
consumption but that was maybe a little
bit of a bold statement I mean the
screen is fantastic but the speakers are
not you probably have to wear headphones
so let's try to conclude this laptop is
it worth it and if so who is it for if
you want a sleek looking to win what is
sleek looking to win one laptop you know
the thing is we we are not going to stop
this to this stream with a finished
video because these gaps are places
where I need to shoot more footage but
i'm just going to show you what i do you
know so you guys all know about that and
maybe after maybe after i'm done with
the video we can do a Q&amp;amp;A as well that
would be quite nice I suppose
yeah so let me see here one laptop and
you don't happen to partake in any
hardware taxing okay oh now it's now
it's stuttering no it's not or is it is
it stuttering you don't and no but I
can't West audio in this clip I can't
see the audio there's the other volume
no volume there you on laptop and you
don't happen to partake okay and you
don't happen to partake in any hardware
oh it's lagging finally it's lagging you
know I'm streaming at the same time as
us i'm editing 4k video that might be
why it's stuttering small bit one laptop
and you don't happen to partake in any
hardware taxing work it's worth it but
that's not to say that it doesn't have
any competition because it certainly
does the del x and now i need to pull up
a picture of the dell XPS 13 dell XPS 13
two in one
that's it and now I'm just going to put
that into their space 13 to win one for
example so just make sure to do your
research inc now let's do like a final
letter a good shot at the final shot
maybe let's just see how this turns out
terms of pricing features you want to
make the perfect purchase for you so
there you have that that's my verdict
let me know what you guys think I guess
we could use this a standing piece just
to hear maybe and then delete delete
think about the vaio said flip in the
comments down below and I'll catch you
guys in the next video peace chicken
nuggets by that thanks for tuning in to
the to the string I appreciate it okay
so it looks like we got all the stuff
that we could get for the for this video
with with the footage that we are with
that we had already but there are some
gaps obviously that we need to fill in a
few metal panels but that is not the
same thing as having a full metal ring
so we need to where am i from I am from
Sweden it has two super speed USB type a
ports and actually my port headphone
jack and a card reader the build quality
isn't all that great it does have a few
metal panels hmm does have a few metal
panels I guess this would work ah yes
I'm from Sweden schooner
school is cool Yasim my family are not
from squaw net but I live in this corner
if that makes sense I guess this works
so let me see here have a few metal
panels but that is not the same thing as
having a full metal disc sign that's why
the keyboard and screen flexes a bit but
it's also why is so light you don't
sound squamish no I don't sound Spanish
because my family is not from schooner I
don't sound schoolish yeah that this
shot is probably the best shot to put
here stands tech videos what's of it is
that a donut that looks to me like
that's a donut well thanks for
commenting a donut that's awesome wait
at Stan I think you got the new macbook
pro right I think you have the new
macbook pro yes it's a donor awesome you
have the new macbook pro right is it
good let me know but it's also dude you
didn't you do not have in a new mac pro
so who was it yo yeah you built a
hackintosh right but there was some
somewhat some some other person who
deemed me that was going to get a
macbook I'm not sure who that was let me
check my dm's
not sure if I even remember who it was
to be honest this oh yeah i think it was
taking fusion maybe maybe taking fusion
I'll see who got the new macbook yes
tagging fusion yeah that was the guy who
with the macbook all right great so why
it's so light so in this regard it all
comes down to your own preferences in
terms of my sis in terms of battery life
value is advertising 11 and a half hour
panel boss headphone jack and a card
reader so now I have filmed in that gap
there's more gaps to fill in as well few
quick tools like adjusting discreet oh
yeah the quick tools we need to show the
show a picture or show a video of the
keyboards maybe because it's 4k maybe we
can zoom in a little bit now this is 22
purple now it works it certainly works
let me see here we're going to just zoom
in because I want them to see the quick
tools these right here this row of quick
tools screen brightness and volume but
weirdly enough there is no media
controls why the flip mechanism ok
that's great that works now there are
some more gaps to fill in as well maybe
here not indeed I mean you can take it
ok their portability after over the
laptop
do a how I shot that that I can use to
show that the portable of the macbook
not not the macbook the dell laptop
maybe this shot it shows that it's a
small but still very premium looking
laptop even though it's build quality is
not that fantastic not indeed I mean you
can take it anywhere it's light it's
small it's quiet it's god it's the
perfect on the workhorse given that you
don't do any hardware tech man the
compression on that on that idea was not
good not good compression at all well
it'll have to be like that so so you
built a hackintosh how is it let me know
and what are the specs I'm not sure if I
remember the specs of it in that you
don't do any hardware taxing work it's
still a dual core machine so video
editing so really adding new ok got a
few more gaps no just one more gap to
fill in awesome one more gap hundred on
the right side I mentioned before that
this laptop it wait what hundred on the
right side oh and maybe this shot no
something that shows hmm
read read and write speeds yeah let's
just take this it's decent it's a decent
shot right side I mentioned before that
this laptop is fantastic for media
consumption okay so it looks like the
video is finished now we just need some
background music and then we are going
to upload it to youtube so background
music honey I definitely do need to find
some new background music so let's try
to do that instead epidemic sound come
on epidemic sound I'm going to login not
show you the details let me see here
Robin TV login sign in and we're signed
in awesome
it's sick it's running the latest
version of Sierra 1012 dot 3 that's
awesome well that's great let me just
see which version I'm well this excerpts
here I had an update for Mac Sierra yeah
10 12 3 i'm going to update that after i
have uploaded the video let's try to
find some music for this video so cpu
six then gen core i3 6100 cool gtx 750ti
that that's a great card got the ram ram
the motherboard storage pink peignoir
SATA SSD yeah you know yes SSDs are
really quick they're awesome but the fun
thing is in the macbooks they have the
pcie ssds which are super quick and like
oh my god they're this macbooks a speed
in terms of hard drive or SSD storage
speed is 2000 megabytes per second and
what and what and what 1300 on on the
right side have so have so Sean the
video Swedish fika Carl on this on yes
on Swedish I am
I'm not going to use that song right now
I'm just looking for some music is for
some background music I do like that
Jesus Christ so quick yes it's super
awesome it is so that song is quite cool
quite smooth quite soothing that's cool
too also my hag Natasha what 450 well
that is fantastic value for the money
fantastic
with a 750 Ti well that's that's a deal
it sure is that's one great deal 450 so
how is how I mean how how is the
computer when you're editing videos
because you know it's not it's not the
genuine Mac hardware is it good or is it
slow let me know where did I put there
it's here okay let's just bring these in
here and here and close that and clean
that up and let's just import these two
songs and put them as a background track
yeah oh you use premiere pro yeah oh you
bought most of the parts during black
friday okay have you seen the video
Swedish week and no I have not well
maybe I have but I don't remember the
title exactly so maybe I have maybe I
have not oh yes Premiere Pro works like
super good with nvidia cards because
because of the optimization for the cuda
cores dab dab 13 hello welcome to the
stream how are you doing so for anyone
who has not been here for a while right
now i'm just adding the background music
to to this stuff up this available for
400 maybe 20 26 decimals a blazing-fast
256 gig PCIe SSD two hundred dollars
more upgrades to cpu except that time
that's why the keyboard and screen
flexes a bit but it if there is no media
controls given that you don't do any
okay that's one song if I was going to
use Final Cut Pro I would get an AMD GPU
yes
that is for certain but you I mean my
macbook has the the integrated graphics
and I don't see any issues at all I'm
running to to 1440p displays off it
right now and it does just fine which is
kind of interesting so that this the CPU
is doing a lot of work right now at two
1440p monitors plus plus its own monitor
+ 4k video editing plus streaming it all
to youtube so i mean that's that's great
ok well that's something that's an
interesting comment in that you don't do
any hardware taxing work it's still I do
a core machine so video editing no video
editing no signing tax forms yeah that
probably works this laptop is fantastic
for media consumption but that was maybe
a little bit of a mac OS is way more
optimized than windows yes it is way
more optimized but that's also because
it only runs on certain hardware so
that's intel cpus and and stuff like
that so well actually i'm not sure why
it's that optimized that more optimized
then windows don't know why but it is
for sure really yeah it is bold
statement I mean the screen is fantastic
but the speakers are not you probably
have to wear headphones so let's try to
conclude this laptop is it worth it and
if so who is it for if you want a sleek
looking to win
on laptop and you don't happen to
partake in any hardware taxing work it's
worth it but that's not to say that it
doesn't have any competition because it
certainly does do you know Benigno knows
why it just is yeah excited everything
that's weird for example so just make
sure to do your research in terms of
price and features you want to make the
perfect purchase for you so there you
have that that's my verdict let me know
what you guys think about the vaio said
flip and the comments down below and
I'll catch you guys in the next video
peace that sounds perfect to me come on
I mean that that that that's a video
that's the video done now let's oh this
is going to be interesting I'm going to
render this video at the same time as
streaming it all to YouTube + + running
to 1440p display soffit let's see how
quick it is do you use the YouTube end
cards on your videos no i don't but i
should i really should but i am lazy
cool really liking your video content on
your channel and your style look and
feel of your vids thank you very much i
really do appreciate that of course I
came I came just when he finished it
well yes you did but you still have time
to ask questions regarding anything you
want plus I'm going to be uploading this
video right now to YouTube you know so
you can wash it if you want so let's
just save it as voz flip the review and
now we're going to see how fast it
renders even though it runs a bunch of
stuff of it so one percent already two
percent okay it's not it's definitely
not not
the quickest it can be because it can be
super quick that is when when I'm not
running any monitors off it and when I'm
not in na streaming obviously where am i
from I am from Sweden I have I have
answered that quite a lot now I'm from
Sweden not from any other country Sweden
Sweden Sweden so now we're we're just
just rendering the video if you guys
have any questions regarding anything at
all just let me know in the live video
and I'll try to answer them while this
is rendering and then also while it's
uploading and then and then want it once
it's uploaded it can go up like that so
x noob gaming me too you thought I where
from 99 Nigeria well I'm not too bad are
you using a Mac yes I am as you can see
there I'm using a Mac how did you start
your YouTube channel i clicked create a
google account and then i went to
youtube com and i clicked create a
youtube channel that's how I start
started my youtube channel no but I just
the the thing is with being a tech
youtuber you kind of have to both like a
cameras and tech in general because if
you don't like cameras then I mean
that's a problem because because you
have to use your camera will you be
getting the Lumix G 80s last g85 no I
will not the g7 works perfectly fine for
me if I am ever going to be upgrading
upgrading upgrading that would be to a
agh five probably what program do you
use for video for video editing I use
Final Cut Pro which is the software that
is on your screen right now boy are you
gonna get a pc I'm not going to get a pc
it's too it's too expensive for me and
the thing is if I if I'm gonna get a pc
it has to be pretty well SPECT in my
opinion but I have it I have in a
macbook that works perfectly fine and
the only thing that is better if for me
in Windows is gaming but for foot for
that I'm just going to get it a console
instead like a piece for pro or an xbox
one else instead that only descendants
can okay so I'm now going to teach you
Swedish alright so if hello is hey
that's it h e j because Apple isn't
expensive well Apple is very expensive
but I saved up for this a long time and
I cannot not save up for it if for
something that costs the same again
because I have other stuff to save to
anyway a disease and then I seaman eat
this early all right then the food royal
think if the stream is not fun for you
then just go this dream is just here to
show you what I do it when it when it
comes to to the production and that's it
and that's it so if you don't like just
go well that's sad
I got my hackintosh to dual-boot Sierra
oh and windows so i can play GTA well
that's fantastic that's what a
hackintosh is great for so we're at
eighty-five percent where soon we're
soon finished rendering and we're soon
going to start uploading so eighty-eight
percent eighty-eight percent once again
if you guys have any questions
whatsoever just let me know for Fleiss
is in you tuned in and the wrong time
because I'm i just finished the video
I'm rendering at the moment and we have
a bunch of Swedish people in here that's
interesting shouldn't you guys be at
school okay so i just rendered the video
it's it's done right it's oh it's 4pm
maybe you should not be at school 799 US

paired with eight gigs of ram and a
blazing-fast 256 gig PCIe SSD 200 I'm
taking another sick day well that's as
bad get well No ok well I was off school
today we had a so-called studia dog in
Sweden here which is a day where you're
supposed to study but i'm not studying

my channel with three days left that's
great go to his channel if you want to
win a game pad so the video is all is
all rendered we're going to upload it
now so there's the video file oh and by
the way I have one thing to show you
guys that is quite interesting it's this
come on get over here internet speed is
quick this is quick fiber for the
win over for the win and the fun thing
is that i am still streaming at the same
time I am streaming at 4,000 at a 4000
bitrate come on 478 down and 200 up
that's awesome it is awesome no don't
don't don't don't get me do this again
well I'm sorry I I have to show it it's
awesome I had like well like before I

megabits down and like 0.3 up it was
horrible but now it's all awesome
you have 100 down and 10 up that's
exactly what I had before as well
exactly what I had before and why am I
so overexposed I get 38 up that that is
actually good it's not 200 but it's it's
Oh down well that's fine too seven is
that down or up let me know let me know
so this video file is 1.5 8 gigabytes
let's upload it to YouTube one percent
two percent three percent four percent
five percent it's quick it's extremely
quick like that's one and a half gangs a
4k video it's uploading in two minutes
up okay so let's do this vaio z
flip is syd worth and where's the dollar
sign there 2004 it's not a good title
holy man that that's the dream yes
it is the dream it is crazy to mega but
not to two minutes to upload a
one-and-a-half gig file which mike are
you using i am using what was it again
it's the rode nt1-a know it's a rode
nt1-a is it let me check yes it's this
Mike it's the rode nt1-a anniversary
vocal condenser microphone package
exactly this one this is exactly what I
got
but keep in mind you still have to get
as a sound board to connect it to so
that's an extra one hundred dollars I i
uploaded a three-game file once
accidentally and it took over 15 hours
Wow 15 hours that's a lot of time to
upload a video so title description vol
volume then click portable I have I Mike
I was just wondering yeah sure and I was
just letting you guys know that if
someone was to get this Mike you have to
have a sound board as well so now we're
going to do the amazon com referral
links let's vaio z flip pass the laptop
and text copy paste
I did not the realized i selected yo the
uncompressed file oh oh I remember the
days I would leave my i three laptop on
foot in height to render then set an
alarm for 3am to upload it so it's ready
for the morning the grind was real
that's awesome it is awesome that's
called dedication so okay UK and that
will be Rio said flip if it's even
available here it's not available in the
UK so what I do then is I just click
text and I just get the search as the
ref link instead so so if it ever oh no
crap so if it if it ever gets so so
there it pops up is it snowing where you
are no it's not snowing it's weird it's
Sweden it's like a very northern part of
the world and there's no snow here well
I am in the in the southern part of
Sweden but in the middle and above there
is a lot of snow so yeah the fun thing
is with YouTube right now is that the
processing takes more time than it then
it takes for me to upload that is weird
we have the goal of thumb and yes we
have the goal of Thurman which gives us
the the warmth then grant through the
hemispheres yes it's green I outside of
my house as well so vios said value that
lip flyers at the lake review
let me see what people search for vaio
said flip 2016 yet Rio said flip 2016
review drawing all right maybe chu body
has some suggestions maybe English
review yes english review but bond
George's no I cannot I'm not French I
don't do finish well you're talkin
American cities in a videos tigana the
in essence volley Lotus on the air nano
encircle poor Dom had put forward estan
described it in so so far youtube
boarded in t tell Dean Dean basically
evening octagon ax at kelapa so if i'll
tag an amateur media some some some non
ha scary within so hardened videoxxx in
once at the comedy circus with tata
today they're my yard that's what you do
basically rio
conversation science and technology
looks good to me now what we need to do
now is also add this message here oh
yeah we need to do attitude reviews as
well Toby how did you learn to speak
English well it was not school
definitely not school it was just
watching a bunch of YouTube videos and
movies and somehow I I I got decent I
got decent at English yeah we learn
English in third grade in school but
it's not at my level like the level that
the people in my class are at the moment
they are you know not not not not not as
good as me um I'm sorry but they have
not yeah I don't know what to say but in
class at the moment we don't learn
English at the level of of what I'm
speaking or what I'm capable of so
that's all cool so let's just let this
process youtube on you they're noobs
yeah they're kind of noobs some people
are good but most of them are not so for
the thumbnail we are going to use two
buddies who just take out a picture from
this video and use it as a thumbnail as
I do which with every single piece of
video that I upload is easier that way
and we do however need to do a thing
here on our thing here so we need to add
videos because i have uploaded more
reviews that will be this and that as
well here you go now we have that that's
also not the postman kin rest moves
Carlson Rasmus Carlton King all right
vaio said flip is it worth 2499 US
dollars everything looks good to me this
I delete because it's wrong and let's
add a message new video
okie dokie do people at your school
watch your videos yes they do not all
not all of them and not maybe that
regularly regular very but yes they know
about my videos and some of them watch
them a little bit now and then which is
weird it is weird it feels weird a fun
thing is even my teachers wash my videos
some of my teachers have watched my
videos and they like them so that's
that's thumbs up processing two minutes
remaining if you have any questions just
let me know alright alright alright
let's let's let's check some some of the
website stats I don't know why my
website is so slow my host must be
really bad my host is really really bad
the host is the hosting service I use
it's cheap but it's not it's not fast
not for me at least
come on come on come on come on come on
there you go I'm just gonna check some
stance because let me see last 30 days I
find it crazy how many school friends
watch my videos who without me knowing
yes I do too it's weird they're very low
key about yes some are but your best
friends are not that they're very very
very annoying at sometimes at times one
kid at my school made gaming
commentaries that / storytime videos
where he just dissed the school then he
got expelled Wow well that's too bad for
him too bad for him like this review is
doing very well Carmen Phoenix three HR
review got 511 unique leaders and I have
never made a written review before so I
guess that's a plus that's a plus
referring web sites google com yeah I
I'm walking home from school well
awesome people wash my in class that
much like that much must feel very bad
ija she is his channel but they made him
delete most of the videos how can they
make him delete videos like I mean as
long as he's not doing anything illegal
or against you YouTube's Terms why would
they make him delete his videos
this is the vios pcie SS so yeah there's
I am taking a look at here is the
highest end one it is great good it's
sharp Joe doing document XPS 13 to win
one I like the background music I I got
there but what I'm gonna do now is I'm
going to wait for this to process to 4k
so that so that i can get a thumbnail
from it and then i'll click on this
button to make it live it for you guys
to watch because he called one of the
teachers a dick head and they did not
like that well i'm sure they did not
like that but i guess yeah i mean that's
not very nice to say but it's also not
that big of a reason to expel him from
the school i guess and make him delete
his channel no his videos so let me just
see if this is processed yet to at least
not 360p squad 360p still add 360p just
waiting just waiting this reading this
meeting you're gonna have to wait for
this to become like 1080p at least and
then i can ok now it's 1080p so now
let's bring out a thumbnail from this
video like a good point that looks good
you know maybe something like the oh
yeah this is good this is a good
thumbnail
look back a little bit back back back
back back back back back back back back
back back that's it probably a pretty
good thumbnail hmm maybe maybe not what
do you guys think is this a good
thumbnail or is it a bathtub male let me
know maybe that's not even in focus
maybe this or maybe I don't like you too
much well I'll have to keep looking them
rawtube no again thumbnail yeah all
right I've got one person who likes it
and one person that one was good oh so
you did like that one okay one of the
