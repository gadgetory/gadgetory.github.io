another video in this one we're taking a
look at a pre demint arresting router
system from asus this is called the
Liberace o AC 750 mesh Wi-Fi system
corner to corner Wi-Fi this specific
package features three Lehrer trio hubs
of course as you would have guessed by
the three ones here and of course the
trio in the naming and they're supposed
to cover up to 5,400 square feet in your
home so in this video I figured we will
take a look at its packaging and unbox
it and then of course also show you guys
some of its features and specifications
so without any further ado let's get
these out of its box and there they are
neatly packed so these are pretty damn
small routers actually and what they do
is they all connect to each other to
form a unified network basically between
three different points in your house so
what this does is it basically asks you
guys could have guessed it increases the
coverage and the signal strength in your
home anywhere you are basically so on
the back here it features your power DC
in Port your Al and /r and port for
connecting a PC or something like that
to the network and of course the
Ethernet port where your internet comes
in - all in all it features a very
modern and contemporary design it's
small so it will definitely be able to
be placed in tight spaces like wardrobes
and stuff like that if you don't want it
to be seen but then it also features a
pretty nice design so that if you have
to have it out in the open doesn't
matter because it looks quite good on
the bottom here we have three rubber
feets so that it stays in place and
doesn't rattle around and also we have
some holes for ventilation here and also
if you would like to you have a mounting
system here so that you can mount them
on your wall down here we have a reset
button and a pair button - so of course
we got three of these so let's pull
those out and check what else we have in
the box alright so I'm just gonna pull
this up there we go so of course here we
have three power bricks and cables for
each
of the three lira hubs we have our
manual which for some reason looks to be
in a language that I do not understand
and we have what's this our manual in
many different languages great in here
we have just one Ethernet cable which is
kind of sad I wish that they would have
provided a one for each of them at least
but okay maybe they're supposed to go
here because there was nothing here so
maybe when you purchased this for
yourself
you get three of them here because this
is a review unit and it might have been
an early unit and so and so that's why I
got only one Ethernet cable and these
things in a different language but no
problem so now let's talk about how
these work how they would work for you
and and their features and
specifications so the main thing about
these is it will of course increase your
range throughout your entire house but
also it will strengthen the Wi-Fi signal
because you have these three hubs that
all provide a nice and even field along
your house instead of just having one
router for example in this corner of
your home and then of course if you were
to be in this corner of the home the
signal would not be so strong whereas
with these aces Lehrer trios you could
have one hub there and maybe one hub in
the middle and then one in the end or
something like that this will of course
provide the best signal wherever you may
be in your house of course this also
works great for multi-story homes so it
could stack these on top of each other
to get a much better signal up top so
asus describes these as a dual band tri
hub mesh Wi-Fi system with a unique
antenna placement which supposedly
should deliver strong Wi-Fi to every
corner of your home they feature 3x3
MIMO technology instead of 2x2 and
seamless roaming which delivers superior
Wi-Fi speed and automatically connects
you to the best
you know and we're in your home so for
example if you were to be in the middle
of your home it would automatically
connect to this hub and then if you were
to move here let's say this is your
living room it will automatically
connect to this hub without actually
changing which network you are connected
to this means you only have to have one
Wi-Fi system in your phone or laptop and
just one password and then these will
automatically talk to each other and
tell which device should be connected to
which hub another cool thing here is
when you set these up you won't have to
have a PC with you because they now have
this new Asus Lyra application on your
phone which enables PC free setup and
network management and diagnostics and
notifies you about any problems on your
phone now these have their antennas here
so one here one here and one here it's
supposed to minimize interference and it
transmits the Wi-Fi signal vertically as
well as horizontally for better
reception and performance in multi-story
homes it also has all of the nice stuff
such as malicious site blocking infected
device detection and blocking it has a
free lifetime subscription to all of
these features it's got parental
controls so that you can schedule times
and stuff like that it automatically
updates itself it's a course running on
the latest wpa2 encryption protocols etc
etc etc it's a very high-end system and
of course this all comes at a pretty
high price tag or around I think three
to four hundred dollars now these are
also available in two and one hub
options instead if you have a smaller
home so with all this said I want to
thank you for watching this overview
video of the Asus Lyra trio hub and
please feel free to like subscribe and
comment down below if you have any
questions and yeah I'll see you guys in
the next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
