another video today we're doing
something very different first of all
the microphone setup is kind of weird at
the moment that's because my lab leer
microphone has stopped working this is
called a gadget crate and it's a bio
monthly subscription box of tech and
gadgets and this is very very exciting
for me because I always love the concept
of monthly subscription boxes like loot
crate and this is kind of the same
concept just with gadgets and tech
instead of gaming accessories and
collectibles and stuff like that so if
you guys are interested in checking this
out or maybe even purchasing one
yourself and the link is down below so
without any further ado let's get
straight into the box all right we got a
letter here alright we have got some
very interesting stuff in here so first
of all this stands out a lot the
Bluetooth sound square juice small
speaker big sound the jelica dual
Universal grip and stand for your mobile
device designed in Finland
hey that's close to me Alena Sweden
mobile stand hand grip car mount
interesting we'll take a look at that
later we've got ourselves the woosh tech
hygiene screen shine I could really use
this because my stuff is all dirty so it
looks like they have included a
microfiber cloth and some kind of
cleaning thing here you got our self
power tabs okay so this is actually also
very interesting it's a battery we'll
definitely take a look at this assume
and the last thing we have in our box
here today the gadget crate is the Nomad
key for Android micro USB charging cable
built into your key basically so this is
what you get in the gadget crate let's
just run through everything tell you
what it does and what it is specifically
and then we're done so we've got the
Bluetooth sound square wireless
bluetooth speaker small I don't expect
it to have you know any decent punch
or sound quality but it's definitely
going to be louder and better sounding
than your mobile device we have got the
jelica the jhalak dual it's a you is a
universal grip and stand for your mobile
device we have got ourselves these
things called power tabs which I think
look interesting but may not be that
good for the environment maybe because
they're just one time use batteries so
let's take a look it's basically just a
very simple battery you just plug this
into your iPhone and that's for your
Android phone and it charges and when
it's empty when it's empty you cannot
use it again and this is called the
Nomad the gnome and key for Android it's
basically a key which has both ends for
charging so that's both a microUSB maybe
not that updated anymore because most
new phones are using the USB type-c
standard and what you do is to just plug
that into the computer and plug that
into your phone and it charges and
transfer data the last thing we got is
called the whoosh tech hygiene a screen
shine screen cleaner so that said what
do you guys think of what you get in
this box 439 quid pounds UK pounds let
me know in the comment section down
below and while you're at it please
click that like button and subscribe if
you haven't already and I'll catch you
guys in my next video I don't know how
to do this in hand gestures but I'll see
you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
