basically being the best Windows laptop
out there it's got this nice balance
between portability and power but as per
usual nothing's perfect so in this video
we're taking a look at the main pros and
cons of the new Dell XPS 15 95 16 I'll
also make a full review video which will
be done in a week or so so without any
further ado let's get into the pros
first and then move our way into the
cons as always the XPS PCs are very well
built the XPS gives seem even more so
the carbon fiber is soft touch coated
chassis is backed up by aluminum panels
which both makes it look better and
gives the laptop a nice sense of
sturdiness the screen has no flex and
the same goes with a great keyboard and
therefore I genuinely think that the
Dell XPS 15 is one of the best built
laptops in the Windows market the one
thing you've all been looking at though
is that display with its tiny
surrounding vessels it doesn't only look
good they also let Dell shrink the
device itself which made the XPS 15 one
of these smallest 15-inch laptops out
there display wise you've got two
options
either the 4k touch one or the 1080p non
touch one and it both look great the
1080p display has a matte anti-glare
coating on top of it and the 4k touch
one has a piece of glass in front of it
instead they're both IPS displays which
means that color accuracy and viewing
angles are on point but in terms of
which one you should choose a lot you
know soon the Dell XPS 15 is powerful
the model I have is featuring the latest
seventh gen Engler core i7 7700 HQ
quad-core processor 16 gigs of fast ddr4
Ram and insanely quick 512 gig nvme SSD
and is surprisingly powerful and vidya
gtx 1050 dedicated graphics card the PC
can do everything from basic tasks like
browsing the web and watching high-res
video to more demanding tasks like photo
editing graphics design and 1080p video
editing with ease if you like me someone
who does creative work but also like to
play games a little bit now and then the
gtx 1050 GPU can easily
games like csgo rocket League and
overwatch at 1080p it can even handle
battlefield 1 at 1080p with medium
settings at around 50 fps so yes the
Dell XPS 15 is very powerful for its
size I also like the keyboard and
trackpad on the XS 15 the keyboard has a
decent tactile bump so you know when a
key is pressed it's got a good layout
with very useful quick toggles and
switches like audio control screen
brightness and more the trackpad is
smooth and the gesture controls work as
they should I like them both a lot and
in my opinion they're the best on any
Windows laptop out there in terms of
inputs and outputs it's looking pretty
good on the left side you have the
charging port a full-size USB port HDMI
USB type-c Thunderbolt 3 which can be
used for various different things such
as connecting a display and adapter
worried doc like this one from count
digit next to that is the headphone jack
on the right side there's a Kensington
lock a battery life indicator very
useful another full-size USB port and a
full size SD card reader looking good
now let's talk about the displace again
because depending on which one you get
it will either be a pro or a con in my
case it's a pro as I've got the low res
1080p model so what's the pro well
battery lives on a 1080p model I got
great battery life of around nine hours
of browsing the web seven hours of video
playback and around three hours of video
editing very respectable if you've got a
4k display though you can expect an
amazing display but with lesser battery
life I'm not entirely sure as to how
much you're losing but based on other
reviews it's pretty bad as touched on
before and as you can probably tell the
laptop is very small and portable for
the power it's got it weighs just over
two kilos or 4.4 pounds and I mentioned
wise it's smaller than most 15 inches
out there thanks to the aforementioned
bezels
it's also quiet the sand doesn't spin at
all when doing this normal daily tasks
it does spin up however when using the
laptop for more demanding tasks and even
when it's at full speed it doesn't have
that loud and high-toned
whine which is what most people get
annoyed by the fan is just there when it
has to my last Pro in this video is the
SSD which I touched on before as being
insanely fast but that single sentence
does not justify how great this SSD is
rebooting booting turning off starting
applications loading applications and
data and so on is extremely quick and
makes the XPS 15 feel more responsive
and quick this SSD technology is
definitely the future and you can expect
to see it in many other flagship laptops
moving forward so with their pricing out
of the way let's talk about the
not-so-good stuff first up the webcam
it's bad the video nor the audio quality
is good and the placement of the camera
itself doesn't help in any way either if
you're going to be attending video calls
a lot this laptop might not be for you
the speakers are also back there placed
on the underside which muscles the
already not-so-great sounding audio it's
not like they're the worst speakers it's
just that you can expect better sounding
speakers of a laptop of this calibre
this next con is a huge nitpick but also
an easy sticks from downside take a look
at this doesn't look very professional
that's it come on Dell it's an easy fix
just put some kind of noise or indents
over there
my last con is the price of the laptop
itself it's great but definitely not
cheap Dell themselves actually make a
laptop with the same specs inside of a
less premium and more thick package the
Inspiron 15 75-67 and if you don't care
about the keyboard trackpad and build it
that much get that instead in conclusion
however the pros of this fantastic
laptop definitely outweighs its cons by
a lot it's genuinely the best Windows
laptop I've ever used and I can
recommend it to anyone interested in a
powerful yet sleek portable and well
built laptop thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
