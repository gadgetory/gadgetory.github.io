a slam this is the Nokia six which is
going to be released this year it's
actually an Android phone instead of a
Nokia branded operating system which is
phenomenal its 2017 it's just not worth
it to develop your own operating system
and getting enough developers to create
apps for you the only way to go is
Android Nokia are going for more of a
budget phone rather than an expensive
flagship phone for their first
smartphone release of 2017 so what's the
price going to be it's going to be two
hundred and fifty US dollars so what do
you get well you get a metal built with
a snapdragon 430 processor paired with
four gigs of ram and 64 gigs of storage
that sounds great
it's also got a 16 megapixel back facing
camera and an 8 megapixel front facing
camera the screen is a 1080p IPS display
so it's not AMOLED but that's fine it's
pixel density is 401 and of course as
its 2017 again the phone is going to be
rocking Android nougat in terms of
battery size we do not know the capacity
yet so with the specs out of the way
let's talk about availability the
problem with this phone release is that
right now it seems like it's only going
to be available in China at the retailer
jingdong or JD comm I am not sure if
it's going to be available for
international shipping though but that
would definitely be great in future
releases though I do think that their
phones are going to be available
worldwide or at least I hope so in terms
of value I think that we are sitting at
a good price to spec ratio the CPU is
going to be handling social media and
all that stuff so do not worry about
that in terms of heavy weight gaming
though it might be more of a struggle so
that's the phone I think it looks good
and has great value so Nokia I welcome
you back to the industry let's not screw
this up so guys what do you think about
the Nokia 6 please do let me know in the
comments down below

watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video
