phones with good specifications and a
near stock Android for a relatively good
price and although they have increased
the price a tad bit this year is no
exception as compared to the latest
flagships from the likes of Samsung and
Apple going for around $1,000 550
doesn't sound that bad but of course
every device whatever it is has its ups
and downs so in this video we're going
to take a look at five of the oneplus
sixes pros and cons starting with the
pros and the most obvious one its
specifications with the snapdragon 845
the Adreno 630 GPU and a whopping 8 gigs
of ram the oneplus X may very well
support the best course pacification on
any Android device right now another big
Pro with this year's release from
oneplus is its flagship like build
quality and while it does miss a few
standard flagship features like wireless
charging and waterproofing the overall
feel and look of it is definitely up to
par with for example a samsung s8 or s9
oneplus has always been more interested
in stock Android rather than stocking
the phone with a bunch of features the
users won't ever use this time around we
have got the same experience which in
this case is Android 8.1 with a few cool
features added like for example the
alert slider which lets you quickly
switch from ring to vibration and also
to silent mode the battery life is not
on the level of let's say a blackberry
key one however with - charging which by
the way is the fastest form of fast
charge I have ever experienced it isn't
too bothersome whatsoever as topping it
up is extremely fast and for my last Pro
we have got quite an obvious one just
like the first one the price for what
you're paying around $550 you're getting
a lot of the traits that you'd expect to
see in a flagship but at almost half the
price but that's not to say it doesn't
have any cons because it definitely does
so make sure to listen up so
you don't miss anything vital before
deciding on this phone with this release
oneplus decided to follow the trend and
put a glass back on its flagship killer
which when I first saw it seemed like a
great thing as that will enable wireless
charging but that hasn't been the case
so even though it meets the requirement
for wireless charging it doesn't
actually have it another annoying thing
to me was that its speaker even compared
to the cheaper zenfone 5 sucks it's not
loud it sounds tinny and obviously it's
not stereo which makes it very easy to
muffle it in landscape mode the display
is great mostly the colors are good the
blacks are great as it's an AMOLED
display the resolution is definitely
good enough and the bezels are small
just like you want them in 2018 the only
issue I have with it is that it doesn't
get very bright compared to flagships
which can be quite annoying outdoors at
the launch event oneplus talked a little
bit about how they focused on making the
device more water resistant which is
good and all but they didn't actually
give it an IP rating which means that
even though it'll probably take it no
problems I wouldn't be comfortable with
using it around the pool I usually don't
need to expand the storage of my phone
as I stream all the content buy a watch
and I rarely take any pictures or
selfies but I know you guys out there
definitely do so it's quite sad that
this phone which is supposed to be a
device for the power user by the way
does not have a micro SD card slot so
those were my personal pros and cons of
the 1 plus 6 let me know what you guys
think or if you have anything to add to
that list in the comment section down
below and with that said I want to thank
you for watching have a nice day and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
