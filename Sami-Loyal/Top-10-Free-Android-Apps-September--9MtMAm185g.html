starts I just want to give a huge shout
out to dot tech domain for sponsoring
the channel go ahead and go to WWE Tag
to register your own tech domain for
only 299 a really good price so go ahead
and do that after the video yo what's up
guys to be your back with another video
and today we are going to be taking a
look at 10 awesome apps that you can
download for free to your android phone
the Google Play Store links to all of
these applications will be down below in
the description also please do let me
know in the comments down below if you
would like to see more videos like this
so let's get started the first app is
called screener it's basically an
application that you can use to put your
screenshots on a picture of the phone
that you're using me myself I use this
application when I want to share my home
screen on social media it just looks a
lot better than just uploading the
screenshot itself so the next
application is a great free screen
recorder called a said it's very simple
to use and is also very customizable for
example you can change the resolution
the frame rates the bit rates and even
more you can also do things like time
lapses recording audio from your
microphone and face cam the app has
everything that you need the next
application is called camscanner and
it's great for people who doesn't have
access to a scanner but still has to
scan a document it's very easy to use
and works great and that's that so the
fourth app is called tappets Andy say
wallpaper application but it's not the
usual one tap it actually generates a
material designed wallpaper right on
your phone basically your own very
unique wallpapers the app can also
automatically generate new wallpapers in
the background and change them
automatically that's pretty damn awesome
so the fifth app is the launcher called
ASAP it's a great launcher for people
who want to be more productive save time
and have a super clean phone the UI is a
little bit different than other
launchers so let me explain just swipe
left to get to your contacts swipe left
again to get to the weather and then
swipe right to get to your calendar
swipe again to get to your to-do list
alright cool but where is the app drawer
just swipe left from the edge of your
display and there it is your most used
applications will be on your homescreen
this launcher is definitely not for
everyone but if you do like the UI
download it it's great so the next app
is from google themselves and it's a
great way to get some quick google play
store credits so how does this work well
it's very simple the app will send you a
notification just click it and answer
maybe two or three questions and boom
you just got a dollar to added to your
Google Play credits very simple and very
awesome so the next app is also from
google and is called chrome remote
desktop it's a very cool app that I used
daily it lets you control your pc from
anywhere in the world it's smooth
responsive and does not take up too much
bandwidth so yeah it's pretty damn cool
so the next app is called mr. phone and
it's a simple app that you can use to
compare phone specifications just type
in the two phones that you want to
compare and then you will be greeted by
a really good and simple look in
comparison so the next app is more
geared towards the enthusiasts rather
than the normal users it's called
impaired and shows you how fast you are
currently charging your phone it also
tells you voltage temperatures and more
so the final app on this list is called
a block and is super useful the app
basically lets you set a lock on the
apps that you choose you can then use a
pattern pin or even your fingerprint to
unlock the app it's simple yet really
useful thank you guys so much for
watching the first episode of apps
spotlight I hope you enjoyed the video
if you did please like the video
subscribe and I'll catch you guys in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
