phone if you count the X and not the 3t
but one plus five is six and they have
made six phones yeah a confusing naming
scheme but a legendary series of phones
they're all famous for packing the best
essential specs of a phone for quite a
lot less than the major flagship like
Samsung's LG's apples and so on in this
video we're going to be taking a look at
the five major pros and cons of the new
one plus five so let's start with the
pros and then move our way into the cons
the specification is found in the 1 plus
5 is like no other phone flagship or not
it's packing the latest and greatest
Snapdragon 835 SOC with the adrenal 540
GPU paired with either 6 or an
astonishing 8 gigabytes of RAM this
means you've got yourself an insanely
competent phone if the software is done
right which is my next row of the 1+5
it's done right meaning basically
nothing's done to it there's no skin on
top of Android there's no gimmicky
features it's just Android 7.1.1 with
some small but useful features added to
it this is how I like my Android to run
but of course if you're that type of
person more into a phone filled with
gimmicks and features at the cost of
performance then by all means look
somewhere else if that's not your piece
of cake though you'll love the 1 plus 5
everything is extremely quick with no
stutters anywhere in the US and also
because of the huge RAM size of either
six or eight gigs your apps are open
much longer in the background and
there's no need to clean up the recent
apps anymore I love the experience of
the 1 plus 5 my third Pro of the 1 plus
5 is the fingerprint sensor and all I
can say is it's freaking quick next up
is a dual camera system it's obviously
very similar to the one found on the
iPhone 7 plus and in my house that's not
a bad thing it's responsive images look
well exposed and the dynamic range is
pretty darn good it's also got a feature
called depth effect which is basically
the same thing as portraits on the
iPhone it adds a blur effects on the
background of subjects and in most cases
it does look pretty good but sometimes
the edges around the subject can get
blurry as well it's not perfect but I'm
sure it will get better with some
software updates the final pro of the 1
plus 5 is the battery life and charging
speed because the use of a 1080p display
with no software gimmicks the oneplus is
3300 milliamp hour battery holds up very
well with about 30 to 40% left at the
end of the day and that's of course with
my usage it will be different for you
though but I'll say that I'm a pretty
the user so that's good by itself but -
charging makes it even better
- charging is one pluses take on fast
charging and it's the best in the
business
you can charge from zero to 58% in just
30 minutes it's great so with the pros
done let's take a look at some of the
not so good things first up is the
screen resolution and before I get the
hate thrown at me I cannot tell the
difference between a good 1080p and a
quad HD display however the resolution
of this phone means it's not ideal for
VR if you don't care about that which to
be honest I don't either
the display is great it's an AMOLED one
so colors and blacks are very intense
it's sharp and bright enough and to be
honest I've got no complaints with it
other than that it can't be used in VR
my next con is the big vessel size with
the SI 2 g6 and Xiaomi me mix this out
there the multiple styles might not look
as innovative or as new as those sounds
it's not a big deal but just something
small to point out my next con is this
speaker it's easily as good as the ones
found in the SI g6 and so on but with
the big bezels I think they could have
put a stereo pair of speakers instead to
stand out a little bit more next up is
water resistance or the lack thereof
most flagship out there nowadays pack IP
67 or 68 water resistance but the 1 + 5
just don't personally it's not a big
deal but just as the screen resolution
and the bezel size it's just something
to point out my last column with the 1 +
5 is the lack of optic image
stabilization sure it's got electric
stabilization which works good enough in
well-lit areas however when trying to
take those low-light shots you're Sol so
there you guys go
those were my personal 5 pros and cons
of the new 1 + 5 it's honestly one of
the best phones I've used and I can't
wait to bring you guys the review of it
but the question for this video is what
do you guys think of the 1 + 5 let me
know in the comment section down below
like and subscribe if you haven't
already and I'll see you guys in the
video piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
