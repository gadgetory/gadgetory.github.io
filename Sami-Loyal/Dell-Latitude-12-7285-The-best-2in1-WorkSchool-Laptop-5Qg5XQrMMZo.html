laptop to win one and it's actually one
of the more interesting laptops I
reviewed in a while and in this video
we're gonna take a look at why that is
now this is strictly a work and school
laptop that means it's supposed to have
enough performance for easy tasks like
web browsing writing and video watching
but also have a low enough power
consumption for the battery to last an
entire workday it's also expected to be
small portable and well-built so in
order to accomplish that they'll have to
choose components with extremely low
power usage and so they chose the white
series of dual core Intel CPUs running
at only 4.5 watts with an internal GPU
as well on the CPU and it's the perfect
chip for a system like this it allows
for the entirety of the system to be
built behind the display giving Dell the
availability to put a larger battery in
the keyboard section of the laptop and
of course also the ability to just use
it as a tablet now this 70 to 85 is not
a whole lot to look at
it isn't beautifully crafted or of any
special materials but I do have to say
it feels extremely sturdy and well built
there's no creaking or bending anywhere
the screens hinge is strong enough so
that it doesn't wobble or actually move
at all when using its touch
functionality connecting and
disconnecting the screen from the
keyboard parts hinge is easy but it
feels secure at the same time and I
think I like about it is that you don't
have to push any special buttons to
release the screen instead you just grab
one side of it and pull up and in terms
of reconnecting it the magnet does most
of the work for you in terms of the
number of ports available on the 70 to
85 it might not look that impressive as
it only has three ports you have two USB
type-c Thunderbolt 3 ports which can
basically return into an infinite number
of other ports thanks to the magic of
docks and adapters in terms of
specifications this specific model I
have features an Intel
I 5 7 y5 7 8 gigs of RAM a 256 gig
superfast PCIe nvme SSD and a beautiful
12 point 3 inch 3 by 2 28 80 by 1920 IPS
touch display protected by Corning
Gorilla Glass 4 the battery is actually
pretty small at just 34 watt hours but
with these great component choices
battery life on the 70 to 85 has been
pretty great around 7 to 9 hours of use
with the keyboard and around 2 to 3 with
just the screen in tablet mode this
obviously changes based on what kind of
work you're doing so you might
experience a better or a worse battery
life than what I got but nevertheless
it's looking pretty good the 70 to 85
has a pretty interesting trick up its
sleeve and I think it's actually one of
if not the first laptop to have this and
that trick is wireless charging now
sadly the charging mat that you're
supposed to use is a rather expensive
accessory at $200 and Dell did not send
one over with my loaner unit so I
haven't had the opportunity to test it
out but it's probably a pretty awesome
as a laptop with the keyboard attached
the Dell 72 85 is great at what it does
the keyboard is one of the best ones
I've ever experienced on a small laptop
like this one the port selection is as
you guys know good and the beautiful
display really adds to the overall
experience but it does fall short in
some areas namely the speaker's lap
ability and trackpad they're just not
top-notch like everything else is on
this laptop and what I mean by my newly
invented word lap ability well the
special hinge that kind of racist a
laptop a bit makes it very uncomfortable
when actually using this laptop on your
lap and while that's not a deal-breaker
by any means I thought I should mention
it so what's so bad about the speakers
in trackpad well they're not
particularly bad by themselves but put
into this otherwise extraordin
a laptop they kind of become bad in
comparison to everything else the
trackpad for example just doesn't feel
very good or particularly responsive for
that matter - and the speakers are just
met so there's that I can't fault the
performance though while this isn't a
workstation desktop replacement by any
means it performs extremely well at the
things it's supposed to so everything
from web browsing to watching
high-quality video and just breezing
through Windows 10 worked very well and
meanwhile you get a pretty great battery
life now as a tablet it's pretty good
too performance stays the same and the
tablet portion of the laptop is pretty
light and comfortable to hold for
extended periods of time the only issue
I see with using it in tablet mode is
the fairly weak battery life you get
when depending on this small internal
battery behind the screen so as a
conclusion the Dell Latitude 1272 85 is
a great laptop for the businessman or
students I wouldn't recommend it to
anyone in a line of work that requires
significant performance though like
caddy signing etc but if what you do
consists of mainly web-based and
Microsoft Office based work this is a
phenomenal laptop the only big issue
with it being it's pretty large price
tag so let me know what you guys think
about this laptop in the comment section
down below like this video if you
enjoyed it and I'll see all of you guys
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
