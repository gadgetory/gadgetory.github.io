here back with a video today I'm going
to show you guys all of the cool
features of tubebuddy which is a
youtuber plugin which I have used for
almost two years now now this video is
sponsored but as I said I've used this
plug-in for two years so that's way
before this video but as I said we're
gonna take a look at some of its
features definitely not all of them
because there are way too many features
for just one video so I will leave this
very cool link with all of the features
listed in the video description there's
just a bunch just productivity that's
like 30 bulk processing video SEO
promotion data and research there's a
lot of features I'm also going to give
you guys this pricing list so you can
see which features you get for free and
which features you get for the paid
options as well so if you want to
download this plug-in just go to your
Chrome Web Store and just install it
here very easily and then just sign up
with your YouTube account
so once the Chubin plug-in is installed
you will notice a few changes around the
YouTube UI mainly this one right here
besides the upload button which kind of
combines all of the features now as I
said I'm going to show you the features
that I personally use the most because
those are the ones that I can vouch for
and talk about and those are right here
on the video manager page so let's
imagine that this video is a giveaway
video and let's say you want the video
to disappear when the giveaway has ended
you can choose this sunset video feature
right here and you can choose the date
and time for the video to be private if
it's going to load I'm having some
networking problems at the moment not
sure as to what's happening with that
but okay we're gonna have to get into
this sunset video feature later however
it's very easy you just choose the
specified date and time for the video to
either be unlisted or for the video to
be private
now that feature I don't use that much
but it's great to have if you want to
move or private a giveaway video perhaps
so that more people don't join you could
also do something like a scheduled video
update if you do want the video to still
be up you could choose to change the
title of the video to something like
this giveaway has ended at this specific
time and date so that you don't have to
remember to go back into your of your
video manager and change that at that
specified date instead you could just do
this here any time you want and choose
your giveaway ending date and you are
good to go
that's great now this feature I use a
lot it's called a thumbnail generator
and it is fantastic I don't know why
YouTube themselves haven't implemented
this feature yet it's very helpful
it lets you choose a steel frame from
the video and choose that as your
thumbnail it's also very very intuitive
to use
so take a look here I'll click here oh
wow I will choose at which point in the
video I want my thumbnail to be let's
say this looks good I'll just click
continue I could add some some text if I
wanted to but I'm not going to do that
and I'll just click continue the plug-in
will give you this this preview to let
you know what it will look like and you
can just say okay that looks good save
and publish yes and it will publish that
thumbnail as your official thumbnail
that's a feature that I've been looking
for for a very long time and the fact
that YouTube aren't doing this is very
weird because it's just a feature that
I'm sure so many people would love to
have this is also one that is very very
useful if you want to be able to publish
parts of your video as previews on your
Twitter page your Facebook page and that
is the animated gif or Jif generator
this is also very easy to use just
choose the starting and end time let's
say we want to use this this bit right
here where my phone falls perfect now we
just click preview and here the all-new
iPhone 8 is going to fall and that's my
new jiff I will now click generate jiff
it's now going to create the jiff and
there and there we go is created here is
a preview of the jiff
yeah that thing Falls a lot of times
right now you can just right click and
choose save image or you could just add
your Twitter account to chew buddy and
publish it automatically next up we are
getting back to the giveaway track and
here we have this feature called pick a
winner which does exactly that it does
pick a random winner in your comment
section so let's click pick a winner
take a winner and there we go
Rajic explorers with the comment nice
video bro was the winner of this
giveaway if it was a giveaway now right
here they will also kind of summarize
their social media server so right here
I can see his Instagram page his
Facebook page his Twitter and his
Google+ which is extremely helpful
because that way I can just go to his
Twitter page which makes contacting the
winner much much much easier you can
even publish this video to Facebook very
easily and actually I think you could
even bulk publish yeah you can publish
basically basically all of your videos
to facebook very easily with the true
buddy plugin it is fantastic I've used
it for a long time it can also show you
some some suggested tags and there you
go here are the suggested tags now I
have already chosen many of these to be
my tags and they are very very useful
you can also easily see
your search rankings by those keywords
I'm gonna show you that feature where
it's actually working so let's click on
my most viewed video and let's choose
this video because I'm sure that this
video has where is on the top page so
let's see search rankings yes this video
is ranked number one if you search for
debt if you search for Dell Precision 55
10 and all of these other things so yeah
true buddy I use this plug-in a lot
sadly I do not have the time to show you
all of these features I'm going to leave
this link which is to buddy.com slash
tools which gives you a very nice list
and a very nice explanation of what all
of these features do great plugin for
any youtuber out there small or huge I
really really recommend it so thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did leave a
