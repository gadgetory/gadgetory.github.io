bands called activity trackers whether
they're from Garmin Fitbit Nike or
jawbone we have all seen them but are
they really worth 50 to 250 dollars my
name is Toby from techne now and in this
video we are going to be taking a look
at just that starting off
what can they do they usually only track
your steps and distance but some of the
new and higher-end models can track
things like intensity minutes
floors climbed heart rate and more and
with that combined information they can
show you data like calories burnt some
even have a few SmartWatch features like
the vivosmart HR from Garmin many
activity bans also has this thing called
move alerts basically when you sit still
for too long the watch will tell you to
go and get out and move which can
actually be very encouraging to get out
and get moving
almost all activity trackers have a
connected app or platform of sort this
is the place for you to go back and see
your history progress stats and more
some of these platforms also have the
feature to add friends and compete in
steps and other activities which can be
super fun and encouraging so with that
said what can't they do well they will
not get you better health but they can
be helpful in a way so that you get more
stats on how active you are and
encourage you to eat healthy and move
it's pretty complicated so let me break
it down a little bit easier for you so
what they do they can encourage movement
and a healthier lifestyle they will
provide you with stats on how much you
move and how you could possibly change
that for the better
some track your heart rate 24/7 and can
show you when and how much you're
stressing out but mainly they're just
there to encourage you to get moving
eat healthier and train better so what
they don't do they don't just get you
better health you got to work for it the
activity ban is just a tool to help you
on the way they're not 100% accurate but
they should give you
decently accurate information just not
100% so the endless question should you
get one well that depends if you're
easily motivated it's a great idea to
get one as it will for sure motivate you
to live a more healthy lifestyle if you
are not easily motivated but still like
stats and data it's still a great idea
to get one I still will give you the
data you need so if you're neither of
these just don't buy one as it will just
be another annoying thing to keep track
of and having to sync up and all that
jazz just go with the classic way of
exercising and eating healthy without
tracking and that's about it thanks for
watching please subscribe if you liked
the video and I'll see you guys in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
