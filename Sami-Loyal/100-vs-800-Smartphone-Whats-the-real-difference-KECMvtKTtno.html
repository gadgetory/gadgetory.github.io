point has been at around seven hundred
to eight hundred and fifty dollars it's
only over the past couple of years that
companies like oneplus Alcatel and said
te has started to get into the spotlight
so what's special with their phones well
their phones have flagship specs for
half the price of the big boy phones
like the s7 edge from Samsung or the
iPhone 7 from Apple take for instance
the Alcatel idol 4s it runs like a
flagship phones it looks like one it
feels like one and it laughs like one it
even succeeds the big companies phones
in some department like value and
accessories with the idol 4s you get a
VR headset JBL headphones a screen
protector and a case out of the box for
a price of $400 so what do you get in
the s7 edge box for example you get the
phone a charging cable and some really
bad headphones but what happens if we go
even lower to the most budget phones
there is it's actually quite interesting
this is the Alcatel top 4 plus and it
costs a hundred and twenty nine US
dollars for the sake of making this
video just that tiny bit more
interesting let's compare it to the top
dark phone of 2016
the samsung galaxy s7 edge now right off
the bat there is a difference in the
feel of the phone the s7 is made out of
this beautiful and premium feeling glass
and aluminum whereas the pop four plus
has that classic plastic feel just like
an old s3 or s2 from Samsung and the
screen is not as exciting as the 1440p
AMOLED display that the s7 edge has but
to be honest I frankly don't care now
don't get me wrong the display in the s7
edge is outright amazing but to do I
feel like I need it no I don't the 720p
LCD display that de-puff fourplus has is
just fine videos look good and there
isn't a problem with the colors now in
terms of power under the
well yeah there is a difference but once
again it's not that huge in the real
world going through your Instagram or
Twitter feed is actually pretty soon and
watching video was not laggy in any way
either more camera related stuff like
snap chatting or posting your own
Instagram pictures
yeah they don't look amazing but not
everyone needs to have a full on DSLR
killer in their pocket actually most
people don't the pop 4 plus takes just
fine pictures and video
it's enough for snapshots now games they
don't work that good on this phone it's
laggy and sometimes the game just crash
ok with this set let's try to bring it
into it a more wider perspective I want
you to respond to these questions in the
comments down below
number one do you need a DSLR like
camera in your pocket number two do you
need to be able to edit videos and
photos on your phone do you need the
premium build quality and water
resistance of on s7 edge or comparable
phone if you answered no to those three
questions
you don't need a galaxy s7 edge Google
pixel or iPhone 7 you would be much
better off with something like the pop 4
plus think about it you save $700 that
you can use for other stuff I don't want
you to tell you that you can't have a
nice phone because you really can but it
doesn't have to cost $800 for example
compare the 1+3
to the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge ok price
one plus three $400 s7 edge 850 dollars
processor one plus three Snapdragon 820
s7 edge Snapdragon 820 Ram one plus
three six gigs s7 edge for gigs so let's
rewind the tape of its price one plus
three $400 s7 edge 850 dollars do you
see my point here if not then go ahead
keep buying those expensive Samsung's
and apples and Google phones but if you
do
just one tiny bit please trust us
reviewers when we say a good phone does
not have to cost $800 don't take my word
for it take a look at Flossie Carter for
example he says the thing I hope that
you maybe not change your mind about the
expensive phones I mean they are amazing
and we live in a great world but I do
want you to next time look beyond Apple
Samsung and Google and try to look at
these four hundred or less dollar phones
and see if the $800 price tag is really
worth it
all right I know that was a lot to take
in and I maybe went on rambling a little
bit too much but let's conclude if you
only need to call text check social
media and stuff like that
you don't particularly need the top dark
phone but if you would like to take good
photos play games and all of that there
are amazing choices out there for much
less than the iPhones and the top-notch
Android phones you just have to do some
digging around to find them alright
thanks for watching and I'll see you
guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
