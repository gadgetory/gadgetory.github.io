another video and today we are going to
be doing a Q&amp;amp;A for you guys also kind of
like a channel update so yeah 2016 has
been one hell of a year both for this
channel tag me now and also for the
world so last year in January I said
that I wanted to have more than 5000
subscribers by the end of 2016 and right
now we have 5442 subs that's just
awesome we hit our goal so I've had
quite a few people that have asked me
what is your goal for 2017 so my goal
for 2017 is actually 20,000 songs yeah
that's a lot and that's that's four
times the subs that I have at the moment
I'm not sure if we can do it but I'm
going to hustle all the way and I'm
going to try to balance school and
YouTube to make this work perfectly so I
asked you guys on Twitter for some
questions that you want answered in in
quarter one of 2017 and here are the
questions that could be gods so the
first question comes from sahaja Datuk
waffles or pancakes not much of a
serious question but waffles okay ma
cherie asked fully SPECT out 5k iMac or
a full expect out macbook pro for video
editing and designing I think it's quite
obvious for power reasons the imac 5k is
obviously a lot more powerful it has the
desktop grade i 7 and the good graphics
that you can use in applications like
adobe premiere and after effects and
final cut pro x and all of that stuff so
for power the imac 5k is obviously a lot
better but it all depends on if you want
the portability of the macbook or the
power
the imac 5k and that beautiful 5k
display semi-loyal asks when you hit 1
million subs after me of course how do
you plan on celebrating that's far into
the future and i don't even think i will
hit 1 million but you're saying after
you so first let me get some things
clear if one of us two are gonna hit 1
million subs it's gonna be me before you
okay and how I plan on celebrating I
have no idea it's 1 million subs and
that is a lot of subs and and if that
will happen it's far away in the future
okay tech Rome asks should i get a GoPro
you did not give me any context
whatsoever what do you plan on doing
with the GoPro if what you want to do is
like action sports and stuff like that
I'm sure yeah get a GoPro but if you
just want clean video there are much
better options out there such as the
Panasonic g7 that I'm using to shoot
this video the gh4 the a 6300 etc much
better options for clean video but if
you plan on doing kind of action sports
and extreme sports and and underwater
stuff or motorcycle vlogging or you know
stuff like that get the GoPro it's the
best that you can get stands tech videos
asks would you ever consider selling
tech me now merchandise like t-shirts
phone cases etc me myself I think that
this channel is obviously too small for
that I don't think that anyone would
actually buy it and thing is I can do it
but I don't think it's going to be worth
the while because you guys are probably
not going to buy it but of course if you
guys actually want that then comment
down below and I will make sure to make
it happen so those were the questions
for the first Q&amp;amp;A of 2017 please go to
my Twitter if you would like to ask me
more questions for the next Q&amp;amp;A and
has been it it's now 2017 this is going
to be the year of tech me now and I
can't wait to get you guys some more
awesome videos in the next following
weeks and months and years thanks for
watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
