me now and today we're taking a look at
LG's somewhat risky g5 so the Box
resembles one of the new features in the
g5 the modules that they call France and
I have the camera plus one right here
and in the box we get the phone a used
we type a two USB type-c charging cable
a wall adapter and an empty space that
looks to be four ear pods although my
version did not come with any the g5 is
this year's addition to the G series and
this time they took a very different
approach when they added the second rear
facing camera and the much talked about
friends system and we will definitely
talk more about these later in the video
but as usual we will start off by
looking at the specifications and the
build of the g5 the g5 features the new
Snapdragon 820 processor paired with
four gigs of ram and the Adreno 530 GPU
its display is a 5.3 inch 1440p IPS
display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 the
battery has a capacity of 2800 milliamp
hours but that can actually be increased
with some of the modules and more on
that later in the video the battery is
also removable and can quick charge via
the new USB type-c cable all right
camera time the primary standard view
camera has 16 megapixels and an aperture
of f-18 the second camera which is super
wide by the way has 8 megapixels and an
aperture of f28 4 they're both capable
of shooting in 4k and in manual mode the
front-facing camera is an 8 megapixel
shooter with an aperture of f28 oh and
the rest of the specifications are
pretty much the same as any modern
smartphone today so let's not bore you
guys with the specs and get right into
the review so pretty much every review
that I make goes as follows so yeah this
is the display I like this
not that etc but this time we are going
to change things up and start the review
by talking about the new features that
LG implemented to the g5 so let's start
off with the cameras this is not the
first time that LG makes a phone with
dual cameras last year with v10 they had
two front-facing cameras but now they
switch things up and made the g5 with
the two cameras in the rear instead and
I gotta say I love this change the main
camera has a view of 78 degrees and the
second one has a view of 135 which looks
awesome as you can see on the pictures
taken with it they both used laser
autofocus and optic image stabilization
and it works great pictures are good and
colors are accurate although in my
opinion they are a little over sharpened
but some people like that you can also
use both cameras in full manual mode to
get DSLR like controls like shutter
speed ISO focus white balance and more
so if you spend some time tinkering with
it you can get some pretty awesome
looking videos and images low-light
performance is not the best and
highlights do look a little bit blown
out but when using HDR those issues get
mostly solved the g5 has a mechanism
which enables you to change the bottom
part of the phone with something called
friends these are modules that have
different tasks or enables a few
features and to change modules press on
the lower left side button with your
fingernail and the bottom part will be
separated from the phone and then just
pull to get the module out and remove
the battery which requires a bit of
force and then insert the battery into
the new module and then just slide that
whole thing into the phone it's pretty
easy although you gotta use a lot of
force when removing the battery and it
kind of feels like you're breaking it
the module I have is the cam plus one
and it has an extra twelve hundred
million power battery built-in and that
was significantly increase your battery
life it has a dedicated shutter button a
scroll wheel to zoom a video record
button and a switch to launch into the
camera app and it also acts as a grip to
make it feel more like an elaborate
camera alright those
two main new features in the g5 so let's
continue with the general phone review
the g5 is made out of metal but it
doesn't feel like it they added some
kind of plastic coating most likely to
hide the antenna bands and to make it
look more seamless and it does just that
but I like this sense of exclusivity
because it just doesn't feel as premium
as it looks but I do like the weight of
it it feels sturdy and well built like
any other phone of this price should on
the bottom there is some speaker grilles
a USB type-c port and a microphone and
on the left side there is a volume
rocker that feels clicky and tactile the
power button is on the back just like
the v10 and the Nexus 5x that they made
some people have said that it feels
wobbly and plasticky but I haven't
experienced any of that maybe it's just
the review units setting the fingerprint
sensor up was easy and quick and it
worked with just a couple taps it works
great it's fast and responsive and I
tested it ten times and it worked great
each time with no problems whatsoever
the new Snapdragon chip and four gigs of
ram it makes the GFI one of the fastest
phones I've ever tested and it handles
multitasking like a beast with no
hiccups or slowdowns at any point
whatsoever the experience is super
smooth and everything runs like a charm
it's just perfect Gaming works well too
again with no hiccups or slowdowns at
all and in Geekbench its corded 2293 in
single core and five thousand three
hundred and forty eight in multi-core
which puts it in the top of high-end
smartphones so performance on this thing
is top-notch
the battery is not great but I could
definitely go through an entire day
without charging but not much more than
that so it discharge is pretty quick but
it also charges quick thanks to the
next-gen quick recharge technology
through the USB type-c port the cam plus
module actually adds 1200 milliamp hours
which is awesome because you can
literally have it charge your phone
while it's in your pocket and it easily
gave about 40 percent more juice you
charged the module just by charging the
phone like you would anyway
so that's great the screen is just like
any other lg screen they're not AMOLED
but they sure as hell look awesome
viewing angles are good colors are poppy
and vibrant without getting annoying and
it's overall an awesome screen I also
love this slight edge on the top of the
display I don't know what it is or why
it's there but I love it the vessels are
also really small so that's a plus I
also love that they chose to go for a
5.3 inch screen it's big without being a
problem so you can watch Netflix and
YouTube with joy it's also good with
one-handed use so 5.3 inches is perfect
but of course that's for me but I think
that I have pretty average-sized hands
the speaker is good for not being
front-facing but it's not front-facing
so they're not even close to the best
although I do like them because they are
a hell of a lot better than the 5x and
the v10 and LG's skin is okay it's not
as bad as it has been before I also like
that instead of having a bunch of apps
that do the same thing they either have
their version or the Google version
which is awesome and I would love for
other people to do that as well
mm-hmm Samsung with that aside I still
prefer to go with either the Google now
launcher or the nova launcher asked
they're cleaner and look better in my
opinion
yep that's the g5 so in conclusion the
g5 is a top-notch phone with the most
premium specifications although that
cannot be said for the build it has a
few features that have never been seen
before and I like that it definitely was
not the safest bet for LG but I love
that they are one of the companies that
risk their success to shape the future
of smartphones thanks for watching make
sure to leave a like if you liked the
video dislike if you didn't also don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
