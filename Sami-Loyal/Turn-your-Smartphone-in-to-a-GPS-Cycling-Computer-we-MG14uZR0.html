domain name to be a star burg Tech and
here's a chance for you to get your own
dot tech is the perfect domain extension
for everyone passionate about and
associated with technology you can use
the coupon code
check me now on WG tech to register your
domain at only $2.99 for the first year
so the links will be down below in the
description so you want to level up your
cycling game but you don't want to spend
hundreds of dollars on a GPS cycling
computer here is the perfect solution
for you the solution smartphones
everyone has them and they have just as
good if not better GPS than the ones
that you will find in dedicated GPS
cycling computers but how do we get the
most out of our phones GPS s well apps
and there's a bunch of them but here are
the ones that I have tried myself and
that I can definitely vouch for so the
main most popular cycling and running
app is called Strava it combines social
media with GPS workout tracking and it
works phenomenally it's even free
although there is a premium subscription
that you can buy to get more in-depth
insights of your workouts there's
challenges that you can join and compete
in and it's just a very social app the
next app is called runtastic road bike
or mountain bike pro these have a
one-time fee but it gets rid of this
social aspect of Strava and adds offline
maps which is just great because it
won't take as much on your mobile data
as online maps would and other than that
they're kind of the same so now that you
got your cycling computer how do you
mount it to your bike well obviously a
bike phone mount but there's so many to
choose from you can go cheap or really
expensive but there's one that really
stands out from the crowd and it's
called the quad lock mount and it's the
best most secure and easy to use mount
that I have ever seen but that comes
with a price tag of 69 bucks but the
great thing with it is that it's super
super secure and still very easy to
mount
demount so there's only one problem that
I have found with using this setup and
that's battery life as every one of you
guys know phones tend to have extremely
bad battery life so if you know that
you're going to go out for longer bike
rides make sure to bring some kind of
power bank to keep your device charged I
prefer the Signet charged up digital
10000 as it's very slim but still has a
great capacity of 10,000 milliamp hours
which is enough to charge my iPhone 6
plus about 4 times
another great thing with it is that it
has a display to show you how much
battery it has left also it has two USB
ports that can both output 2 amps at the
same time so you can charge two devices
at high speeds at the same time so now
that you've got all the things needed
get on your bike and get moving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
