ghetto setup I have ever done I'm not
too proud of it the monitor is above the
camera and where is the microphone
well the microphone is in my hand that's
right the cable is here the microphones
in my hand all right let's just do the
video so what's up guys to be here back
with another video and today we're going
to be taking a look while not taking a
look more of just going to be announcing
something kind of special to me and I'm
going to be asking for your help if
you're interested and the thing is you
might remember me announcing a website a
tech news and reviews website a couple
of months ago it's called tech mininet
and that hasn't been going very well
mainly because well it's 2017 and
there's kind of no room for a new
technology news website so you know that
did not go too well
so you can consider that website kind of
on hold at the moment but I've got
something else that I think is much more
exciting and I think would be more kind
of like useful to you guys and that's
tech deals when we are purchasing
something a technology product you know
gadgets stuff like that we we want the
best deal there is because well you
don't want to pay more than you should
have to and taking the time to find
those deals can be annoying and that's
why we are doing it for you instead so
the website it's called tech deal e-comm
so what does the name stand for well
first tech tech products and gadgets
gizmos all that stuff and then Deeley is
a combination between two different
words
that's it deals and daily so we're doing
tech deals daily so when you go over to
tech daily comm you will be granted with
a pretty nice-looking webpage and a
whole bunch of regions to choose deals
from and right now we're only doing at
the u.s. the UK and India at the moment
and this is where you guys come in I
need your help to find deals if you who
are watching this video yes you behind
that screen monitor whatever are
interested in helping out
with this website that maybe even
earning some affiliate you know
Commission stuff like that
gift cards then please slide into my DMS
on Twitter my username is to be as
Dahlberg and underscore that link is
down below if you don't want to type
that out and yes before you comment this
down below I know that there are more
technology deals websites out there like
deal hunter tech a deal source tech and
the thing is yes those websites do exist
and you are completely free to visit
those websites and purchase stuff but
what I set out to do is create the best
tech deals website that will keep going
for a long time you know deal hunter dot
tech has closed down my goal as a person
is to provide you with at least four
tech deals in the US every single day
and in terms of the other regions the
same goes there but first we actually
need to find people who are willing to
basically add deals so yeah that is
basically the announcement in a nutshell
thank you guys so much for being a
subscriber to this channel I really do
appreciate it and there's a lot a lot of
great content coming up soon so yeah I'm
very very excited thanks for watching
check out tech daily comm the link is
down below in the description and I'll
see you guys in the next video peace
oh my arm is hurting so much now all
right peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
