another video and as you can see by the
title down below this video
this is my review of the 1 + 5 but I
decided to make my review a little bit
different from the other reviews that I
made if you are a follower to this
channel you know that usually my reviews
are just voice over recorded with this
microphone behind me and then just
b-roll on top of that and that's the
review but I've seen other guys like
mkbhd Jonathan Morrison all those team
crispy guys Jase Q sense they they all
make talking head reviews and I think
that those seem a bit more connected to
the reviewer so that's what I want to
try today this is also going to be an
unscripted review I just have some notes
in front of me and let's see how this
goes if you liked this type of video or
review then make sure to click like down
below and also comment down below what
you like and what you think that I
should improve on the 1 + 5 was released
in June of 2017 that being just about
two months ago and they have two
different models the model that I have
here is the one with the darker paint
that being the midnight black I think
it's called and that one features 128
gigs of storage and an astonishing 8
gigs of RAM and then there's a normal
model which is maybe 50 bucks cheaper
which has 64 gigs of storage and 6 gigs
of RAM so let's take a look at the
design of the 1+5 now as you guys can
probably tell already it's very similar
to a pretty well known phone out there I
don't know what it could be Samsung no
LG now it's Apple of course the iPhone 7
plus it's very similar to the iPhone 7
plus the Apple design of the iPhone 6
which is basically the same as the
iPhone 7 what's good when it came out
about three or four years ago now but
now it's just boring in terms of what
went on in the designers mind I think
they wanted to create a design that has
been tested before and that they know
many people will like
yeah sure it looks good it's high
quality you know it's aluminum and all
that so it feels good in the hand maybe
a tiny bit more slippery than I would
like but it looks good it's just a bit
boring it's also got a pretty big chain
and forehead you know with the essays
and LG g6 and the shell Mimi mix us out
there it looks kind of you know non
innovative and a bit outdated compared
to those songs you know let's compare
them right now this is the LG G 6 small
vessels cool design and this is the one
plus five it looks kind of boring not
anything special just a totally typical
phone that you see every day in terms of
specs we have got kind of the best that
there is out there in the android market
that being the latest and greatest from
Qualcomm that's the Snapdragon 805 SOC
they've got as I mentioned before either
six or eight gigabytes of RAM that still
amazes me every day at 1080p AMOLED
display which doesn't make it good for
VR I don't know if there are any V or
hasted out there that are compatible
with it if there are then then that's
not going to bring you the best
experience compared to the 1440p
displays however when just looking at it
and comparing it to a 1440p display it's
not easy to tell the difference so it's
still very sharp still very good-looking
and I think on par with flagship phones
and also the cut is an AMOLED display it
of course has those super inky black
those very popping vivid colors and
overall I think it just looks very good
and below the display is the fingerprint
sensor it's extremely quick apps have
been ever since they came out with the
one plus three here I'll give you an
example right now ok 1/2 pound open them
open them yeah it's quick it's it's
awesome it's quick it's accurate I've
never had any problems with a
fingerprint scanner oh and also it has a
headphone jack which I personally
appreciate a lot so another thing that
oneplus is famous for
other than having these beastly specs is
the operating system it's called oxygen
OS and in it's running on android 7.1.1
it is no skin though it's just in a
normal pure Android which I love it
looks so clean it's super fast because
they have basically no gimmicks or weird
features that so many other phones like
the s8 has it's just very very pure
Android and I love that but if you don't
like that if you want those gimmicky
features to show your friends I am cool
I've got the iris scanner I've got the
gesture control and all that stuff then
by all means look somewhere else this is
not the phone for you this phone is kind
of like an iPhone this phone is kind of
like an iPhone but it's an Android phone
basically so this smooth operating
system in combination with the beast
respects the slightly lower resolution
1080p display compared to other
flagships that combined makes it a very
fluid very fast phone and probably the
most powerful phone there is out there
today in terms of what they have added
on through the operating system there
are some very small improvements to the
operating system though and those are
for example the alert slider which is
similar to the mute switch on the iPhone
however this has three modes the first
mode in the lowest setting cutting sound
on the middle being do not disturb and
the upper mode being silent just
vibration it's also got some gestures
such as three finger screenshots so if I
put three fingers onto the screen and
and drag down it takes a screenshot so
yes it does have some added features to
it but those are not gimmicks they are
actually useful and stuff that I use on
a daily basis the speaker on this is
it's no Nexus 6p speaker it's just very
similar to the LG G 6 and the s8 and
that means it's fine it's good but not
anything special not anything that will
blow your mind the front-facing camera
is a 16 megapixel camera sensor which is
very good actually but do not take my
word for it let's roll
pictures taken with the front facing
camera
all right so now let's talk about the
dual camera system so for you guys who
don't know why you would have two
cameras well it's basically like this
behind one of these lenses is a normal
wide-angle lens and behind the other one
is what they describe as a telephoto
lens but but it's definitely not as
shallow as that it's just a little bit
more assumed in that being 2x zoom
without losing any quality it's fast
there's no shutter lag switching between
cameras it's also very fast there's no
lag overall and I think generally that
the photos and videos that come out of
the Wampus at five dual camera land
system look great account with the
system though is it does not have
optical image stabilization which
results in pictures taken in low-light
being a bit more blurry than for example
on the estate and the iPhone 7 plus it
does have electronic image stabilization
though which which is definitely not as
good as optic but it works fine in
well-lit areas and as I mentioned before
in more dim areas it could look a bit
blurry and and a bit jiggly and
artifactory instead of word without me
rambling on too much about this let's
roll some pictures and videos you know
4k video tests and all that taken on the
1 plus 5s dual camera system
so there you guys go now let's talk
about the battery life which I was
actually surprised by its a 3300
milliamp hour battery which is by no
means anything special but when you
combine that battery with the more
energy-efficient components inside and
with a 1080p display which draws less
power both because it's an AMOLED panel
and also because it's 1080p instead of
1440p which most of us actually out
there are the better life is great in my
own testing in my own testing time which
has now been about three weeks at the
end of the day I had about twenty to
thirty five percent less and that's good
in my opinion but the main cool thing
about the battery life is not the
battery itself but the way you charge it
and it charges via this fast charging
technology called - charge and it is
seriously the best on the market today
charging from zero to 100% happens in
just one hour and 15 minutes that's
extremely fast
for example the LG G sticks right here
it charges from zero to 100% they may be
one hour and 45 minutes the F safe is
probably around that time as well so
yeah - charging is super fast but what's
even cooler than zero to 100% is the
speed of which you're charging from
maybe 15 to 50 percent and that happens
in this 20 minutes which is extremely
fast so let's end this review by talking
about my pros and cons of the amount of
file pros is extremely quick fast it's
very well built
battery life is great the dual camera
line system is also very good in my
opinion it's definitely up to par with
slashing phone I like the small extra
features that they have added to it the
buttons they feel tactile and clicky the
thing is in sensor is very fast and I
love - charging now let's move on to the
cons it comes the main conics maybe that
it doesn't have any water resistance
which basically every flagship
smartphone has
one days it also doesn't have anything
like a high quality DAC it doesn't have
wireless charging it's not VR compatible
what else what else the bezels are
pretty big which doesn't look as you
know futuristic as the latest phones and
I think that's about it
to ask a conclusion the one plus five is
the phone right now for the Android
enthusiasts who just want here Android
no gimmicks just an overall speedy phone
but if you are interested in a more in a
more edited version of Android then do
not buy the one plus five by something
like the s8 or the HTC u 11 instead
which have all of these extra features
