best-looking Android wear SmartWatch as
of now the watch has this very premium
watch housing all made out of high
quality metal the leather watch band is
made out of actual leather an awesome
cheap fake leather and a 1.4 inch 400 by
400 m OLED display has a sapphire
crystal glass panel right on top of it
so yeah this thing it screams premium
all over the place including the price
tag of 349 to $800 but hey it's not as
bad as the $15,000 Apple watch Edition
the Huawei watch comes in this beautiful
leather box which opens up to present
the goodness inside you'll find a wall
we wash beautifully presented at the top
down below you'll find some manuals and
at the bottom you'll find your charger
it's the Wally watch as good as its
price tag suggests well we're going to
be taking a look at that in this review
we will start off by taking a look at
the hardware then moving on to the
software where we will be taking a look
at how functional it is being paired to
iOS if you're more interested in a video
from an Android standpoint please do let
me know in the comments down below and
I'll give you a few links to some other
good reviews the display is a 1.4 inch
AMOLED 400 by 400 display I know that
sounds awesome
and yeah it is the colors are super
vibrant and poppy and whenever something
on the screen is black those individual
pixels actually stop emitting light
which both help save battery life and
makes the watch look badass so the
display on the wall you watch is pretty
much spot-on
the watch itself is as mentioned before
made out of high quality metal it has a
more glossy finish on the top and a more
brushed finish along the sides and back
it has one simple button on a two
o'clock position a microphone behind one
of the banned mounts and a heart rate
monitor on the back there's not that
much more and I mean that in a good way
the watch just looks so sleek simple and
premium the heart rate monitor is pretty
accurate when compared to a chest bass
monitor but you're not going to use it
that much because there's not that much
implementation in the Android wear
software for a heart rate monitor the
watch though has all the gyroscopes and
accelerometers that you'll find in most
SmartWatch so activity tracking is
pretty much spot-on
it counts your steps calories burned and
how many times a day that you've gone
from a sitting position to a standing
one the body wash uses 18 millimeter
bands so if you're not very fond of the
band that comes with it this purchase
your own so what I would do is I would
go to amazon.com buy one in silicon for
workouts one in metal for a more
business II and classy look and keep the
one in leather and you know I'll be
pretty much good to go so let's take a
look at the software pairing it to the
iPhone was quite simple you just had to
download the Android wear app and
basically pair it like you would with
any other Bluetooth device but
functionality is actually okay to use an
Android wear SmartWatch with an iPhone
I'd actually say so yeah if you're just
buying a SmartWatch for notifications
and doing simple tasks Android wear it
will work perfectly fine but if you want
the third-party apps and replying to
texts and calls on the watch you've got
to have an Android phone with that said
let's take a look at the apps that we
have available when paired to an iPhone
so we've got agenda alarm daily tracking
google fit fitness tracking flashlight
Google heart rate settings stopwatch
timer google translate and weather so
yeah we've actually got quite a bit of
functionality just not the third-party
apps and the ability to reply to emails
phone calls and texts straight from the
watch in terms of watch faces we get the
ones pre-installed on the Huawei watch
and a few select third-party ones the
battery life is definitely in the upper
bracket of SmartWatch
most watches only last about a day if
even that the while we watch well I can
definitely vote for it lasting at least
a day and a half with moderate use and
about one day and ten hours or so with
hard use and brightness on Macs talking
about battery life how do you actually
charge the watch well there's this
cradle with pins on the side it's
magnetic but you kind of have to align
the payments to actually get the wash to
charge so that's a little bit messy
right there so it's the Wally watch
worth its price tag well you know it's
super luxurious and expensive looking
and it has some of the best hardware
that you'd find in any SmartWatch right
now like the beautiful AMOLED display
and a luxurious build quality pair that
with Android wear and you get an amazing
SmartWatch even more so if you pair it
with an actual Android phone thank you
guys so much for watching if you're
interested in buying the body wash there
will be a couple amazon links down below
