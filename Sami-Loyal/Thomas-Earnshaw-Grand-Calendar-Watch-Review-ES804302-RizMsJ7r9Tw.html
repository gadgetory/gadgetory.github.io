here back with another watch review on
your screen right now is the Thomas
Earnshaw grand calendar now Thomas
Earnshaw was a pretty famous old
watchmaker that made luxury and very
high quality watches this isn't the same
thing this is just a company that has
bought the name and started producing
cheaper watches this one's about three
hundred and fifty US dollars it's
definitely no Rolex it's no it's no
Amiga it's it's no longeing it's a
modern Thomas Earnshaw and what is a
modern Thomas Earnshaw well let's take a
look so in terms of the specifications I
grabbed them off their website one weird
thing is that they don't show very much
in terms of the specification so you
have to do some guessing which I've done
and those guessing's are probably not
going to be 100% correct but here we go
it's from the collection grand calendar
and the specific model in that
collection is called the es - 804 3 - OH
- the movement is automatic it has three
hands with four complications those
being the day the date the month and a
24-hour indicator so right off the bat
it's a complicated watch the case is
stainless steel its diameter is 41
millimeters the cases thickness is 13
millimeters so it's not a very thick
watch the case color is stainless steel
however this model is also available in
gold rose gold as well the dial color is
called silver white but it's also
available in some other colors on their
website and the band color is black it's
also available with a brown leather the
strap is a buckle strap it's water
resistance is 5 atmospheres so that's 50
meters do not swim or shower with it and
the bandwidth is 20 to 18 millimeters it
weighs 100 grams and you get 2 years of
international warranty now the weird
thing with this spec sheet is they don't
show you what movement it is the
movement does look really cool from the
back however I'm sure that it's a
mass-produced cheap movement with
nothing special really and also they
don't tell you which kind of glass there
is it is mineral though so scratches can
get
on there pretty easily if you bump into
something or job the watch or something
so be be careful with that so let's do
an overview the watch face is very
complicated because it has a lot of
complications and the skeleton look and
what are complications well
complications are anything in a watch
that is not telling the time this
particular one has a set before the
24-hour indicator the weekday the date
the month and the 24-hour indicator the
skeleton looked basically means it
doesn't have a dial that is 100% white
or 100% black it's actually transparent
so you can see a bit of the automatic
movement from behind which looks like a
skeleton basically but that makes it a
lot more complicated in terms of just
looking at the time it's got rose gold
colored hands they are very thin the
crown can of course be used for winding
the watch and a weird thing with the
crown is if you look from the side it's
blue for some reason I don't know it
looks weird but that's the way it is the
case is polished stainless steel with a
lot of shine it is water-resistant to 5
atmosphere which is not okay for
showering or swimming it has glass on
the backside to show the movement which
does look nice but as said before it's
just a cheap mass-produced movement so
nothing sentimental about that the
leather band feels and looks pretty
fitting over the watch so you easily
forget that you're wearing it now with
that said let's take a look at the pros
and cons pros it's very dressy so if
that's what you're after that's a big
pro and it does have many features in an
automatic watch for just 350 US dollars
it's very cool to see so many
complications in a watch that is both
automatic and not so expensive at the
same time the leather band feels like
it's of quality it has a nice feel to it
and it will probably hold up very well
so cons it's got mineral glass which
means it's not scratch proof it's kind
of hard to read the time because the
hands are so thin and because the dial
is so complicated so if what you're
after is just a
utilitarian look where you can just
easily see the time this is definitely
as far as you can get away from that the
movement is nothing special it's
mass-produced it isn't you know the most
cool movement there is out there it's
just a normal automatic movement with
four complications which still is pretty
cool another con is the weird blue dot
on the crown I don't know why it is
there however it is and there's nothing
to do about it it's just a weird blue
spot on the crown for some reason next
up is no waterproofing which doesn't
really matter anyway because you have a
leather band on it which which is also
not waterproof so it's also a dress
watch so you should not be swimming with
it anyway however it is good to know
that this watch will probably die if you
decide to go snorkeling or diving or
anything like that with it which you
shouldn't do anyway another con is that
because of its very many complications
and just in general because it's an
automatic movement the service costs
will be pretty high and that's not very
easy to chew on when the wash itself
only costs about three hundred and fifty
US dollars I'm guessing if you have this
watch for like ten years
you're probably going to spend about 150
US dollars on just service costs many
watches in this price point decide to go
for quartz movements instead because
they are so cheap to service it is
pretty cool to have a mechanical watch
on your wrist though instead of you know
some normal quartz movement that's
basically just a computer the next con
is that there is no loom at all which
means reading the time in the night is
impossible next up is the wash is not
accurate compared to quartz it's gonna
run at least plus minus 10 seconds per
day versus like 20 seconds per year on
quartz and at this price point they
should have just chosen quartz in my
opinion so as a conclusion if you are
after a very dressy watch with features
that start conversations but don't
really care about the actual quality of
the movement waterproofing scratch proof
glass etc I think this Thomas Earnshaw
watch is a pretty good
by so thanks for watching if you've got
any questions please do leave those in
the comment section down below and I'll
catch you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
