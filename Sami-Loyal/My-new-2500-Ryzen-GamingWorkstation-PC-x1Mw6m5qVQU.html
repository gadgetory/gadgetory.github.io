choosing the components putting
everything together doing cable
management and then lastly of course
turning it on for the first time to
watch that boot screen pop up on a
monitor so in ASU's KF a to be quiet and
crucial offer to send in some components
for me to build a PC with I got very
excited now there's a bunch of videos on
YouTube talking about how to build a PC
and they're really good so I won't do
any of that
instead I figured would just take a look
at the components my thoughts of them
and some benchmarks on the PC and then
in some future videos I might make some
individual reviews of some of the
components in this computer so first of
all let's take a look at the case which
be quite provided among other components
it's called the dark base 700 and it's a
really great looking case it's extremely
rigid features tempered glass a great
mounting system for radiators up top a
fan hub and just an all-around great
look it's extremely quiet and has a
really cool RGB strip running along both
sides of the case which by the way can
be turned off upfront it features two
USB ports the controller for the LED
lights a hard drive activity light which
also happens to be the reset switch a
nice and tactile power button a
headphone and a mic jack and
surprisingly a USB 3.1 type C port and
next to that is the controller for the
fan hub overall I really enjoyed
building in it as everything from
mounting components and radiators to
cable management has been a pleasure the
only issue I have with it is that I
wasn't able to fit a rear exhaust fan
because of the radiator block unit I
also have no idea how to put the PSU
cover pieces back on but that one's
probably on me spec wise it's featuring
the new AMD Reisen 2700 CPU it has a
whopping 8 cores and 16 threads it's a
very versatile CPU in a way because
it'll handle gaming quite well but it'll
also do lots of creative work with ease
so it's really the best CPU for
like me who tends to play some games but
also gets into some more creative stuff
like video editing and maybe also some
streaming sometimes in Cinebench and at
stock speeds it manages to get an insane
score of 1466 nice cooling the CPU is
the really stealthy and industrial
looking be quiet silent loop 280
millimeter all in one water cooler now
for someone who doesn't like the
epilepsy inducing RGB effects of some
coolers I really enjoyed the more
professional look of the be quite silent
loop but it doesn't only look good it's
cooling performance is beyond what I'd
expect at idle I'm averaging around 30 C
which is alright but what's really
surprising and cool pun intended is that
it maxes out at only 45 C while on a
synthetic load pair to the CPU we've got
probably the best 16 gig ram kit you can
get right now
it's a 2 X 8 take kit from Corsair the
Vengeance RGB which is Asus RS
incompatible more on that later it's
running at an insanely fast 30 600
megahertz speed which paired to a rise
in CPU is really good and of course it
looks badass supplying the gaming
performance this time around we've got
the kf8 2 geforce gtx 1070 TI x sniper
white now some people think this card is
a weird addition to Nvidia's GTX lineup
and I agree it is we've now got a
whopping 10 Pascal based gaming cards in
the lineup and it's weird and confusing
to people who don't know a whole lot
about components but I'm in no way
complaining about getting a 1070 TI it's
an amazing card as it'll play any game
that I can possibly throw at it as 1440p
and at
high settings I also really like the
design of it it differs a bit from the
cards we always see in these kinds of
builds it's refreshing I haven't really
overclocked the card yet and I don't
really plan on it either as Nvidia's
automatic speed boost feature seems to
do the job just fine for my storage
crucial stepped in and supplied me with
a really nice 500 gauge SATA SSD I
mounted it on the back of the case and
it's been holding up really well now
last year I built a PC with a 250 gig
pcie-based SSD and it was super fast but
also extremely expensive and not really
worth it and what's really interesting
here is that I never noticed a big
difference in speed between my old PCIe
SSD and this SATA crucial one I'm sure
the speed difference is more noticeable
when for example transferring big files
but in day-to-day tasks I have not
noticed a difference so at just a
hundred and twenty dollars for a 500 gig
SSD this crucial Drive is awesome in
terms of our motherboard here
Asus were nice enough to send in their
ROG crosshair Hero 7 now this is really
an overkill motherboard I'm not going to
talk about every feature that it has
because there are so many and it's
literally got everything you could think
of but what's really stood out to me so
far is its awesome looks a Seuss's are a
sync making it easy to sync up the RGB
of most of my components and the great
stability and bios that it offers I
don't think you can find a better x4 70
motherboard on the market right now now
for what's powering the build and doing
it with ease we've got to be quite
straight power 11 with 850 watts of
power and in Nice 80 plus gold
efficiency rating I don't have much to
say about it and I haven't really
thought of it much after installing it
and with a power supply that's really
good it means it does the job extremely
well it's quiet it's modular and has
really nice cables that come in the box
now
I know 850 watts is really overkill for
this build but it means that I can sli
high-end cards in the future which I
might do so with all this said I want to
thank a SUSE for supplying the
motherboard the RAM and also the CPU be
quiet for sponsoring the case the power
supply and the cooler crucial for giving
me the awesome 500 gig SSD and of course
KF a - for sponsoring me with a really
high-end graphics card in these times
where GPUs are really expensive
thanks so what do you guys think is
there anything you would change did I do
a good cable management job etc let me
know in the comment section down below
and I'll see you guys in the next video
