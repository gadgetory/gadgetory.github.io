now and today we are going to be taking
a look at the Nexus 5x from LG and
Google
the Nexus 5x is the younger brother to
the 6p so it has a smaller screen size
with a lower resolution it also has a
less premium body and less premium
specifications but most importantly it's
a lot cheaper and in my opinion it still
holds up very well to today's standards
so let's find out why so let's start off
by looking at the specifications of the
5x the 5x is rocking a Snapdragon 808
processor and 2 gigs of RAM the screen
is 5.2 inches and sports a resolution of
1080 x 1920 it also has Gorilla Glass 3
the battery has a capacity of 27 hundred
milliamps and is able to quick charge
via the USB type-c port in terms of
graphics we are looking at the Adreno
418 GPU and looking at storage options
we either have 16 or 32 gigabytes which
is a little low especially when shooting
a lot of 4k video which surprisingly the
Nexus 5x supports so speaking of 4k what
are the camera specs on the Nexus 5x the
Nexus 5x actually features the same
sensor and optics as these 6p which is
awesome to see 12 megapixels F 2 point 0
a Verger laser autofocus slow motion
pretty much the whole package the front
facing camera is a 5 megapixel shooter
with an aperture of F 2 point 0 and in
terms of audio we have one front-facing
speaker no not too we only have one but
it kind of looks like there's two but
sadly there's only one and it's not even
good so let's just not talk about the
speaker so let's take a look at the
build on the bottom there's a USB type-c
port and a headphone jack and on the
side there's some very boring looking
power and volume buttons and on the back
there's a fingerprint reader which is
not clickable which feels a little bit
weird when moving from the LG v10 and as
you've already noticed the whole body is
made out of
plastic instead of metal which we see on
the more expensive devices such as the
6p and iPhone 6s all right enough
 let's talk android 601
marshmallow it's awesome there's nothing
as pure as a Nexus device running the
latest and greatest Android software
it's extremely sleek and smooth and
everything runs like a charm without
needing to worry about random
pre-installed software so yeah that's
awesome but software is nothing without
hardware so how is the performance the
Nexus 5x handles daily tasks such as
browsing the web and multitasking
surprisingly good it's only when you
start gaming and doing more heavy stuff
that it starts to lag a bit behind but
not by much the screen is actually great
it's not a 1440p AMOLED display but
colors are still decently vibrant and
poppy but I have noticed that the screen
has a small amount of green tint which
looked a little bit weird but it's only
noticeable wanted to go really deep into
it and other than that it's great and in
my opinion it also has the perfect
screen size it's relatively easy to use
with one hand but at the same time it's
fairly big for consuming media such as
YouTube and Netflix and speaking of
media how is the camera I will let you
be the judge of that
you
I
leave your comments about the camera
down below in the comment section the
front facing camera is decent but not
special at all it's gonna get you okay
selfies but all this hardware would not
work without a battery and this is where
the 2700 milliamp hour battery steps in
I could go an entire day with moderate
use and still have about twenty percent
left but if you are a power user the
Nexus 5x may not be for you because the
battery drains pretty damn quick but to
mention it also charges pretty damn
quick and that with the help of the new
quick charging capable USB type-c port
all right that's the Nexus 5x it's an
awesome device and for the price you
will not be disappointed the Nexus 5x is
a very well-rounded device and I would
not hesitate to recommend it to anyone
thanks for watching if you liked the
video go ahead and leave a like and if
not please tell me why in the comments
down below also do not forget to
subscribe if you haven't already and
I'll see you guys in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
