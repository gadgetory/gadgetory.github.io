with another video and today I have got
the mystery unboxing number DOS so this
time I wanted to change things up a
little bit so we are not going to be
doing just one package but instead we
are going to be doing three packages and

can customize you can customize the
colors the switches yes a lot of stuff
so I cannot wait to show you guys in I
customize this to my own liking oh my
god this looks sweet oh oh okay guys
guys guys
so what did I choose as you can see I
chose to have all of the key caps white
because I think it would look good with
a white desk like but there is a catch a
very good catch so you might have
noticed that some of these key caps are
actually black with some white logos on
it and no it's not the windows or or the
mac logo it's actually my logo my own
tech me now logo has been printed on
these key caps that are black so the
Saudis keys and then the Escape key
doesn't this look amazing a high
