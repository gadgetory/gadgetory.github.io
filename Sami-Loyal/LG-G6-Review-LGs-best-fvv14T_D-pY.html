last year in a nutshell it's had a weird
build where it was made out of metal but
had a plastic coating on top of it for
some reason it had good specs for the
time you know a snapdragon 820
4 gigs of ram and all that a decent
screen average battery life and a bad
execution of the modular phone concept
and the two main reasons for this
failure is that the phone had to be
restarted when switching modules and
speaking of those they were not many
this year with the g6 though LG stepped
away from the huge risk taking and
instead they set up to create a really
solid 2017 collection but with a huge
smartphone manufacturer Samsung I think
you've heard of them and the new s8 have
they managed to do that well let's find
out as I mentioned before the g5 had an
all round metal / plastic build this
year however the phone has a very shiny
for the first 5 second glass back panel
instead it looks and feels great and so
does the entire phone the metal sides
have this premium looking Shepherd edge
the volume rocker is solid metal and
have a great tactile click there's a
headphone jack Wow the glass back panel
looks very futuristic with the dual and
camera layout and they managed to put
the pretty big 5.7 inch IPS display on
the front thanks to the much appreciated
reduction in bezel size on the back
you'll find the fingerprint scanner
which is very freakin accurate and has
pretty much never failed on me so the
build it's futuristic it's
water-resistant down to 1.5 meters in up
to 30 minutes
if solid premium fairly lightweight and
just great feeling in the hand and
that's my summary of the LG g 6s design
and build quality now let's take a look
at that screen
it's an IPS panel so it's maybe not as
vibrant and punchy as let's say the
AMOLED display found on the Galaxy s8
but it does look great and in my opinion
more natural than an AMOLED panel its
resolution is 28 80 by 1440 so that's a
little bit taller than the 1440 16 by 9
aspect ratio displays that were used to
this means that when watching videos
shot in 16 by 9 there will be black bars
around the sides it can look weird at
first but it never actually bothered me
in any way the pro of having a taller
display though is more room in apps of
which you scroll allotting so basically
every app other than video and gaming
apps so in summary I really do like to
display its razor-sharp natural-looking
has thin vessels and more room in social
media apps let's really quickly get into
the specifications of the g6 so that we
can talk more about to the important
stuff like battery life and cameras the
thing is specifications in flagship
phones like this don't matter that much
anymore you expect that actual phone to
be speedy and the g6 is just like the s8
even though as you might know the s8
hassium newer and supposedly more
powerful SOC so yes the g6 is just as
fast as my s8 in terms of just she
respects though the g6 is packin a
Snapdragon 820 1 paired with the Adreno
530 GPU 4 gigs of ram a 3300 milliamp
hour battery a 5.7 inch 1440p IPS
display protected by Gorilla Glass 3 a
micro SD card slot dual 13 megapixel
cameras and on and on and on and other
than the previously mentioned specs it's
got all those normal things like Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and all that so let's not
waste any more time and get into some
fun stuff the camera system because it's
interesting the camera system on the g5
last year was actually pretty great so
what LG did this year was just to
improve on it it's got one standard view
camera and one super wide one the g5 of
last year had the same camera setup but
the wide view camera was significantly
worse in terms of quality than the
standard v1 this is not a problem
anymore though as both cameras or
equipped with the same quality glass
wide apertures and same megapixel count
so let's take a look at some unedited
pictures videos and selfies taken with
the LG G six in auto mode
so there you guys go please let me know
in the comment section down below like
you think of the camera in the g6 now
let's move on to another very important
part of a phone the battle compared to
last year is a lot better it's no longer
just average and instead it's actually
better than most personally I got around
four to five and a half hours of screen
on time depending on the usage for that
day including idling hours the phone
last to a day of use with ease and it's
actually one of the reasons why I
switched to the g6 from the SAS the g6
also has quick charge 3.0 meaning it
will charge fast a point of which the
essays and g6 are very similar in its
speakers they're both just met they just
have one speaker at the bottom which one
is not directed towards you and two is
very easy to block when watching movies
videos and playing games so don't expect
the speakers to be very special in the
g6 nor the s8 in terms of some special
features like wireless charging and an
inbuilt high quality DAC the g6 has all
of that but not in one place if bought
in Europe you get none of that if bought
in the u.s. you get wireless charging
and if bought in Asia you get attacked I
find this dividing of features across
regions to be very weird and I wish that
LG stops doing this with the next phones
so as a conclusion the LG G 6 is a huge
step forward for LG this is definitely
their best phone yet and one of the best
phones so far in 2017 in terms of
competition the g6 is one hell of a good
phone and I decided to sell my s8 and
keep the g6 so I really like it and you
can't go wrong with it so thanks for
watching please click that like button
if you enjoyed the video subscribe if
you haven't already and I'll catch you
guys in the next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
