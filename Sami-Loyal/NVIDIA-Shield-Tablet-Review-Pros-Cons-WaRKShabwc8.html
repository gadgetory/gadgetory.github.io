this is my review of the Nvidia shield
tablet now I will start off with the
pros and then move over to my comms so
the device is extremely fast and very
very responsive and very very good
that's the Tegra k1 processor right
there it is super snappy super fast and
super awesome it's really just a
powerhouse this device it's just really
really fast and for pro number two the
speakers are literally the best speakers
I have ever seen on a tablet before they
are front-facing so the sound is very
crispy and clear and very loud it's very
very good another great Pro is that the
screen is a 1080p screen is super crispy
and super clear and very good viewing
angles and for the last pro in this
video the controller connects in just
about three seconds via Wi-Fi direct
three seconds that's amazing the
controller that you can buy separately
connects in just about three seconds and
you see here i am able to use it very
very fast very good it has no lag it
just pretty much the best controller i
have ever used so for the cons the power
and volume rocker buttons they are very
mushy they feel very sheep they're just
very very bad but you know they work at
least but they are not very very good
I don't like them at all but you know
there's always going to be some cons in
such a great device so the micro SD card
tray it's very very deep so you have to
have pretty long fingernails to get the
the the SD card to work properly and for
the last con the camera is really really
really bad but you know that's not
something you can expect from a tablet
like this because this tablet is it is
focused for gamers and gamers only so
the camera does not play a huge role but
that's about it so that is everything I
have for you today thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
