improves on a lot of points since last
year's p9 however no piece of tech is
perfect so in this video we're taking a
look at the five major pros and cons of
the new wall AP 10 so without any
further ado let's get straight into the
pros the P 10 features a stationary
fingerprint sensor which is super fast
it's honestly the quickest sensor I've
ever experienced it's also very accurate
and just top-notch overall what we
decided to keep the headphone jack
despite Apple and HTC ditching it it's
still a very important port to many
and I don't think that we're ready to
move to wireless just yet it has to get
cheaper and therefore I think what we
did us all a favor by keeping the Jack
the t10 has a really interesting dual
camera system one of the sensor is a
black and white one and the other is a
color one the software then combines the
information from the two sensors and
produces great images the Huawei p10 is
very well built it's got a very similar
aluminium design to the iPhone and I
guess that's a good thing if you like
that type of this sign nevertheless
though it's rugged high-quality and
feels great in the hand with its 32
hundred million power battery the p10
lasts you a day of use with ease it's
interesting how the p10 has a bigger
battery than the s8 which is a
specifically bigger phone it might just
be Samsung stepping back a bit though
because of what happened with in note 7
so with approach done let's take a look
at some of the cons I have for the p10
as mentioned before the home button and
a fingerprint sensor is not really a
button as it's stationary that meaning
it doesn't move that makes it feel a bit
awkward if you never use such a button
before and yes I know this con is a huge
nitpick as you get used to this pretty
fast compared to the latest from Samsung
and LG the Huawei p10 might just look a
little out of date because of its huge
top and bottom vessels it's just a poor
use of space nowadays hashtag poor use
of space I don't know what it is but the
touch surface on the display feels a bit
awkward it's just not as smooth sliding
your finger across that screen compared
to pretty much every other phone
used I think I've read some articles a
while back about it not fishing some
kind of display coating that could be
the cause but I'm not entirely sure the
emui skin on top of android looks in my
opinion this is very subjective very
outdated and just cheesy it's not clean
it doesn't fit the phone very well and
the settings menu looks oddly similar to
iOS it also packs a bunch of duplicate
apps not good in my opinion the water
resistance should be a standard on
flagship smartphones moving forward
since the s7 launched last year have we
seen that yeah actually we have seen
quite a lot of water resistant phones
the iPhone the LG G 6 the Sony phones
but the YP 10 launched a whole year
after the s7 does not feature water
resistance so there you guys go
those are the five major pros and cons I
had for the Huawei P 10 if you liked

button and subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
