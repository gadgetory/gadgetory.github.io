with another video and today we are
going to be taking a look at the Atlas
wristband this is an interesting fitness
tracker but it's definitely not for
everyone it doesn't track steps or
distance or anything along those lines
but what it does track is mainly
exercises that you would do either at
home or in the gym so everything from
jumping jacks to pull ups the Atlas
wristband has an interesting look it's
nowhere near close to being discreet so
if you were planning on using it both in
the gym and in the office that's a big
no this is only for workouts and I have
to put an emphasis on that the one that
i have is black and green but there are
different color variants available the
actual device itself attaches to the
band with magnets there is one button on
the side that can be used to go back and
on the bottom there is a heart rate
monitor and on the other side there is a
micro USB charging port speaking of
charging how is the battery life it's
not good for wearing all day every day
but who would do that the Atlas
wristband should go through about two or
three workouts though before needing
some extra juice the band is comfortable
to wear and it's very light it's also
waterproof down to 30 meters but it
doesn't track swimming so those 30
meters were not that needed or I cool so
what does the interface look like it's
very simple to use just tap where you
want to go and that's that so on the
first screen you have the time and date
next you have a workout program that you
choose in the connected application and
next we have a freestyle where you
basically just start working out and the
device will detect what you are doing
basically how many reps and your heart
rate and once you are done with that
press the physical button and click end
then just open the app and sync the app
will then show a summary of your workout
now let's get into some pros and cons so
pros workout detection is spot on it's
light and comfortable it has a touch
display and a good heart rate monitor
cons the display is practically unusable
outdoors it has is somewhat ugly
designed but the beauty is in the eye of
the beholder the screen is easily
scratch able and the battery life is man
alright so as a conclusion do I like
this product yeah sure it's a cool
product made entirely for gym usage and
home workouts there is cardio training
but it's not worth spending two hundred
dollars on it to do cardio there's a
bunch of better watches for that thank
you guys so much for watching please
leave a like if you enjoyed the video
and I'll see you guys in the next one
peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
