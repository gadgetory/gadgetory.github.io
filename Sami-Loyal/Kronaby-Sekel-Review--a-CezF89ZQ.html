sequel hybrid watch
it's a watch trying to bring a good
balance of two worlds the tech world and
of course the quality wash world and in
my honest opinion I think it strikes a
great balance between the two it
features this beautiful steel design
paired with this mesmerizing dial and it
really does look great maybe a bit too
dressy for my taste but nonetheless it's
a great looking watch and not only that
it's also very well-built with its
sapphire glass meaning it basically
can't get scratched the waterproofing of
a hundred meters and these rugged
quality side buttons in terms of what
you get from the tech world there's
actually a lot to like for example it
tracks your daily steps and can display
the gold progress on the second dial it
can keep track of two different time
zones and either display the second time
on the small dial or just when you press
your desired site button it's got a
vibrating alarm filtered notifications
and more now it's definitely no
SmartWatch that can keep track of
activities give you readable
notifications etc it's just got the
basics and for me that's enough I
personally do not think that smart
watches have advanced enough yet for me
to want to wear one every day so this is
a good substitute
I like quality watches I like
convenience features and the krona buy
has those features but yeah there's not
a whole lot to talk about in a watch so
let's just run down the pros and cons as
an end to this video
pros great design it looks good and can
easily be mistaken for a normal luxury
watch and that means you get the
convenient features without looking a
bit too geeky or sporty it's also very
well built it features the standards
found on luxury watches such as sapphire
glass and water resistance it comes with
quality bands compared to other watches
around this price hybrid SmartWatch or
not the watch's band looks feels and is
of high quality
obviously the leather strap is not water
resistant so if you want to daily wear
the watch and not worry about damaging
the strap get yourself a metal band
instead it looks just as good the setup
is easy just click the mid side
when you have unboxed it open the app
and there you go it's connected another
pro is to watch this functionality and
you guys already know about that so
let's move on to the next Pro this is
truly a hybrid watch that you can carry
every day not only because of its good
looks and the water resistance but also
because it doesn't need charging all you
gotta do is change out the battery once
every two years or so so with that said
let's take a look at the not-so-good
things and starting off it's got bad Lu
now if you don't know what loom is in
the wash world it's basically the white
parts on a dials and our marks those
shine blue when it's dark and not
through battery power but through the
light which was shined at it before it
got dark in many watches around this
price point the loom is clear bright and
easy to read but not so much with the
corona boy it just doesn't shine bright
enough and the outer marks are kind of
hard to read because they're so small
another con is the fact that it cannot
be bought instead of a SmartWatch if
that's what you're looking for the
features on the corona buy are enough
for me although if your intention was to
get a more dressy SmartWatch this isn't
it look at something like the gear sv
classic instead The Seagull could be a
bit too dressy for some people it
certainly it looks good but I wouldn't
wear a watch with this look every day
instead I'd buy the apex washing step
it's got the same features but just with
a more everyday wear look so with that
said I do like the Kona Buy and I can
definitely recommend you guys to go and
get one but the question is what do you
guys think about this watch let me know
in the comment section down below like
and subscribe if you haven't already and
I'll catch you guys in the next video
