another video and today we are going to
be starting a new series called tech
life hacks where I together with another
youtuber gives you some awesome tech
related life hacks so the plan is to do
this serious monthly given that you guys
actually enjoy it so please do let me
know by commenting down below or liking
the video in this first episode I am
collaborating together with tech proof
another great youtuber so if you like
what you saw from him in this video you
know what to do
so with that said let's get into the
tech life hacks
kickin this list office for the people
that are building a PC once Windows is
installed and you didn't mess up your
computer build you'll need to install
all your design programs there is a
website called 9 night and you can
select all the programs the basic ones
you need you can click on download and
you won't have to run to all the yes I
accept the terms and servers an
agreement ball that you normally
have to and will all download in at once
which is very snazzy and a fuses in the
past I can fully recommend it if there's
a youtube video that you want to turn
into a jiff
just type gif before youtube.com in the
URL bar this will redirect you to gif
Escom who are you can edit the video to
your desired length and also add effects
and texts and stuff like that the next
one some of you might know that's do not
keep batteries in cool environments not
only because the cool drains the
batteries but it also damages them in
the long run because it shortens the
lifespan and eventually your batteries
will be useless you also should keep
batteries under 20% you should charge
them while still above 20% because this
is also prone to be bad for your battery
in the long run if you have an iPhone
and want to play a YouTube video in the
background while doing other stuff start
watching the video in Safari go to home
then go to the control center where you
can just click play now I've got one
that's quite ghetto but you really all
should be using it and that's
double-sided tape I used to secure amps
and Dax to my desk I used to secure LED
strips to my desks
I used to secure batteries to my camera
basically I use it for everything it's
very very handy it's cheap it's reliable
I also sometimes find you spell CRO tape
which is another one of those that's
very very handy
reason being for instance I've got my
LED remote for my LED strips I'm just
second under the desk and whenever I
need it I'll just pull it off and manage
my LEDs and I'll just stick it up there
and it always works and it never falls
off so that's really something usually
you guys should be looking into because
I really do recommend it if you want to
spice up your typing in stuff like word
or pages you can actually make your own
font with your own handwriting by going
to my script font comm just print out
the PDF or PNG file and start writing
all the letters and once you are done
with that just scan that in and upload
it to the website the website will then
give you a font file that you can
install and once that's installed you
are all set to go and there you go
that's my handwriting in pages on Mac
keeping your hard drives plugged in is
another one of those that you should do
reason being is a spinning hard drive is
less prone to get damaged and a hard
drive that's not being used that's
actually proven science I always keep my
external hard drive buck since you might
be see but I didn't know it was actually
less prone to get damaged as it turns
out it does because the drive is
spinning it can't get stuck or some
stuff like that it's actually proven
science so just keep your hard drives
plugged in and they'll be fine
so the next life hack is a very quick
one but also extremely useful if you did
not know about it before if you happen
to accidentally close a tab in your
browser just click ctrl shift T on
Windows or command shift T on a Mac to
reopen the tab magic cable management
can make or break a set off it also
enhances productivity because they clean
set up is a clean mind set I always use
cable drops to keep cables in place all
to make sure they don't fall off my desk
it's really handy and I think most of
you guys already know about cable drop
so another thing I would really
recommend is this cable management kit
from Ikea it's super handy it costs only
five bucks and it comes with all the
tools you'll need to make sure that your
cables are neat and tidy this goes along
with velcro as well as cable ties if you
use all of those you'll be set you'll be
fine and I mean for five bucks it's
pretty hard do not recommend this thank
you very much Toby for having me on the
channel and I'll see you soon if you're
having a
along with any type of tech can go to
google.com search for the problem that
you are experiencing and add solved to
the end of the search bar this will give
you webpages of people who have had the
same problem as you and has solved it
the more you know so that has been it
that was the video if you liked this
series and want to see more of it please
