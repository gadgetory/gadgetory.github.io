iPhone 8 plus and here are my five
personal pros and cons to help you guys
decide whether you should pick it up or
not so without wasting any time with
long intros let's get into the pros
starting with qi wireless charging it's
finally here and it's great now sure I
know Android has had that for ages
however with a company as large and
influential as Apple implementing the
feature we got ourselves a much more
widespread feature benefiting all of us
I'm willing to bet that we'll see a
bunch of these charging pads all over
coffee shops restaurants and more we'll
also see a lot more research going into
this technology meaning it'll get
improved in terms of charging speed and
efficiency and also eventually we'll be
able to buy tables or desks with
wireless charging across the entire
surface that's going to be awesome in
terms of wireless charging on the iPhone
right now I'm gonna have to say it is a
bit behind the competition because it
charges at five watts instead of 15
watts on for example the s8 but yeah
nonetheless it is definitely a step in
the right direction for Apple and the
entire industry next up I'm gonna have
to say I love this camera photos looks
so clean crisp and just very true to
real life and also now we've got 60 FPS
4k video which is insane it's most
likely the only phone doing this right
now
and that's thanks to the all new a 11
Bionic processor which is my third pro
of the iPhone 8 it's fantastic now
you're not going to notice a big
increase in performance regarding normal
tasks like social media and browsing the
web
however this increasing power enables
technologies we've never actually been
able to implement into the iPhone before
some examples of those would be a are an
actual 4k video editing right on the
phone next up is the fantastic battery
life I'm not going out on a limb and
saying in the last two full days which
it will not however I'm almost 100% sure
that
whatever you do during your day will not
kill the battery of the iPhone 8 plus
there's not many phones out there that
I'm able to say that about my final pro
with the iPhone 8 and do note that these
are not all pros and cons are just the
main five in my personal opinion is iOS
11 I've heard about complaints regarding
bugs however during my two weeks with
his phone I never experienced any of
that
I love the new iOS 11 features we have
finally got a customizable control
center augmented reality quick setup
quick type and so much more it's just a
really great mobile operating system I
definitely have some minor gripes with
it like the fact that we can't place
apps in the way we want its 2017 Apple
but anyway in my honest opinion and I'm
saying this iOS is the best overall
mobile operating system right now
alright let's move over to the cons
starting with the most obvious con these
so boring design we have been getting
this design from Apple for the last four
years
and it's definitely getting repetitive
the ex is coming out and that's
definitely an improvement but releasing
two phones two months between each other
with one being a four year old design
and the other one being brand new come
on Apple just release the X my next con
is about the lack of a headphone jack I
said it I still want the jack but that's
just me if all your headphones and
accessories are wireless that's great
good for you but there are still many
people out there using aux equipped
hardware like headphones connecting to
their cars etc and now you gotta use a
dongle for that which cuts off charging
yeah I don't like that battery life on
the non plus model is mad and that's why
I included it as a con in this video I
don't want you guys to think that you're
getting amazing battery life on a normal
eight because that's the way it is on
the 8 + reports and reviews have shown
that it might get you through a day of
use if you're a light to medium user but
if not you're probably and this is sad
going to have to recharge during your
day
Walter assistance is also appearing on
the iPhone 8 and 8 plus just like it did
on D 7 however it's still these somewhat
useless ip67 rating meaning it's more of
a safety measure rather than something
you could actually use underwater to
take pictures and that's going to be
fine for most people though it would be
cool to see a more usable water
resistance rating my final con is the
price the iPhone 8 plus costs $800 which
is still very expensive and if you're
coming from a different system like
Android you're gonna have to buy some
accessories as well meaning the final
price you pay could definitely go above
$1000 and that's for an iPhone 7 with
some internal improvements they should
have just named it the 7s and everyone
would be happy anyway those were my five
personal pros and cons about the iPhone
8 plus let me know what you guys think
about these and if you have any of your
own please do leave those in the comment

you haven't already and I'll catch you
