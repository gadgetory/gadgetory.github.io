comes in different specifications but
the version that I have right here
sports a quad core i7 6700 HQ 16
gigabytes of ram a gtx 960m
128 gigs of SSD and a one terabyte
mechanical hard drive the screen is a 4k
IPS touch display and a price
$1200 now to put that price into more
context the Dell XPS 15 with the same
exact specifications would cost you
$2,000 and if you decide to choose my
recommended version of the Inspiron 15
that would cost you only $900 and the
only thing that you lose is the 4k touch
display in trade for a full HD non-touch
display and that trade is pretty damn
good because you take away $300 of the
price and you wouldn't really use the 4k
display in gaming anyway if you don't
have that much time to watch this review
click the screen right now or go to the
first link in the video description down
below to just watch the pros and cons of
this laptop all right let's take a look
at the laptops design and connectivity
the laptop is mainly made out of plastic
but it's a rather high quality it
doesn't feel as good as the XPS laptop
does but for this price the build
quality is just fine the laptop has a
little bit of flex on the screen and
just a little on the keyboard but it's
not anything bothersome and the screens
hinges are stiff enough for a touch
display while at the same time being
able to get open with one finger the
main theme here is black and red so it
definitely has the gamer vibe to it but
not too much when it comes to gamer
intended products I generally don't like
the quality or the actual design of the
product itself but in this case the
laptop actually looks really good and
also feels good and the keyboard is
decent it's actually the same keyboard
as the Dell XPS 15 has but of course
this laptop is intended mainly for
gamers and they are most likely going to
be buying a separate keyboard
instead and the keyboard has a backlight
but it's not RGB so you can't change the
white color to something else and the
trackpad it's pretty big and Palm
reaction was really good as you can see
here but you really have to buy a
separate Mouse of course if you're going
to be playing any games on this laptop
so the trackpad doesn't really matter at
all but it's there and it's fine in
terms of audio you are probably also
going to be buying a separate headset
and not used two speakers but I gotta
say the speaker system is pretty damn
good actually
and the main speaker is above the
keyboard which is great but it also has
a subwoofer on the bottom of the laptop
so the audio gets very loud and sounds
crystal clear the speakers are great
even though you're probably not going to
be using them on the left hand side of
the laptop there's a charging port
exhaust to super speed USB type a ports
and a headphone jack Apple on the other
side there is a Kensington lock on
Ethernet port HDMI another super speed
USB type a port and an SD card reader so
yeah in terms of ports there's
everything you need alright let's take a
look at the gaming performance within
960m now obviously you are not going to
be playing games at 4k you will be doing
that at 1080p which is why I recommend
you to buy the the 1080p version if
you're not going to be using it for
things like photo and video editing this
laptop can play almost any game as 1080p
low and medium settings in rocket league
at 1080p medium settings I was sitting
at an average FPS of 95 and in csgo I
had an average of 150 and games like
League of Legends was of course also
great I actually bumped up the
resolution to 4k in very high settings
and I got a very high average FPS of 101
which is great especially at 4k
resolution in overwatch as 1080p and
medium settings I got on average FPS of
95 so as you can hear this PC is a great
buy if you
plan on playing games like csgo League
of Legends
overwash will of warcraft and those
kinds of games it can even handle some
more intensive games like Battlefield 4
where I sat at around 65 FPS average at
1080p and medium settings I wouldn't
play games like The Witcher 3 on it
though because that would significantly
reduce your gaming experience the
cooling is great I never got the CPU or
GPU to reach above comfortable
temperatures and as you can see here
when we open up the laptop which is very
easily done with just one screw by the
way there are two fans one for the GPU
and one for the CPU the fans get their
fresh air from the vents down below and
push out the hot air to the sides and
back of the laptop where there are red
cooling vents inside of the laptop you
have got the ability to upgrade a lot of
things actually such as the SSD here the
2.5 inch mechanical hard drive and the
RAM in terms of noise doing smaller
stuff like browsing the web and watching
video is dead silent and when you start
playing games though the fans spin up
and get more audible now watching
YouTube Netflix and that kind of stuff
was stunning thanks to the incredible 4k
touch display having Skype calls worked
perfectly fine - the webcam is of decent
quality and the mic is fine to the Wi-Fi
performance was pretty good although I
did have some hiccups a little bit now
and then in games probably just this
unit though as I haven't seen any other
reports of their problem and lastly a
battery life is it good well that
depends on your configuration the 1080p
version lasts for a decent amount of
time although the 4k touch one of course
draws a bunch of more power so it will
last a little less oh and also the 4k
touch display is glossy which can be
annoying for some people if you get the
Sun in your way but the 1080p screen has
anti-glare coating though so in
conclusion the Dell Inspiron 15 75 15
it's an all-around beast of a laptop for
a great price
$900 gets you a top-of-the-line
quad core i7 chip 16 gigs of ram and a
960m and pair that with its great looks
cooling and gaming performance and you
have got my top choice laptop for anyone
looking at getting into gaming or just
wants a portable powerhouse that can
play most titles without breaking the
bank thank you so much for watching
