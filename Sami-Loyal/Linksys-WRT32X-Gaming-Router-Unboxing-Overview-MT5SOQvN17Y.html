look at the Linksys wrt54g an unboxing
taking a look at some of its features
that stand out and so yeah without any
further ado let's take a look at the box
so right here it says wrt 32x gaming
router and they have collaborated with
Alienware gigabyte msi and razer to
implement the so-called killer
prioritization engine into their devices
so let's say the Alienware pcs get that
the gigabyte motherboards get that the
msi laptops and motherboards
etc get that and the razer laptops and
hardware as well now the first thing
that you'll notice is this does not have
the kid you know twelve year old
minecraftgamer look with a black and red
scheme everywhere it's just a very very
subtle looking router which I prefer a
lot no it's not RGB it's not anything
crazy that is on the outside however
it's got some very serious
specifications and features on the
inside of which we will take a look at
in the review so without any further ado
let's get the wrapping out try not to
destroy the box here now while I'm
unboxing this I do want to say that if
there are any special features or things
that you would like me to take a look at
in the review specifically please do not
hesitate to leave those in the comment
section down below and I'll make sure to
check that out
so with the wrapping off we'll take a
look at the backside and here they're
talking about the killer prioritization
engine and what that does we'll get into
that later and to actually benefit from
this feature you have to have a killer
and naval PC and I'm sure there are a
website that lists all of those
compatible pcs so if you want to know if
your PC is supported take a look at that
on Google maybe so let's stop talking
and get right into the box oh and right
here it says reduce lag lower ping
prioritized gaming all right it's got
this magnetic thing here and there is
the router very beautifully presented
with this phone up here to protect it I
like that you know as I said it doesn't
have the gamer aesthetic instead it's
just very subtle very restrained it's
not it's not in-your-face which I do
very much like now let's take a look at
the i/o before continuing this unboxing
you'll see these gold contact points
around the router which is the points of
which you connect the antennas to right
here you have got some Ethernet ports
right here is where you connect your
internet coming from your wall or
whatever and you've got some USB ports
here this is USB 3.0 this port right
here is actually very interesting if the
combined USB and eSATA port which I've
actually never seen before so yes you
have got to use piece but this could
also be used as an eSATA port maybe to
connect an external hard drive and have
that act as a nice hard drive on your
network very cool stuff right here
you've got the 12 volt DC powering and
you have got your power switch and some
more contact points for the antennas now
right up here you will have some blue
lights as you can see on this box right
here that tell you what kind of features
are on if for example
Internet is connected properly if you
have got both the 2.4 and the 5
gigahertz bands connected and running
and also lastly if it realizes that you
have connected a USB or an eSATA port or
device into it this will light up as
well to indicate that the same goes with
these 4 Ethernet ports there you go very
subtle design I like that now let's put
this to the side and you are immediately
greeted with your Quick Start Guide this
being in an actually high-quality I like
that it's got color not just a boring
cheap looking one you'll see that you'll
see your wireless network ID and the
password and now I'm gonna change that
later which you can do when you're going
to the my router dot local in your web
browser and then you can set that up via
a PC or even a phone I think now right
here are the aforementioned antennas of
which you are supposed to connect to the
gold points right there if you lift this
up I do think you'll so you'll get your
power adapter yes here is your power
adapter and here is an Ethernet cable
simple stuff you got some CD / DVD
documentation I don't think there's
anything below this nope and there is
that so now let's take a look at this
router and some of its features that
stand out from the crowd the first one
being the aforementioned killer
prioritization engine or for short the
KPE engine or KP and as I said that
prioritizes gaming packets on the
network to give you a better ping
supposedly however you can also go into
your routers control panel and set the
prioritization to do the same thing as
it does on gaming to let's say YouTube
or Skype to help you with those things
as well
so that I will be testing thoroughly to
make sure that their points are actually
valid in terms of specifications it's
got four high-performance and ten
which as they say ensures optimal
coverage and maximum signal strength
even in large multi-story buildings all
right it's got a 1.8 gigahertz dual core
central processing units that being CPU
which in their words promotes
simultaneous high speed data processing
it's got the latest wireless AC
technology for simultaneously streaming
and gaming on multiple devices that
being AC of course it's got the
simultaneous dual band connections those
being 2.4 and 5 gigahertz bands which do
give is stronger a connection at a wider
range it's of course also got the normal
advanced wireless security features like
wpa2 encryption and it's also got an SPI
firewall now as per their website they
say it's built exclusively for gaming
we'll test that out it's supposed to
lower your peak ping up to 77 percent
with an asterisk we'll take a look at
that later
it's not a very modern and as they say
powerful interface for ultimate control
over Wi-Fi traffic we'll take a look at
that later as well but here are some
screenshots of it looks pretty cool it's
DFS certified it's designed to dominate
yeah these are marketing terms but we
will take a look at these later in the
review to make sure that those actually
stand up and work well in real life but
as per this page and as per their box
and as per the router itself I do think
it looks like a very solid router it
does have a very steep price tag however
of $300 which I guess is fine if you
need all these features but otherwise I
would recommend looking at something
else a bit cheaper so without any
rambling on we will do that in the
review video which comes out in a couple
of weeks instead let's end this review
if you like what you saw if you would
like me to do more unboxings let me know
by commenting down below and liking this
video subscribing if you haven't
already and I will see you guys in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
