yeah 12 year old naming aside they
really do crush your ears with all that
bass I'm serious these things have a
freaking bass slider and at the lowest
setting you're already getting a very
basic sound so what if you turn it up a
little I can literally feel the bass
which by the way is also the tagline on
the Crushers box so I guess it's good
that they're not lying about it so yeah
they're very emphasized in the low end
but what else do we know about them well
for starters they're very well built
which is in this case both good and bad
I mean they feel solid the leather is
nice and comfortable but they're very
heavy which you do notice after wearing
them for an hour - I would imagine
though that this extra weight that we're
not used to comes from this enormous ly
sized battery inside of them the box
ain't lying you can actually get 40
hours of music playback with these
Wireless - oh and I should also mention
that if you bump these into something
while wearing them be prepared to get
like death because literally just the
tiniest bump into something will sound
like a big jump is banging right besides
you on the underside of the headphones
you'll find the controls the left ear
Cup houses the aforementioned bass
slider and the other one houses the
volume up down and pass / on/off button
if you want to skip a track just click
and hold the upper button and the lower
one for the previous track it's all very
simple and intuitive but let's for a
moment get back into the sound of these
because I never mentioned anything other
than bass and that is because it's
basically the main thing that you're
gonna notice with these so if you like
bass these are awesome
but don't expect them to be very
accurate I mean like at all they're
awesome for music but don't use them in
your studio in the box you'll find your
microUSB charging cable and an aux cable
for when these things run out of battery
which they never seem to do by the way
I've used them every day for two weeks
straight and I've only charged them once
that's
in my books so that was a quick look at
the Skullcandy crushers if you're into
bass heavy music and want these for like
commuting these things rock really but
don't buy them for a studio or for like
monitoring it's just not what they're
made for
it's all about the bass the music the
hip hop the trendy music that's where
these bad boys shine so with that said
let me know what you guys think about
these in the comment section down below
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
