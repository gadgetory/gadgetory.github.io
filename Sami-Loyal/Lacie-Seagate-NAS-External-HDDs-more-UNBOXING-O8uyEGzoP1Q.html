another video and today we are going to
be unboxing another rather big package
this one comes from LaCie the hardware
company / Seagate Technology so that
should be hard drives so let's get right
into the box and see what the fuss is
all about
nice so I got a lacy kind of like a bag
I guess thank you there's a lot of stuff
in here okay this first is an SSD plus
HDD hard drive for the PlayStation so
you can do this for a success here a
high performance upgrade for either ps3
or ps4 I believe in here we have got a a
or terabyte Porsche Design mobile drive
that uses USB 3.0 and USB C can't wait
to take a look at this either awesome
we have that big boy this is the Porsche
Design Desktop drive 4 terabytes of USB
C / USB 3.0 S which can't wait to take a
look at this either and then for the
final unit I believe yes we have got
ourselves a Seagate personal cloud 5
terabyte mass storage you know cloud
kind of drive okay so let's unbox all of
these things and and take a brief look
at what these things have to offer let's
begin with the Seagate personal cloud
because this is the biggest package of a
the coolest in my opinion there you go
and here we have got most likely our
accessories cables and all that this is
a UK adapter
this is the power brick cable yep this
power awesome and here is come on come
on
here is an Ethernet cable that you would
use to connect it to your home internet
or Ethernet
okay and here is the actual drive itself
actually smaller than I thought then I
would have thought I like this a lot
actually I've been actually I have been
looking for a nice guy for quite some
time now and I can't wait to take a look
at this one
oh it's awesome
on the back here we have got power
button a power in Ethernet jack USB 2.0
jack here USB 3.0 so you can use that to
connect more hard drives
I suppose external hard drives you
should be able to get this thing open
somehow not too sure how you do that but
of course we will be taking a look at
that in the final review of this bad boy
so let's put this to the side I'll clean
everything up and we will move on with
the with the next package all right so
the next thing is the porsche design
desktop drive this is just an external
drive four terabytes of it which should
just connect to your PC / laptop and Mac
whatever you use and you get four more
terabytes of storage for your
things basically awesome so USBC power
and you can actually use it with your
your laptop and at the same time charge
your laptop via the USB type-c cable
that some laptops used for example the
MacBook just the MacBook right so that's
awesome use PC for next gen computers I
like that a lot actually that they
included USB type-c this is not Seagate
it's Lacey not seeing it but Lacey here
is the drive oh I love I just have to
appreciate the build quality this is
made album out of metal it weighs quite
a bit and it is cold to the touch I like
that a lot
alright so this would be sitting at your
desk something like this and at the back
you connect wait now on the side here
you connect your USB type-c cable and
power cable then of course if you don't
have a USB type-c capable device I do
believe they provide you with an with an
adapter for it and here is the quick
install guide and probably all the stuff
you need with this product made for
ideas I like that because I'm gonna use
these for my videos obviously a lot of
things in here so a power adapter for UK
a power adapter for EU the actual power
brick and two USB cables one which is
USB type-c to the Norton to the normal
sized USB 3.0 and a USB type-c
to USB type-c for USB type-c products
alright so next up is the USB type-c or
USB 3.0 mobile drive this is supposed to
be the exact same Drive that that we had
we unbox before the same size even but a
smaller form factor so I like this one a
lot I'm going to use this one a lot I
think for traveling and recording video
with laptops and cameras and all that
jazz it has a nice size as well and then
and then in the final review and of
course going to test out the performance
of those said drives to see if the if
they can be used for things like video
editing so yeah this one is so awesome
it has pretty sharp edges and I cannot
really say more it's the same type of
design just smaller very nice design
actually up here is your USB type-c port
down here is your USB type-c to see and
your USB type-c to a type 3.0 cable this
is a PlayStation game drive for
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 and you
would basically buy this to have a
bigger hard drive and a hard job that
based on sshd which means that it's it
has a combination of both a solid-state
storage and hard drive storage for
faster booting times I would suppose and
that of course will also get its own
video
this shouldn't be all of that
interesting actually now it's just a
hard drive a 2.5 inch hard drive and the
video about this will come up as soon as
I get the time to make it
about X let's line these things up and
show you what we got today so that is
the video leave a thumbs up if you
enjoyed the video subscribe if you would
like to see more like it and I'll see
you guys in the next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
