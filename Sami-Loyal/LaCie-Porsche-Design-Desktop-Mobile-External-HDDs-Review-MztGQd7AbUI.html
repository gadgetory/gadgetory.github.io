with another video and today we are
going to be taking a look at another
hard drive solution this time not a Nass
system instead it's a normal external
hard drive from LaCie designed by the
porsche design team so right here we
have both the desktop version and the
mobile one which is basically the same
as the desktop hard drive just in a
smaller more portable form factor so
when taking a look at the hard drive
specifications you can see that it uses
the new USB type-c interface this goes
for both the desktop and the mobile hard
drive in fact everything that I'll talk
about in this video goes for both the
desktop and mobile hard drive the only
difference between the two is that the
desktop version has to get external
power from the wall and this is because
it can actually charge a connected
laptop if you use it with one whereas
the mobile one cannot charge a laptop
and instead takes the power from the
computer so in the Box you get both a
USB type-c to type C cable for
connecting devices like the new macbook
or the new macbook pro but there's also
a USB C to full size USB cable in the
box for everything else the design of
the drive looks really good if I did not
know the brand
I could easily have guessed that it's
made by like Apple so I can definitely
see it fitting in nicely in a really
well done productivity setup with that
said let's take a look at the speed so
the transfer speed was about 150
megabytes per second and that goes for
both to and from the drive with that
said let's take a look at the pros and
cons pros great build quality and a sign
the hard drive is quiet it uses the new
USB type-c interface transfer speed is
great and if used with a USB type-c
laptop the desktop version of the hard
drive can both transfer data and charge
the laptop connected to it cons there
have been reports of bad USB type-c
cables from macbook owners in which case
replacing the cable solved the problem
so to come
this video who is this hard rifle I'd
say mainly Mac users or people who have
a laptop that uses the type C interface
because it will serve both as a fast and
good-looking hard drive but also the
charger for your notebook thanks for
watching make sure to LIKE this video if
it was to any help subscribe if you
would like to see more like it
and I'll see you guys in the next video
