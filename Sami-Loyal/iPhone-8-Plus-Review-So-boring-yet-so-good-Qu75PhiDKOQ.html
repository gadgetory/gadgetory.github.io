not read the title of this video or hear
me say it
you would have probably mistaken this
phone for just another 6 6s or 7 plus
and I'm not blaming you it's not until
you turn the phone around that you
notice that it's indeed the latest and
greatest from Apple that is for another
month until the axe comes out so it's a
flagship phone released a month before
an undeniably better phone from the same
company comes out but that's not to say
the H+ is a bad phone it's actually a
really great phone just one that is
shadowed by its Bessel s brother so I'm
going to throughout this video try not
to compare the 8 with the X and just
review the phone as it is if you would
like a full comparison with the X though
I would be more than happy to give you
guys that video when I got the X in hand
but as previously mentioned this video
is just a review of the 8 and nothing
else let's get into it so let's get the
boring things done starting with the
design and I'm surprised to hear myself
say that the boring part of a phone in
my review is the design of an apple
product I mean this design was fantastic
when it came out almost 4 years ago but
it's definitely starting to show its age
now that most flagship phones on the
competing side have these staggering
AMOLED basileus displays full glass
design with the color switching in
different lighting and all that so yeah
it's it's safe to say that Apple has
lost its wow factor with these phones
there's no denying that it's a very
well-built phone though I took a look at
jerry-rigged everything's durability
test of the iPhone 8 because well I
didn't want to risk breaking my own
phone so thanks to jerry-rig everything
for taking that risk for us but anyway
the results are great the glass front
and back will not scratch by keys or
coins its structural integrity is on
point and overall it just seems to be a
well thought out phone like as usual
with Apple taking another look at the
back of it you'll see the shiny glass
panel instead of the aluminum that were
used to with Apple this change
definitely has its ups and downs a down
being the fact that it's more easily
breakable
/ - aluminum and the apps being it's
less slippery making it easier to hold
and manage and also that glass allows
wireless charging which is a completely
new thing to Apple devices now I can
imagine you Android fanboys out there
with your custom roms proudly screaming
we've had that for years and that is
true Android nowadays get all the new
features before iPhones so so the
innovation is really on those guys and
not Apple however when Apple decides to
finally implement a feature like this it
helps everyone not only Apple customers
you're gonna see a lot of Meucci
wireless charging stations in coffee
shops restaurants and more and that's
thanks to Apple choosing the main
standard Qi over some proprietary
standard so big props to Apple for doing
that
in terms of charging speed it's going to
be quite a bit slower than connecting a
cable because it's limited to five watts
the s8 and note 8 from Samsung for
example will work up to 15 watts which
is a lot faster but nonetheless is great
to finally see wireless charging on an
Apple device water resistance is also a
feature on the 8 + and the 8 of course
it's not been improved on so it's still
this somewhat useless ip67 rating
however that still means your phone is
not gonna break if you drop it in the
toilet or in the pool the fingerprint
scanner is probably making its final run
with the iPhone 8 and it's great no
remarks here it's the best in the
business we've got the same speaker
setup as on the 7 which was already
pretty good but I noticed it sounds a
fair bit more bassy and punchy so
there's definitely been some kind of
improvement here that's great many new
phones nowadays have stopped caring
about sound quality so it's great to see
Apple still improving their phone
speakers I also want to mention that the
iPhone is a bit heavier now thanks to
the glass back and it's not only on
paper you will notice it and in my
opinion that's great it makes the phone
feel more premium and solid there's not
a whole lot other than that to talk
about when it comes to the design though
so let's take a look at the display
which is also mostly untouched it's
still that 16 by 9 1080
P IPS display that we've had since is
sex just with some minor improvements
the brightness is up
we got a wider color gamut and now with
the eight we got true tone which changes
the white balance of the screen based on
the lighting around you and if you think
that sounds gimmicky I'm with you I mean
there is a small change but I still
don't know what it's for display quality
is good however next to an AMOLED
display even one with the same
resolution like the one plus five it
doesn't look all that stunning and with
a big chin and forehead bezels it looks
even more out of place in 2017 now let's
talk specs and this is where the big
changes this year Apple released the
all-new a11 Bionic SOC which is a big
improvement even over the a-10 from the
7 and 7 plus it's now got six cores two
of them being 25% faster and four of
them being extremely high efficient ones
that are a staggering 70% faster this
increasing power is to handle the
all-new AR features which do take a big
toll on the CPU everything else on the
iPhone is also butter smooth
there's no hiccups anywhere I know some
people have experienced framedrops and I
did too but it's completely stopped now
after the 11.0 to update so yeah don't
worry about performance with the 8 it'll
handle everything you throw at it
Ram wise the 8 has 2 gigs and the 8 plus
has three this means that apps are going
to be saved for a longer times so you
can jump back to them quicker on the 8
plus compared to the smaller 8 charging
is still done via the Lightning jack and
that's not necessarily bad it's just
boring everyone's moving over to USB
type-c and apples just sitting there
with their proprietary Jack to earn more
revenue on accessories they very nice
enough to use a widely adopted standard
with wireless charging though so we
might see Apple changing to USB type-c
with the next iPhone I sure hope so at
least
speaking of charging the battery life is
great at least on the plus model in
terms of the 8
terms of the 8 I did some research and
found out it's not all that great
so if battery life is a big concern with
you get the plus you'll thank me later
I got about seven hours of usage and
nine hours of standby on the eight plus
on a single day with about 15% left at
around 11 p.m. and that includes
personal hotspot sharing my cellular for
about 45 minutes lots of social media
mailing and YouTube video watching the
iPhone also has fast charging now though
you'll have to cough up $75 on the 29
watt USB type-c adapter and lightning
cable once you've got that though it's
lightning quick in my testing it charged
from about 10% to 60 in just 25 minutes
which is on par with quick charging on
the Android side however the fact that
you need to spend extra to get it it's
just absurd now finally let's talk
camera so in a nutshell I'm actually
surprised to see this kind of
improvement over the 7 it's really good
low light has been improved a bunch
autofocus is extremely fast and the
portrait mode has been greatly improved
as well
it can also shoot 4k 60fps video now
thanks to the upgrade in processing
power if you're after a phone with a
phenomenal camera the iPhone 8 plus
should make your shortlist and here are
some photos and video samples to back
that up
so the iPhone 8 doesn't look all that
new but most everything on the inside is
improved and it shows in everyday use
wireless charging is great to finally
have and use on an iPhone the phone's
quick the battery lasts an entire day
with some juice left to spare the camera
is fantastic and overall it's one of the
best phones released in 2017 without a
doubt the question is however should you
spend all that money on the 8 plus or
wait a month and get the X and that's up
to you guys so let me know what you
think in the comment section down below
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
