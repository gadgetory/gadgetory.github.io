another video and today I would like to
show you the process that I go through
every time that I create a review of a
product now if you are new to this
review thing you might not know exactly
what it's about so let me try to explain
it for you a review on YouTube is a
video showing a price features
specifications performance and also
giving information regarding the
stability and quality of the product in
question and in the end the review
usually forms and shares an opinion of
the product alright so let me show you
my specific process that I go through
when I review products now the first
thing is actually getting my hands on
the product that I'm interested in
reviewing when it comes to a brand I've
never reviewed for in the past I'll go
to their website and find a press or me
a contact to get in touch with my
channel is still very small so I'm lucky
if even a half big brand responds to me
but if you happen to have 100,000 subs
or more it should not be that hard
getting to review what it is you want to
review if I had an ongoing relationship
with the company I just contact them
asking for the next product for review
an example of a company that I regularly
make reviews for is Dell now most of the
things I get to review are actually
loaner units which means that I get to
use the product for a couple of weeks to
evaluate it and then send it back to the
company for this video I'm going to be
using my 2015 15 inch MacBook Pro as the
review product sample okay great so now
I have their product what's next well
the actual testing of the product and
when it comes to everyday used products
like phones and laptops and stuff like
that I generally just start using the
product instead of the one I already
have if the product in question has any
special features like for example the LG
g5 with its module design I test those
features immediately and try to form an
opinion or
around them I then try to use the
products i review in a way that someone
who bought it for themselves would so
let's test this laptop and try to form
an opinion around it and whether is
worth its price hi so first I will take
notes of all the general stuff like the
keyboard the screen the bill equality
and the overall performance and stuff
like that and to do that I basically
just used a laptop like any other person
would and this testing process usually
takes about five days or so when it
comes to laptops and phones and once I
feel comfortable enough with my
knowledge about the product I will move
on with benchmarking and that could be
things like gaming and video editing in
the mean time of actually testing the
product I take notes on what I think of
certain things and features in the
product or in this case the laptop and
once I feel like I know everything that
there is to know about that said product
I will start writing the video script
and basically I take all the notes plus
stuff from my head and pile it together
in a somewhat organized script like this
one and when the script is done I will
start with recording the voiceover for
the script I use a free program called
audacity is great so once I have the
voice recording done I will send it to
my phone which I will use to listen to
it while I record the b-roll of the
product I listen to every sentence and
think like okay now the shot should look
like this and it should be this part of
the product that gets shown in this
specific time of the voice-over and
video and once I feel like a hat all the
video footage I need I'll bring it into
Final Cut Pro 10 and put it all together
with some nice background music and the
thing that I love the most about Final
Cut Pro is the smoothness of the video
editing it renders everything in the
background so playback is almost always
super smooth and the software has
everything I need and when it comes to
rendering the video I render in the H
dot 264 codec because it takes the lead
space and when the render is done I just
upload it to YouTube with a relevant
title I also add my Amazon affiliate
links for that product in the video
description I then add some tags and
upload my stamina
and now the review is done and uploaded
to YouTube and now it's time to repack
the product and send it back to the
company and that's it thank you so much
for watching I hope I gave you some
insightful information if I did please
click that like button and subscribe and
I'll see you guys in my next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
