most of you out there immediately think
of the well-known and very popular iMac
but there are actually windows-based AIO
pcs out there now you may think yeah I
knew that but they're all just boring
business computers right well this is
where you are wrong and also where the
Dell XPS 27 comes in
it's a windows-based AIO computer with a
quad-core skylake i7 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 ram and discrete Radeon m4 85 X
graphics all this hardware is housed
inside of a gorgeous all aluminum
chassis with a dark finish and on the
front you'll find a 27 inch 4k IPS touch
display this thing is seriously
beautiful it's incredibly vibrant and
gets fairly bright in terms of color
accuracy it's got a fantastic srgb score
of one eighty seven percent compared to
the 5k IMAX one thirty percent in other
tests however it's not that accurate and
could use some calibration if you plan
on making it your professional photo and
video editing machine now as I said
before it's a touch display and actually
a rather good one I am not entirely sure
however how that would be useful in a
computer like this I am sure though that
someone else knows exactly what to do
with a touch computer this stand can
make the computer go almost completely
flat which I guess is good for maybe
graphics design and join so in front of
the display is a sheet of glossy glass
which gets bombarded in fingerprints as
soon as you use to touch functionality
so just below the awesome display you'll
find a rather unusual set of speakers on
most a iOS the speakers are not even
visible but here you've got six in the
front and four below making the Dell XPS
27 the loudest AIO I've ever heard
clarity and detail wise these sound
fantastic but they don't have that much
bass at all in between the front
speakers there is a webcam and a Windows
hello iris scanner the webcam is of
mediocre quality and it's placement
doesn't help in any way the iris scanner
however did not even work on our review
units it's not recognized by Windows for
some reason but I've done some research
though and according to most sources the
iris scanner works great with Windows
hello and is supposed to be very fast so
on the sides there is a very welcomed
USB type a port an SD card reader and a
headphone jack the back port situation
however is in terms of just sheer ports
great it's got two USB type-c
Thunderbolt three ports four USB type a
port an Ethernet jack HDMI out and
DisplayPort out it's pretty sad however
that the DisplayPort and HDMI out ports
are just out there is no way to use just
the monitor itself and not a computer
this makes the PC not very future proof
at all in terms of accessing the ports
though it's a struggle as they are all
hidden behind the thick aluminum stand
in the box you get a Bluetooth keyboard
and mouse the mouse feels very cheap and
just doesn't work for me the keyboard
however is really good it feels
unlike the mouse premium the clicks are
good with just enough resistance and
clicking as from a non mechanical
keyboard the layout is also great it's
got the full numpad and dedicated media
control keys a really good job on this
down performance-wise
the XPS 27 got a Cinebench CPU score of
813 and an OpenGL GPU score of 106 fps
keep in mind though that our review unit
is running the last gen M 385 GPU so you
can expect all GPU related scores in
this video to be better with a new GPU
speaking of GPUs can it game yes it
actually can while definitely not as 4k
the XPS 27 can pull out some pretty good
and playable SPSS in easy to run games
it flows through photo editing with ease
it can also actually do some 4k video
editing as long as you don't have the
preview window at the native 4k
resolution I rendered a three minutes
long 4k video in Stony Vegas in 19
minutes compared to the nine minutes and
38 seconds on my 8 core AMD rice and CPU
so with all this rendering and playing
games the CPU and GPU put out a lot of
heat that have to be cooled the cooling
system does a good job of cooling the
components so that they don't throttle
while at the same time being very quiet
I appreciate that
the XPS 27 is available in various
different configurations they all start
at 1449 u.s. dollars that gives you a 4k
non-touch display with an i5 CPU a piece
of RAM and a one terabyte hard drive
there are other configurations like the
ultra high-end $2700 one however I think
the best one to buy would be the two
thousand dollar ones it bumps up the CPU
to an i7 it also doubles the RAM and
hard drive capacities so as a conclusion
the Dell XPS 27 is a great all-in-one
computer with a punchy speaker system
its 4k screen is one of the best i've
ever seen and the performance is good
enough for most people so what do you
guys think of the Dell XPS 27 let me
know by liking or disliking this video
if you have any questions make sure to
leave them in the comments down below
and I'll see you guys in the next one
