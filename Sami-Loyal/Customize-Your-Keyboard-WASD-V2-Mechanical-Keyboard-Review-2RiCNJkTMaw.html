mechanical keyboard or well one of their
configurations because you can actually
customize just about everything in this
keyboard so let's get into more detail
and show you what it is that you can
customize exactly so this is the webpage
the first choice is what type of Cherry
MX mechanical switches it is that you
want there are many options including
blue brown black red green clear and
silent red now if you would like to hear
the difference between all of these
awesome switches click that I in the top
right corner of this video the next
option is to install sound dampeners
which I did not choose to do and next up
is text color it's pretty
self-explanatory now this is the good
part
this is where you can choose the keycap
color of every individual key cap so
once you're done with all of the dots
you can choose if you want the american
ANS eye or the international ISO layout
so here is what I chose Cherry MX blue
switches all white key caps except the
escape and OS keys on those I chose
black with my own custom printed logo in
white here it's awesome and in the box
you get the micro USB cable a USB 2 PS 2
adapter if you happen to be a fan of
that and also a key cap removal tool the
first thing that I like about this
keyboard is that the USB cable is not
permanently attached which means that if
the cable breaks you do not have to
replace the entire keyboard I also love
that there are cable routing tunnels
under the keyboard which makes it great
for cable management the keyboard itself
is made out of plastic but it's a very
high quality and feels extremely sturdy
so do not worry about that below the
keyboard there's a bunch of rubber pads
so that the keyboard does not slide
around it's not going anywhere and
another thing that is below this
keyboard are these switches that you can
use to switch between different output
modes such as a Dvorak and Cole Mac this
feature is made for the more
customer though so if you actually know
what Dvorak and cool mark is you
probably don't need an explanation from
me
so the actual keyboard it's great just
like any other cherry MX blue keyboard
it has that tactile bump and that
obnoxiously loud click that so many
people like and the keyboard layout is
as it should be and there and fYI there
are media control buttons as well and I
think that pretty much sums it up I
can't talk about specifics because it
will be different for each and every
person but I am going to be making a
video soon that will show you the
differences in sound and click of the
different switches so let's do a quick
pros and cons and then conclude this
review pros the keyboard has a very
sturdy build it has a clean look it's
fully customizable and the cable is
removable
alright cons it's quite expensive and
there are no dedicated media keys so as
a conclusion the WASD B 2 keyboard is a
great keyboard that I'm happy to
recommend to anyone its customization
means that it can be used with any type
of operating system and person so that's
it thanks for watching make sure to LIKE
