the markets the all-new Xbox 1x and the
somewhat older P is for a pro in this
video we're going to be comparing them
to each other to try to determine which
console is the best and we're going to
do that by comparing them in different
segments and those are as follows
hardware performance controllers
exclusives non-gaming features and
lastly value so let's not waste any time
and get right into the hardware both
consoles are made out of matte plastic
which is boring to begin with but with
the layered design and cool LED light
bar the ps4 pro looks more distinctive
whereas on the other side of the
competition you've just got a black box
and that's it however the Xbox one X is
smaller than the ps4 pro in every
dimension making it easier to fit the
console into tighter spaces in terms of
the port selection the two consoles are
very similar the Xbox one X has an extra
HDMI in Porto which gives it the edge in
this comparison that port lets you
connect your TV box to the Xbox so you
can watch TV on the Xbox without needing
to switch sources on the TV screen
itself taking a look at the specs the
Xbox one acts with its six teraflops GPU
over the 4.2 on the ps4 Pro is the clear
winner it's got 12 gigs of gddr5 video
ram over the ps4 s-- 8 gigs it's 8 core
AMD Jaguar CPU is also clocked higher
with 2.3 gigahertz over the ps4 pro's
1.6 both have one terabyte spinning hard
drive so they are equal here but I
honestly feel like they should have
included a 2 terabyte hard drive instead
because games are huge and with one
terabyte of storage you'll only be able
to fit around 25 games on there
performance wise the Xbox one X is able
to push 4k games at 30 or 60 FPS
natively while the ps4 pro uses fancy
algorithms where the console renders a
game at a lower resolution like quad HD
and then upscale set to 4k so yes if you
look very closely the Xbox one access
performance is better in games but to my
eyes it's hardly noticeable for some
reason the ps4 Pro is the clear winner
in performance outside gaming it's just
a whole lot smoother than the Xbox 1x
when browsing the UI and apps in the
controller department the ps4 pro's
controller wins here as well it has an
updated DualShock 4 with the light bar
now shining through the top of the
controller as well and the Xbox has the
same Xbox one controller as on the
original one and 1's now the controllers
are a very subjective thing but I'd say
as a conclusion the Xbox s controller
has a better feel in the hand but the
ps4 pro's controller is better built and
wins the battery department because it's
rechargeable and that's why the ps4 pro
wins this controller segment of this
comparison I'd also have to say that the
ps4 Pro comes out on top in the
exclusive games department it's got
games like horizon zero dawn VR games
uncharted infamous Gran Turismo and more
and all those are great games the Xbox
one has halo 40 and Gears of War which
are pretty good games but they're not as
good as the exclusives found on the ps4
pro but that's just my opinion though in
terms of non gaming features the two
consoles are very similar you can
download apps like Spotify and Netflix
on both of them you can also browse the
web rent or buy movies etc but
unexpectedly the Xbox one X has better
blu-ray support as it can play 4k HDR
blu-rays while the ps4 pro cannot so
value the Xbox one X is $500 and the ps4
pro is 400 so it's the Xbox one actually
really worth $100 more or should you
just get the ps4 a pro now that's the
hard question and it all depends on you
personally you've got to ask yourself
which controller you prefer which
operating system you prefer which
console most of your friends play on and
probably most importantly which platform
has the best exclusives in your opinion
when you know the answers to those
questions you know which consult
so with that said thanks for watching
