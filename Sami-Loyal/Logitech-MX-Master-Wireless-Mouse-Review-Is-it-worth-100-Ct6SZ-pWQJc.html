today we are taking a look at the
Logitech MX master the MX master from
Logitech is seen as the youtubers mouse
it's supposed to have great features for
video and photo editing great comfort
aim great battery life but is it really
that good I think that the MX master is
really just overrated so if you want to
find out why just follow along and I'll
tell you exactly why
the MX master features a curvy and sleek
design with black and gold colors and i
gotta say the mouse looks really good
and is very very comfortable to use but
it does actually feel pretty plasticky
and that's definitely not something that
you would like to see in a 100-dollar
mouse so if you did not already know the
Logitech MX master is a wireless mouse
which uses either Bluetooth technology
or its unifying receiver which uses a
USB port on your computer laptop etc and
it works great it really does work great
it connects very very fast and very very
easily if you use the unifying receiver
all you have to do is connect it to the
to your source and then click the
connect button on the bottom of your
mouse and you will be connected to the
unifying receiver it's really as simple
as that and the same thing goes for
Bluetooth but with Bluetooth you get
even more functionality if you're using
Bluetooth you can actually connect three
different devices to the MX master and
all you have to do is connect them to
the mouse very simple and then if you
want to switch between these devices all
you gotta do is press the lower button
and it will switch between these devices
very simple and very awesome the MX
master also features a smart shifting
scroll wheel and you can change the
sensitivity on it in the settings on
your connected device so what happened
is you just have to scroll a little bit
harder and the scroll wheel will lock
out of place and scroll super fast and
super smooth for a long time and that is
great for long webpages strolling
through shots and like a deal but this
is where their problems start for me
because the scroll wheel is able to log
out of place it can actually fail
sometimes and I think that that is the
case with my mouse so what happened is
my scrolling wheel is now super loose at
all times there's no click you feel to
it at all it's basically
smooth at all times and it really just
doesn't work rate at all and sometimes
you can bump into it and it would just
ruin your whole experience it's just a
huge problem right now because i use my
scroll wheel a log and i'm sure that you
guys do that as well so i can't
understand why logitech put such a bad
quality scroll wheel on here because if
they did not this would actually be a
great mouse and don't get me wrong it's
a great mouse but it's just that god
damn scroll wheel that just doesn't work
I will not use this mouse as my daily
driver even if I paid 100 bucks for it
it's a shame it really is but let's
continue with the review the battery
life is completely amazing for a mouse
of these capabilities it goes for about
40 days straight up no gimmicks at all
40 days best battery life I have ever
seen in such a feature-packed mouse if
the application is also pretty good you
can change a lot of settings in it
change the sensitivity you can add
different features two different buttons
and it works great like a charm nothing
to complain here the MX master also has
a second scroll wheel that actually
works phenomenal the scroll wheel sits
perfectly besides your thumb and it
works great you can assign different
tasks to it so at default it's set to
scroll sideways but I have it changed so
it changes the volume very quick and
easy nice handy-dandy feature to have so
good job very nice addition to the
Logitech MX master and there's really
not that much more to talk about of
course it's a mouse there's no
specifications there's no screens IPS
displays and all that jazz it's a mouse
and a rather good one but it doesn't cut
it for me because of this scroll wheel
issue that just makes it unusable for me
but if you believe that it's just me
being very harsh on the mouse and I
guess go for it it's a great mouse it
really
and I'm sure that it will serve you
great for a couple of years and that is
it for the video thank you guys so much
