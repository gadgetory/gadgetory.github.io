with another video in three weeks now I
know that is very bad and I'm sorry
about that and I'm also sorry about this
ghetto garage wall thingy I'm going to
put up a this sound isolating foam here
to make this set look a lot better but
this is what we have got now I just
wanted to make a quick video unboxing
something very interesting from
Microsoft that they sent out just today
and you guessed it it's the Microsoft
Xbox one so without any further ado
let's just get into the box and take a
look at the Xbox one X
on the box it says 4k blu-ray 4k Ultra
HD and HDR very nice 4k 4k 4k everything
is just 4k that's the main selling point
which I do understand this is not not a
generational bump it's just a like a
small bump even though this is the the
most powerful console ever built the the
game pass which is interesting now I can
test out some cool games we also got
ourselves some Xbox Live Gold 14 days
free Xbox Live Gold interesting Thank
You Microsoft for that I'll put that to
the side and in here is of course the
Xbox one so let's put this right here
and left in the box we got ourselves
this so let's put that out and then put
the box to the side so here we go
this is I think yeah the cables the wall
cable and then this one probably the
adapter now the controller of course the
controller was a long time since I
unboxed or even played on a console so
this is all so this is all very
interesting to me HDMI cable great and
then the usual books and stuff like that
I forgot the the power supply is
actually integrated in the box so so
yeah it takes up less space that's
awesome so here's the controller it's
probably just the usual Xbox controller
oops
those were the batteries I i forgot
these things have batteries i hope
they're rechargeable i think they are
just a usual normal Xbox 1x controller
or it the same even with the Xbox one
and the S it's not the elite anything
like that so let's put all this to the
side and get into the meat and potatoes
which is the console itself
I've never ever held a heavier console
than this it's not a very interesting
designed console it's just a normal
black plastic box but there's nothing
too spectacular about this design it's
all on the inside the components which
are able to run games at native 4k which
is really interesting and I'm going to
be testing that out and bringing you
guys my full review of this new console
from Microsoft Xbox 1x so yeah we got
another package let's take a look at
that as well this is another chrome
package so I don't know why they shipped
everything in chrome but whatever
something new to me at least
so in here
there we go and here we have got Oh a
movie okay
planet earth - narrated by David
Attenborough this is a 4k Ultra HD HD R
movie so I'm definitely going to be or
am excited to check this out to see what
the quality is like on my 4k TV so yeah
awesome okay
Xbox game Pass Live Gold mixer I don't
know what mixer is actually to be honest
with you am I supposed to know that
Netflix that's awesome and then EA
access I don't know what EA access is
and Spotify very nice stuff so thank you
Microsoft for those then here we have
got ourselves I'm gonna have to blur
this out as well but this is Assassin's
Creed origin we got shadow of war and we
got Forza Motorsport 7 awesome so if I'm
not 100% mistaken these things you don't
get when you actually buy the console
these are just for me they're reviewers
so I have some games to check out and so
that I don't have to spend any money
while reviewing Microsoft's products and
then this is I don't know this might be
a manual no it's this is actually the
Swedish reviewers guide for the Xbox one
X so if you haven't seen a reviewers
guide before it's basically just a
booklet with a bunch of information that
will be good to know for the reviewer so
right here for example it says power the
Xbox one is 40% more powerful than any
other console it basically just shows
you a bunch of information that will be
good to know when you do the final
review of the Xbox one X so this does
not come with your Xbox one X so before
ending this this unboxing video we will
just take a closer look at the box
itself so at the front you've got
yourself a USB port power power button
basically some exhaust or intake vents
hello from Seattle Xbox one x hello to
you from Seattle okay here is your power
in the DC power in here is HDMI out for
the TV HDMI IN from a satellite or cable
box and you got two USB ports the IR out
and you got some optical in and the
Ethernet and then some Excel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
