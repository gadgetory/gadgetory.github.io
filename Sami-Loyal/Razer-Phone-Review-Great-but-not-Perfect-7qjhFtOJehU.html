first real entrance into the mobile
market they're famous for their high
quality PC accessories and lately also
their gaming laptops which are
considered the MacBooks of Windows in
terms of build quality that is they have
been offering headsets and other mobile
accessories before but it's about time
that they made a full on phone so here
we are with the razor phone now I'm
gonna go straight into the meat and
potatoes of the phone it's beastly
specifications it's got a Snapdragon a
35 SOC giving you the best performance
an Android phone can have at the moment
it's paired to a whopping 8 gigs of ram
which makes multitasking extremely fast
especially also because it's rocking
near stock Android the battery is of a
humungous size four thousand milliamp
hours which while it gives a phenomenal
battery life of around 4 to 6 hours of
screen on time also gives the razor
phone it's chunky and thick design which
some people might not be too happy about
the display is a 5.7 inch er with the
usual quad HD resolution it's not all
wet and that's actually fine this time
around because the display has actually
got a very nice trick up its sleeve to
make up for it a refresh rate of a
hundred and twenty Hertz
now you gamers out there know exactly
what this means but for you guys who
don't well a refresh rate is basically
how many times per second the display
updates with new information from the
graphics processor now practically every
phone's display nowadays are just 60
Hertz so the eraser phone's got double
the refresh rate and it's awesome I mean
everything from your usual scrolling and
browsing to playing games looks
incredibly smooth on this display and
going back to a normal 60 Hertz display
it's quite hard and might take some time
I gotta say the panel also looks very
good in terms of colors and sharpness so
the IPS display on the racer phone is
definitely a big pro now as I said the
racer phone is quite chunky it's got a
very boxy and industrial aluminum design
so it wastes quite a lot and because the
screen is a 5.7 ensure it's quite large
- but after a couple of days of use that
weight and boxy design will probably not
bother you but for you out there with
small hands the size might so keep that
in mind
what might bother you more though is the
rather thick chin and forehead on the
front of the phone and I agree to some
extent as it doesn't look very modern at
all but it's it's not wasted space racer
has implemented what might very well be
the best speaker system in any phone
right now period it gets very loud has
substantial bass and compared to the
iPhone 8 and X which are number two on
that list in my personal opinion it
sounds a lot better but don't get me
wrong it's by no means going to replace
your stereo or even your portable
speaker but it's the best in the
business
if you're wondering where the
fingerprint sensor is it's not on the
back instead it's been put into the
left-side power button it's fast and
I've never had any problems with it on
the right side you'll find the volume
buttons now I watched mkbhd s review of
this phone the other day and I reacted
to this statement that he thought the
buttons were mushy and just not tactile
and I couldn't disagree more the buttons
are in fact in my opinion very tactile
and feel great so I'm thinking he might
have had a bad unit now on the bottom
you'll find a typical USB type-c port
with fast charging what you won't find
though is a headphone jack and that
feels quite weird because this phone is
indeed an entertainment and gaming phone
at heart so in my opinion it should have
had it it's definitely not that big a
deal but it just gets a bit annoying
sometimes especially if you lose track
of where you put the adapter now
software wise there's not a whole lot to
talk about which is good the phone's
featuring stock Android with Nova
Launcher prime installed out of the
factory it's simple its Android it's got
none of those cheeky and weird features
it's just clean I like that but that's
not to say this software is issue free
because it isn't for example when
watching Netflix which the phone's
display
HTR support for by the way it sometimes
crashes and I don't mean the app the
entire phone crashes and has to restart
this practically happens 50% of the time
and it's super annoying so they gotta
fix that now another thing I don't like
about this phone is sadly the camera it
and I'm dropping the bomb here sucks it
literally looks as bad as an old iPhone
6 and I'm not kidding and actually the
experience of taking pictures and video
with it is even worse it doesn't focus
properly and when it does it takes like
five seconds the app is slow and
sometimes it just outright crashes so
racers definitely got a lot of work to
do in the camera department because this
just doesn't cut it in 2018 I also have
to mention the really really bad
vibration motor it sounds like it's
loose or kind of like broken and I was
hoping that this was just my phone
affected but it seems as though every
phone's motor is this weird so as a
conclusion the racer phone is fast has a
great battery life an awesome smooth
display great build quality and software
near stock Android but there are quite a
lot of software fixes to be done both in
terms of just the Netflix things and
those kinds of bugs and also the camera
department the phone also might be too
big for some people and as I said the
camera is not cutting it in 2018 so with
that said let me know what you guys
think of the eraser phone in the comment
