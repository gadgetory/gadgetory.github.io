the past but there is one that I keep
coming back to the XPS 15 for me it's
almost the perfect laptop so what's
lacking why is it not my perfect laptop
well well because I want Final Cut Pro
which is only on Mac now that is one
hell of a good con for a laptop to have
with that said let's get into the review
now this is one good-looking laptop
I love the industrial minimalistic
design approach that Dell weren't for in
this laptop and pair that with the
incredible 4k infinity edge touch
display with practically no vessels and
you have got yourself a stunning laptop
now there are several good things about
having a small vessel first off is the
obvious one it looks good but also
form-factor lowering the bezel size will
allow you to create an overall smaller
laptop without sacrificing on the actual
screen size compared to the Inspiron 15
which is also a 15-inch laptop the XPS
15 is a lot smaller in every way it's
lighter - the XPS 15 has done extremely
sturdy build with a carbon fiber chassis
and silver aluminum panels on the top
and bottom of the device
the carbon fiber part of the laptop gets
a lot of smudges and stuff like that on
it which makes it look kind of cheap but
as long as you have a microfiber cloth
ready that will not be an issue in terms
of portability the XPS 15 is definitely
not as portable as its smaller brother
the XPS 13 but at the same time I think
the extra power is worth it it weighs
just under 4 pounds and has the
footprint of a fan has the footprint of
a 14 inch or larger 13 inch laptop the
XPS 15 starts at $9.99 u.s. dollars and
that gets you an i3 6100 h8 gigabytes of
RAM a 500 gig hard drive paired with a
32 gig SSD partition and the screen is a
full
non-touch display if your budget is
around the 1k USD mark you should not
buy this laptop I would look at the
inspire 115 instead which for the same
money gets you an i7 16 gigs of ram and
an SSD which is a much better deal it
may not be as pretty as the XPS but it
has much better specs for the price if I
would buy this laptop I would get
something along the lines of the one
that I have here which has the quad core
i7 6700 HQ 16 gigabytes of RAM 512 gigs
of SSD a 4k touch infinity edge touch
display and powering that display is a
gtx 960m graphics card if you do want to
save some money though you can opt for a
full HD display instead of the 4k touch
display which at the same time saves
battery life
speaking of battery the laptop has an 84
what our battery and we will touch more
on battery life later in the review so
what's the keyboard like well it's fine
but it isn't anything special the keys
are a little bit wobbly and doesn't give
you that good of an actuation click but
for most people it's fine it has a white
backlight which fades out after a while
to save battery life the trackpad is
pretty good it's big enough for most
people and it's great for gestures like
scrolling and right-clicking the screen
is outright amazing and probably the
best I've seen in a laptop yet just look
at those vessels or well lack thereof
the screen I have here is a glossy 4k
touch display it is an IPS display which
means that colors look great it gets
fairly bright too but there is of course
some of that IPS backlight bleed in
terms of connectivity we have got power
in USB a HDMI Thunderbolt 3 ma USB
type-c connector and a headphone jack on
the other side there is a Kensington
lock a battery indicator and an
other USB type a port and an SD card
reader the battery life is not amazing
but definitely not a problem
either the 84 watt hour battery will
last about six hours of web browsing
three hours of 4k video watching and
from my testing about two hours of
editing video in this department the new
MacBook Pro definitely shines with its
well optimized software giving it a 10
hour battery life when surfing the web
and watching some videos the XPS 15 I
have here has the dedicated 960 m GPU
which by no means make it a full-on
gaming laptop but that's not to say that
it cannot run games because it can games
like csgo rocket League overwatch and
League of Legends run surprisingly well
on this laptop
it does get audible when gaming and
editing video but it's not anything that
I think would bother you alright let's
take a look at some miscellaneous things
alright the webcam is located at the
bottom of the screen because there is no
place up top like on laptops with a
larger vessel this is a problem which
have made me stop using the webcam all
together in terms of Wi-Fi and other
connectivity the XPS 15 has the killer 1
5 3 v wireless card and bluetooth 4.1
with that said let's conclude this
review the Dell XPS 15 is a great
MacBook Pro 15 competitor for the
Windows user if you want to build
quality from a Mac while getting a more
powerful system for less of a strain on
your wallet this is the choice for you
