another video and today we are going to
be taking a look at the router from
lynxes I have never reviewed a router in
the past so if you do feel like I left
any information out please do let me
know in the comments down below and I
will give you that information so this
is the EA 7500 the router is a dual band
AC router that supports both 2.4 and 5
gigahertz bands in terms of speeds it
can do up to 1,900 megabits per second
which is definitely plenty it's very
easy to set up just go to Linksys smart
Wi-Fi calm and set up your Wi-Fi name
and password after that you can set up
an online account that you can access
from anywhere in the world they also
have an app both in the iOS App Store
and the Google Play Store on the back
you have two USB ports that you can use
with external hard drives to essentially
make your router a nest we then have a
Wi-Fi Protected setup button a reset
button the internet in connection
followed by four Ethernet ports and it
swelled volt DC power in when it comes
to range
I was surprised in a good way I could
walk away from my room all the way to
the most outside corner of my backyard
I'd say this was about 25 meters or 65
feet and about three walls now obviously
I was not getting good speed from that
distance but at least it worked we have
a 100 megabit down and 10 up connection
in our house and I got about 90 megabits
per second with a moderate distance
which is great so with that out of the
way let's take a look at the web
software that you can use to control the
router system so this is the web
interface system so first off you login
with the password that you have created
in this set up process and once you are
in you'll have a bunch of options and
settings to play around with
so let me show you that right now so as
you can see here this is the homepage so
first up we see the network status so
this device connected to the router and
the router is connected to the Internet
and everything is working fine as it
should then we have this which is
basically just some tips and tricks on
wireless here you can see the wireless
networks that you have created this one
is 2.4 and this one is 5 gigahertz on
here you have the option to set up a
guest network with its own password and
it has set up its own password called
strawberry 18 and you can see how many
guests are on your network on the
network map map you can see how many
devices are connected to the network's
the system and on parental controls you
can choose if the parental controls are
on or off and here is the external
storage and if you happen to connect an
external hard drive to your router this
essentially becomes a Nass a drive which
is really awesome on media
prioritization you can prioritize
devices and we will get into that more
in depth later so here we have our tools
so let's start with network map on here
we can see our router and we can also
see that my that my macbook pro is
connected to this and network if you
click on it you can see device info and
you can change the name of the device so
Allah so I will choose just MacBook Pro
crap
fifteen and here you can see that it is
connected to the Lynx is ei is 7500
network system and up here you can check
who is connected to your guest network
as well on the next page here you can
check out guest access more in detail so
allow guest access and here you can
choose your network names and password
so change the name and and and password
and then also how many total guests
allowed into that your guests network so
the next one is Parenthood controls
which is very awesome if you happen to
be a parent obviously you can click yes
and if so let's say that I have a kid
who has a MacBook Pro 15 and I want to
block his internet access or case or
hers at specific times I can then choose
at what times the internet will be
blocked that is great but I can also
block specific websites so let's say I
want to block you know yeah I can block
websites and next up is media priority
ssin which is great if you happen to
have either a kid or or yourself who
wants to either like watch Netflix and
it lags or you want to play games and
and and it lags so you want to have the
priority ssin so what you do then is you
click on you then select which thing is
going to get its high priority I'll put
my MacBook Pro here and on here
I can choose which applications that get
the priority ssin there are some preset
applications here but if you would like
to add a new application you can do that
here
but you can also prioritize online games
such as the ones on this list and if
your game is not on this list you can
click add a new game to prioritize that
server for better King and better gaming
experience pretty much next up here
speed test is basically just a speed
test to check your broadband speed and
now on external storage you can connect
an external storage device and give
different access to folders to different
people within your network next up here
is settings this is where you can change
the router password and everything that
has to do with your router now this is
more advanced stuff and it should be
good as it is so you should not have to
play around with this but you can if you
would like to and next up is
troubleshooting basically just
troubleshooting and the one after that
is wireless where you can change a few
settings to your security mode your
network name on both at the 5 and 2.4
network band and you can choose
everything here and you can also choose
wireless scheduler to turn on and turn
off the wireless network as well at
different times which is great to have
as well next time we have security which
is basically just security settings that
you can choose so that is the web OS by
the way guys if you happen to have an
old laptop or a desktop PC you can pick
up Lynx's Wi-Fi adapter that supports
the latest AC Wi-Fi protocol which means
that it will significantly increase
stability range and speed with all of
that out of the way let's conclude this
router if you are looking for a great
router with good speed
long range customization guest accounts
priority ssin and all of that this is
the router for you but if you would also
like to get even better
speeds and range they also make the ea9
500 which has that and this software
capabilities as well so thanks for

and I'll see you guys in the next one
