sound as flashy as these Samsung Galaxy
s7 edge or the iPhone 7 plus but it is
for $400 the Alcatel Idol 4s might be
ticking all of the boxes that we want so
taking a look at the packaging you can
clearly see that this is not your
typical smartphone box in fact it's much
more than that inside you have got some
paperwork and below that you have a VR
headset inside of the VR headset is a
pair of JBL headphones a screen
protector a case rapid charging cable
and wall adapter and the phone for $400
you get all of this but more importantly
how is the phone well the first
impressions that you get when taking the
phone out of the VR headset is whoa
quality it feels just as well built and
premium as my daily Java phoned us these
Samsung Galaxy s7 edge and that say
something about the future of smart
phones they don't have to cost six seven
eight hundred dollars to feel good in
the hand but that's not to say that the
phone doesn't have any shortcomings in
terms of design because it does take for
instance that they pretty much reversed
the phone's buttons the power button is
on the left hand side and not only that
it's on the top of that side and the
volume rocker is on the right side the
microUSB charging port is on the bottom
but to the right of the phone why the
buttons and ports are in pretty awkward
places
speaking of buttons there is one that
you don't see on most smartphones it's
called the boom key and it has a warning
sign on it why anyway it's there and it
does actually have a few useful
functions go into the settings and click
on boom key from there you can choose
what the actuation of the boom key will
do both when the screen is turned off
and on I have the boom key set to turn
on the screen and if I double click it
the phone will take a picture and when
the screen is on and I press the boom
key it will take a screenshot you can
also configure it to activate the camera
or an application the build quality on
the phone is very good it's covered in
glass on both sides and it has metal
side rails with sham furred edges the
phone's design is oddly familiar
which phone could that possibly be well
yeah the Samsung phones anyway it looks
good it feels good and it's premium what
more could you possibly want all right
build quality gets a tick but what about
the cameras they are not the best but I
gotta say for $400 the cameras are fine
it works good for Instagram snapchat and
that kind of deal it's just not up to
par with the Samsung phones but that's
definitely to be expected for 400 bucks
so yeah the cameras get uptick - now
what about the screen it's awesome the
screen is a quad HD AMOLED display it
looks just as good as the Samsung Galaxy
s7 edge s7 and note 7 I can't tell them
apart the idol 4 SS display though is
not as bright as the Samsung ones so you
can see a difference outdoors in bright
sunlight but not anywhere else the quad
HD screen definitely gets it tick when
it comes to medium price phones they
usually slack in things like display
speakers and camera but not on this and
especially not the speakers they sound
phenomenal the speakers are both front
and back facing speakers which in turn
means that you can use it both normally
and flat on its face with the same
volume and crispness they just sound
great and the JBL headphones that you
get in the box
they sound great too now the Alcatel
idol 4s so far has been ticking all of
the boxes that we want but there is one
left that is very important and that is
performance is that up to par with
flagship phones well on paper it's not
it has a Snapdragon 650 - CPU and three
gigs of RAM but in real world use I
could not see a huge difference between
my
seven edge and the idol 4s the phone has
actually never ever lied on me which is
great so yeah for me the Alcatel idol 4s
has decent performance and against a
tick in this department - okay then the
idol forest gets my seal of approval but
how is the VR headset that you get in
the box
I'd say that it's decent but not
something that you would want to use on
a daily basis there's not that much
content out yet either so yeah but it's
definitely a great addition and also a
great experience if you have never tried
to be R before so huge thumbs up for
Alcatel four hundred bucks and you get a
very capable phone with fast charging
great speakers decent performance an
amazing screen and great premium design
you also get a case a screen protector a
VR headset and JBL headphones again for
hundred bucks you can't really go wrong
here and for that the Alcatel idol 4s
gets the second ever tech me now top
tech award this means that the product
is amongst the best for the price and
that I can definitely vouch for it so
