interesting video for you guys I'm here
in the hallway because well this thing
would not really fit on a small table to
unbox it so yeah we have to do it on the
floor
I do actually know what's inside it's
the it's the Alienware alpha but the
Alienware alpha is a small desktop
computer it's not this big so I figured
why don't we unbox it and see why the
packaging is this huge No so let's get
let's get it rolling shall we
we got tape all the place so maybe like
this Oh God
and it also weights a lot so there's
that okay get this side open all right
and then like this okay what do we have
here oh so we have a mouse we have the
raw cat Cova mouse looks pretty decent
like it awesome why is this so pitiful
this has to be the Alienware alpha this
is the Alienware alpha and then we have
this huge compartment here I don't know
what's inside of it we have this cable -
what in the world what in the world is
going on right now
what in the world is this wrong a
keyboard is not a kind of keyboard but
that's all fine let's put this to the
side and let's try to unbox everything
for you guys all right this is kind of
me awesome
not too sure what business I do know
that this is the Alpha itself but I know
but I don't know what this is such a
huge box and what this could possibly
contain so let's get into it alright so
this is the stuff you got you got this
mouse it's the rocket Cova prepare
performance Gaming Mouse looks pretty
awesome and here we also got the rocket
is q FX multicolor gaming keyboard and
then we got these two boxes I'll start
off with the small box because it's
probably the Alpha itself alright let's
unbox it yep okay cuckoo so up top we
have got what looks to be like a letter
or something
umm anywhere alpha QuickStart guide with
safety and regulatory information don't
really need that and it has a place here
for a controller but there's not like
control in here so yeah anyway here is
our chalkboard here is an HDMI cable
there is our huge power brick okay now
we get to the actual Alpha I'm gonna
have to remember how to put these back
later because I am sending this back
it's a review unit oh wow
what am I supposed to do now I'll put
that to the side and um so the Alpha is
really this small wow you've got to be
kidding me you haven't caught it's this
small it's super duper small I am I am
impressed guys okay I'll put this to the
side and let's get to the second box and
let's see what the fuss is all about
all right let's get to that well this
second the bigger box actually which is
interesting that it's the bigger one and
there you go and whoa this is a cable
that connects the the alpha to the
amplifier wah wah wah Wow down here we
have got ooh it's its power cord awesome
there's a lot of things to keep track of
because I'm sending this back in a
couple of weeks and I gotta know where
all of this stuff fit in yeah
so let's pull this guy up and however
you do oh just like this put this to the
side like that all right here see
graphics out the fire come on there you
go okay it's pretty huge - oh I can grab
this I'm not dropping it and of course
it's upside down again come on
oh I should not have done that guys guys
guys guys guys
it includes a graphics card they put
they grab this card inside of it so I
can play around with it without needing
to put my desktop graphics card into it
not to share which graphics card they
put into here but they did put in one so
that's pretty
amazing in the back here is your power
supply you've got Wow a a 4 port USB hub
the graphics card and the cable and the
power adapter and how do you get this
thing off the moon because I want to see
the graphics card oh this is bad ass
I hope you guys are seeing this that is
badass
that is some of the most awesome things
I've ever seen
it's the gtex 99 80 so it's not the 10
serious but it's in 980 and a 980 will
pretty much pretty much max out any game
at 1080p Wow okay so the power supply
here is a Dell one how many watts is
this 460 Watts that's a lot of watts by
the way and this video is going to be a
long one because I'm going to set this
bad boy up and how I'm going to get
rolling with this bad boy it's going to
be awesome I can't wait to bring you
guys start my review on it so let's get
things rolling and let's set these two
bad boys up with the keyboard and my
down monitor this is awesome just a
heads up if you buy this you're gonna be
receiving a lot of packages or well a
lot of packaging material it's a mess in
here and I'll have to clean that up and
I'll get right back to you guys
and so this video turned out to be more
of a vlog style video but that's
probably fine with you guys so these two
boxes you get and this is the stuff it's
messy I know but this is the the Alpha
and that's the graphics amplifier so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do
something cool I've already made a mess
at my main setup I'll take another Dell
monitor the P 24 16 D and put it on this
flat now
nice desk I'm now going to to install
that and the graphics amplifier and all
those things so I mean let's get right
into it so we are we are of course going
to start with the Alpha and then get to
the graphics amplifier
so first let's plug the Alpha into our
monitor and then with the included HDMI
cable if you are wondering what's want
what monitor it is I'm using it's
actually a date del key 24 16 D so
that's a 1440p monitor not porque about
14 point P you need to get the mouse and
keyboard into place
there you go okay let's turn the alpha
on okay we got some light now I gotta
check the specs too because I don't know
the specs of this bad boy yet and if the
the graphics amplifier is actually
needed I don't know but let's get this
thing rolling so that's why they okay
yeah so we're in perfect now let's set
things up like Wi-Fi all that so the GPS
day is the 960 the 960 so technically
you can't play games on this by by
itself I'll have it here so the PC is
there the the amplifier is here maybe oh
wow
what I just want to get to gaming you
know I just want to get to the good
stuff
you know what I think it's my pens um oh
snap
no no not snap well okay we got we we
have life you were supposed to have this
guy turned off when you you know try to
turn on this guy um because when you
turn on this guy this guy gets fired up
as well um so well this thing is working
now and it's pretty loud - I probably
think you can like turn this fan off for
it I don't know if it's actually using
the 980 right now yeah this thing this
is the thing with new technology um you
don't know everything and you kind of
have to you know see or take a look at
the manual you know and of course the
hard drive is very slow at startup but
it's gonna you know turn on will get
faster once you're you know all set okay
and now let me get all of this all you
know figure it out and I'll get back to
you guys
he's up okay so I have been trolling
around with this thing it's pretty I'm
awesome but this thing is way too loud
and I did a search through this thing
and I found that it's the front fan that
is the most audible and I want to
I wanted to turn down the fan speed but
when searching on the the Alienware
forums they said that is a two-pin fan
so it cannot be controlled so what I'm
going to do is I'm basically just going
to I'm basically just going to turn off
the fan I'm going to unplug the cable so
if you have one of these yourself this
is what you do to get rolling and pull
this tab to get this thing open
alright and the fan is just way too loud
it's this fan right here and there goes
a red cable all the way in here to the
main board just disconnect that like
this it's this tiny thing here just
disconnect that and you have got
yourself a much quieter system so this
black thing here do not disconnect that
because that is probably going probably
going to this blue light up front so do
not disconnect that but that's how you
get it to sound much well much less so
thank you guys so much for watching this
unboxing and set up of the Alienware
alpha and the graphics amplifier I'm
gonna have some fun with this and I'll
give you my review in a couple of weeks
and ha yeah I'll see you guys in the
next one peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
