doing a top 5 Android apps video which I
haven't done in like a very long time so
if you guys enjoy this type of content
on the channel please do let me know by
liking and subscribing down below this
one I'm using is the LG G 6 in black and
without any further ado let's get into
the apps the first app in this video is
called backdrop and it's essentially a
free wallpaper app with some of the best
quality wallpapers out there the app has
a nice and easy to use interface with
non intrusive ads and when you find a
wallpaper you like you can just press
the set button to automatically make it
your lock and homescreen wallpaper it's
a fantastic app and if you want it the
link to download is down below in the
description next to that like and
subscribe button the next one is an app
I use on a daily basis it's called
Newton and it's in my opinion the best
email client out there for starters it's
available as an app on iOS and Android
it's also available on Mac OS and
Windows as a beta on the skin this app
looks like a normal email client with
normal features like drafts multiple
inboxes and that can appeal but it also
has some very useful features like
snoozing so let's say you get an
important email that you want to take a
look at deeper later just click snooze
choose date and time and you will
automatically get a second notification
for that email at the set time you can
also compose an email and send it at a
later time and date another great
feature is read receipts this lets you
know when and how the recipient has read
your email that being time and on what
kind of a device phone or desktop and in
some cases even where the email was read
this feature is very useful and in my
opinion the main selling point for Nutan
you get a free two week trial and after
that Nutan cost fifty bucks per year
it's well worth it this next app is for
all you guys rockin an AMOLED display on
your phone it's called AMOLED minimal
and it's an app similar to backdrops but
with black backgrounds instead to help
save battery life thanks to the
individual pixels on the AMOLED display
turning themselves off the link is down
below next up is a great free utility
app it's called after ship and it's an
all-in-one shipment tracker instead of
downloading each app for every delivery
company like UPS D
sheÂ´ll and so on just download this one
application and enter the shipment
numbers and the app will track and give
you updates via notifications on your
shipments if you sign up for an account
which is free you can sync all the
shipments on multiple devices and even
get it on your desktop browser in
summary it's a must have app for anyone
getting a lot of packages delivered and
want to keep track of them nicely
the final app is called tech news and is
just that it a great sab unch of
reputable and big publications and lets
you click on them to read tech news it's
an extremely simple but great to have
application that I use on a daily basis
so there you guys go those were my top 5
Android apps of June 2017 if you enjoy
this video and would like to see more of
it let me know by clicking like and
commenting down below so that's it I'll
see you guys next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
