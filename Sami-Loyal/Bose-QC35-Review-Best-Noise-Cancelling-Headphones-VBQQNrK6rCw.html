another video and today we are going to
be taking a look at some wireless active
noise-cancelling headphones from bose
these are the quiet comfort 35 s these
headphones are the successor to their
previous quiet comfort 25 headphones
they are available in black and silver
now these headphones are pretty much
standard on any business class flight
because of its superior noise
cancellation but also because they are a
lightweight so they don't hurt after
wearing them for an extended amount of
time there is not a huge difference
between the 25 and the 35 s in terms of
design or audio quality and the main
thing is that the new 35 s are wireless
but they can also be used with included
aux cable and the qc25 s were wire only
headphones the new version also has a
rechargeable battery for the active
noise cancellation while with the old
version you had to use double-a
batteries the QC 35 s have noise
cancelling on at all times but when it
runs out of battery you can still use
them you just have to use them wired and
without noise cancellation in Wireless
mode the QC 35 s are expected to last
for 20 hours and I thought that was
about right if you use them in Wired
mode the battery will last up to 40
hours because it only has to power the
noise cancellation charging the battery
is done with a micro USB cable which
means that you can pretty much use it
with any type of micro USB charging
cable you have laying around whether
that be your phone's charging cable or
the one that you get in the box
speaking of box inside the box you get a
hardshell case with an airplane adapter
you also get an aux cable for whenever
you run out of battery alright with the
introduction out of the way let's take a
look at my own opinions regarding the QC
35 headphones in terms of audio quality
they are not the best and definitely not
as flat and neutral asthma m50x SR but
that's not its goal the goal is to
provide good audio quality with a punchy
bass and good treble and the QC 35 s do
just that and combine that with its
active noise cancellation and you have
got yourself a great audio experience
speaking of noise cancellation how
good is that it's actually top-notch
obviously if you work in like a
construction environment these will not
cut out the high tones of things hitting
the ground and stuff like that but what
they do cancel out is a constant lower
noises and that could be people talking
cars humming trains or airplanes and for
things like that
the QC 35s are freaking amazing
literally when you put these on it feels
like you are entering another universe
of calm and quiet goodness it's really
amazing so if you are a person who
travels a lot or live in a noisy
environment I gotta say these are the
best there is and for that you have to
pay a premium because these cost $349 so
what's the bottom line
get these if you need the noise
cancellation because it's literally the
best there is but if you are not in need
of that there are better sounding more
accurate headphones available for the
same amount of cash got that alright so
that's the bottom line
thank you for watching leave it like if

guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
