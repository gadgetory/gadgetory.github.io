another video and today we're going to
be doing something I've actually never
done before and that unbox cases and try
them out for a particular phone in this
case it's the Samsung Galaxy s8 so let's
just make this quick
these are premium smartphone accessories
by Oleg Stark and apparently I am now a
VIP member and therefore I get access to
new cases and stuff like that so without
any further ado let's just unbox this
rather beat on box let's do this one by
one okay well this is interesting this
is some kind of a double cage so it's
both a thing where you can put your
phone in here and mount it to your maybe
your car or something like that and the
vents maybe and there's also a case in
here with a kickstand so you can watch
videos stuff like that so that's pretty
cool this is a rather rugged looking
case I suppose it's going to protect the
s8 quite well has a very nice snug fit
the singer pin sensor is still pretty
easy to get to so that's great it's not
blocking the sensor in any way it's got
two uses that being protecting the phone
while looking pretty badass and also
giving you the ability to use the phone
in landscape mode without using your
hands so let's get on to the next case
got it so that gives the phone a very
nice grip in my opinion it makes it so
less slippery and at the same time it
gives the fingerprint sensor some kind
of a lift over it so that you can more
easily distinguish between the camera
and the fingerprint sensor so this is a
great case for you guys who don't want a
big rugged case that will just be in
your way
you're supposed to remove this like
protective film
I suppose okay so we've got this kind of
blue blue tint on it suppose that's cool
for you guys who are interested in that
kind of color
first impressions are it makes the phone
easier to hold while not being that much
more bulky like that the color looks
cool blue also this gives you a more
easy way of knowing value of
fingerprints emissaries
okay well this is something special I'll
never seen a case quite dramatic like
this one before it looks straight out of
like a superhero movie something like
that so pop the phone in and you can
instantly feel that this really does
protect the phone quite well have got
ourselves a standard so you can put it
like the other cases we saw before it's
also supposed to have a card slot or
something like that so this is quite
interesting let me show you this is just
my transit card so pop that in on the
top here there you go and then you can
use this to pull it up sit down and then
up and then just flip it up that is
quite a interesting design
so this is more my style
I like this one it's kind of a thin case
so it's not going to be in your weight
as much as the previous one lost got a
nice fit to it I like that it feels
great in the hand soft and everything
and it does look quite nice with this
stitching you've got yourself easy
access to the fingerprint sensor which
is great so without dead those were all
of the cases of which we are taking a
look at today I'm going to just I'm
gonna just put them up here for you guys
to more easily see them so these were
the cases we've got today we have got
the genuine leather one with these
stitches we have got this very rugged
one with a flip-out stand we have got
this more utilitarian style case with
both a card holder and equip outs and we
have the blue tint with a clear side and
we have also got the same case but with
a black side and then we have this clear
very same case for you guys who are not
interested in a skin maybe and you just
want the scratch protection so that's
said so thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this video
if you did make sure to click that like
button down below in the description and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
