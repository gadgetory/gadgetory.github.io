from the future
I just noticed when skimming through
this kind of 1 week old recording that I
sound very kind of down and that's
because at the time of recording this
voiceover I was sick and I recorded it
at 8 a.m. in the morning so if I start a
bit down that's why now you know let's
show the video hey what's up everyone to
be a stabber here back with another
watch review today I've got a very
interesting watch for you is called I
own the Bradley timepiece it's available
at their store online and it cost about
three hundred and sixty nine euros so
with that said let's get into the specs
the case and face is made out of
titanium which which means it's very
light and also very strong this strap is
a mesh of stainless steel terms of the
movement you've got around a quartz
movement with some Swiss parts it's got
a diameter of 40 millimeters and an
eleven point five millimeter thickness
the strap has a width of 20 millimeters
and it will fit wrists from fifteen
point nine to twenty one point five
centimeters and in terms of water and
shock resistance this is what it says on
their website the Bradley will easily
withstand brief contact with water like
getting caught in the rain or washing
hands it is not intended for submersion
in water or high intensity sports which
basically means it doesn't have any
special water resistance at all just
enough to withstand rain or washing
hands as stated before the battery is a
Ranade 317 one button sells so that's
gonna be easy to just change out either
yourself or at your local watchmaker or
watch shop and finally it has a two year
full warranty so with that said let's
take a look at the overview of this
watch first impressions it's very light
it also looks a lot different from the
usual watch so how do you tell the time
well well the minutes are on the inside
and the hours are on the outside I'm
guessing it there's like a magnet in
there that switches positions and
therefore the metal globes also switch
positions they can run freely but they
stay in place when they appear on the
place it's supposed to be so yeah
it's a very interesting Raj face more on
it later
the watch strap is adjustable easily I'm
going to show you how right now and
while I'm doing that let's take a look
at the pros and cons pros it's very
unique I've never seen a watch like this
before it's very interesting with these
globes running around yeah if something
special I don't have much to say about
it just look it's it's it's something
special for sure it's also got a very
accurate chorus movement pretty much
every quartz movement is accurate in
nowadays so so if it's got quartz and at
this price point it's gonna be very
accurate it's also basically got no
service costs just a battery change
every few years so so yeah you're not
gonna spend a lot of money on this watch
it's also very light I guess thanks to
the Titanium's so you do forget that
you're wearing the watch after a while
it also looks very stealthy this is the
all-black model and the last Pro people
who are blind can use this to tell the
time so that's probably the biggest
program this watch you can easily tell
the time by just feeling where the
globe's are around the wash style so
that's great now let's get into the cons
it's a little hard to get used to
knowing what the time is in the
beginning and it also seems left the
hour and minute hands should switch
positions because the minute hand is
longer than the hour hand is smaller on
normal washes so yeah they kind of
should have switched places in my honest
opinion another con is it doesn't have
any special features like the date or
chronograph or anything like that it's
also kind of expensive at 369 euros so
it's definitely not a cheap watch at all
it also has no second hand which would
be very cool in this setup but probably
drain the battery very quickly as well
so I understand why they did not go with
that it also have no loom at all but you
can feel it which is good so you can
still tell the time at night however
that's something that I just could not
get used to so as a conclusion if what
you're after is a unique cool and yet
stealthy looking watch that is accurate
then the Bradley timepiece by I own
should be on your list it's a very
interesting watch that is definitely a
conversation starter so with that said I
want to thank you guys for watching my
review of this watch if you enjoyed it
please leave it like and subscribe if
you haven't already and also if you have
any questions feel free to comment down
below and I or others will try to answer
your questions and with that said I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
