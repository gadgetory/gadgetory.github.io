that Epson sent me to make videos on so
I sat down and asked myself what kind of
videos could I make about this thing so
what I usually do is I create a review
video but trust me guys
you would not like that both because I
am NOT an expert on these kinds of
things and who watches a projector
review anyway so I asked my fellow
Twitter followers and they suggested
that I make a comparison video between
the experience of using a projector
versus a normal TV so here's my take on
that so starting off the Epson projector
is using the three LCD technology for
its projection system which can output
up to Full HD which is 1920 by 1080 in a
16 by 9 aspect ratio the projector also
has active 3d which is nice it retails
for about 800 bucks
the TV is from Samsung and it's a mid to
low range 4k TV this is what I believe
most people are looking at when buying a
4k TV because it retails for about 850
bucks which is somewhat affordable so
which one of these gets you the best
experience in terms of standalone
features the TV wins by a longshot why
because it's a smart TV you will get the
ability to watch YouTube and Netflix and
listen to Spotify and all that jazz out
of the box no external device is needed
the projector on the other hand only has
connecting to Wi-Fi and screen mirroring
which is awesome by itself but I never
even got it to work you'll have to get
something like the Apple TV or the
Nvidia shield TV if you want the same
feature set as the normal Smart TV and
both of those go for about 200 bucks
although with the shield TV you can
stream games from your PC to the
projector and play games in console mode
which is pretty damn sick when it comes
to viewing experience it really depends
on if you've had a projector before or
not if you haven't you'll find the
projector pretty darn cool
but of course that feeling is going to
wear out after a couple of weeks so
going completely tactical which one of
these gives you the best viewing
experience it depends on when and where
you're watching if you're using the
projector in the dark it will look
awesome but it's hard to beat the TV's
vibrant colors and more poppy image so
if you're having a hard time choosing
between a TV and a projector go for the
projector if you want a more theater
East experience but that comes with the
cost of needing to buy things like the
Apple TV and those kinds of streaming
devices but on the other hand if you
want things to just work and look good
just go with the TV you can't really go
wrong here thanks for watching make sure
to smash that like button if you enjoy
the video also please subscribe as that
helps me out a lot and I'll see you guys
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
