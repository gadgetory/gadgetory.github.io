and dislike in a product no piece of
tech is perfect and that's just the way
it is so in this video I wanted to share
my personal likes and dislikes about it
not so new anymore
iPhone 7 so without any further ado
let's just get into it
coming from Android and more
specifically the Samsung phones which
are a victim of touch with lag I really
loved the smoothness and overall
responsiveness of the phone even though
it doesn't have top-notch specs from an
Android standpoint the optimization in
the operating system really showed and
made the phone as quick as it is the two
speakers on the iPhone 7 are great they
get decently loud and the sound is clear
detailed and has enough base for a
mobile device compared to the old iPhone
speakers from these 6 and 6s this is a
great upgrade I also love this
fingerprint sensor and home buttons the
sensor is super fast and I've honestly
never seen a thing of a sensor this
quick before there's basically no
waiting time when it comes to the home
button at first I thought this would
feel weird because it doesn't move but
it actually feels very satisfying for
some reason build quality on iPhones
have always been top notch it feels
premium because if it's weight it feels
good because of its size which gets
imperfectly in my hand really it's just
very well built there's no debating
around that the camera and iPhone 7 is
also phenomenal it lets in a lot of
light and the pictures look natural with
no over sharpening or color saturation
going on these pictures and videos talk
for themselves so let's just take a look
so with the life out of the way let's
take a look at my dislikes about the
iPhone zone first I just have to get
this out of the way the camera bump just
keeps getting bigger and bigger now
Apple if you just mainly device a little
bit more stick to remove the bump you
would also have enough space for a
bigger battery and probably even a
headphone jack
which is my next point the absence of a
headphone jack just feels weird like in
my head you kind of expect the phone to
have a headphone jack nowadays I went to
the gym with his phone and forgot that
they didn't have a jack so yeah that was
a boring gym session and I know I know
Wireless is the future and use the
type-c force on laptops are the future
as well but Apple it would have been
good if you could have kept a few other
ports on that MacBook Pro and also have
kept the headphone jack during this
transition period or whatever you want
to call it but anyway that's just my own
personal opinion another dislike with
the iPhone 7 non plus version is the low
resolution display it's got a resolution
of 1334 by 750 which is basically 720p
to be honest the panel itself does look
very good it's vibrant functional stuff
but still is 2017 not 2013 I also
dislike the fact that it's so easy to
scratch the back aluminium piece
especially in matte black and of course
jet black I've had this thing for like a
week and I already have a scratch my
last dislike with iPhone 7 are the huge
vessels I mean we have this xiaomi me
mix the LG G 6 and now the Samsung
Galaxy s8 which are also inspiring big
displays in smaller than usual footprint
for their display size the iPhone 7 is a
4.7 inch phone and it's just a tiny bit
shorter than the new
eight and the safe has a 5.8 inch
display those were my own personal likes
and dislikes about the iPhone 7 let me
know what you guys think in the comments
down below and I'll catch you guys in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
