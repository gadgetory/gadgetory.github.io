going to take a look at five of my tips
for buying a new laptop now these tips
are general and not for a specific
laptop type or customer if you'd like
that though for example maybe a video on
five tips for buying a gaming or school
laptop let me know in the comment
section down below you're also very
welcome to submit some of your own tips
as well so with that said let's get into
my tips tip number one don't be a spec
nerd now I know specs can look tempting
and on paper it might seem like you're
buying a better laptop if the specs are
better and it is a decent rule of thumb
but there are many more things that
matter and that you should take into
consideration when looking for a new
laptop for example build quality is it
made out of cheap plastic or is it made
out of a sturdy all aluminum chassis
keyboard and trackpad matter as well I
recommend reading or watching a review
of the laptop in question to learn more
about the keyboard trackpad screen and
all that you know because it might be a
really wobbly keyboard or a trackpad
whose gestures don't work well so yeah
it's a full experience that matters not
just to specs tip number two don't be
afraid to try something new I know most
of you out there look for a Windows
laptop when browsing for a new PC but
you shouldn't forget about Chromebooks
Macs or even tablets like the iPad pro
and Samsung Tab s3 a Chromebook for
example is a fantastic laptop if
everything you do can be done in your
browser it's also very cheap and a whole
lot faster than the Windows laptops in
the same price point a Mac might be a
better choice if you're for example
video editing on the go and want
something that has good battery life and
video editing speeds while being
portable that is if you're going to use
Final Cut Pro your best choice might
even be just a tablet with a keyboard it
all depends on your own needs and
situation so try to look outside the box
and try something new it can really be
beneficial tip number three know your
needs if you don't know what your needs
are you're going to buy the wrong
you might be looking for a gaming laptop
but you'll buy a workstation one instead
just because you didn't know what your
needs were and what to look for
according to those needs if you'd like a
more comprehensive video on choosing the
right gaming laptop let me know in the
comments down below
tip number four do your research
research is very important let's say you
find a laptop with great specs what
seems to be good build quality and let's
say a great screen for a phenomenal
price so you order it expecting to be
amazed by the new computer and you are
for a week or so and then the screen
starts flickering and after a day this
ring goes blank and now you've got to
send your brand-new laptop back to its
manufacturer that's not fun so once you
find a laptop that suits your needs with
a price tag that's in your budget go out
there and do some research just google
and search for the PC and then add
problems in the end and if there are any
known and widespread problems you don't
know about it tip number five find the
best price online this probably sounds
very obvious to many of you guys out
there so I'm not going to go very
in-depth with this but just know that if
you find your perfect laptop at like
Best Buy chances are you gonna find a
better deal online so definitely make
sure to research the price so that you
get the best deal available for the
laptop in question so those are my five
tips for buying a new laptop if you've
got any questions make sure to leave
those in the comment section down below
and also like and subscribe if you
haven't already it means a lot thanks
I'll see you guys in the next video
