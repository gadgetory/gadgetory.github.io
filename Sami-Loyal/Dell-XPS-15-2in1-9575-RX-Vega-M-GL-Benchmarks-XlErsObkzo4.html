the model number 95 75 and it's in many
ways a very interesting laptop it is as
you guys know a two-in-one convertible
but at the same time it's also a big
laptop as 15 inches and so because of
its size I never actually found myself
using the two-in-one function other than
that one time I just wanted to check it
out and so because of its unconventional
size in terms of 2 in 1 laptops it's not
a very easy laptop to handle as a tablet
especially not with the keyboard in your
hands which just feels so wrong the
keyboard does get disconnected though
when you put it into the two-in-one mode
but it just feels so wrong holding it
and you know pushing all those buttons
now I do understand why some people
could find this function useful and I
think it's a pretty cool feature at the
same time it gives you some bragging
rights among your friends so there's
that and it's basically just the normal
XPS 15 but with the two-in-one
functionality added so I'm not gonna be
talking about its build quality or its
keyboard or its trackpad they're all the
same basically as on the normal XPS 15
and if you want to know more about that
watch my review of the XPS 15 or the XPS
13 to know more about how it's built and
you know things like that this video is
going to be a look at how it performs in
gaming because even if it isn't a gaming
laptop per se it does feature a very
interesting GPU so let's take a look at
it my specific model is featuring the
Intel Core i5 8305 G in collaboration
with AMD yes you heard that right
intel has collaborated with AMD I would
like to clarify that this is the
graphics part of AMD that they're
collaborating with and not the CPU
department but nonetheless it's a pretty
cool thing in terms of other
specifications it's got a 1080p IPS
panel with touch it's got 8 gigs of RAM
and a half terabyte of PCIe SSD so
what's this
intel and AMD collab all about well the
cpu is basically your typical laptop
quad core i5 CPU however this time
around as it is an AMD collaboration it
is paired with an AMD rx Vega m GL GPU
power wise it's around the same as the
laptop version of the 1050 Ti which is
quite good it's gonna be able to play
all the eSports games you want
so in Cisco I was averaging at around a
hundred and fifty fps in overwatch at
1080p and medium settings its averaging
at a hundred and eight fps and 50 fps if
you play at Ultra games like League of
Legends dota heroes of the storm etc are
also going to be extremely playable I'm
talking above a hundred fps some older
triple-a titles and also surprisingly
some of the new ones work quite well too
in BioShock Infinite we're getting
around 50 fps at Ultra settings at 1080p
in Metro last light we're getting around
40 fps at the same settings The Witcher
3 can actually be played at 1080p high
settings at 40 fps however if you crank
it up to ultra it's gonna bog down to
about 20 FPS which is just not playable
and lastly fallout 4 went pretty well
too at 45 fps in high settings and at
1080p so it's definitely no slouch it's
super cool to see how this technology
improves so fast I would have never
guessed that you could play all those
games and get those impressive results
on a laptop meant for semi portable work
so if you need a laptop to take to
school or to work but also want to be
able to play some games on it the Dell
XPS 15 2 in one looks very promising
the only question you have to ask
yourself is if you really need a
two-in-one function or not and if you do
then obviously get this one if not then
the XPS 15 the normal version is
available with a gtx 1050 TI which is
gonna get about the same results in
gaming as the RX Vega mg/l so what do
you guys think about this laptop let me
know by leaving a comment
and also feel free to like and subscribe
if you enjoy to this video and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
