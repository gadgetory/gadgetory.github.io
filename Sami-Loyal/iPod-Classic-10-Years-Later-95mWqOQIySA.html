iPod Classic as it's called now and with
iPod being discontinued I decided to dig
this beautiful thing out of my garage
and take a closer look at what we
considered the best music player back in
2007 that being 10 years ago it was
available in two different storage and
color options one with a degree of
storage and another with 160 one with a
silver color and another with a black
color its design is very athletic it's
made out of aluminum and there's no
plastic to be found anywhere the back
part is glossy which was a horrendous
decision from Apple it looks great until
it got trashed which happened very
quickly and easily but it also was a
fingerprint magnet its display was very
high def back then and even by today's
standards it looks okay and part of that
is thanks to the operating system being
as clean looking at today compared to
every other operating system at the time
handheld music player or not this will
clean futuristic and just a whole lot
better than everything else but it
didn't only look good it was easy to use
as well you control the iPod with this
touch wheel which made it super simple
to scroll through your endless library
of music charging was done via the 30
pin port on the bottom and the battery
lasted a whopping 30 hours of music
playback up top you'll find the
headphone jack and the hold switch which
acted as they touch wheel disable and
screen lock
so the iPod Classic it was well built
albeit with some scratching issues it
could store twenty thousand or 40,000
songs this battery life was great it had
a headphone jack which today is a
feature it had an easy-to-use interface
and overall it was the best music player
around back then this Apple is the Apple
I would like to see more of today do you
