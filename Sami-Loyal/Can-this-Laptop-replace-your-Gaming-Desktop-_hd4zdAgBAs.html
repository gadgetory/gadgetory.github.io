desktop this is the asus rog GL 702 ZM a
gaming laptop with a desktop grade gtx
1060 in it it also has a quad-core i7
6700 HQ paired with 8 gigs of ram that
is upgradable up to 32 gigs attached to
this thin an insanely powerful machine
is a 1080p IPS g-sync
enabled screen a keyboard and a trackpad
it's basically a desktop in a laptop
form even its port selection is quite
desktop like now obviously it's not got
the quantity of a desktop but it's got
the selection hdmi displayport you see
type-c SD card reader and three
normal-sized USB ports now i'm sure that
you guys are very interested in seeing
the performance of the gtx 1060 graphics
card so let's get into the benchmarks
before we get into everything else like
screen keyboard and all that so as you
can see on the benchmarks here the gtx
1060 in this laptop is very powerful now
I have noticed frame drops however a
little bit now and then which is why I
recommend using g-sync when gaming on
the laptop screen and capping the FPS
260 or your screens refresh rate when
not so what does g-sync do well when
g-sync is enabled it limits the max FPS
to the screens refresh rate which in
this case is 75 I recommend everyone
using g-sync
instead of the higher spss as anything
over 75 does not help when gaming on the
laptops display if you however happen to
have a non g-sync monitor with a higher
refresh rate like 144 hertz obviously
use that the benefit with g-sync
is that gaming skills smoother as it
synchronizes your screens refresh rate
with the FPS you get that means both a
smoother feel had no screen tearing
whatsoever and in this case it also lets
the GPU run more stable quiet and most
importantly cool the build quality of
the actual laptop is not like great it's
mainly made out of plastic which makes
it feel not as premium at a laptop with
a full metal design
and in terms of portability it's a 17
inch laptop it's down to be big and
heavy it actually weighs 6 pounds but
it's still one of these smaller and
thinner 17-inch gaming laptop this exact
laptop is available in a 16 inch format
which would obviously be a better choice
for people going to LAN parties and
stuff like that the keyboard is one of
the click you're feeling ones which
gamers love it's got a backlight not RGB
though so you cannot change the color
and a thing I don't like with the
keyboard it's the quick access tools
because there are no media controls on
them now the trackpad is nowhere near
close to Apple's but it is one of the
better windows-based trackpad
the SSD is in the MDOT 2 format is SATA
though so you will be getting pretty
average SSD speed inside the laptop
there's also a normal hard drive which
is great for game and media storage in
terms of battery life you can expect
around 6 hours of video playback and
around one and a half hours of gaming
but the thing with these big and
powerful laptops are that you're not
getting the maximum performance when
gaming on battery the inbuilt battery
just cannot supply enough power so don't
expect to gain without a wall outlet
nearby so to answer the question can
this laptop replace your gaming PC well
yes if you've got power nearby the g6
1060 is pretty much perfect it can
handle any game you throw at it at 1080p
and at least medium settings so with
that said who is this laptop for it's
basically for gamers on the go with a
wall outlet nearby so on a train a LAN
party and stuff like that it works
perfectly so what do you guys think of
the asus rog GL 702 vm let me know in
the comments down below and i'll see you
guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
