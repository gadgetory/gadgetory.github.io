quite some time now you know that I have
reviewed the normal version of the XPS
13 about a year ago and I really liked
it especially for its near perfect
balance between performance and
portability Dell announced the new XPS
13 featuring the seventh gen Intel CPUs
as CES this year alongside the new
two-in-one option which is the one we're
taking a look at in this pros and cons
video so without any further ado let's
get into the pros the Dell XPS 13 2 &amp;amp; 1
is like all other XPS computers very
well built and sturdy it's got aluminum
panels on the outside making the device
sturdy and plastic on the inside with a
carbon fiber soft touch coating which
makes a computer lighter than one made
all out of aluminum the hinge is robust
the keyboard and display has no flex to
them and overall the XPS 13 to in one
feels like a tight and well-built
package I really like Dells displays
lately they have very small vessels
which in turn makes the entire device
smaller great touch functionality and
responsiveness and they're also on top
in terms of color accuracy and quality
the one I have here is just a 1080p
model which still looks good but it's
also a qhd+ model available personally
though I would prefer a display with a
three by two aspect ratio as that would
give you more screen real estate
something like the display found in the
surface book from Microsoft this PC is
Dells most portable one yet it's small
and lightweight yet it's still very well
built as touched on before it comes down
at only one point twenty four kilos or
two point seven pounds which is
fantastic for such a well-built device
Dell is together with Apple and others
on the USB type-c Thunderbolt 3
bandwagon and that's great it's such a
powerful and versatile port for example
you can connect this Cal digit dark to
it with just one cable and charge a
laptop at the same time as getting
access to a whole plethora of other
essential ports such as 2 USB type ace
audio jack Ethernet DisplayPort and
another USB type-c the laptop has no
full-size USB port so the Cal digit dock
is recommended although not essential in
this case as they do include an adapter
for one USB type a port in the box which
is
great to see something you won't find on
a normal XPS 13 is a fingerprint scanner
although there is one on the two-in-one
model I am not sure as to why it's
apparent here but not on the bigger
model but nevertheless it's a great
feature to have the scanner is quick and
it's never failed to recognize my finger
so with the pros done let's take a look
at five not-so-good things because of
Dells very tiny bezels
there was no place up top to put the
webcam and therefore they have to put it
below the Dell logo which basically
renders it unusable if you're going to
be faced calling anyone on this laptop
they'll be looking up your nose you'll
look like you're staring at something
far away and if you're using the
keyboard at the same time you'll just
block the view yeah not a good placement
so another con is the performance sure
it's got this boost mode which
significantly helps it through some of
the more Hardware taxing things like
watching high-resolution video or lights
photo editing but it's not going to be
able to edit your next you know 4k text
video without stuttering and getting
very very hot it's handled easier tasks
like note-taking video watching emailing
and browsing though like a boss but not
anything more than that if you're
looking for a better performer in the
two-in-one space take a look at the
Microsoft Surface book I have made a
video about it just like this one so go
ahead and check that out in terms of
battery life it will last long enough
for most people around 6 to 7 hours but
to the surface book from Microsoft exist
which gets around 10 hours of use the
Dell XPS 13 2 &amp;amp; 1 has a very very
awkward tablet phone and although the
feature is there the laptop just doesn't
feel like it was intended to be used as
a tablet it's just too heavy and you're
constantly touching the disabled
keyboard which just feels weird and
makes it hard to find a comfortable way
of using it my last con is kind of a
nitpick but it's been frustrating the
hell out of me over these past two weeks
and that's opening the laptop there's no
way of doing it without just looking
like a dumbass so there you go those
were my main five pros and cons with the
Dell XPS 13 2 in 1 what do you guys
think of the laptop let me know in the
comment section down below and also make
sure to like or dislike this video and
off to you guys in an
one piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
