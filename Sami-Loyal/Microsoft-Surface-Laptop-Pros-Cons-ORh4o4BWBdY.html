the version I have is in a rather
special color called maroon it features
Windows 10 s which is a lighter version
of Windows 10 you can only install apps
available in the Windows Store which
limits your selection of applications
widely so I just installed the full on
Windows 10 OS instead which is free by
the way and in this video I'm going to
be talking about the pros and cons that
I noticed during my couple of weeks with
this laptop so let's get into the pros
the first Pro being its awesome design
and quality picking up the laptop you
can definitely feel the quality and even
more so when you're using it it's got a
metal shell and a very soft like
textured feel on the inside it's hard to
describe but it feels awesome another
Pro is the phased recognition with
Windows hello and it works like a charm
just set it up once and then when you
need to log in or approve of things just
look at the display and it takes less
than a second to know it's you this is
so much better than fingerprint sensors
and of course just using a password the
keyboard and trackpad are also great the
keyboard is clicky and is very easy to
get used to likewise with the precision
driver trackpad I'd have to say that
these are probably the best in the
Windows market maybe tied with the XPS
15 the screen is also phenomenal it's a
touch 20 256 by 1504 display I know
weird AF resolution but it looks great
colors are vibrant and true to life
viewing angles are good and it gets
fairly bright as well definitely up to
par with MacBooks the portability of
this surface laptop is a big pro as well
and the fact that it's both well made
sturdy and all of that plus being light
small and easy to carry around is by all
means very impressive this is definitely
a good laptop for people on the go and
with around 7 hours of writing on the
surface laptop before it dies the
battery gives you enough juice for a
whole day of work so that's great as
well performance wise the laptop can
easily handle things
like 4k video watching browsing the web
with multiple tabs open Lite video and
audio and photo editing etc and I rarely
came across any lag with those tasks so
if what you do falls in between the
things I mentioned in terms of you know
toll on their CPU etc it's gonna work
very smoothly now I would not buy this
if you do any professional work like CAD
or video editing though that's when the
two course starts choking now let's get
into some cons the first one being is
iron on the left side you'll find a
full-size USB port a mini display port
and a headphone jack on the other side
there's just the charging port and so my
problems with this layout are as follows
one the charging port should be on the
left side not on the right side - why
are there no Thunderbolt ports this
leaves you stranded with just the port's
you have if you want to connect a
full-on Ethernet jack you can't if you
want to run dual monitors you can't if
you want to connect a wired keyboard and
mouse you can't there's just a whole lot
of limitations here if the surface
laptop had just one Thunderbolt three
USB type-c port we could have added all
of that with a dock and charge the
laptop at the same time so the fact that
that's missing is definitely
disappointing my next and actually final
con of this laptop is the price of it
the laptop starts at $1000 and for that
you get an i5 128 gigs of SSD storage
and just four gigs of RAM yeah that's
that's not good if you want the i7 with
eight gigs and 256 gigs of storage which
is the best model to go for you're gonna
have to cough up $1600 and the top and
model 16 gigs of ram and one terabyte of
storage is $2,700 for a laptop with a
dual core i7 that's hard to justify so
what do you guys think about them up so
what do you guys think about the
Microsoft Surface laptop let me know in
the comment section down below and I'll
see all of you guys in the next video
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
