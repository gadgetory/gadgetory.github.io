another video and today we're taking a
look at the Dell XPS 15 and before we
get into it I do want to say that I am
sick right now so my voice may be
sounding a little bit weird but that's
not going to stop me from making videos
so let's get right into it so the device
that I have features and i-5 8 gigs of
ram a one terabyte sshd and the full HD
non-touch display on the left hand side
you will find a charging port a USB port
an HDMI port a USB type-c port and a
headphone jack on the other side you
will find a Kensington lock a power
indicator a USB port and an SD card
reader so alright let's get into the
pros so first up the display the XPS 15
has a beautiful display called the
Infinity display there's practically no
vessels and you can configure it with
different options the one that I have
right here is the less expensive Full HD
non-touch version but there's also a 4k
touch option and both look amazing build
quality the build quality in the XPS
lineup is one of the best in Windows
based machines it's really close to
being as good as the Macs are in this
department too it's made out of aluminum
on the outside and soft touch coded
carbon fiber on the inside it looks
really clean and professional although
the carbon fiber do attract finger
prints which is a little bit annoying
the displays hinges are also pretty
stiff so you can't open the laptop with
one hand but other than that the build
of the XPS 15 is very sturdy and premium
alright next up this size the XPS 15 is
a small laptop for being 15 inches it's
5 percent smaller and 13 percent lighter
than the MacBook Pro 15 the touchpad the
exbest 15 has a glass touchpad that
works phenomenally you can two finger
scroll and zoom and do all of those
handy gestures with it I'd say it's just
as good as the Mac books are all right
next up perform
the x-15 is a powerhouse you can equip
it with an i7 16 gigs of ram a 4k touch
display one terabyte of SSD storage and
960m graphics but that's expensive so
how does my mid range version hold up
surprisingly well it ran through Windows
and browsing smoothly and washing 4k
video was not laggy but how does it work
with more power-hungry tasks playing
games on the CPU worked surprisingly
well it's not a gtx 1080 but if your
lower the graphics too low and played on
1080p you got about 30 to 65 FPS that
meaning in less intensive games like
csgo rocket League and League of Legends
it's not going to run the latest
triple-a titles on max and 4k so it's
not a gaming machine alright let's take
a look at some of the cons the webcam DX
based laptops have their webcams on the
lower part of the display
not on top like on normal laptop so the
view really sucks and you can't have a
normal conversation with this thing the
better life the better life in the XPS
15 is nothing to be excited about
I mean it's decent but not
groundbreaking the full HD has much
better battery life than the 4k touch
option so if you're looking for a good
battery life look elsewhere or by the
Full HD non-touch version you will see
yourself charging this thing a lot next
up finger prints
the XPS 15 may be super sleek and feel
premium but it still attracts finger
prints especially on the carbon fiber so
your $1000 plus device will not look
that new for any longer than a week or
two if we compare this to the MacBook
it's night and day
the MacBook is crafted by aluminium and
aluminium only so if you get
fingerprints you can just wipe it off
very easily but that's not the case with
the XPS 15 all right next up price the
Xbox 50 may not be the most affordable
laptop and if you're all about
specification
you can find much better options alright
so those were my main gripes and here's
a small conclusion the exbest 15 is not
for everyone if you are a gamer look
elsewhere if you're a business guy get
this model version if you're on a
smaller budget look elsewhere so who is
this laptop really for I'd say anyone
who can really appreciate the great
build quality and performance so if you
felt like this video was too short and
didn't cover everything please check out
the XPS 13 review that I made these two
laptops are practically the same so that
one video will do the job just fine
thanks for watching make sure to follow
me on social media the links are down
below and I'll see you guys in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
