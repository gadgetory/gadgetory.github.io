five terabyte version to be exact and on
Amazon it goes for a hundred and
ninety-nine US dollars at the moment but
of course if you opt for another size
the price will go down with it so if you
are in need of a simple storage and
backup solution this might be the way to
go actually so let's check it out it's
got a nice piano black top with a white
LED light on the bottom right corner and
on the front there's a nice-looking
sigit logo the actual build quality
though is not spectacular in any way
it's just made out of plastic and that's
that on the back there is a simple IO
with a power button power in Ethernet
and a USB port on the right side there's
a USB 3 connection that you can use to
connect external hard drives to the same
nass system I use a LaCie 4 terabyte
Porsche Design mobile hard drive and it
works perfectly the external hard drive
basically gets its own folder within the
NASA system so how does it work and how
do you get it up and running well it's
extremely simple just plug it into power
then connect the ethernet cable to your
router click the power button and wait
for the white LED to stop blinking then
go to your PC go to the file explorer
and click network if you get an error
message just click yes and start network
sharing and there it is personal cloud
just click on that and then click on the
public folder and there's a link in the
public folder go to that link and follow
the steps on the website to set up your
personal cloud device and once you're
done you will get to the home page and
if you want to set up accounts that get
their own folder click on device manager
go to users go to add user you can then
choose if the user is within the same
network as you or anywhere else in the
world and if it's an external user you
just have to provide an email address
and the system will then
send an email for the person with setup
instructions and if it's a local account
you can let the user themselves add the
account info or you can do it yourself
so once you have added the account the
user will have its own folder within the
network share and if anyone tries to
access it they will have to enter the
username and password to see the content
inside so as you can see it's very
straightforward
if you connect an external hard drive to
the NASS with the USB 3.0 port that
external hard drive will appear as its
own folder in the NASA Network share so
let's take a look at this software so
device manager is where you can set up
accounts change settings and all that
canister in the download manager you can
make the NASS download content to itself
with either a link or a torrent file you
can also choose the destination in the
backup manager you can setup a backup
schedules for your pcs etc you can also
backup the connected external hard drive
to the NASCAR Jam and I find that very
useful you can also choose to backup
things to two services like Google Drive
and Dropbox in the app manager you can
it you can install apps such as a plex
media server WordPress IFTTT and more in
the app IFTTT you can set up some really
cool stuff for example every time you
add something to Dropbox or Google Drive
it can automatically download it to
itself as well you can download every
Android or iOS photo that you take and
you can also automatically download
email attachments to the drive and much
much more it's just awesome basically
you put the Internet to work for you so
next up is S Drive this is the app that
you use if you go outside of your home
just sign in and you have access to your
Nass from anywhere in the world it's
available both on Windows and Mac now
that we have got all of that out of the
way there's only one last thing to test
and that is transfer speed I'm going to
transfer
a folder of important tmn stuff from my
PC to the personal cloud drive and then
bring it back it's about 55 gigs the
average speed was lying at around 55
megabytes per second that being both
from and to the personal cloud which is
pretty decent considering it's all going
through the network all right quick pros
and cons time pros it's good looking it
can connect external hard drive it's
relatively cheap for what you get it has
a good interface with great inbuilt apps
that are all very useful it's quiet and
it's extremely easy to use cons the
drive is not easily upgradable it only
has one drive slot and it isn't very
well built so as a conclusion this
Seagate personal cloud is a simple to
use mask for a good price it looks good
it's not too big and more importantly
it's extremely easy to set up and use
and the inbuilt apps are all very useful
so would I recommend it yes totally it's
a great bar thanks for watching make
sure to LIKE this video if you liked it
and subscribe and I'll see you guys in
the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
