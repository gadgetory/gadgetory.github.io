another video in this one we're going to
be unboxing and taking a quick look at
this audio technica at2020 USB plus
microphone and in the end I'm also going
to be testing its audio quality so stay
tuned for that now believe it or not I
have actually owned this microphone
before but I didn't really know how to
use it and how to set it up properly and
also I did not know how to enhance the
audio in my audio editing software and
so consequently I sold this microphone
and then bought the very easy-to-use
Samson meteor microphone and then I went
pro with an XLR microphone the rode nt1
which was a fantastic microphone but it
was a little bit clumsy because you had
to have this big audio box and you had
to have that thick XLR cable so then I
got rid of that and ASA sent me the ROG
Magnus microphone which I have been
using since I got it and unboxed it but
now I'm going back to the 80/20 20 USB
plus for my voiceover work and one
reason as to why I'm doing this is
because it looks awesome
and number two and most importantly I'm
switching microphones because this one
sounds a whole lot better if you can set
it up properly so without talking
anymore let's just get straight into the
box and take a look at this awesome
microphone oh and by the way I paid for
this microphone with Bitcoin that was
such a pleasant experience it's really
awesome how some of the biggest online
retailers here in sweden in terms of
electronic status are now starting to
accept bitcoin so that is pretty damn
awesome so open up the box we do have
our purchase registration card which i'm
not going to be using whatsoever
we do have a disposal of old electrical
and electronic equipment thingy and then
we have our manual i suppose yes the
instruction manual i will not need this
it's a very simple microphone to use I
don't understand why I couldn't use it
before yeah I just I wasn't as sharp
back then and then we have this piece
here let's take that other way and here
we have the box divided into two
sections and so here at the top we have
the microphone itself and it is very
nicely presented but most importantly
it's very nicely protected and then down
here on the bottom half of the box we
have this leather pouch I'm not sure if
this is real leather or not probably not
it has a stamped audio technica logo get
his zipper up and we do have our
accessories here which include number
one and most importantly the USB cable
for connecting this to your computer and
then here I assume this is the stand yes
this is the stand for the microphone
which you are going to be using here
with these legs here you can also mount
this on a real professional microphone
stand if you would like to do that which
I am probably going to be doing but for
now I will be using this this thing
which is on the box as well I think yeah
this stand right here it's good to have
in the beginning and yeah that's it so
this is a very nice pouch to keep your
microphone and the microphone
accessories when traveling I will not be
needing this really but it's nice that
they include that now let's get into the
microphone just close up this box it is
quite a heavy microphone it screams
quality all over the place so here it is
wrapped in plastic
oh yeah this is a beautiful microphone
extremely heavy actually you know for
the size of it on the back here we have
an ox out port for connecting headphones
so that you can listen to your voice to
make sure that it sounds all good and
then this this slider here is for
balancing how much audio you want from
the mic and how much audio you want from
your computer so that it's nice to just
balance that out if you want more
computer noise or more microphone noise
in your ears if you have connected some
headphones if not then this thing that's
absolutely nothing and here we have the
volume slider for those said headphones
if you decide to connect them and then
down here we have our USB connection and
so for those of you out there who are
purchasing this microphone yourself I
want to know how to set it up it's
actually very easy on the stand you just
take your microphone you take this part
which comes in the box of course and you
slide it down like this onto the flat
bottom here like so and then you just
screw it on and once it's all in and
sits perfectly like this then you take
this end and you screw on the tripod
piece just like a sole and you can
adjust this however you would like it to
be and so as you can see now when you
connect it to your computer and it
receives power it does shine blue inside
of the capsule it's really nice looking
but without any further ado let me open
up audacity on my macbook and let's
record with the at2020 plus I'm not sure
how I've set up the audio yet in terms
of volume so we are going to be
switching from this microphone to that
microphone in three two one
alright guys now I am speaking to you on
the audio technica at2020 plus let me
know how you guys like this audio this
is completely unedited just off the
microphone all right guys now I'm
speaking to you on the same microphone
but now I have added some EQ and some
compression to it let me know what you
guys think of this audio in the comment
section down below let me know what you
think of this microphone do you like it
or not is it worth its price tag of
around one hundred and twenty dollars
let me know in the comment section down
below and I'll see you guys in my next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
