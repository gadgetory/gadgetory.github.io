so this is the TG to from Olympus so the
TG to is a very very tough camera you
can shoot 1080p of course and the
toughness is actually 15 meter
waterproof and 2.1 meter shockproof so
the sensor has 8 megapixels so the
camera might not be the best of the best
but it's very very tough let's move on
to my main gear so this is the nikon d
33 hundred and it is a DSLR camera also
so this camera is priced at around six
hundred fifty dollars and i am using the
normal kit lens that i got with the
package alright so this is the nikon d
33 hundred to the next off
so this is my time-lapse remote which I
use to create time-lapsed of course it's
nothing very special but you know it
really just gets the job done click now
to see a video that I have made with the
time-lapse controller so these are my
very very trusted speakers these are the
logitech said for I've been using them
for many many years and they have been
serving me great poor quality sound and
yes great it has a controller where I
can change the base and the volume and
power it on and off of now let's move on
to the next stuff this is my keyboard
the key station 49 version 2 from m
audio and so as you can here by the name
it has 49 keys and it has a controller
you know it's just a very very basic
keyboard that I use to play the piano
and things like that for school so you
can of course change the volume the
pitch the modulation the Octavius and
play pause and record and so on
so this is my phone the iphone 6 plus so
this mobile phone basically does
everything that I needed to do I guess
um it's just an iphone and that's that
you know it's an iphone 6 plus I like
the screen I like to watch Casey nice
thats vlogs on it and that's about it
you know a phone alright i'm sure you
have seen many of those videos so this
is my second monitor a very creepy very
bad basically just a old monitor that i
use to record audio and play the piano
on now let's move on to the more fun
stuff this is my mouse the coarser m65
RGB and i gotta say man i really really
like this mouse it is it feels great and
it looks great and that's good enough so
this is my keyboard it's the k70 and
that is also from corsair it's also read
it's not our GP but i like the read so
i'm happy so this keyboard has the MX
red switches you can set your own custom
modes and you can change the lighting of
course and you can also play pause you
can skip and stop and mute and volume up
and down of course
so my boxes have a special place in my
room I like to keep my most loved boxes
in my room I usually keep my mobile
phone boxes there i keep my camera boxes
my d 3300 camera of course i keep the
show tiled and so on and i just love
nice boxes so these are my stinking
black headphones and this is my HyperX
cloud to box which i really really love
the packaging on that one so these are
my two shield tablet boxes and so this
box is the meteor microphone box from
Samsung I really love this box it feels
like a very special box you know so this
is my main monitor it's the bank you g
to 250 and it has the sense I three
technology in whatever but it's just a
1080p monitor that I use so this is the
star of the show the samsung media
microphone that's the one that you are
hearing on right now and I just love the
look of this and it just sounds great
and it's pretty damn awesome right it's
so classy so good-looking alright so
this is my Nvidia shield tablet this is
my favorite tablet of all time why well
it's sheep it's very powerful and you
can game on it very very good
so this is my computer that you are
looking at right now this is in the
factor design are for case and the specs
are coming at you right there so if you
want to know the specs just read the
occasion you will know it so thank you
guys so much for watching I'm sure
you'll love this video if not then you
know what to do but if you loved it be
sure to smash that like button and I'll
see you guys in the next one piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
