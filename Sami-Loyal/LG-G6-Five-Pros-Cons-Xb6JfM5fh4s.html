package of a phone its specs are pretty
good with its price tag being lower than
its main competitors the s8 but as I
always say in these videos no piece of
tech is perfect and that's why this
serious exists we're going to be taking
a look at the five major pros and cons
of the new LG g6 so that said let's not
waste any more time and get straight
into the pros the LG G 6 features a
striking almost bezel-less 2880 by 1440
IPS display it's immersive thanks to the
small bezels it's sharp gets fairly
bright and also features an always-on
display even though it's an IPS panel I
like it a lot LG went from a small
twenty eight hundred million power
battery in the g5 to a 3300 milliamp
hour one in the new g6 combine that with
more energy-efficient components and
you've got yourself fantastic battery
life it's also got quick charge three
points out meaning it charges really
fast in terms of numbers I got around
five-and-a-half hours of screen on time
and in general use I still had about 25
to 40 percent left at the end of the day
ip68 water resistance on the g6 is a
first on lg smartphones and I dig it in
my opinion every flagship should have
some sort of water resistance and if one
does not it makes it almost a
deal-breaker for me as I've grown used
to feeling that sense of security if I
happen to drop the phone in water it'll
be fine the g6 keeps the same camera set
of last year that being two sensors with
one of them being super wide and the
other being a team normal focal range
sensor wise is a decent upgrade from
last year they have also fixed the issue
where there was a difference in quality
between the two sensors there are some
pictures to help you decide whether you
think the same as me
or not
the LG g5 of last year had a weird build
technically it was a metal build however
LG for some reason may be too high the
antenna bands decided to add a plastic
coating on top of the metal which in
turn made it feel like a plastic phone
yeah not a good decision this year
though the phone comes with a glass
design it feels very well-made its solid
has no flex to it and seems quite
scratch resistant so with the pros done
let's check out let's check out some
cons I can happily say that LG has
decided to keep the headphone jack
unlike some other baking brands however
it's on the top of the song and I know
it's a pretty big nitpick but using this
phone with the cable attached just feels
a bit awkward it's definitely not a big
deal though the LG g 6s spec sheet looks
oddly familiar to a flagship phone of
last year it's featuring the Snapdragon
820 one chip which is used in for
example the Google pixel it's still a
great ship but the s8 exists with the
all-new snapdragon 835 chip which has
better energy efficiency and performance
it's definitely not noticeable in daily
use but in terms of bragging rights
you've got more if you have the SI as
mentioned before the LG G cigs has a
great looking screen however in direct
sunlight it could be a bit wider it's
not like it's hard to see it's just that
the Galaxy S shape is crystal clear even
in direct sunlight while the g6 is not
another small con with a new display
it's odd 18 by 9 aspect ratio this will
give you small black bars on the sides
while watching standard sixteen by nine
videos however it will also give you
more screen area to work with
in scrolling type apps such as web
browsers and social media apps some
features such as the quad DAC and
wireless charging is not available here
in Europe while the wireless charging is
there on US models and a quad AK in some
other regions this region dividing is
not very fondly seen upon and I wish
that they would stop doing this for
their next releases so there you guys go
those were the 5 major
and cons of the new LG g6 in summary
though it's a fantastic phone and I
might even consider switching from my
essay to it instead so with that said
thank you guys so much for watching
please leave a like and subscribe if you
enjoyed the video and I'll see you guys
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
