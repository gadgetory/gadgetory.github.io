speaker with some very cool RGB effects
now first impressions when unboxing it
r1 it feels very sturdy and solid
it's got no rattling to it and to the
RGB light show has got mirrors behind it
which makes it look very cool it's only
got the LEDs on one side though which is
a bummer as it would have been even
cooler to have it on both sides in the
Box you get a manual and a micro USB
charging cable you don't get a wall
adapter with it so you either have to
charge it through your computer or just
use your phone adapter with it bluetooth
pairing is fast when you're already
paired since before however it would
have been great to see the NFC feature
as well which many other speakers in
this price point have it makes it a lot
easier to pair by just placing your
phone on a specific spot and clicking
yes instead of trying to search through
bluetooth and not finding it and also I
don't think the NFC module is that
expensive so yeah the fact that it's not
there is a con so how's the sound well
my opinions on this sound are mixed the
high-end is clear and detailed however
the bass is lacking which is a shame
because that's what you're looking for
punchy bass with a clear and detailed
high-end and mids however with this
speaker you just get the latter and
sadly not so much of the former also a
con for the speaker the lighting effects
are as mentioned before looking very
three-dimensional and to say the least
very cool and even better than that you
can choose between about 12 different
effects in the so-called X spectra
they're all very well made and because
of the mirrors behind the LED lights it
all looks very cool and all of this is
packed inside of a reasonably small
wireless speaker technology has come far
in terms of i/o you've got two ports on
the back one for charging and one if
you'd like to use an aux cable for like
a more stationary use of the halo
perhaps pairing two of them in a desk
set up up top you've got the usual
controls from the
is power volume down play pass and
answer phone calls
next to that button is the microphone
for those aforementioned phone calls
following the microphone the volume up
button and next to that the button to
switch between the twelve lighting modes
if you don't want to use the expect trap
it's also got this fixed strap on its
left side which I guess makes it easier
to hold and not drop it to be honest
I've still got no idea why speakers have
these since I never used them however
I'm sure that there's people out there
using them otherwise they would not be
there so yeah it's just in the way for
me but might not be for you in terms of
battery life they're claiming up to
eight hours which i think is accurate
and that is phenomenal eight hours is
most likely an entire day of music
listening so they have definitely chosen
the right sized battery so how much does
all of this cost six to nine US dollars
now whether that's worth it or not is
definitely up to you guys the consumers
however in my opinion I think it's
sitting at a decent price what I would
have liked to see though is one more
base and two NFC pairing but other than
that the creative halo is a unique well
built quality wireless speaker so what
do you guys think about the creative
halo let me know in the comment section
down below like and subscribe if you
haven't already and I'll see you guys in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
