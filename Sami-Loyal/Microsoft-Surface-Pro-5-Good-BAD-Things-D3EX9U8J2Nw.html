surprised me with how good it actually
is I remember I bought the first surface
two-in-one by Microsoft a couple of
years ago and to be honest with you it
was bad the performance was not good the
keyboard really sucked and the battery
life was just horrendous and eventually
it just died so when Microsoft offered
to lend me their new surface pro for a
review I wanted to see how much they had
improved over these couple of years and
long story short I'm very impressed so
in this video I figured we'll take a
look at fire pros and cons with the
surface pro but before we get into those
let's take a look at the specifications
of the laptop this specific model I have
is equipped with the cobalt blue type
cover it's also the i7 model paired with
16 gigs of ram and a half terabyte SSD
now this specific configuration will
cost you twenty two hundred dollars so
it's definitely not cheap with that said
though let's get started with the five
probes and then get into the find cons
first up is just the overall build and
design and I'm gonna say they have done
a phenomenal job choosing the materials
and designing the surface pro everything
from the stand to the shell of the
laptop itself feels extremely sturdy and
well designed and I really like how the
keyboard when not in use acts like a
really high-quality screen cover and
going from laptop mode to tablet mode is
as simple as just pulling the type cover
off there's no buttons to do it just
pull it off next up is Windows hello for
logging in this is seriously a feature I
think every new Windows laptop should
have it's so easy to use just set it up
once and every time you open the laptop
it'll take you straight to the desktop
in a matter of milliseconds my third Pro
with the surface pro is how well it acts
as a laptop and even though by
definition the surface pro is more of a
tablet it still works very well in
laptop mode with the type cover now
that's thanks to the high quality and
very sturdy stand and also just the fact
that the keyboard and trackpad feels
like they should on a great laptop
the trackpad for example is on par with
my MacBook Pros trackpad which believe
me I haven't been able to say about any
other Windows machine before and the
keyboard has a fairly long channel
distance great quick controls and just a
very nice feel to it
number four on my list is that awesome
display and while it doesn't have the
super thin vessels like on the XPS
laptop from Dell and it isn't 4k or OLED
it looks so good and the touch
functionality works so well don't get me
wrong though it's still got a pretty
high resolution of 27 36 by 1824 and if
you think that resolution seems a bit
weird that's because it has a 3x2 aspect
ratio display which i think is actually
fantastic on a laptop / tablet like this
one number five on my list of
significant pros with the surface pro is
its awesome battery life it really
surprised me how good of a battery life
I got with it even with the highest spec
i7 model and 16 gigs of ram paired to
that awesome display keep in mind also
that the entirety of the computer is
behind the display it doesn't even have
an extra battery inside of the type
cover like for example on the Dell 72 85
s keyboard part has so number wise I got
around 7 to 10 hours of use with the
laptop before it died now that's awesome
so with the pros done let's get into the
cons starting with the port selection it
only has one full size USB port a
headphone jack a mini DisplayPort
and of course the charging port now you
can expand this with a dock that you
connect to the charging port but the
dock is very expensive and you can only
get one dock the one that Microsoft
makes so my ideal port selection would
be something like 2 full size USB ports
a headphone jack an SD card reader and
two USB type-c done about 3 ports and
you could use one of them as a charging
port that would in my opinion be the
ideal port selection for this laptop
next up I would have loved to see
different colors available and I mean
the actual tablet itself and not the
type covers now I do realize that this
is a he
huge nitpick and doesn't matter at all
the surface pro is actually really that
good so I can only complain about these
small things so in terms of color
choices I would love to see in matte
black one is Space Gray one and also the
colors available on the surface laptop
like Burgundy cobalt blue etc next up is
the speakers and while they're not
horrible they're not very good either
so don't expect them to be on the level
of the new MacBook Pros for example my
fourth con with the surface pro is the
camera and inbuilt microphone they kind
of suck and yeah I know most of you
don't care about that and to be honest
with you I don't really either but it's
still a comp now my last con with it is
the price and that's because well to put
it lightly it's not cheap by any means
this model as mentioned before costs a
whopping twenty two hundred dollars and
features a dual-core CPU so as a
conclusion the surface pro is a great 2
in 1 laptop probably even the best one
I've ever used their build quality is
amazing the type cover is great and so
it's battery life
however the port selection is weak and
it has a pretty steep price tag for a
dual-core machine so let me know what
you guys think of the surface pro in the
