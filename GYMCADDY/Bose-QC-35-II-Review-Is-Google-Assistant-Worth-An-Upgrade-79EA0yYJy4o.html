august and the biggest addition to the
bose dc35 2 is google assistant
integration with a few new noise
cancelling headphones on the market of
the bose qc25 2 still King we're about
to find out don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe and you can watch some of
my other videos here after you're done
watching this video the both QC 35 -
coming the same black and silver
colorways as the original post QC 35 the
currently rito for 349 95 like the oj
bose qc25 did when they first released
and knowing bose they will rarely go on
sale and the OG bose qc25 have gotten a
slight price cut to 3 29.95 if you want
to pick either of these headphones up
i'll have links in description below and
i'll keep them up there so you can get
the best deal possible packaging is
identical on the bose qc25 2 so you want
to double check if you've got the right
box if you're buying them at the store
you get a hard shell carrying case on
micro USB cable for charging and an
audio cable but with the bose qc25 2 you
don't get an airplane adapter but it
really shouldn't be a problem because
planes these days either use the
standard audio jack or you can just use
one of the two jacks because the reason
planes have dual audio jacks is for
redundancy on the outside the bose qc25
2 is identical to the original bose qc25
except for the addition of a new button
on the left ear cup and I'll go into
that in a minute
build quality is still top-notch you've
got a stainless steel headband that has
no problem flexing the body panels or
glass filled nylon and are more durable
than plastic panels you've got synthetic
leather on the ear cups in headband and
there's the same Alcantara on the bottom
of the headband that helps a headphone
stay in place when they're in your head
the ear cuffs swivel and pivot
gracefully and the padding is very soft
and stays cooler for longer than other
headphones the best qualities of the
boss CC 35 have always been comfort and
build quality on the right of your cup
you've got the same binds as before
there are two volume control buttons in
a multi-purpose button tap once to play
or pause your music tap twice the
skippers track tap three times to go
back to track and press and call to
activate Siri if you're using them with
an iPhone and the bose qc25 two are
still using bluetooth for that too
so you get the same range of around 40
feet and you can connect up to two
devices at the
same time which is great because it
makes switching from your phone to your
laptop super easy
also for those who plan on using a wide
connection with the boss you see 35 to
just know the headphones themselves have
a 2.5 millimeter jack instead of your
standard 3.5 millimeter jack which will
make replacing boses cheap included
audio cable a little harder but here's
the first problem with most QC 35 - when
other manufacturers release updated
versions of their products they usually
upgrade the battery life but the bull of
CC 35 - still have the same 20 hour
battery life with noise cancellation
turned on like though G boasts QC 35 and
they also had the same quick charging
plug them in for 15 minutes and you
should get about two-and-a-half hours of
playback time and I know some people are
gonna say they should have switched out
the micro USB port for USB type-c port
and I agree when it comes to audio
quality the ballscrew c35 - sound the
same as the og bose qc25 and that's not
a good thing if you ask me sure these
sound good and they have a good amount
of death and the Volkers are good but
there's no bass compared to other
options out there and sometimes the
highs just crash and you can't adjust
the EQ from bosses app so you have to
download a third-party app to do that
and the number one thing I wish the bose
qc25 2 fixed was noise cancellation and
unfortunately they did it like I've said
the past the bose qc25 gives me
headaches and they have a lot of cabin
pressure when noise cancellation is
turned on and after using the sony 1000x
and - which have no cabin pressure you
can feel the difference immediately if
you were expecting performance
improvement on the noise cancellation
there is it so what is different under
both QC 35 - the only difference is the
addition of the new action button on the
left ear cup and google assistant
integration and even if you have an
iPhone you can still enjoy google
assistant all you have to do is go into
the app store and download Google system
what's Tesla stock price Tesla is
trading at 350 dollars and 67 cents a
share after hours down 0.12 percent from
closing its 442 p.m. you
have any recent updates if you click the
action button once Google assistant will
tell you the time and any notifications
you might have if you press and hold the
action button you can talk to Google
assistant and she will respond to you
through the headphones just keep in mind
you have to keep the button pressed down
while you're talking and release when
you're done it's kind of like a walkie
talkie using Google assistant on an
iPhone is limited but you can still use
the multifunction button on the right
ear cup to activate Siri by pressing and
holding so you get two assistants at
your beck and call and personally I like
that because for simple stuff
I know Siri can get it right and for
more complicated questions I like to use
Google who was the president eight years
ago
George W Bush and Barack Obama were both
President of the United States in 2009
who was president eight years ago let's
see what we can't find
here's what I found on the web for who
was president eight years ago have a
look but naturally using Google
assistant with an Android device will be
far superior what's the weather going to
be like in New York City here's the
forecast for New York City it's 5:30
6:00 p.m. you don't have any recent
updates set a timer for five minutes
okay five minutes and here we go what
else can you do here are some things to
try you can say things like navigate to
work or play Hispanic instruments just
swipe to see more suggestions
what's my current battery status sorry
I'm not sure how to help but I'm still
learning show me YouTube results for
Sony 1000 X m2
playing results for Sony 1000 xm2 on
YouTube but if you don't want to use the
action button to activate google
assistant you can also just repurpose
that button to toggle to your active
noise cancellation you've got three
seconds to choose from there's high
where the headphones will block out
everything there's low where the
headphones will let in a good amount of
noise in but it will still filter out
noise pollution like the whirling of an
AC unit and then there's off but keep in
mind you can still toggle through the
noise cancellation settings directly
from boses app on both the new both UC
35 2 and the older boss QC 35 and here's
the test of the microphone on the boss
PC to b-52 I think it sounds pretty good
sure we gonna be taking phone calls with
the headphones on that shouldn't be a
problem but honestly I see no reason to
upgrade from the bose qc25
to the bose qc25 2 if you're trying to
choose between the two models I say just
get the o.g bose qc25 save yourself 20
bucks and go have yourself a nice lunch
bullets should have taken this
opportunity to improve their battery
life improve their noise cancellation
and improve their sound quality because
everybody else did but instead they
slapped on a button and called it a day
and honestly if bose is so eager to jump
into the voice of system gain protective
just achieved the same thing by pressing
and holding the multi-purpose button
maybe the biggest change to the bose
qc25 2 might be the PCB so it can handle
google assistant but it still looks like
all the processing takes place on your
mobile device
so I wonder if the original bose qc25
can also get a google assistant
integration and if so is bose just
keeping that feature behind the paywall
