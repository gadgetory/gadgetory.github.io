of technology of 2017 this little guy is
an extremely durable and easy to fly
entry-level drone and through software
updates is going better but more
importantly and now has some epic new
picture capture modes aside from just
giving you a six month later review I
really want to touch on these new
picture modes because it just makes the
sport that much more of an awesome
product one of the reasons I really like
the DJI spark is because it's so small
you can take it with you anywhere and
since it's so small you can fly it
indoors but it's still more than capable
enough to fly outdoors even in windy
conditions and it does all of this while
looking like a toy which is clearly not
and the best part is you can actually
get it on sale right now for as low as
$350 if you want to pick the dj's buck
up I'll have a link at the description
below and if you use the link it really
helps out the channel and if you want to
learn more about the DJI spark you can
watch my full review any versus video
against the DJI phantom 3 by tapping on
the eye icon on the top right first
let's go over the coolest new feature on
the spark and - 360 degree images all
you have to do is fly this part to where
you want it and press it take the
picture and then the spark will slowly
do a 360-degree spend almost a
convertible pictures for various pitch
angles the process itself does take
about a minute and a half and it does
drain the battery pretty quickly but
after the process is completed you just
go into the DJI app and stitch all the
images together and to be honest with
you I was blown away at how good the
image came out because I was worried
since it was so windy and the spark
can't move in from where it initially
started the process that the image was
going to be this incoherent mess but as
you can see by the final result it's not
and through the app you can adjust the
image and zoom in on any particular
point you'd like unfortunately you can't
share this 360-degree image on social
media and let your followers manipulate
the photo however they like you can only
show people how awesome your 360 degree
pictures are directly from your phone
but since drones are becoming
increasingly more popular I imagine it's
only a matter of time social media
platforms will integrate such
functionality but the DJI spark does
have four other new picture modes that
are definitely much more useful for
social media lights and just overall
great picture taking
normally when you take a picture with
the spark you're going to end up with an
image with a 3x2 aspect ratio
certain subjects in an image might not
get captured cause of the narrow field
of view but now you can take horizontal
or vertical panoramas and either of
these modes is great for capturing epic
landscape shots or pictures of tall
objects and just like the spherical
images when you tad to take the picture
the spark will fly in place and take
multiple pictures from various angles
and stitch them together but unlike the
360 degree pictures these modes take
much less time they think about 15
seconds to complete now the spark also
has a 180 degree panorama mode but I
personally think this is the least
useful of the new picture modes all it
does is that it gets a little more of a
wider shot than the horizontal panorama
but with a lot more warping and you
can't go in and readjust the image like
you can with the 360 degree picture so I
personally see no point of this picture
mode now just like every other phone
that's been released this year the DJI
spark now also has a portrait mode and
basically when you take a picture the
spark will take two images from two
perspectives and mesh them together and
through the CGI app you can manually
select what you want to be in focus and
how much of a bokeh effect you want well
let me tell you it's not as good as the
iPhone 10 iPhone 8 + or pixel to excel
so don't get your hopes up but hopefully
it could get better through future
software updates because right now the
blur effect around the subject in focus
isn't consistent on the edges either it
misses the edges or goes over too much
so those are the new features I want to
talk about the spark because I honestly
think it really helps make the spark
that much of a better product and with
these new picture mode I'm going to be
more inclined to take more stills with
the spark because up until now 99% of
the time that I flew my drone it was a
capture video and that's because the
spark does a really good job of
recording very smooth video through a
combination of digital image
stabilization through the use of its two
axis gimbal system and the drone itself
does a really good job of automatically
compensating for wind that otherwise
would ruin your shot and what the spark
you can shoot up to 1080p 30 frames per
second video but the biggest drawback of
using this spark in general is its
overall size even though the spark does
a really good job of counteracting
random gusts of wind if it's too windy
then it's almost impossible to keep the
drone stable and get good quality video
that's the price you pay for using such
a small drone another price you pay for
using such a small drone
is the battery life the spark will
typically last 250 minutes of flight
time and to fully charge this battery
it's going to take about 80 minutes but
even after six months of heavy usage the
intelligent battery on the DJI spark
still manages to perform just as well as
when I first got it just as long as you
take proper care of it but still if you
plan on flying a lot with the spark I
recommend you get a second battery now
what I don't recommend you go out in
India right away with the spark is the
optional controller which usually
retails for one hundred and fifty
dollars and is sold separately in my
opinion it's overkill given what the
spark is really intended for and epic
selfie machine by default you can
control the spark through the DJI Go app
on your phone and with your phone alone
you can get a range of about 300 feet
which is more than enough for a lot of
people the controls are responsive and
through practice you'll learn how to
control the spark with a good amount of
precision and be able to get some great
shots if you want to get the controller
so you can fly the spark out up to 1.2
miles then I recommend you just get two
Matic pro or a phantom three because
with the 15-minute flight time the spark
has to offer you're not going to get
four but I do want to give you an
important heads up if you do plan on
getting a DJI spark make sure your phone
is able to smoothly run the DJI Go app
without freezing or crashing because if
not you do run the risk of losing
control of your drone mid-flight it
almost happened to me since my primary
phone right now is an iPhone 6s plus and
since we now know Apple deliberately
slows down all the phones to protect its
battery and almost cost me a drone
because I wasn't having this problem
early on the summer the app fro is and
since the last input was a hard write
the spark kept flying through the right
until it reestablish a connection and
stopped even though the spark does have
a 3d sensing system on the front and a
vision positioning system on its belly
which admittedly have saved me from
multiple crashes you're still prone to
crashing into stuff from the side or if
the spark is flying backwards but even
if the spark does suffer from the harsh
crash it does not care as long as the
propellers are intact you can fly I've
even flown my spark with cracked
propellers multiple times when a lot of
people get their first drone they're
worried they're going to crash it and
destroy it but that's not the case with
this point it's built like a tank and
that's why it's a great for a strong for
anybody is bad
price point it's so easy to fly it can
even fly on its own through active
tracking you can tap to fly or he can
even just use gesture controls to fly it
although gesture controls aren't always
perfect I have found that it's a great
way to take a quick selfie with a group
of friends on the fly and then call it
back and get back to whatever you were
doing but still gesture controls aren't
always perfect so you usually better off
just flying your drone manually and plus
you can probably position your shot but
it's still a cool option nonetheless
hands down the DJI spark is still the
best entry-level drama market right now
especially if you can get it on sale
it's easy to fly you can take it
anywhere it's super durable and it takes
some great pictures and video the new
panoramic picture modes on the spark
allow you to capture some breathtaking
images that otherwise aren't possible
unless you buy some specific equipment
that cost more than the spark itself if
you've been thinking about getting the
spark get it it's a great zone to learn
how to fly with and once you've mastered
it you'll be able to get some cinematic
shots with it but once you've outgrown
it you can upgrade to a more capable
drone and rock out right out of the box
but obviously for the DCI spark - I
would like to see improved battery life
a 3-axis gimbal system and maybe
obstacle avoidance sensors to the size
and to the way of the drone hey if you
