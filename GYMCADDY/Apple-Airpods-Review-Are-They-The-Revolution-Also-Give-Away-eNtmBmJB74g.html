even after the general disappointment
the Apple earpods are finally here now
this isn't going to be your usual
earpods review where everyone bashes the
design and says the same joke by
comparing the air pods to a case of
dental floss nope I'm better than that
and I can come up with my own material
so what's the weight worth it was me
chasing down the UPS man for my ear pods
is justified or are the ear pods Batman
V Superman dawn of Justice levels of
disappointment let's find out you know
what if this video gets a thousand likes
I'll give these away to one of you for a
chance to win just like comment and
subscribe and I'll DM a winner on
January 31st ok first let's get the
unboxing out of the way packaging here
is standard Apple white box product
picture on the front open the box and
you'll find some documentation under
that front and center is the earpods
carrying / charging case under that
there's a lightning cable but no wall
wart kind of wish it came with a wall
wart now this is where other people
would drop the dental-floss joke but to
be honest I'm kind of a fan of the case
the lid is securely sealed and it's
satisfying when you open it it also
doesn't create a large bulge or anything
once in your pocket the air pod case
design and satisfaction when I open it
reminds me of when it was cool to always
have a zipper lighter on you at all
times
matter of fact I wouldn't mind a
stainless-steel air pod case Oh
or better yet what if deep and made a
skin for then deep breath give me a call
inside the cases where the air pods and
stuff live and charge back up there
magnetically kept in place where you
won't have to worry about them popping
out when you open the case this is the
flaw to Samsung gear iconic suffer from
the air Paz himself have a slightly
thicker and longer stem then your wire
ear pods but hey you have to cram all
that courage somewhere if you're like me
and you never had an issue with the air
pod staying in your ears then the air
pods will fit you just fine but if ear
pods never stay in place for you then
you're going to have the same issues
with the air pod so do the air pause
fall out when you do vigorous exercise
I'm sorry to say but yes if you're
looking for a while as earbuds to work
out with these aren't for you they're
not even in water or dust resistant if
you're here looking for a wireless
earbuds for the gym then check out the J
Brand X 3 or power beats 3 links to the
reviews are in the description the air
pods have apples Boone w1 chip which can
also be found in the beats solo 3 power
beats three and the soon-to-be-released
fingers crossed beats X the w1 chip
allows for
with any iPhone running iOS 10 all you
have to do is open the case wait till
the card pops up and click connect and
right there your phone's are now
connected to all of your Apple products
associated with the same iCloud account
this means you can listen to music with
your ear pods with your iPhone and then
seamlessly start listening to music from
your iPad or MacBook just change the
source on your device and that's it the
w1 chip also allows for a very strong
wireless connection with your device's
that can go through multiple walls as
well as a longer battery life if you
want to pair them to non Apple devices
and you can connect them via bluetooth
by pressing and holding the button on
the back of the carrying case but to be
honest if you're not using the air pods
with an Apple device then there's really
no point so how do they sound while the
Apple earpods sounds slightly better
than the ear pods which is a little
ironic because I would have thought
having a wireless connection instead of
a wired one would reduce audio fidelity
the base is punchy but the highs are a
little distorted but overall the dynamic
range of the ear pods is slightly better
than the ear pods slightly concerning
battery life each our pod has an
internal battery that should last five
hours if they're one at a juice to
charge in case can charge up the
earphones back for a total of 24 hours
of use time even if you place the ear
pods in their case for just 15 minutes
you get a total of 3 hours of playback
time which is kind of like the power
beats 3 which gets you one hour of
playback time from 5 minutes of charging
and in order to charge up the case
itself you just have to plug in the
landing cable into the port on the
bottom there's also an indicator light
inside the case which tells you when the
ear pods charging fun fact if you open
your ipod case while it's connected to
the charger your iPhone will tell you
the ear pod and case battery status it's
a nice touch when the ear plugs are both
placed in New Year's they play stereo
sound if you only have one ear pod in
the ear it'll play model sound instead
and if you take out an ear pod from your
ear it'll automatically pause your music
by tapping on the ear pod
twice you can either activate Siri or
pause your music depending on your
settings the tap recognition is very
accurate and much better than Samsung
gear icon Nexus since there is no inline
controller to control your music
playback all that has to go through Siri
now which can be a little annoying since
it's making what were one simple task
like play pausing skipping or going back
a track more tedious here's an idea how
when you have both air pods in your ear
double tapping the left ear pod activate
Siri single tapping the right ear pod
plays or pauses you music double tapping
the right ear pod skip subtract and
triple tapping the right ear pod goes
back a track you know because the ear
pods has its inline controller on the
right side hey it's just an idea but
Timmy kook give me a call I'll help you
for example so the ear pods an
all-around capable and versatile pair of
wireless earphones no I believe Apple
has a certain consumer in mind for each
of his wilds earphone models which I
will go into detail in a later video
the air pots are a great option for any
young professional that works in an
office setting who wants to listen to
music while they work I found that
having truly wireless earphones is a
great luxury especially if you wear
multiple layers like I do since I'm a
New Yorker not having your earbud snag
on your coat or scarf is sort of
liberating and I know it's the first of
all problems
so should you run out and get them nah
but if you're interested in them and
have the money to spend then pick them
up if you're going to use them while you
work or chill at home hey if you made it
