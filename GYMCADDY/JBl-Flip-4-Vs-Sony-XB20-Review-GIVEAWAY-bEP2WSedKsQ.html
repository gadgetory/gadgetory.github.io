video I've made yet so look at to it JBL
six four versus the Sony XP 20 these are
both small bluetooth speakers and if
you're going off to college in the next
few weeks
having a portable Bluetooth speaker like
these is pretty clutch so which is right
for you let's find out nobody it's like
comment and subscribe
matter of fact I'm going to do a
giveaway if this video gets over five
thousand likes I also liked one winner
and send them their choice of speaker
just be subscribed like the video to
share the video and comment below and
tell me which album you'll know
signature right now right now I'm pretty
hooked on jay-z's 444 album so both of
these speakers retail for $100 and
becoming various colorways the JBL flip
4 was released earlier in the year and
comes in black blue gray red teal and
white the sony xba-40 and red i wish
they made a griever zhm like the XB 950
n1 headphones i think that would look
really sick if you want to pick either
of these speakers up I'll have links in
the description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deals
possible size-wise these speakers are
very similar but the sony xba-1
difference is basically negligible
you can only lay the sony xba-4 the
table 54 gives you the option to also
stand it on its side they both have a
micro USB port in oxygen on the back
both of these speakers have control
blinds and they are very easy to use and
have great tactile feedback you control
your music playback adjust the volume
answer and end calls and even activate
series from either of these speakers but
oddly enough you can't go back a track
on the JBL flip 4 by triple press into
triangle button but you can go back a
track up to Sony XP 20 by triple
pressing the play pause button it's not
a big deal but it is a minor annoyance
both of these speakers have soft touch
rubber on them but the JBL 54 has a
nylon mesh wave covering the majority of
the body while the Sony expert wen T has
a painted metal grille in front of it
speakers although the metal grille looks
great I'm afraid that if you bump it too
much it'll get dented and the panel chip
but for the same price of the JBL flip
for it
Sonne XP 20 also has a lighter feature
it can't change colors like the larger
XP 30 or the XP 40 but it does look good
while concerning durability it's gonna
have to go to the JBF it for also the
debut look for has a nylon rope too so
you can just tie to a backpack if you're
taking it on to go it's actually come in
handy and the JBL 54 also has the little
battery gauge on the back so you can see
your current battery status at a glance
next b20 doesn't have a fuel gauge so
you have to press and hold the phone
line on the top to get over burrito
both of these speakers compared to other
speakers in the respective product
lineups the foot four can connect to
other JBL connect plus enabled speakers
and the sony xba-40 speakers you can
connect up to 10 speakers together and
you can connect up to 100 JBL speakers
together obviously you're not going to
pair 100 JBL speakers together but it'd
be pretty cool if you did concerning the
tech inside both of these speakers are
using bluetooth for that too so you can
be paired to multiple devices at one
time and it makes switching between
devices super easy but the range on
these speakers is very different the
Sony expedient of around 40 feet and the
connection will struggle if there are
multiple walls between you and your
phone the JBL 4 4 on the other hand has
a range of around a hundred feet and i
notice it takes more walls between the
foot 4 and your phone to actually cause
any connection issues battery life is
also very different between the XB 20
and the JBL foot 4 in my testing i some
the XB 20 had a nine hour battery life
with the music set at 50% volume the
lights show on and the extra bass
feature turned on too if you listen to
the SB 20 at a low volume with the light
feature turned off you'll be able to
squeeze out a 12 hour battery life
JBL on the other hand over delivers they
advertise a battery life of 12 hours but
i usually get a solid 14 or 15 hours out
of my JBL before both of these speakers
charge via a micro USB cable so you
don't have to worry about any
proprietary cables on either of these
speakers both of these speakers aren't
afraid of a little water one of these
speakers will be fine if you splash them
but the sony XP
while the JBL 54 is ipx7 certified this
means the JBL 54 can be submerged
underwater without any issues while the
XP 20
now when it comes to sound quality
wasn't a speaker sound really good both
speakers only shoot out down to the
front although at first glance you might
think the JBL flip 4 has 360 degree
sound but it doesn't the Jay Buford 4
has passive radiators on either side of
the device that delivers crisp and
powerful bass next b20 has a small
opening on the back of the device that
lets out a little bit too but the funny
thing is even though the sony xba-4 bass
feature the JBL stretch for actually has
a little bit more bass than the XP 20
which is a little ironic but when it
comes to sound quality I have to give it
to the Sony XP 20 it just sounds crisper
does less distortion when the volume is
cranked all the way up the soundstage is
wider and there's the depth to music
that I feel Sony does very well but then
again this is just stuff that you'll be
able to notice if you can listen to
these speakers back-to-back like I can
lots of these speakers also have
companion apps that let you update the
speaker many settings and help you
through the setup process when pairing
multiple speakers together you really
don't need to use JBL companion app
damage but Sony's app is a little
different Sony's app allows you to
switch between eq s and you can adjust
the light feature on XP 20 you can pick
between rave chill and strobe personally
I like to keep my on chill because I
think it looks the best so when it comes
down to it which did you get even though
I really liked the sony xba-40 cool I
know the majority of the people will be
better off with the JBL 6 for the JBL
support is only more durable has a
longer range has a much longer battery
life and side 2 x7 certified I might not
be the biggest fan of JBL headphones but
they make some really great speakers
