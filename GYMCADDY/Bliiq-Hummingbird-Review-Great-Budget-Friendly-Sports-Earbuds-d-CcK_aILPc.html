videos besides earpods
I still prefer to use wired Bluetooth
earbuds for working out at the gym like
the power beats 3 or the J products for
because they usually have a longer
battery life do a Bluetooth connection
is more stable they cost less and they
have an inline controller and the guys
wear oblique seem to agree cuz they sent
out their hummingbird Bluetooth earbuds
for testing and were awesome enough to
sponsor today's video and honestly these
are a really good pair of
budget-friendly earbuds for working out
the oblique hummingbirds come in a black
or white colourway in the retail for $68
but there's also a red colorway like the
one I have here but that one we toast
for is $74 but you know me if there's a
red option then most likely I'm gonna go
with that one if you want to pick these
earbuds up I'll have links in
description down below first let's go
over what comes in the box cuz there's a
lot EE coming birds come included with a
hard shell carrying case that
magnetically latches up so you're not
gonna have to worry about these earbuds
if you throw them into your gym bag and
they also come included with a micro USB
cable for charging the hummingbirds also
come included with a total of eight
pairs of silicone ear tips these are
standard round ones that come included
with most of their earbuds and these are
the ones that I personally like to use
but there's also round and Conal by
flames ear tips for people who want a
more secure fit and finally the
hummingbirds also come included with a
lifetime warranty so if they
unexpectedly stopped playing music or if
the battery dies Bleek has you covered
personally for working out I've always
preferred wireless earbuds with an ear
hook design because no matter what you
do they'll always stay in place even
though your fins do do a decent job of
staying in place as well I found that
they're not as foolproof as having a
full on ear hook and that's one of the
reasons why I liked a hummingbird so
much their ear hook design keeps them in
place no matter if I'm this Mantic from
a pull-up bar or if I'm doing my morning
cardio on the treadmill and in general
the hummingbirds fit me like a glove
they're very lightweight so you hardly
notice when they're in and there's a
cinch on cable which you can tie in if
you want an even more secure fit another
thing I really like about the
hummingbirds is their battery life they
have an advertiser's battery life of 14
and a half hours and
me I can go five full workouts in
between charges with these earbuds which
four wireless earbuds like these that's
a lot because the power beats three are
good for about four workouts and the
hummingbirds also have fast charging if
you plug them in for 10 minutes from a
dead battery they're gonna get you one
hour of playback time now like I
mentioned at the beginning of this video
one of the main reasons why I still
prefer to use wired Bluetooth earbuds
like these is cause of their connection
stability something that I feel truly
wireless sports earbuds still struggle
with and the hummingbirds have a stable
connection that doesn't cut out it can
go through multiple walls and they
actually have very little latency so
they're pretty good for watching YouTube
videos on your phone but the biggest
reason why I still prefer to use a wired
Bluetooth earbuds at the gym is because
of the inline controller like some
people who refuse to give up on the
headphone jacks on phones I refuse to
give up on inline controllers with an
inline controller you're able to fully
control your music playback without
having to use your phone or voice
assistant for simple stuff like
adjusting the volume pausing your music
or skipping through your tracks and the
inline controller on the hummingbird is
very good the buttons are very well laid
out and they have a lot of tactile
feedback which I wish more ear buds had
these days but something that not a lot
of earbuds have that the hummingbirds do
is an ambient mode if you double press
the center button twice then the earbuds
will polish your music and pump in all
of the ambient sound so you can talk to
someone without her my take your earbuds
out and this feature does come in handy
if someone at the gym ask you a question
like how many steps you have left or if
you'll spot them on their next left and
when it comes to sound quality the
hummingbirds have a neutral sound
signature their basis in as exaggerator
like to power beats 3 but it's still
present they also get significantly loud
but I found that with a proper seal you
never really have to go above 90 percent
volume with these earbuds so overall I
feel doubly hummingbirds are a solid
pair of budget-friendly
earbuds for working out they bring a lot
of value for the price the very
lightweight and their ear hook design
makes sure they stay in place at all
times no matter how intentional workout
gets they have a very long battery life
for a while this year but so you can go
multiple workouts without Hamlet charge
them and their Bluetooth connection is
just as stable as more expensive
Bluetooth earbuds
and given with the fact that Bleek gives
you a lifetime warranty that's a very
nice added bonus if you made it this far
