JBL extreme - to get here I thought we
should take a quick look at the new clip
3 because it was announced back at CES
2018 alongside the extreme - and to be
honest I was pleasantly surprised by
this ultra portable speaker here's what
I like and what I don't like about the
new clip 3 and how the sound compares to
the outgoing clip - and the war course
that is the for the new JBL clip 3
currently retails for 59.95 and comes in
a whole bunch of different colors and
the outgoing clip 2 is now on sale for
$39.99 now I just want to get this out
there really quickly if you're trying to
decide between the clip 3 and the 4 4
just get the flip 4 if you have the
budget for it the clip 3 is really for
someone who just wants something ultra
portable if you want to pick either
three speakers up I'll have links to
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel I
suggest you check them out cos JBL
speakers routinely go on sale so you
might be lucky
design-wise there are some significant
changes on the clip 3 from the clip to
the clip 3 is slightly larger and
thicker than the outgoing clip to the
clip 3 still has the same fabric mesh on
the front of the body as the clip 2 but
the clip 3 now has raised control
buttons on the front which I've grown to
prefer over the side buttons on the clip
to the new button send the clip 3 make
it much easier to know what you're
pressing without having to look but
there are two major differences between
the clip 2 and clip 3 that I want to
point out first up the actual clip on
the clip 3 is slightly smaller than the
clip on the clip 2 so I did find the
clip 2 ahead an easier time let's move
on to more things than the clip 3 it's
not a huge deal but I just like to
nitpick also the clip 3 no longer has a
built-in audio cable like the clip 2 but
since having an audio jack or phone
these days is considered a feature I
don't think it's a big deal for smaller
speakers like these but the clip 3 still
has an audio jack so you can just use
your own cable if you really want to use
a wide connection to save on battery
life and just like the clip to the clip
3 still charges via a micro USB port
regarding battery life
JBL advertises about a life of 10 hours
on the clip 3 which is a two hour
improvement from the
outgoing clip - in my testing I was able
to hit ten I was - playback time on the
clip three but with the volume set at
50% with the volume set at 80% the clip
3 managed to hit five and a half hours
of playback time and with the volume set
at 100% the clip 3 managed a three hours
of playback time which is not bad for
this little guy we're going to speaker
set up the clip three has a single
upward firing forty minute transducer
just like the outgoing clip - and as a
result the clip 3 is of very directional
speaker the clip 3 is also using
bluetooth 4.1 and I found the connection
was pretty solid and having a single
wallet - between the speaker and my
phone didn't cause any stuttering issues
I also notice Lillian C was pretty low
so I would recommend the speaker for
watching youtube videos and the clip 3
is also
ipx7 rated so it's not afraid a little
little water and it also floats
the back of the station
aha
a slightly updated design and slightly
better battery life the biggest
improvement on the clip 3 from the clip
2 is just the overall sound quality the
clip 3 just sounds clearer and there's
more bass in the clip 3 doesn't sound
muddy like the clip 2 does and I also
notice the clip 3 gets significantly
louder than the clip 2 but like I said
at the beginning of this video if you
have the budget to get the flip or just
get the flip for it because the clip 3
doesn't sound nearly as good as a flip
for for obvious reasons even though the
clip 3 is a pretty good improvement over
the clip 2 there is one major setback
and that the clip 3 does not have JBL
connect + so you can't pair a clip 3 to
any other JBL speaker and I think this
is just a huge mistake because the bose
sound like micro which is a speaker of
comparable size to the clip 3 can be
chained to any other Bose speaker
granted it does cost significantly more
than the clip 3 but I do feel the clip 3
should have came included with JBL
connect plus ok and here's the
microphone test and it's not the worst
microphone but I want to take this but
this audio clip is being recorded by the
microphone on the jvo of 3
but overall JBL is ultra portable clip 3
is a pretty good improvement over the
clip - blue - latency has been reduced
battery life has been improved and the
clip 3 sounds significantly better than
the clip to the clip 3 is a good little
speaker if you want something small and
rugged for personal listening for when
you go out hiking I've also seen a lot
of people jr. a clip 2 so the handlebars
when they go out it's cycling and I
expect the same for the clip 3 but if
you're someone like me who likes to
shower with the music or podcasts
playing in the background then the clip
3 can get the job done easily if you
made it this far I guess you enjoyed the
video so hit that like button and get
subscribed it helps out more than you
