first Google assistant interpreter smart
speaker I mentioned how I really like
the Google home Mini and the Google home
acts but I'm not really a big fan of the
original Google home and the longer I've
owned my Google mini the more I've grown
to like it especially because it just
keeps evolving so here's a pretty little
review on the Google home Mini and a few
new features you might not know I
actually picked on my Google home Mini
during the holiday season for 30 bucks
but the Google home Mini usually retails
for $50 and I haven't seen a go back to
that $30 range since Christmas a lot of
people might still be a little nervous
of bringing in a smart speaker into
their home because they don't want to be
spied on but either way if you use any
of Google's services in any way shape or
form or any other form of social media
like Facebook or Instagram these
companies already have a lot of
information on you whether you know it
or not so my reason and when I first got
my smart speakers was if these companies
already have a ton of information on me
anyways
might as well get a smart speaker so
they can foster my laziness even more
now here's a quick rundown of the Google
mini regarding hardware it's tiny it's
slightly bigger than hockey puck and I
think that if you get the black version
it's going to disappear in most rooms
the top is covered in fabric and there's
a lot of rubber on the base so this
thing isn't going to be moving a lot on
the back doors to make USB port for
power and make news to it unfortunately
there's no object so you can't hook up
the mini to a better speaker and play
music and this is shame because even
though the 40 millimeter upward firing
speaker is decent for passive listening
I would really like to be able to hook
up my mini to my JBL boombox
but I guess Google needs a reason to
sell youth or Google home Max or a
chromecast the mini also comes with a
premium feeling power cable which has a
pretty small plug and it's a very decent
length when smart speakers first came
out there were really only good for
asking them arbitrary questions like how
tall is the president what's the weather
like and controlling your smart light
bulbs if you had them but as these
speakers have progressed you can ask
them to do more complex tasks like talk
to other applications or hang stuff
online making phone calls and their
voice recognition can even tell
different people apart personally I
really like talking to crypto prices so
I can either cheer myself up or get
really upset for a few minutes and I
really like the call function because
after all
long editing session I could just have
mini call my local deli so I can get a
takeout order already without having to
stop what I'm doing on the computer
hey cool talks are crypto prices sure
here's crypto prices high which
cryptocurrency would you like the price
for like coin the current price of light
coin is one hundred sixty four dollars
and 34 cents hey what's the weather for
New York City today in New York City
today it'll be partly cloudy with a
forecasted high of 46 and a low of 33
right now it's 41 and partly cloudy
we'll call games up calling game stuff
thank you for bowling game stuff where
you can get the hottest new videogame
consoles and collectibles for less get
the best deals when you trade it you're
holding up now when the Google home Mini
was first released there was a problem
where if you press the center of the
mini to manually activate your assistant
like you do in the original Google home
after the mini answered your question or
did whatever it is you asked it to do it
just kept recording everything and this
was a huge problem because Google smart
speakers are only supposed to be
listening to your voice when the
notification lights are on and Google
said that this was a hardware issue so
Google got rid of the touch controls on
the Mini at lunch but now if you tap on
the sides of the meaning you can adjust
the volume and if you press and hold on
either side you can play or pause your
music but unfortunately you can't
manually skip a track or activate your
voice assistant all this has to be done
through voice commands
I want the credit Hey roleplay and set
volume to 75% obviously if you're
picking up a Google home Mini you're not
looking for an amazing sound quality but
here's a quick little sound test
yeah the many cell quality is amazing
but if I'm doing research I might ask it
to play something for background music
what I really do like using my mini for
though is how do they play white noise
while I'm editing my videos it really
helps cut down on distractions but many
also helps make me more efficient while
I'm getting my work done I can ask it
for unit conversions up fly I can ask it
to spell or define a certain hoard and I
can also have it's a timer so I can
better manage my time and even for me
someone who talks pretty fast the mini
doesn't have a problem hearing me or
understanding what I said even when I
wake up in the morning and I'm just
mumbling my words the mini clearly
understands when I tell it's just news
my alarm it's not like the Xbox one
where you really have to enunciate your
words in order for it to understand you
and still it's only good 50% of the time
and even if you're talking very softly
at a distance the Mini has no problem
hearing you that's why I made my own
routine for when I get up at night to
use the bathroom or if I say night late
to my mini it'll set my lamp to 50%
brightness and I don't have to worry
about disturbing anyone else in the
house like I mentioned in my last video
I really don't see a need for the
original Google home since it doesn't
sound good for listening to music it's
really just a plus size will go home
many to me because I strictly use it for
voice commands so if you're trying to
decide between the two I highly advise
you just get the mini and avoid
overpaying I really feel Google needs to
release a second generation Google home
with a much better sound quality for
fifty dollars the Mini is great for what
it is and the convenience it offers but
I would really like to see an ox check
so I can plug in my own speaker and I
would like to get rid of my curious B
port and throw into USB C ports one for
power and one so I can charge up my
future pixel 3 Excel
