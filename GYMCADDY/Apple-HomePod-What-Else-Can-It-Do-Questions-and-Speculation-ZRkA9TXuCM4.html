the comment section of my first
impressions video of apples you home pod
it's super cool but there are a few
questions surrounding Apple's new home
pod concerning how will it work and what
exactly can you do with it outside of
listening to music that Apple has
conveniently left unanswered
now I'm not hating on the home pod we've
got to see how it does when it's
released in December but these are my
top seven questions concerning the Apple
home pod
if you have any questions of your own
comment below and let's keep the
discussion going and please hit that
like button first up is connectivity
reporters I got a first look at the home
pod after Apple's WWDC keynote got some
good up-close-and-personal video in
those videos you can clearly see there's
only one cable going out of the home pod
the power cable but I didn't see any USB
ports or auxiliary ports on the whole
pod granted the port's might be hidden
on the bottom of the device but
interestingly enough Apple site makes no
mention of device having either of those
ports I'm just saying
having either of those ports might be
important what if I wanted to use my
home pod as an external speaker for my
iMac pro and I wanted to use a wide
connection because I wanted to get the
best sound quality from whatever I'm
playing off on my computer and the same
goes with my TV also Apple site makes no
mention of the home pod having bluetooth
so how's it going to connect to your
phone and please don't sing magic under
the wireless specs it says that the
speaker has a toe 2011 a BGM AC y5 of
Nemo so will I be able to connect non
Apple devices to the home pod or is the
whole plan going to be exclusive for
Apple devices if you're just
communicating with the home pod over
Wi-Fi does that mean if your Wi-Fi is
down then you can't use your home pod
and what about streaming services
obviously it'll work with Apple music
but can you use Spotify or any other
service cuz I have an iPhone but I'm a
huge fan of Google Play because you get
to stream all the music you want you can
store music locally and you get a
subscription to YouTube red which means
you can watch YouTube videos at free or
low supporting creators and can you
store music locally on the home pod
because again if the Wi-Fi is slow or
down or you're just out in an area with
Wi-Fi how are you going to play music
the home pod has no connection also what
about the wake word if you have multiple
Apple devices and you say hey Siri are
they all going to activate or is Siri
going to be smart enough to know if your
iPhone is connected to your home Wi-Fi
default to the home pod but what if your
home and your home pod is in the living
room and you're in your bedroom with
your iPhone and you say hey actually
Siri just went off like I was saying if
you're in your bedroom with your iPhone
and you say hey Siri to your iPhone is
the home pot in the living room going to
start talking or is Siri going to be
smart enough to know you're in a
different room in your house and should
default to your iPhone the simple
solution is just using the mic to
determine which device should activate
but what if you're standing near both
devices and you want to activate a
specific one and are you going to be
able to connect multiple applicants to
your home pot because Apple made it very
clear they want to make the home part of
your music ologists so if I say hey Siri
DJ for me I'm going to expect it to
start playing rap easy and hip-hop or
R&amp;amp;B
but if my dad comes over and says hey
Siri DJ for me he's going to expect some
completely different music and if I say
hey Siri at so-and-so event to my
calendar I'm going to expect that event
to go on my calendar and not someone
else's or the home pod going to be
locked to just want to count
steer clear I'm recording also what
about the spatial awareness well the
home pot automatically know where it is
or are you going to have to calibrate it
yourself and what if you move in are you
going to have to recalibrate it again
because with my Xbox one if I move the
position of the camera I have to
recalibrate it every single time or else
the voice commands won't work also what
about ordering stuff online with the
echo I can say hey Alexa order five
pounds of flamin hot cheetos and it will
order that from Amazon for me I'm not
saying I do but it's a hypothetical
those apples and Amazon New Deal go a
little deeper than just having Amazon
Prime video on the Apple TV will you be
able to pair your Amazon account to your
home pod and order stuff with the sound
of your voice or less likely is Apple
going to jump into e-commerce and start
selling stuff online - I doubt it look
Apple has never been first up releasing
their products they
or in first wind II really thought mp3
player they were in first when they
released or smartphone they were in
first when they release or tablet they
were in first when they released or
small ones and now they were in first
when they release or smart speaker but
they always took their time so they
could deliver the best user experience
ever Apple is going all-in on music
consumption when it comes to the home
bot in new information and changes will
come until Apple's home pod is released
in December unless it gets laid and
until then we won't get the answers
we're looking for but it sure is fun to
speculate hey if you enjoyed the video
