one X. Today Xbox held their E3 conference
and they wasted no time showing off their
Xbox One X, its capabilities and a whole bunch
of up coming titles. The Xbox One X is even
smaller than the Xbox One S, has a matte black
finish and its due for release this November
7th. It's going to be backwards compatible
even with OG Xbox games when the program launches
later this year(digital downloads, not disks),
it's so powerful it uses liquid cooling which
is a first for home consoles, runs at a native
4K at 60 frames per second and Xbox made it
very clear this is the smallest and most powerful
console they have ever made. And it's going
to retail $499 this fall. Comment below, would
you buy it for $500? and don't forget to like
and subscribe!
A quick technical run down of the Xbox One
X... it has a 6 Tera flop GPU, 2.3 GHz custom
CPU, 1 terabyte of storage, 12 gigabytes of
GDDR5 memory, and 326 gigabytes pre second
memory bandwidth. All of this means you will
get smoother game play, bigger worlds thanks
to the added memory, life like detail, and
faster load times. 
Even current titles that are out now will
be getting free updates so they can run at
4K. So games you have now will still get better
if you play them with an Xbox one x. But even
though the Xbox One X is really pushing 4K
gaming really hard, even people who don't
have a 4K tv can still benefit from the Xbox
One X power. People who use a 1080p tv with
this console will still get faster load times
and games will look better regardless. But
Honestly, if you invest in an Xbox One X you’ve
got to pick up a 4K TV.
Now don't get confused, the Xbox one X isn't
a next generation console... it's simply an
improved version of their Xbox one. Obviously
it can do every thing the Xbox one S can do
like play 4K UHD content, it supports HDR,
and has a wider color gamut. But unlike the
xbox One S, the Xbox one x can upscale older
games to 4K UHD,and can produce higher quality
images on 1080 p screens. 
But sadly, Xbox made no mention of VR on the
Xbox one X today. Which was a bit of a disappointment.
With the Xbox one X's sheer power I thought
Xbox was going to show off  VR at least a
little. I mean, even apple showed off VR on
their Imac at wwdc. And with PlayStation's
VR selling so well, at least that's what I've
heard, I thought Xbox would be showing off
a VR head set of their own. But who knows,
E3 is just getting started and there's still
time for Xbox to show off their VR head sets
if they have one. Comment Below, do you want
VR from the Xbox One X? Have you ever even
tried VR?
Xbox also showed off more than 42 games at
their conference and 22 of them were x box
exclusives. Here a are a few that stood out
to me. First was Forza Motorsport 7. And they
didn't just show off the game, Porsche also
announced the 2018 GT2 RS, me being a gear
head it was pretty cool. And then they showed
off the same car in the game demo. They also
premiered Assassins Creed origins, which will
take place in ancient Egypt. The story is
supposed to tell the origins of the Assassins
order, and honestly I hope it's better then
the last few assassins creed titles. With
it being set in Egypt I hope they can go crazy
with the location, the pyramids and their
under ground tombs, the Neil river, and all
of the Egyptian mythos. 
They also showed off dragon ball fighter Z
which just looks like a whole bunch of fun.
The trailer looks very colorful and I can't
imagine what it will look like in 4K. Just
watching the trailer gave me memories of when
I played DBZ Buddha Kai on my PS Go in English
class. 
EA also gave us a closer look at their new
title anthem. It looks cool and all, but I
can't stop thinking it's like a halo and destiny
mash up. But it still looks interesting enough. 
But just keep in mind, a lot of these games
didn't have any release dates on them. So
it could take a while for some of these games
to show up in stores. But luckily, Xbox isn't
going to be making games that can only run
on the Xbox One X exclusively… or at least
not yet. but i really hope it doesn't happen,
because causing that type of fragmentation
within a console family would really suck.
But it looks like xbox and playstation is
trying to cater to both casual gamers and
hardcore gamers that don't want to build their
own PC’s. you just want an affordable console
to play games and watch Netflix on? then get
the Xbox One S. Are you a little more hardcore
and you want your games to look great and
cant be bothered with load screens? Then pick
up the Xbox One X. But comment below, what
do you think about the Xbox One X? Would you
have named it differently? And Are you going
to get one?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
