new 10.5 inch iPad pro s 4k video
capabilities there's going to be samples
in the daylight nice shot low light shot
stationery shot walking shots that test
out the iPads in your optical image
stabilization slow motion in a few
photos as well if you want to check out
my full 10.5 inch iPad pro review click
over here somewhere
if you want to see what the camera on
the iPad pro can do this video is for
you heck this whole intro was recorded
in 4k using the iPad pro don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe if not for me
and let's do it for my best friends who
helped out make this video okay so I
decided to start off with this first
shot because I believe we put the iPad
pro Center to the test at 30 frames per
second the water movement is a little
rougher compared to 1080p 60 frames per
second but you can see how crisp the
lines are on the black post and if I
were to zoom in on the New York skyline
I would still get a good amount of
detail
here's the New York skyline again and
the camera sensor is doing a really good
job of capturing the details in the wave
here we are at 100% zoom in 4k and you
can still make out individual floors and
the lines are still crisper than what
they would be in 1080p here's a sensor
it is doing a great job of getting color
accurate detail but the 30 frames per
second is really making it hard to keep
the fast-moving soccer ball in focus now
we've got some slow-motion video at 720p
240 frames per second you can tell we've
lost a lot of detail on the grass and
the color is a little dull but the
trade-off is getting more detailed
slow-motion video and this is 1080p at
120 frames per second and we're back at
4k at 30 frames per second now this is a
walking shot and you can see the optical
image stabilization do its job keeping
the video steady
now this is another walkin shot but
instead in a low light situation notice
how there's any lens flare in this video
but there's also a lot of noise in the
night sky here we've got a bit of a
problem as you can clearly see a lot of
these lights are simply blown out
we're in this shot you can see how
detailed the benches are the lives are
captured very accurately and you're
still a good enough detail between the
splits on the backrest here we've got
some photos of some flowers the first
picture is strictly low-light the second
picture is with two-tone flash turned on
and the last one is in daylight as you
can see that even with the true tone
flash the iPad still dulled the colors
of the flowers
this next video is really playing the
shadows you can see how the iPad pro
sense or handle shadows and multiple
objects here we're zooming into the dugs
and you can see the camera does a really
good job of keeping the Ducks neck
smooth at 1080p the neck area would
start to look a little jagged at 100%
zoom oh no wait actually these are these
are geese those are keys not ducks in
here you can see how the sensor handles
moving objects in low-light against
those who are only on 31st the second
the video isn't as smooth and there's a
lot of trailing going on this is perhaps
my favorite shot the camera did a really
good job of capturing all the rest and
you can see the detail in the supports
of the bridge state very crisp and you
can still see a lot of details and weave
down in the Hudson I took the same video
at 1080p and there's just a lot of noise
and the support for just sold out now
we've got some water flowing again
capturing this at 60 frames per second
wouldn't make the water flow smoother
but 30 frames per second gets the job
done and here we've got some stills of
the New York skyline at night and 0% 0
and here's the same shot at 100% zoom
now we're playing with the tap to focus
here we focus on the water setting
notice all the lens flares now we're
focused on the center tree again lots of
lens flare and that will focus on the
top right high rise in the foreground
again there's so much lens flares it's
almost like JJ Abrams erected this and
now we've got some more stills there's a
lot of clarity lost in this one
here we can see there isn't much detail
in the post surrounding the water
fountain
actually held up traffic for this one
but it was so worth it
here's my favorite shot again if you
look at those supports you'll notice
there isn't a lot of detail that's lost
compared to the 4k video
and this is 4k video shot of the New
York skyline at night notice all of the
noise going on in the sky and here we're
going to zoom in to 100% in two support
cables of the gwb notice that even at
this distance the camera is still able
to smooth out the shape at 1080p the
cable did get a little jagged
and here we've got some cars in 4k we've
got some great detailing but at 30
frames per second it is causing some
motion blurring and there you have it
this is what you should expect from the
camera on the iPad pro it's great for
daytime but I've seen other cameras
perform better at night if you enjoyed
the video please remember to Like
comment and subscribe
and I'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
