integration for their headphones for a
while now and even though it did take a
little longer than expected it's finally
here now this new firmware update is
only available for a few select products
but eventually Sony's whole hatful
lineup will feature Google assistant
integration but for now let's see what
Google assistant is all about on my
personal favorite headphones there's
only one thousand accent tune just so
we're clear this is a full review on the
Sony 1000 XM - I'm just addressing this
new significant firmware update if you
want to learn more about the sony 1000x
them to watch their full review but if
you want to pick up the sony 1000 XM -
i'll have links or description below and
if you use the links you only helps out
the channel I just actually check them
out cuz Sony headphones routinely go on
sale and also check out the numerous
shelf down below ok so the most
important thing you need to install this
new firmware update on your headphones
is time they supped I took like 40
minutes to install but after your
headphones have been updated if you
scroll down to the bottom of Sony's
headphones app you'll see a new option
tab you can either keep the default
settings of the ambient button or you
can remap it as your Google assistant
button and as a refresher the 1000x m2s
have a touchpad on the right ear cup
that controls your media playback and
those have remained unchanged the power
button and the anc / ambien button are
the only two physical buttons on these
headphones and in this default setting
the ambient button will cycle through
having noise cancellation turned on
where they will obviously block out
noise ambient mode where the headphones
will pump in all the surrounding sound
so it's like you're not even wearing the
headphones or just off
ambient sound
but if you choose to remap the ambient
button then you'll have quick and direct
access to your voice assistant if you
simply press the ambien button then the
headphones will tell you the time and
they'll give you a rundown of any
notifications you might have or if you
press and hold the button then you can
start talking to your voice assistant
immediately just like I'm the post you
see 35 series - you don't have to see a
hot word and you don't have to press and
hold and wait like before the whole
process has been a streamlined it's 4:18
p.m. you don't have notifications right
now 14 pounds equals six point three
five kilograms sure changing this video
may commit sure changing this video
weight to blue music all right music on
Google thing music here you go
and personally I really do think that
having this direct access to voice
assistant can be pretty useful let's say
if you're a student you can quickly ask
the assistant to do basic math or ask
for unit conversions while you're
working on your chemistry or physics
homework or if you work in an office you
can calculate how much of a commission
you should expect from your last sale
you can access instant what is 12% of
$5,000 six hundred dollars but besides
that the headphones will read out
notifications as they come in and if you
want you can directly respond to these
notifications by using the voice assist
so it's four twelve PM message from dad
dad says did you become a doctor yet my
dad text dad sure what's the message no
I did not do you want to send it or
change it send it even though I have a
Google assistant on your headphones can
be very useful just remember that if you
want to cycle through your noise
cancellation settings you'll have to do
so manually through the headphones app
and personally I would really like to
see you Google assistant have more
control over the headphones themselves
cuz right now if you ask Google to turn
on noise cancellation
or ambient mode things don't work out as
expected
turn on noise cancellation according to
Verizon Wireless from the Home screen
tap Settings General accessibility from
you hearing section tap the phone ways
cancellation sound playing relaxation
sounds this is probably a problem on
Sony's end so hopefully they'll fix it
soon but in general Google assistance
should work better and more seamlessly
if you're using it on an Android device
because right now on an iPhone you do
have to open up the assistant app every
time you turn on the headphones and have
it running in the background for Google
assistant to actually work the Google
assistant it's not connected but that's
a small price to pay so you don't have
to deal with Siri but overall this new
feature isn't a game changer it's just a
new option for the Sony 1000 xm2 Google
assistant is going to be more useful for
some people than others
but it definitely breathe some new life
into these headphones as they approach
their one your mark since they were
announced at IFA last year now since IFA
2018 is a few weeks away I would
personally be shocked if Sony announced
or WH 1000 xm3 I think it's more likely
we'll see an updated version of their XP
950 and one extra bass headphones but if
Sony does announcer 1000 xm3 Google
assistant integration is nice but more
importantly I would like to see better
padding and synthetic leather more
spacious ear cuffs similar to the bose
qc25 s with a more low profile design
about a fast-charging if you made it
this far I guess you enjoyed the video
so hit that like button and get
subscribed it helps out more than you
realize

links down below and I'll catch you next
