months the beats X and Apple earpods are
finally available so which did you get
the Apple earpods are still worth to get
up hold up
so should you just get the beat sector
and call them day for wait for the Apple
earpods let's find out the Apple earpods
currently retails for 159 and come in
only one color and if you were to order
them today you might have to wait a full
six weeks before they actually get to
you the beat X on the other hand retail
for 149 95 and come in four different
colors so if you want to stand out with
a little color then they'll be sexual
the way to go the beat Sox and Apple
earpods vote to use Apple's new W one
chip and if you don't nobody now the W
one chip allows for super simple pairing
with Apple devices and once paired
they'll automatically pair with all
other Apple devices associated to your
iCloud account which just makes using
either wireless earphones with other
Apple devices super simple
no matter what you choose you still
benefit from the convenience the w1 chip
has to offer but if you want to use them
with non Apple devices you can still
connect them with standard Bluetooth by
pressing and holding the power button
the biggest difference between the beats
tax and the earpods
is the form factor the beats X arm long
and rest on your neck the B touch or in
your earphones and can get pretty deep
into your ear canal they also create a
pretty good seal which really helps with
passive noise isolation the B text also
do a good job of staying New Year's at
all times and pro longwear isn't an
issue that player pods on the other hand
are a whole other story when the ear
pods are stored in their case they're
super compact when you actually put on
the aircon you can sometimes forget you
even wearing them after a while not
having a wire to worry about resulting
the sense of freedom that have never
really experienced with otherwise fear
fun the one drawback about the air
pocket that there is always a bit of
anxiety in the back of my mind about
what if one of the air pods falls out
and I don't notice or fall into a storm
drain while walking in my sleep
supposed to be sexier buds or connected
with wire they still have an inline
controller they like control on the
beats X make to control your music and
accepting calls super-easy the Apple
earpods Wireless design makes them feel
like you're wearing the future but you
sacrifice that in-line controller
instead you have to tell Siri by double
tapping either ear pod twice to do
simple things like adjust volume or
skipping the track
sure your music will automatically pause
when you remove one of the ear pods out
of your ear but sacrificing that in-line
controller isn't worth it when it comes
to sound quality these earphones are
very different like I said earlier the
beats XR in-ear earphone they do a great
job of getting deep into your ear canal
and stay
they're under most circumstances they
also create a good feel which results in
good passive noise isolation the beats X
are a great option for wearing on your
morning commute
overall the beats X have a neutral sound
signature they are into bass heavy and
don't sound tinny the mids can get a
little washed out at times but overall
they offer a pleasant listening
experience on the other hand the airpot
simply rests on the outside of the ear
canal they don't offer as much passive
noise isolation and ambient noise can
easily get in in my opinion the ear pods
also don't sanitary protect the air pots
are very based heavy and their mids and
highs of various models if sound quality
is important to you then get to beat
their battery life there's also slightly
different between the bpx in the air
lock on the full charge beats X will
last 8 out they also feature fast fuel
which will get you two hours to playback
from just 5 minutes of charging
personally I think fast fuel is a
must-have feature to save the air plug
to charge when you are placed inside the
carrying case the air pods can last 5
hours of continuous use and with the
help of the carrying case that can last
a whole 24 hours the air plugs also have
their own version of fatsia 50 minutes
of charging inside the carrying case and
will get you three hours to playback
time the good thing about both of these
earphones is that they both charged with
lightning cases which means charging is
a little easier and you don't have to
keep track of any proprietary cable
alright so which is again the B text or
a great life style headphones
you can wear them almost anywhere for
long periods of times without any
discomfort you can wear them while you
work on your commute to work at home and
even go on a run with them if you want
just remember the orange white resists
it the Apple earpods on the other hand
are all about convenience the wireless
design and small form factor gives you
the sense of freedom though otherwise if
only can give you their parts or best
when used while at the office or at home
they aren't the best options when it
comes to working out though hey if you
