channel but they've always been
name-brand speakers cuz I've always been
skeptical of cheaper speakers you might
see online or at the grocery store but
when das reached out about sponsoring a
video and sent me their new sound box
Pro I was pleasantly surprised
these give the JBL for 4 and X be 21 or
run for their money
and these cost twice as much but to make
this video a little more interesting I
also ran out to the grocery store and
picked up this $50.00 my home speaker so
let's see how these $50.00 speakers
stack up up against these $100 speakers
so to make this video as fair as
possible all of these speakers or stereo
speakers that have dual transducers I
decided to go with the iHome speaker cuz
I home is a brand you usually see
sitting on the shelf next to the more
premium speakers that are usually placed
in a glass case at the store
both the iHome speaker and das sound box
Pro retail for $49.99 but if you get to
seven bucks pros you get an automatic 10
percent off discount and then there's
the JBL flip 4 and Sony XP 21 which both
retail for $99.99 if you want to pick
either these speakers up I'll have a
link to description below and if you use
the links really helps out the channel I
suggest to check them out coz the foot 4
and X be 21
routinely go on sale show you might get
lucky first let's talk about design and
build quality when I first took that I
home speaker out of the box it was much
smaller than I expected the front and
rear faces of the speaker are brittle
plastic and the edges are covered in
thick rubber this thing is built like a
tank
there's no denying the sound box Pro
looks like a slightly smaller Sony XP 30
there's a metal grill and light feature
on the front and the rest of the body is
covered in soft touch plastic build
quality is good and the buttons have
very good tactile feedback but I feel
this speaker is better off you strictly
indoors because you can easily scratch
this off there's plastic body that's why
Sony decided to go with fabric out of
shelves for the newer portable speaker
line up the fabric bodies of the X be 21
and foot for or just April withstand
more abuse without showing any scratch
marks both the item speaker and Sony XP
21
or rocking ip67 certifications which
means there are both water and does
proof so you really don't have to worry
about either these speakers if you take
them on the go with you whereas two JBL
flip four is ipx7 certified which means
it's only waterproof you just have to be
mindful of those exposed past radiators
you shouldn't push the men and if you
take the floor to the beach
you shouldn't get sand in them and then
there's the sound box pro which is
rocking an IP x5 certification like I
said earlier I feel the speaker is
better off used indoors a splash of
water isn't a problem but you shouldn't
submerge it and expect it to survive
when it comes to porch all of these
speakers have an audio jack and they all
charge via a mic USB port the flip 4 has
the best world world battery life here
with 7 hours of playback time when the
volume is set at 80% at the same volume
the X be 21 and sound box pro or close
behind with 6 and 5 hours of playback
time but the iHome speaker has the worst
bag life here with it has a claimed
battery life of 6 hours but an 80%
volume this thing barely managed even in
2 hours
ok now let's talk about speaker setups
the iHome speaker has the smallest dual
transducers here that shoot out the
front and it has a passive radiator on
the rear that shoots out the back the
das sound box Pro has larger
front-facing transducers and dual
passive radiators that shoot out the
front and at the back of the speaker the
xB 21 has the same speaker setup as the
DA speaker there's dual 42 millimeter
diameter transducers and dual passive
radiators that also shoot out the front
and back of the speaker and finally
there's the workhorse that is the flip
for it also has front more fire and 40
millimeter diameter transducers and dual
passive radiators on each side now
before we jump into the sound test just
know the sound box Pro is playing with
extra bass mode turned off and the xB 21
is playing with its extra bass mode
turned on
first off I'm just gonna plainly say it
the I own speakers sounds so awful
things like that plastic front plate
covering the actual transducers this
speaker just sounds muffled and it's
also too quite a speaker here and max
volume overall the flip four is the best
sounding speaker here it sounds the
clearest here and it hands JBL's older
sound signature which does put a little
emphasis on the mids in trouble
but since the flip 4 is a 16 watt
speaker it doesn't get the loudest here
since both the sound box pro and XP 21
or 20 watt speakers they both get louder
than the foot 4 but to me they just film
sounds clearer like I said earlier the
sound box pro does give the flip 4 and X
be 21 or run for their money
if extra bass mode turned on both the
Sony and da speakers have more base than
the flip 4 but they do end up pushing
the mids back a little so extra bass
mode is better for when you're going to
listen to rap hip-hop or a EDM and with
extra bass mode turned off the DA
speaker has on neutral sound signature
which is better for when you're going to
listen to music with an emphasis on
vocals so sound quality ranking has to
go flip for in first place second place
is a toss-up between the sound box Pro
and XP 21 and the iHome speaker has been
disqualified
when it comes to Bluetooth connectivity
and all of these speakers have strong
stable connections that don't cut out
but the flip 4 has the least amount of
latency here so if you want a speaker
for watching videos with your phone
didn't you be better off with the floor
the floor also has the easiest and best
way to pair multiple speakers together
thanks to JB I'll connect plus you just
press one button on each speaker and
these speakers will figure out the rest
by themselves and like I've said in the
past sometimes it's better to have
multiple small speakers playing music to
fill a large area with music rather than
having one large speaker blasting on max
volume over in the corner I've
criticized Sony in the past cuz they're
Wireless party chain isn't the best if
you plan on paranal to Bose speakers
together on a regular basis you have to
use Sony's ABS pair these speakers
together sometimes it fails for no
reason and sometimes an echo will form
in while playing music which can only be
fixed by turning the speaker's off and
pair them to
again so the fact that you can pair two
sound box pros together by just pressing
the Add button on top and the fact that
I haven't had any echoing issues with
these das speakers is a very pleasant
surprise to me given that they cost half
as much as the Sony speakers sure das is
connection process isn't as fast as JBL
and you can only pair two speakers
together but for some people two
speakers is enough because in comparison
when I got the JBL clip 3 a few months
ago I didn't expect to like it as much
as I do now because this might dedicate
a podcast machine but the biggest
drawback about this $60 speaker is that
you can't pair it up to other JBL
speakers and objectively the sound box
Pro easily outperforms the clip 3 when
it comes to listening to music and
finally let's adjust the light feature
on the sound box Pro overall it looks
pretty good the light feature is easy to
see in most lighting conditions and you
can cycle through a few different colors
by pressing and holding the mode button
overall the light mode can flash and
several different colors and you can
either have the light feature flash to
the beat of your music you can have the
light feature simply cycle through the
different colors or you can just turn
the light feature off and save a little
bit on battery life and again I'm pretty
impressed by the sound box pro because
it's light feature looks way better than
the xB 21s like I start in the past I
feel the sony xba-1
is actually a downgrade from the older
Sony XP 20 the light feature on the xB
21 is not impressive whatsoever they
actually 21 is perhaps the least used
speaker in the studio I feel that if
you're trying to decide between the xB
21 and 254 and I say just go with the
before I personally feel the winners
here or at the forum and sound box Pro
if you decide to pay the premium and get
the flat four and you're getting a very
good sounding speaker given its size
with a long battery life that can last
you a whole day of listening it's also
very rugged and if you get to flip four
and then in the future if you decide to
get another JBL speaker then you have
the easiest way to pair multiple
speakers together but that can certainly
get expensive very quickly so for less
than the price of one foot four you can
actually get two sound box pros and pair
them together and I feel this is a good
deal for high school or college students
on a tighter budget to strongly consider
sure you're taking the slight
when it comes to sound quality and
battery life but a pair of sound box
pros will go a long way in any college
dorm room because they sound decent
enough for when you're hanging out with
friends gold quality is pretty good and
Plus that life feature is going to look
good
no matter where you place it plainly
said for $50.00 the sound box pro really
did impress me whereas the iHome speaker
was nothing but a huge disappointment if
you made it this far I guess you enjoyed
the video so hit that like button and
get subscribed it helps out more than
you realize
