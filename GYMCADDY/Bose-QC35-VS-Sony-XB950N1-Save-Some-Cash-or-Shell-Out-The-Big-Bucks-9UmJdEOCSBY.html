trying to apply it acting skills
if so smack that like buying from here
recently a few people then asking me if
they should get those Sony xb9 50 anyone
or should they sell out the extra cash
and just get the bose qc25
in my response to that question is
usually well what are you looking for in
these earphone
sir if you're having think question
hopefully I can help you out
first let's adjust the price the Sony
xb9 50 n1 currently retails for 248 over
at amazon and come in two colorways
black or green the bose qc25 on the
other hand retail for 349 and also come
in two colorways black or silver if
you're not good at math these two your
phones have 100 on the price difference
that's like five imax movie tickets to
the fate of the Furious I have linked in
the description below if you want to buy
you to one of these so quick rundown of
these two earphones they're both noise
canceling wireless earphones they're
both using bluetooth 4.1 they both have
a battery life of around 20 hours they
both have NFC pairing capabilities and
they both have an accompanying phone
application but nonetheless they are
both very different products for
starters of both Tuesday 35 are truly
worth at $349 price tag the materials
are much more premium and the build
quality is very solid the majority of
these your phone is made out of metal
and the headband is much more flexible
than the headband under Sony xb9 50 n1
the sony xperia 950 n1 on the other hand
is made mostly out of plastic and the
overall design of the sony xb9 50 and
one is huge like I mentioned in my
initial review you can actually still
see that XP 950 and one in your
peripheral vision when you put them on
the boat you see 35 on the other hand
are much more compact one very subtle
design detail I appreciate from the most
u-235 are the large letters found inside
of the gear comes indicating which is
blast in which is right it just makes
putting on these earphones correctly the
first time much easier
whereas the Sony just have these two
little dots which don't really do very
much so I always have to pause and make
sure they're oriented correctly before I
put them on both of these earphones also
feature controls on the bottom of the
ear cups and they both took very
different approach the boss QC 35 really
just has a power button a volume rocker
and an extra button to play in pods
music double tapping the third button
skips of
and triple tapping goes back a track
it's very easy to tell which one you're
pressing some sort of very elevated the
Sony S P 960 anyone on the other hand
has a few more buttons and allow you to
take more control over your headphones
you can do things like turn on or turn
off the base to flat feature more on
this in just a second you can turn noise
cancellation on or off and controlling
your music with the dongle on the sony
xperia the n1 is much more intuitive and
slightly more accurate when it comes to
controls I really prefer the xB 950 n1
over the QC 35 when it comes to wearing
either one of these earphones they're
both very comfortable what I do prefer
one over the other and that would have
to be the bose qc25 like I mentioned
earlier both of these your phones are
noise cancelling earphones and naturally
I know you're probably wondering which
has a better noise cancellation and
that's a trying both of these headphones
on in the same noisy environment I did
find the Bose 50-35 had the better noise
cancellation just be warned and this is
just my experiment when I wear the both
QT 35 for more than a few minutes
without playing music I do get a
headache
this doesn't mean it will happen to you
but Sony XP 950 on the other hand don't
give me any kind of headache whether the
music is playing or not or after
prolonged use just don't expect the
noise cancellation to be as good as the
Bose you see Felisa overall the sound
quality on both of these headphones is
great as well but they do sound very
different the bose qc25 give you a very
decent listening experience overall
you've got a wide soundstage instrument
separation of spot-on lows mids highs
and vocals all very clear what makes the
Sony xb9 to the n1 special is their base
effect feature as the box implies the
sony xb9 50 n1 are made for people who
absolutely love date the base on the
bose QC 35 just can't compare to the
Sony headphones and having all that base
really changes though it's an experience
and even though the XP 950 and one have
a whole lotta bass it doesn't take away
from the sound quality one complaint I
do have about the XP 950 n1 is their
highs can get a little painful at time
whereas the highs in the bose qc25 in
the same song didn't cause any
discomfort like I mentioned earlier both
of these headphones also have smartphone
app so Sony XP 950 and one smartphone
app allows you to do a few things like
children or scan
on and off you can also adjust the base
effect so you can actually turn it up or
turn it down for those wondering the
base on the both QC 35 is equivalent to
having the Sony xb9 50 and one base set
to negative 2 hopefully that helps give
your reference of some sort sony's app
also allows you to adjust to surround
the size of these headphones well like I
mentioned in my initial review it really
just the sports the sounds really and I
just keep that feature off both of
smartphone app on the other hand really
doesn't even do too much
I even wonder why we even have to bother
with an app some time overall both of
these headphones have their pros and
cons the boss QC 35 has far superior
noise cancellation than the Sony xb9 50
no.1 and we also have a far better build
quality the sony xb9 50 and the one on
the other hand are truly all about that
bass the boss to see 35 give you a very
balanced listening experience and/or
slightly smaller size and included hard
keys make them great for traveling but
the base on the QC 35 does believe you
wanting more and that's what the XP 950
on one picks up the slack the sony xb9
50 and 1 are just made for basic and all
dead bass really truly elevates the
listening experience without taking away
from the sound quality traveling with
the XP 950 and 1 can be a little harder
due to their larger size but if you do
plan to travel a lot with them it would
be smart to invest in a horse shell case
but overall if you're looking for
something with amazing noise
cancellation and sound good
get the bose qc25 if you need to have
your bass then get the sony xb9 50
