oh cool it's gonna get some headphones
for the flight but which one should I
take
last year when we pitted the Sonia 1000
XM to up against the bose qc25 series to
the sony's one because they had to
better perform in technology but bose
still walked away with a close second
because they had far better build
quality for a better fit and they looked
much better than the Sony's and it looks
like Sony took that to heart cuz now we
have the all-new Sony WH 1000 XM 3 so
well there's sodium 1000 XM 3 finally
the complete package or the bose qc25
series to stay on some fight left in
them the sony 1000 Exim threes or the
newer headphones here cuz they were
released in September of 2018 whereas
the bose qc25 series 2 or exactly one
year older than the sony's and both of
these headphones currently retail for
$350 if you want to pick either of these
headphones up I'll have links for
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel I
highly suggest you check them out
because Sony headphones routinely go on
sale so you might get lucky and if you
want to learn more about either these
headphones then watch their full reviews
and also check out the numerous shelf
down below first let's talk about the
accessories that come included with both
of these headphones both of these
headphones come included with hard shell
carrying cases but personally I do
prefer some skills even though boses
case is slightly smaller like Sony's
case cuz of the scratch resistant fabric
body and now you really like the
built-in storage compartment before we
talk about the included cables we first
need to talk about the ports on these
headphones because they're completely
opposite thankfully the 1000 X and
threes now have a USB C port which is
strictly used for charging and there's a
3.5 millimeter audio jack whereas the
Bose still have a microUSB port for
charging and it has a 2.5 millimeter
audio jack the entries included charging
cable is much nicer than boses charging
cable but I hate that is much shorter
but both of these headphones do get a
strike when it comes to their included
audio cables both of these cables are
cheap short and thin and even though the
m3s audio cable is slightly
even boses audio cable it's still
downgrade from the m20 cable I know that
for most people the included audio
cables aren't a factor these days but
for content creators it couldn't matter
but now with all of that other way let's
get to the main attractions even though
technologically inferior the bus QC 35s
have remained a favorite of most
consumers because of their fit design
and tried and tested build quality
because in comparison last year's sony
1000 XM to their ear cups were much more
cramped
they looked much bulkier the old quality
wasn't on the same level as Bose and
they had to shake off the headband
cracking issue that was prominent on the
first generation sony MDR 1000x and from
the looks of it it looks like Sony took
steps to improve both the build quality
and design of the 1000 x m3 there's much
less creaking whenever you flex the m3s
headband the ear cups will much smoother
and tolerances are much tighter the
entries also have a much more minimalist
designed to them because of their muted
color soft touch ear cups and all of the
screws and wires have been nicely hidden
away whereas the bose qc25 s have a much
more industrial look to them they look
like they're completely made out of
metal but they're not and their screws
and hinges are completely exposed
even though Sonia obviously took steps
to improve the build quality on their
new headphones only time will tell if
they're going to be able to hold up as
well as boses headphones do partially I
am confident in the new build quality of
the m3s because after a year of heavy
usage my enthuse have held up just fine
but perhaps more importantly the film of
the 1000 x + 3 s has been greatly
improved from the M twos to better
compete against the bose qc25 the yukos
and IAM threes are much more spacious
than the ear cups and the M twos and
there's much less padding against your
head which means overheating is much
less of an issue since the ear cups and
iam threes are much more spacious and
since the headphones themselves weigh in
at 255 grams 20 grams lighter than the
enthuse extended wear is not a problem
whatsoever but some people will still
find the Bose QC 3 5 is a little more
comfortable to wear than the 1,000 X and
threes even though the panning on the
entries is very similar to the bose qc25
buzzes ear cups are much deeper than
Sony's ear cups we're in the post QC 35s
is like wearing your favorite oversized
hoodie
you have more than enough room to move
around and since the faux leather and
the ear cups feel so much more luxurious
than the faux leather on the entries the
bows feel a little cozier whereas
wearing the Sony's is like wearing a
form-fitting tracksuit you have room to
move around but the cut is much slimmer
obviously both of these headphones are
big head approved but I feel that if you
have larger ears or ears that stick out
a lot then you still be better off going
with the bus QC 35 but another thing I
like about the 1000x and three is the
new headband design it's much more
low-profile compared to the m2 and boses
headband and it's also much thinner okay
now with design to fit out of the way
let's talk about tech specs the bose
qc25 series 2 has an advertised battery
life of 20 hours and they also feature
fast charging if you plug the bose qc25
s in for 15 minutes from a dead battery
they're gonna get you two and a half
hours to playback time the so many 1000s
and threes also have fast charging but
instead of two and a half hours of
playback time they're gonna get you 5
hours of playback time from just 10
minutes of charging the entries also
have an advertised battery life of 30
hours and that with ANC turned on you
can always squeeze out a little bit more
battery life out of these headphones if
you use them with ANC turned off and for
me the entries usually last me about 2
weeks in between charges and when it
comes to Bluetooth connectivity things
are also a little different
both of these headphones have stable
connections that don't cut out which is
good but they do have a bit of latency
so they aren't the best for watching
YouTube videos but with the Bose qc3 5s
you can be connected to two devices at a
time which makes hot swapping much
easier if you're a power user whereas
with the m3s you can only be connected
to one device at a time but you do get
the benefit of sony's dsee and odet
technologies which allows you to enjoy
high res audio without having a use of
water connection but now let's talk
about the active noise cancellation on
both of these headphones like I've said
in the past the reason I like to Sony
1000 XM - so much was because they were
able to block out the moe
tomorrow noise with little-to-no cabin
pressure even more than the most QC 35s
and I don't know how Sony did it but the
new 1000 X and 3's are able to block out
a little more noise across the board
than the previous M twos
even though the bose qc25 is do a good
job of blocking out a good amount of
road noise aka constant low frequency
sounds they do struggle to block out
random higher frequency sounds lecture
chatter you would hear at your local
coffee shop but my biggest issue with
Boz's active noise cancellation is that
there is a considerable amount of
discomfort when you use it I know that
some people have said that they get used
to buzzes ANC technology after a while
but that's never been the case for me
personally I either feel discomfort on
my eardrums or a slight pain on the back
of my eyeballs so after a while of
wearing the bose qc25 with anc turned on
i just got a headache
whereas i never have any of these
symptoms with so nice headphones but
another reason I like Sony's active
noise cancellation so much is because it
does a much better job of preventing
wind noise in your music when you rang
these headphones outdoors since the ANC
microphones are on the 1000 XM threes or
slightly recessed it's much harder for
when to directly hit them and as a
result you really get any in the
background of your music whereas since
the ANC microphones on the bose are so
exposed when noise is a little more
common but another reason unlike Sony's
ANC so much is because you can pump in
some of the ambient sound around you so
it's kind of like having open-back
headphones and this feature is great for
safety if you're walking around in the
city but the trick thing about ambient
mode is that it's not just blindly
pumping in all of the ambient sound
around you it's still selective of what
it lets in so if you're walking around
in the city and if there's a random bang
or a siren the headphones will
automatically block everything out again
so you don't have to worry about
jumpscares or going deaf whereas with
Bose you can only set your active noise
cancellation to high-low or off when it
comes to sound quality both of these
headphones are meant for
easy-listening the boss QC 35s has a
sound so I'm gonna chew that puts and
emphases on the mids and vocals but I
feel the bass does leave something to be
desired I feel that the Bose can
sometimes sound a little bright and if
the vocals really got going then they
can overpower the rest of the song but
my biggest problem with the bose qc25 is
that the bass bottoms out half at the
time whereas the bass on the sony 1000
xm3 can get significantly deeper and is
cleaner than the bass on both the 1000x
m2 and bose qc25 you're not going to get
bass head levels of bass on the 1000 xm3
where your head is just rattling all the
time but the cleaner base of the m3s
does make it listen to music with the
entries more enjoyable and through
sony's headphones app you can also
adjust the EQ of the m3s so you can make
them sound however you want so depending
on the type of music you listen to which
is something you can't do with the Bose
unless you use a third-party app and
when it comes to control your music
playback on either of these headphones
things are also very different the both
QC 35s have a set of physical buttons on
the back of the right ear cup they're
easy to use easy to find and easy to
tell apart besides me wanting them to
have a little more tactile feedback
they're perfectly fine the Sony's on the
other hand have a touchpad on their
right ear cup you double tap to play a
positive music so I pop it down to
adjust your volume and swipe front or
back to skip or go back a track and
after you get used to them the touch
controls on the sony 1000x and three are
very easy to use sense sony's touchpad
is so accurate i'm indifferent when it
comes to choosing between either of the
control methods found on these
headphones they both work just fine but
the thing Sony's touchpad has over Bose
is quick attention if you fully cover
the touchpad the headphones will pause
your music and pump in all the ambient
sound so you can talk to someone without
having to take your headphones off I'm
telling you from experience do not
underestimate how useful this feature
can be
but one thing that I hate about both of
these headphones is their lack of a
dedicated google assistant button both
of these headphones have Google
assistant integration and the Bose even
has Elector integration but in order to
use these features you have to sacrifice
either these headphones and extra
physical buttons that would otherwise be
used to manually cycle through your ANC
settings like this noise canceling
ambient sound
ambient sound control ah not having this
functionality can get pretty annoying
cuz I switched from ANC to ambient sound
mode on DM threes on all regular basis
now I'm fully aware that if you press
and hold on either of these headphones
you can summon your voices system but
pressing and holding and then talking
isn't as efficient as having a dedicated
Google assistant Boyan
or you just press and talk like this set
the studio light to blue okay
changing the studio light to blue such a
studio light degree you got it changing
the studio light to green such a still
relate to render okay changing the
studio light to red what's the weather
like New York City on Saturday Saturday
in New York City it'll be mostly sunny
with a high of 80 and a low of 67 its
6:22 p.m. you don't have new
notifications right now so what I'm
getting at is I do like that both of
these headphones have Google assistant
integration but I wish these headphones
had an extra physical button so we don't
have to sacrifice the manual noise
cancellation setting button cuz having
to open the app on your phone every time
you want to cycle between your noise
cancellation settings can get pretty
annoying and finally I don't usually do
this in a versus video but here's the
microphone test and the microphone on
the Sony WH 1000 X and 3 but sound
better than the microphone found on the
both QC 35 series too cuz the microphone
on people's QC 35 series 2 does have a
considerable amount of static so I
wouldn't recommend taking phone calls
with these headphones so for the time
being I think it's safe to say that the
new Sony WH 1000 x m3 or currently the
best active noise-cancelling headphones
on the market right now
just like the 1000 X and choose from
last year the 1000 x m3 outright
outperformed the bose qc25 series too
when it comes
the battery life features sound quality
and active noise cancellation
performance but more importantly the
1000 x m3 is improved where the 1000 x
m2 is fell short and as a result the fit
and build quality of the 1000 X and
threes is finally on par of that of the
bose qc25 the only reason I would pick
up the bose qc25 now is because you need
the more spacious ear cups multi-device
connectivity is a must for you you
really want that Alexa integration or
just for plain looks but for me the sony
wh 1000 x m3 or going to be my daily
drivers from now on now remember if you
want to learn more about either of these
headphones then please watch their full
reviews if you made it this far I guess
you enjoyed the video so hit that like
