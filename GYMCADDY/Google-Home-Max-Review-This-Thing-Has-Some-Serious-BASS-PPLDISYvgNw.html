home max they said that they set out to
make the best sounding speaker and that
they obsessed over the base and that's
an understatement this thing moves era
out of the way like it's no it's
business the Google home acts definitely
sounds decent but it's not for everyone
Google homes land of now consists of
three first party speakers and there are
a whole bunch of third party speakers
being released on what seems or weekly
basis right now you can get to Google
hold mini for as low as $29 no og Google
home for $79 and the max is currently
retailing for $399 concerning what's
inside the box when you get to Google
home max aside from the speaker itself
you're forgetting a magnetic rubber pad
or power cord and some documentation
that's it but for a speaker that doesn't
have a built-in battery the Google home
max is pretty freakin dense the max
weighs in at almost 12 pounds which
honestly caught me off guard the first
time I'll have to grab it inside the max
is rocking dual four and a half inch
woofers and dual point seven inch
tweeters and the fabric that covers all
of this on the front is pretty different
from the fabrics found on the whole mini
and og Google home the fabric on the max
is much thinner and less textured than
the latter two and underneath the fabric
there earlier Google assisted
notification lights that change
orientation depending on the speaker
position and mostly shine white when
Google is interacting with you the rest
of the body of the max is made out of
what I'm assuming is stainless steel but
if you're going to pick the max up I
suggest you do so from the sides and
avoid applying any kind of pressure on
the front of the speaker the front of
the speaker isn't as sturdy and flexes
very easily on the top of the speaker
you've got your touch controls to raise
or lower the volume of your music and
tap in the center will play or pause
your music and on the back you've got
your AC import and a shag or USB type-c
port in a mic mute switch the mics back
on and the Google home max has a total
of 6 mics built-in so I can listen for
you or so you can automatically adjust
is EQ for the best sound quality
depending on where it is in a room there
are two microphones on the top two on
the side and I'm assuming there are two
underneath the fabric as well but I just
want to point something out really quick
about the magnetic base on the max ya
the Google home max will tell you if
you've oriented it incorrectly and the
pad will or
matically align itself when you place it
on either side but what I really like
about the pad is that it gives the
illusion of the max just levitating in
mid-air which I really like the design
of the Google home Max is very clean and
simple just like the mini and they
should have no problem fitting in with
almost any room decor the og Google home
also has a simple design but you could
really see Google is going in a new
design direction with their newer smart
speaker models and it makes me wonder
what the second-generation Google home
look like obviously all three of these
speakers did the same thing they give
you quick access to Google assistants so
you can ask a questions give it commands
or control your smart home and they all
perform the same they're all here you
just as well and they're all just as
fast ok Google
what's the current price of Bitcoin 1
BTC is approximately sixteen thousand
two hundred sixty five United States
dollars and forty one cents hey Google
play music on the max alright music from
google play music playing on the max but
the Google home max is all about sound
and it's obviously going to completely
outperform the mini and og Google home
but for fun here's a sound test between
these three speakers
what amazes me the most about the Google
home max is the base this is a great
speaker for bass it's even at 50% volume
the max still manages to shake
everything around it
there's a lot of emphasis on the low
winds and highs but I feel the mids and
vocals are a little push back and I feel
the soundstage could be wider the max
has no problem filling a large living
room and he likes to live in the mid 80s
decibel range and occasionally gets into
a low 90s at max volume this speaker
sends us best all the way up to the 85%
volume then after that the highs will
occasionally crash but the real problem
is if the bass really gets going then
there's going to be a lot of distortion
and even a little bit but through the
Google home app you can adjust the
amount of bass and trouble the max has
and although I do like the option of
being able to adjust the bass in trouble
I would much rather prefer to if google
gave you more control over the equalizer
settings but maybe through Google's
smart sound and machine learning though
over time improve the sound of the max
but more importantly push the mint a
little forward because overall the
Google home max has a pretty v-shaped
sound signature and the Google home max
gives you three options to listen to
your music you can either use the Ox
jack on the back you can stream your
music over Wi-Fi or you can stream your
music over Bluetooth straight from your
own device hey Google turn bluetooth on
alright looking for paired devices
Bluetooth is connected to I phone but
after testing the max and watching
videos with it I did notice there was a
significant delay between audio and
video which I'm finding is a pretty
common problem with smart speakers SS
we're on the top of the sound quality I
just want to point out that the Google
home Mini is not good for listening to
music whatsoever its tinny and
everything just falls flat but that's
perfectly fine the Google home Mini is
just a very affordable way to get
started with Google assistant but the OG
Google home on the other hand is another
story
right now it's selling for $79 because
of the holiday season but it typically
retails for 129 dollars and for 129
dollars speaker the OG Google home does
that sound good
it gets overpowered by its own bass and
vocal
sound like they're at the bottom of a
well if you're looking for a smart
speaker in the same price range that
sounds good then I highly recommend the
JBL Ling 10 or the JBL Ling 20 they
sound much better than the og Google
home they have a built in battery into a
very rugged so you can take them outside
if you're having a cookout or something
right now in its current state I don't
see a reason to go out and get an OG
Google home it's Maggert for listening
to music and if you just want a smart
speaker to interact with your assistant
and help you control your smart home
then you'll be better off with just
getting a Google home mini and although
the Google home max is just a super size
will go home many with a very simple
design it's not without its problems as
mentioned before you can adjust the
volume by sliding your finger across the
top of the speaker and you can play or
pause or silence alarms by tapping the
center but what I don't understand is
why can't you control your music
playback by double tapping or triple
tapping the top to skip or go back a
track and I also don't understand why
pressing and holding on the top doesn't
activate Google assistant like it does
on the OT Google home I get around the
Google home many Google had to strap the
feature cause of some hardware issues
but I don't think there's such a problem
on the max I just find it irritating
that Google limits to Max's
functionality and forces you to use
voice commands even when it's not the
most convenient or if your phone isn't
around because there is no reason Google
couldn't add this functionality through
a little software because when you're
playing music at a heart volume the max
is gonna have trouble hearing you when
you give it a command so instead of
double tapping to skip a track or
pressing and holding to activate Google
assistant you might have to either tap
to pause the music and then give it the
voice command or you might have to lower
the volume and then give it a voice
command these are needless extra steps
I get that Google is trying to in a way
make talking to voice assistants second
nature to people but I feel smart
speakers in general should give the user
as many options as possible to interact
with them and allow the user to use
their hardware as they see fit because
the voice assistant truly are as amazing
as Google thinks they are then people
will naturally gravitate towards them
and this is coming from somebody who
really enjoys using voice commands out
on a regular basis specifically with my
Google home mini and Xbox one but one
small thing I do appreciate about the
Google home max is this power cord and
how small the plug is there's no
external power brick to worry about with
the Google home max and those small
plugs means you save room on your
trip for your other electronics because
if you look at the plugs on the mini and
og Google home you'll see how big of a
difference to Max's again for the second
generation go go home I would really
like to see them slimming down the plug
in addition to improving overall sound
quality so what's the verdict on the
Google home max if you weren't a good
sounding speaker that sounds bigger than
it is with Google assistant built-in
then the max is your simplest and
cleanest solution sure you could get a
chromecast Audio and hook it up to any
speaker of your choice and get a Google
home mini to handle all the voice
commands stuff well then that means
three wires you have to keep plugged in
and to potential network failure points
because if potentially either the mini
of a chromecast or heavy network issues
then you're gonna have to troubleshoot
them well I can mention earlier there
are more in more Google assistant
enabled speakers being announced and
released on a weekly basis one that I
think is a direct comparison to the
Google home max is the recently released
JBL link 500 if you decide to get the
Google home max you're not going to be
disappointed because it does sound
impressive for its size and that looks
pretty good as well but I do agree I
would wait for this thing to go on sale
