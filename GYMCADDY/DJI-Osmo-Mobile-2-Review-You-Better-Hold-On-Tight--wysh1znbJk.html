camera is shaky video still sucks and
there's only so much digital and optical
in the civilization can do and that's
where the DJI Osmo mobile 2 comes in
DJI made the new smartphone gimbal
better and cheaper than the previous
smartphone cable although the DJI Osmo
mobile 2 does perform very well the new
price reduction does mean a few
sacrifices the DJI Osmo mobile 2
currently retails for $129 versus the
original DJI Osmo mobile which used to
retail for $200 regarding within the box
it's very straightforward the Osmo 2
comes in a hard styrofoam carrying case
very similar to the one that DJI spark
comes in you get the gimbal on micro USB
cable for charging and your manuals
that's it
there's no wall charger no wrist straps
or no extra accessories if you want to
pick the DJI Osmo mobile 2 up I'll have
a link at the description below and if
you use the link it really helps out the
channel ok let's do a quick rundown of
the controls and ports on this guy
there's a microUSB port for charging
which obviously I wish was a USBC
instead does your USB port on the back
so you can charge your own phone if
you're running low on battery after a
long day of filming there's a universal
mount on the bottom of the handle so you
can attach the gimbal to a tripod or any
of their accessories you might have on
the left side there's a toggle so you
can zoom in and zoom out there's a
shutter button and then there's a
joystick so you can tilt and pan the
camera now you can go into the sentence
menu and adjust how fast you want to
joystick to adjust the camera you have
three options to choose from there's
fast medium and slow after filming with
the Osmo - I found medium or works best
faster just way too twitchy and slow
just takes forever the mode button does
a few things if you press and hold for a
second and a half it will power the
gimbal on or off if you press once it
will toggle between follow and lock mode
the little LED will also change colors
when it's green it means the gimbal is
in follow mode and when it's yellow it
means the gimbal is in lock mode if you
double press the mode button then the
gimbal will reset the camera to the
horizon and if you triple press the mode
button it will switch between the back
facing camera and the front-facing
camera just keep in mind that once you
start recording you can't swap from one
camera to the other hopefully this
feature will come in a future software
update now here the improvements DJI is
claiming under new Osmo mobile - over
their previous gimbal you
a much better battery life of fifteen
hours versus the previous Gamble's four
and a half hours the Osmo mobile 2
weighs less you can now mount your phone
vertically and overheating motors
shouldn't be a problem anymore with a
naked iPhone 8 plus installed
I found the total system weighed in at 1
pound and a half or 686 grams and I
could go about 15 minutes of shooting
before needing to put the gimbal down
for rest also while I was out getting
footage panoramas and multiple 10-minute
time lapses now once did the Osmo mobile
to overheat however I did manage to
overheat the system by I'll gradually
moving the gimbal around for about 10
minutes straight which point the gimbal
would refuse to stabilize itself and the
front motor got extremely hot for
regular use cases I don't think the Osmo
2 will really have an issue overheating
I think the only way the Osmo 2 will
overheat is if you're on a mission to
overheat your Osmo to flagship
smartphones these days have the best
cameras and optical and civilization we
have ever seen in a smartphone and it's
only getting better but there's still a
major benefit for using a gimbal to
smooth out your video even more first
off your framing stage much more
consistent and you don't get those
constant shocks every time you take a
step with your Walken sure gimbal
systems aren't going to completely
eliminate everything because there is
still some slight undulation with the
Osmo - but it's a lot better than having
shaky video overall now you could go and
stabilize your footage in post with
Final Cut Pro but things still like to
warp around a bit it's not going to look
as good if you actually had a gimbal the
Osmo tool also has a tracking feature
that works pretty well just like how do
you do under drone - all you have to do
is highlight whatever you want to track
and the gimbal will try to keep that
object and center the best it can while
you freely move about this feature is
pretty cool but it does have its
limitations
you can't move too fast or your subject
may get out of frame but the ozma will
automatically lock back on once it finds
it again
this feature is pretty useful if you
have to keep moving but you want to keep
a specific car or person or any other
subject in frame but the DJI Osmo mobile
2 isn't just good for videos they can
also capture some really cool moving
time lapses which I really like and you
can also capture some pretty stunning
panoramas and these are from panorama
modes take a few seconds each 100
degree panoramas take about 11 seconds
to complete 330 degree panorama take
about 16 seconds to complete and 3x3
panoramas take about 19 seconds to
complete and personally the 3x3
panoramas are my favorite and I think
they were much more useful than the
other two they allow you to take in a
scene much better without having to get
super far away from your subject
the time lapses and motion time lapses
are good for capturing b-roll and DJI
lets you play around with their duration
and intervals so the looks of these time
lapses can vary but the DJI Osmo mobile
2 isn't without its problems first is
all about software which eventually can
be fixed at first I was surprised the
Osmo to use the older DJI Go app instead
of the newer DJI go for app the camera
app has a bit of a problem automatically
and accurately setting itself to capture
the best quality pictures and videos
sometimes images will be over or
underexposed obviously you don't have to
use the DJI Go app but to get the most
out of the stabilizer you should I also
hate that for some reason that Apple
automatically set itself to shoot in
720p 30 frames per second without you
knowing so you might accidentally end up
capturing multiple 720p time lapses and
not realizing after the fact like me
also 180 and 330 degree panorama don't
really work in vertical mode there's a
lot of warping going on but for some
reason the 3x3 panoramas work just fine
but the biggest problem with the DJI
Osmo mobile 2 is hardware I absolutely
hate the new spring-loaded clamp on this
nimble it's easy to slip your phone in
but it's a nightmare to get your phone
out also the clamp rotates in the wrong
direction so you want to switch from
horizontal to vertical mode you can't
just rotate your phone you have to
actually take it out rotate the clamp
and then put it back in
also the handle on the Osmo 2 is very
slippery its ergonomic but there are no
grooves or hatchet on the handle to get
a solid grip obviously this is a
cost-saving measure but I find that odd
there's not even a restaurant because
when you drop this and you will you're
not just dropping your hundred thirty on
the gimbal you're also probably dropping
your $1000 phone
performance-wise the DJI Osmo mobile 2
is a great smartphone gimbal it
stabilizes your video it doesn't
overheat the 15 hour battery life is
solid and the Osmo 2 lets you capture
some stunning motion time lapses and 3x3
panoramas that just wouldn't be possible
without a gimbal obviously DJI needed to
find a way to reduce the cost of the
gimbal system from $200 to $130 but
these are eye needs to work on their
software they need to redesign the clamp
to rotate in the opposite direction and
if you do pick one of these
I highly advise you get a restaurant or
figure out how to Jerry we're going on
