favorite midsize speakers I actually
like each of these speakers for
different reasons and depending on your
budget and needs one of these speakers
is going to be better suited for you we
have the brand-new JBL charts for the
also brand new ue boom three the sony
xba-1 and perhaps one of the coolest
looking speakers on the market right now
the JBL plus three money-wise the JBL
charge for Sony XP 31 and ue boom three
all retail for $150 whereas the JB
upholstery retails for $200 but it's
typically on sale now for $170 so if you
want to pick either of these speakers up
I'll have a little description below and
if you use willing to really help set
the channel I highly suggest you check
them out because Sony's and JBL speakers
routinely go on sale stream I collec
and if you want to learn more about
either of these speakers then please
watch their full reviews first let's get
the base of stuff out of the way most
premium portable speakers these days
have a few things in common they all
have a fabric body because a fabric body
does a much better job of standing up to
bumps and scrapes than a cheaper plastic
body and most premium portable speakers
these days also have an ipx7 rating
which means the waterproof but if you
want a really durable speaker that you
can take with you almost anywhere then
the boom 3 or XP 31 will might be more
up your alley
since these speakers are fully enclosed
they're both rocking an ip67 rating and
they're both shockproof so you really
don't have to worry about them if you
cram them into your backpack the choice
for is also pretty adorable but due to
JBL trademark expose passive radiators
you really want to be careful not to
push them in or you were spraying them
and finally there's the JBL pulse 3 even
though it is waterproof it's objectively
the most fragile speaker here due to its
acrylic top you do is scratching it or
cracking it if you drop it and again you
have to be mindful of those two exposed
passive radiators so for those reasons
how about we said the post 3 is a great
at-home speaker now also quickly want to
go over ports because they're pretty
different and significant depending on
your needs the boom 3 only has 8 mic USB
port that's use for charging there is no
audio jack in there is no USB a out port
see you can't charge your own devices
the post 3 also doesn't have a USB out
port but it does have an
Jack in charges we have Mike USB port
the sony xba-40 one also charges via a
microUSB port and has an audio jack and
since it has a USB a output you can
charge your own devices and finally
those two JBL charge 4 which has a
slightly more updated set up than the XP
31 it has a USB C port which is strictly
used for charging and it keeps the audio
jack and USB a out ports true you can
also charge your own devices but now
let's talk about battery life the charge
for XP 31 and boom 3 will all have no
problem lasting you at least one full
day of playing music at 80% volume from
a full charge but the charge 4 has the
longest real-world better life here of
about 11 hours of playback time whereas
the boom 3 has the shortest real world
about your life here of about 7 hours of
playback time even though the XP 31 has
an advertised battery life of 24 hours
with its extra base mode and light
feature turned on and with the volume
set at 80%
this speaker is good for about 9 to 10
hours of playback time so if you want
the speaker with the longest world world
battery life here than the JBL charge
for is you guy whereas the JBL pulls 3
has the worst real world battery life
here even though it has an advertised
battery life of 12 hours due to its life
feature and what brightness you have it
set at it's battery life is all over the
place if you use a less intensive light
mode like jet you'll be able to squeeze
out about 8 hours of playback time or if
you use a more intensive light mode like
rainbow then you'll be lucky to get five
hours of playback time but you also have
the option to use a post 3 with this
light feature turned off but what's the
point
so regardless like I said earlier I feel
the post 3 is a good at-home speaker cuz
it's mostly going to live on this
charger when it comes to Bluetooth
connectivity all of these speakers have
stable connections that don't cut out
and they can all go through multiple
walls and since these are premium
speakers they better but if you're an
iPhone user looking for a midsize
speaker to listen to music with and
watch videos with then the boom 3 is
your best bet this speaker has the least
amount of latency compared to all of
these other speakers and the bloom 3 is
also good for watching videos even if
you're using an Android device the sony
xba-40 one is also good for watching
videos but only if you're using an
Android device cut is going to have zero
latency but if you use an iPhone then
there is going to be some latency and
unfortunately both with abl speakers
Josa orange suitable for watching videos
because they both have latency whether
you using an iPhone or Android and I
find that weird because the clip three
doesn't have an alien see but it also
doesn't have GB X plus so maybe we ever
correlated but now let's talk about
speaker setups the post three is a 360
degree 21 speaker with a total of three
transducers all under the fabric portion
of its body and it has dual passive
radiators think of the pool three as
they slightly souped up flip 4 with an
extra chance juicer the boom 3 is also
marketed as a 360 degree speaker but
it's really not it has the dual
transducer and dual passive radiators
setup but since the boom 3 shoots all of
its music out of its size there is a
major dead zone on the front and we have
the speaker if you use it outdoors but
if you use the boom 3 indoors since the
music is able to bounce off of walls
then it creates that 360 degree effect
whereas since the post 3 has a triple
tensor setup you still get that 360
degree effect even outdoors so keep that
in mind if you're trying to choose
between the boom 3 and post 3 now the
sony xba-1 is a 30 watt speaker and has
a very traditional forward firing dual
transducer setup and dual passive
radiators in the center that shoots out
the front and at the back of the speaker
whereas the JBL charge 4 is also a 30
watt speaker but has a new symbol over
transducer that's been offset to the
right and dual passive radiators that
shoot out its sides now before you get
all up in arms and to charge for is
obviously worse than the xB 31 and is a
down way from the charge 3 Curtis moving
from a dual transducer to a single one
it has a negatively affected as
performance in any way since the dual
transducers on both the xB 31 in charge
3 are always working in sync
there aren't giving you any left and
right channel separation anyways so
that's why the larger signal transducer
on the charge for isn't a big deal but
now we're gonna jump into a scientist
just so you know the boom 3 is using
it's the standard EQ setting and the xB
31 is playing with its extra base mode
turn-on
stuck in my ways then I've been stuck in
for days I've been staring at the clock
I'm a slave yeah about stopping my
secret speech
all these speakers sound good for
mid-sized speakers now even love the
poetry and charge for shared the same
neutral sound signature with just the
right amount of bass and trouble to keep
most people happy the choice for does
have significantly more bass in the post
3 and the poultry does have the least
amount of bass here compared to these
other speakers even though it's the
smallest speaker here the boom 3 does
have more bass than the pole story and
that's why I like to boom 3 so much even
though it's very small it has no problem
keeping up with larger speakers like to
charge for and XP 31 and Yui also gives
you the ability to adjust its EQ
settings so you can make a sound however
you want depending on the type of music
you listen to
Sony also allows you to adjust exp 30
ones EQ settings and even though it does
have as much space as to charge for it
does struggle a bit when it comes to
clarity so if I drink these speakers
from best to worst it would go as
follows I like to charge for the most
year because it has the best clarity and
bass here
the boom 3 comes in second because it
has better clarity than the XP 31 but
not as much space bar remember the boom
3 is only worth using indoors the XP 31
does come in 3rd cuz even though it has
good bass
I do think clarity could be better and
sound wise the post where he comes in
last because I feel it has the least
amount of clarity and the least I'm
gonna base here but when it comes to max
loudness even though the UE boom 3
sounds pretty good it is the quietest
speaker here and max volume but all
these speakers have no problem for in a
large room with music the pole 3 does
get a little louder than the boom 3 and
it's almost up there with the XP 31 in
charge for but to charge for and XP 31
both get considerably louder than the
post story and suffer from this
distortion and next volume if you plan
on pairing multiple speakers together on
a regular basis then I still highly
advise you invest into JBL's eco system
they have the easiest and fastest way to
pair multiple speakers together you just
pressed a JBL connect plus button on
each speaker and that said the speakers
will figure out the most by themselves
you ease pairing method is also pretty
simple because all you have to do is
drag and drop the speaker's through the
app but objectively JBL's method is
easier cuz you don't even need to open
an app
but both methods still work pretty well
unlike Sony's pairing methods where you
have to press the WPC button on each of
their speakers hope that all of your
stories are perfectly aligned open up
their app click on the change speakers
tab and grab your Lucky's rabbit foot
and hope that you don't get an error
message and sometimes even when you do
manage to successfully pair your sony
speakers together sometimes you get an
echo effect that could only be fixed by
turning all the speakers off and pairing
them back up again what I'm saying is
Sony's pairing method is not always easy
and it's not as foolproof as other
pairing methods so for those reasons I
feel that Sony speakers are great if you
want a single speaker the sony SP 31
brings a lot of bang for its buck it's
very durable and rugged because if it's
enclosed fabric body it has a much
improved light feature from the previous
Sony XP 30 and it has a pretty decent
battery life even though it does get
pretty loud and sounds decent I do feel
it's clarity could be a little better
whereas the boom three is all about
clarity in a very small package if you
need a small rugged speaker that gets
louder than it actually is the boom 3
has a good option and the boom 3 is also
my speaker of choice whenever I'm going
to watch videos I my phone now because
of its low latency but if you want the
all-around best sounding speaker here
then the chars 4 is the way to go even
though it's not all that different from
the charge 3 it does have more bass and
like I said it does sound clearer than
the XP 31 while having the same amount
of bass but if you do plan on taking the
choice for on the go with you then you
do have to be mindful of those exposed
passive radiators but if you plan on
getting more JBL speakers in the future
then you're going to have the best and
easiest pairing method out there and
finally there is a post 3 the pull 3 is
cool and all but it's mostly about looks
like I said earlier is a souped-up floor
for with without a doubt the
best-looking life feature on the market
and the post 3 is going to look awesome
in any bedroom or dorm room but don't
expect it to sound like the charts for
what the post 3 isn't gonna have a
problem filling a large room if the
music instance the post 3 has a triple
transducer setup you're still going to
get that 360 degree effect even outdoors
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
