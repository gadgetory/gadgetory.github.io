a product as i did reviewing the Garmin Fenix
5.
Every time I look at it I'm just blown away
at how good looking, well built, and how capable
it is.
Im going to tell you right now, The Garmin
Fenix 5 is a beast of a fitness tracker first,
and a smart watch second.
This sport watch is made for people how are
fitness addicts who constantly bike, Run,
or go on hikes. this is made for people who
have been hardcore athletes for years now.
It’s completely over kill for me, but i
just love it so much.
And at a starting price of $599.99 this watch
aint cheap.
and if you were to spring for the garmin fenix
5x with the more durable sapphire glass that
will cost you $699.99.
And don't forget, garmin also sells extra
bands made from silicon, suede, and stainless
steel with prices ranging from $49.99 all
the way to $149.99.
what I'm trying to say here is, if you’re
looking into getting this watch i just don't
want you to get sticker shock.
I’ll have links in the description below,
and i’ll try to keep it updated the best
i can so you can get the best deals.
So what should you expect when you drop $600
on a sport watch… well for starters the
packaging is pretty nice. when you lift the
lid youre going to see the garmin fenix 5
front and center in all its stainless steel
glory.
Inside the box you're also going to find its
charging cable, warranty information, and
an instruction manual that i highly suggest
you study cause there will be a pop quiz.
and theres no wall wart, so you'll have to
use your own.
So i picked up what i believe will be the
garmin fenix 5 that most people will get.
Its the slate gray with black silicon wrist
band version.
The overall diameter of the watch is 47mm
with a 1.2 inch diameter screen.
Personally I think this watch is the perfect
size for most men’s wrists.
It’s a little thick, and about 4mm thicker
than the apple watch series 2, but given everything
the garmin fenix 5 can do, its manageable.
You’ve got five buttons on this watch which
are used to navigate through the different
menus and built in features.
and every time you click either button theres
some really good tactile feed back thats lets
you know you've pressed said button.
And no, this screen is not a touch screen.
The actual screen itself looks its best in
direct sunlight.
theres also a back light so you can the screen
in the dark as well.
on the back of the watch you're going to find
a heart rate sensor thats very low profile
to the case but does a great job of consistently
and accurately detecting your heart rate.
the base garmin fenix 5 also comes with silicon
wrist bands that are very comfortable and
perfect for working out in.
They also feature a quick release mechanism
which is great if you want to swap out your
band.
but like i said, they can get a little pricey.
Over all, I'm a very big fan of the design
of the watch.
its very well built, looks great from almost
every angle, and its very unapologetic.
Unlike fitness trackers that try to blend
in or other sport watches that just look bad,
the Garmin Fenix 5 manages to be a very capable
sports watch with very classy looks.
Its made to be out there with you on your
hike, in the mud, or in the water, but will
still be right at home with you in the board
room.
OK, so lets talk about whats under the hood.
The garmin fenix 5 will connect to your phone
via your standard bluetooth and will send
all of its collected data to Garmin’s Connect
app.
More on the app later.
You can also pair a chest mounted heart rate
monitor to the Fenix five.
side note, if you want wifi in your sports
watch, you'll need to get the garmin fenix
5 sapphire edition.
also, another side note, the heart rate sensor
will not work while you're swimming.
The Garmin Fenix five also has few other built
in sensors other than just the heart rate
sensor on the back.
The fenix five also has a Barometric altimeter,
Compass, Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Thermometer
and will connect to GPS and or GLONASS which
is Russia’s version of GPS.
Thanks Google!
The Garmin Fenix Five also has a rechargeable
battery that should last you 2 weeks.
But with normal use, the heart rate sensor
on 24x7, and you using its gps to track your
runs or rides real world battery life is around
a week.
which is still a great battery life none the
less.
sometimes i even forget you have to charge
the thing.
But if you're doing a big race or an actual
triathlon, then the watch should last you
for around 18 hours with every thing turned
on consistently.
and before i forget, the watch is water proof
down to 10 atmospheres which is like 5 more
than i’ll ever need.
I’m not a big fan of fish.
The Garmin Fenix 5 does everything you'd expect
your average fitness tracker to do.
it'll track your sleep if you can manage to
actually sleep with it on.
It tracks your steps, calories burned, distance
traveled, floors climbed, intensity minutes,
and heart rate.
But these reasons alone aren't why you're
interested in the Garmin Fenix 5.
You’ve got some sports that need tracking.
its good for Running both indoors and outdoors,
cycling, swimming either in pools or open
water, trail running, hiking, climbing, mountain
biking, golf, skiing, snowboarding, and the
list just goes on.
But I think the top 3 sports the garmin fenix
5 will be used for are outdoor running, outdoor
cycling or mountain biking, and hiking slash
trail running.
and maybe golf, I've only played golf like
3 times.
When actually using the Fenix 5 while running
it'll track your distance, route, pace, speed,
cadence, heart rate, and timing info.
It'll also display a good chunk of that information
for you directly on the watch face.
the GPS tracking and distance data are also
pretty spot on as well.
The tracking is so precise that it even knows
on which side of the street I'm on instead
of just guesstimating like other sports watches
I've used. and all of the data the garmin
fenix 5 collects is sent over to garmin connect
app on your phone.
And I've said it before, Garmin’s connect
app is a decent very in depth fitness tracking
app that shows you a lot of data other popular
fitness tracking apps like fitbit don't show
you.
But i personally think there is room for improvement
when it comes to the UI. but with that aside
gamin’s connect app does a great job of
breaking down your performance and displaying
your stats in a very easy to read manner.
The garmin fenix 5 also has some smart watch
capabilities.
For starters, yes the watch face is customizable
and you can down load some more from Garmin’s
connect app.
You also get phone notifications, hourly and
daily weather forecasts, and music controls.
nothing on the level of what you'd expect
from an apple watch but of course not, cause
this is a sports watch first.
But there are a few short comings i want to
point out on the fenix five. for starters
theres no native storage for music.
If you could take this watch out with some
wireless ear phones, listen to some music
while you run and leave your phone behind
then the fenix 5 would be complete.
Also, theres not stress tracker like on the
vivosmart 3, its not a must have, but i assumed
it would be there.
Theres also no repping counting functionality
like the vivosmart 3, but again its not a
must have feature.
And finally, at that $599.99 starting price
point I think garmin should have included
the sapphire lens by default.
So lets wrap things up.
we’re just scratching the surface when it
comes to the garmin fenix 5 and what it can
do. and look out for videos in the future
that'll go more in depth.
But the fenix 5 is a bad ass sports watch
that i feel marathon runners, cyclists, and
mountain sports enthusiasts are going to just
love.
its unapologetic rugged design looks great
and will take a beating.
Its great at what it does.
But like i said, not having native storage
for your music does seem like a short coming.
But if you do decide to pick it up you wont
be disappointed.
I know I'm not.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
