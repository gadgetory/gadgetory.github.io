heats up cheaper ANC headphones are
getting better because of the
trickle-down effect and a good example
of this or the new audio technica ath as
our 50 BTS I think these are a pair of
very well rounded headphones that
perform grades and have some very
welcomed features and if it wasn't for
their touchpad
I think these headphones it would be
perfect but first over from one of our
partners before I started using noir VPN
I would never use public Wi-Fi because I
didn't want to risk having my data
exposed which meant any time I traveled
or wasn't at that zone in the city I
would have a little to no internet on my
phone but now with no one VPNs
military-grade encryption I can use
public Wi-Fi and know that my dad it is
safe from would be hackers Nord VPN can
do a lot more but this is one of the
main reasons I use them see how you can
enjoy three years of online security for
only $2.99 a month by clicking on the
link in the description down below the
new audio technica ath sr 50 BTS which
I've christened the surf 50s retell for
$200 that's the same as last year's 88
ANC 700 BT quite point headphones and
for some placing these sakes if you're
looking into getting the quiet point
headphones I recommend you go with the
surf fifties instead if you want to pick
up the audio technica ath sr 50 BTS I'll
have that link down below as always
we're gonna go over what comes in the
box first the surf 50 s come included
with the carrying pouch which I think
feels a little more premium than the
carrying pouch that came included with
the 88 m50x BTS but still if you plan on
traveling with these headphones on or
ela basis I still recommend you invest
in a hard shell carrying case the cert
50s will also come included with a 3.5
to 3.5 mm audio cable now there's no
inline controller or mic on this audio
cable but I think this audio cable is
decent for a pair of 200 all headphones
but unfortunately the surf 50s still
come included with them mic USB cable
for charging and this is one of those
things I feel or really holding these
headphones back in 2019 and so right now
if you want USB C on your headphones
you're gonna have to go for more premium
models like the 1000 x m3 or the surface
headphones and I don't expect audio
technica
adapt USBC anytime soon because then
after new 88 NC 900 bt quite point
headphones at CES 2019 which are also
still using micro USB but micro USB
aside the surf 50 s actually had very
good build quality
they're super lightweight the headband
clicks into position and there's
basically no cracking or squeaking when
flexing the headband but what really
makes these headphones stand out from
other 200 other headphones is that they
can be laid down flat or collapsed and
this is a big deal because usually with
200 all the headphones they can either
only do one or the other and when it
comes to fit these headphones have a
very loose fit just like the 1000 x m3
or both QC 35 which make them great for
long use sessions and they are without a
doubt big had approved and regarding the
surf if these ear cups they're very
spacious and should have no problem
finding people that have large ears or a
ears that stick out a lot
in short the surf 50s are just as
comfortable as the bose qc25 s because
their ear cups are a little more
spacious than the 1000 x m3
now when it comes to tech specs the surf
if these are rocking bluetooth 5.0 and
they're good for watching youtube videos
on your iPhone because they have very
little latency but unfortunately these
headphones can only be connected to one
device at a time which means you can't
hot-swap from one device to another as
easily as say the surface headphones or
bose QC 35 but when it comes to battery
life the surf 50 s have an advertised
battery life of 28 hours which is a
touch above average for headphones these
days and for me I've noticed that I can
go about a week and a half in between
charges for the way that I use them but
unfortunately these headphones don't
have any official fast charging numbers
which I know that if you're a constant
commuter can be pretty important but now
let's talk about the active noise
cancellation on the surf fifties first I
just want to sell expectations here
active noise cancellation across the
board on sub 200 all our ANC headphones
is going to be nowhere near as good as
the ANC found on more premium models and
just so you can see firsthand we're
gonna jump into an ANC test
noise reduction
[Laughter]
noise reduction like you may have just
heard the ANC on the surface headphones
n 1000 x m3 easily block out way more
noise than the surf 50s but it doesn't
mean the ANC on the surf 50s is outright
useless the surf 50s do manage to do a
fair job of blocking out some constant
low-frequency sounds like road noise and
they do so with very minimal cabin
pressure but one of the main reasons I
like to surf 50 so much is cuz they are
one of the only $200 anc headphones out
there that feature both an ambient mode
and quick attention mode similar to the
1000 x m3 Audio Technica calls their
feature here through mode and it allows
you to select how much ambient noise you
would like to headphones to pump in
while you have them on and a feature
like this is very useful if you're
walking around the city or if you're in
an office or at school if someone calls
your name you're still gonna be able to
hear them but the surf if these are also
feature quick here where by pressing the
only button on the left ear cup the
headphones will meet your music and pump
it on all of the ambient sound like this
and this features useful cuz you can
have a quick conversation with someone
without having to take your headphones
off and like I said the surf fifties are
one of the only sub 200 all our agency
headphones out there that has both an
ambient mode and quick attention mode
like the 1000 X and threes because for
comparison the Skullcandy venues have
monitoring mode which is similar to
quick attention but lacks an ambient
mode but still the here through feature
on the surf 50s isn't perfect it's
simply letting in all the ambient sound
and it's now filtering out any of the
excessive noise pollution like the 1000
x m3 zoom which means if there's a loud
bang a dog starts barking or a siren
passes by you're gonna hear all that in
your headphones whereas the 1000 X and
threes are smart enough to block out
those sudden loud sounds and save you
from jump scares and from going death
but features aside let's talk about
sound quality the surf 50s have a
neutral sound signature that's all about
clarity and honestly I don't have any
bad things to say about these headphones
when it comes to sound quality their
bass resonates nice and deep and it
never bottoms out the soundstage is wide
in some a separation is good and the
highest-ever get Tinian but just keep in
mind these are neutral sounding
headphones if you're looking for
something that's going on rock your head
when the bass guys going DS amen and
unfortunately Audio Technica doesn't
allow you to adjust the EQ on these
headphones through their app and I think
that's done on purpose cuz they don't
want you messing up their headphones
already awesome sound signature but now
let's talk about something that's not so
awesome on the surf 50s and that's the
touch controls first off the touch
controls on these headphones are on the
left ear cup which i think is a bad
choice on audio Technica's part because
the majority of the population is
right-handed so as a righty it does take
some time to get used to using the touch
controls on these headphones and even
after that it still feels a little weird
but in order to play a positive music
you just press once on the audio
technica logo and if you want to skip or
go back a track you swipe up or down on
the left ear cup and after you get the
hang of it it works ok but I found
trying to adjust a volume using the
toast controls is just too much of a
hassle
you're supposed to press right up
above or below the logo to adjust a
volume but it almost never works on the
first try so I just skip the headache
and whip out my phone to adjust volume
every single time but you can cycle from
having anc turned on here through or
just having those features turn off by
completely covering the touchpad which
is nice but still I think audio technica
would be much better off if they just
use physical buttons instead of trying
to keep up with the cool kids by
insisting on using a touchpad that
causes more problems than it should and
finally here is the microphone test and
just like most other headphones out
there and the microphone isn't that
great but this audio clip is being
recorded by the microphone panel on the
audio technica ath s rs.50 B keys but
overall I really do like the SR 50 BTS
and if it wasn't for their imperfect
touch controls and lack of USB C I think
these would be hands-down the best sub
$200 neutral sounding agency headphones
on the market right now but still if you
can look past the lack of USB C and 2019
and in perfect touch controls that sort
of 50 BT's or a great pair of headphones
they have very good build quality
they're very comfortable to wear they
sound very good and I think they look
good but what really makes these
headphones stand out for me is they are
here through and quick here through
features a lot of others sub 200 all our
ANC headphones have both of these
features if you made it this far
