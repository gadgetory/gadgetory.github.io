Sony WH 1000 X and 3 a and C headphones
and it's with a good reason the m3s got
all of the great technology found in the
m2 s
and improved on them and pack them
inside a much better body but I know
some people just can't afford to drop
350 dollars on a pair of anc headphones
or there might just be hesitant to
upgrade from there and twos so here's
how the new sony 1000 X and 3's compared
to the older Sony 1000x m2 s how my 1000
X and twos have held up after a year of
heavy usage and do you really need to
upgrade to the 1000 X and threes the new
Sony 1000 XM - are currently or year old
now cuz they came out in September of
2017
initially they used to retail for $350
like the current 1000 x m3 is do now
but now the 1000 XM tubes are currently
retailing for $298 if you want to pick
either these headphones up I'll have a
little description below and if you use
the links it really helps out to channel
I suggest you check them out because so
many cell phones routinely go on sale so
you might get lucky and if you want to
watch the full review on the sony WH
1000 XM 3 click on the eye icon above
and also sharpen your shelf down below
everything on the 1000 x m3 has been
changed from the 1000 x m2 even the
accessories the hard shell carrying case
of the m3s is slightly larger than the
m2 s case it has a color matching fabric
front and there's even a compartment on
the inside for storing your cables I
like both cases just fine but I will
admit having that little storage
compartment is pretty convenient with
the 1000 X in the twos case I have to
store my audio cable in the back pocket
so it doesn't look as clean as the 1000
x m3 and speaking of the audio cable one
of the things that peeves me about the
m3 is its included audio cable it's much
cheaper and shorter than the audio cable
that comes included with the M choose
the m3s audio cable is the same as the
watch 700 ends audio cable and those
headphones cost half as much as a
content creator this is a big deal cuz
with the m3s cable I don't have as much
slack and I'm afraid is going to wear
out much faster but the new USBC 2 USB a
charging cable of the m3s
feels
much nicer than the enthused microUSB
charging cable I just wish it wasn't so
short now we can actually start talking
about the headphones the
first-generation MDR 1000x got a bad
reputation because a lot of people
suffer from cracking on the plastic body
panels of the headband from seemingly
normal wear even though I didn't
experience crack body panels when I had
the og 1000x
one of my friends did but after your
heavy usage on my 1000 xm2 I still don't
see any evidence of cracking on my
headband plus my headphones have to
stretch a good amount because I do have
a big head but that's one of the biggest
upgrades on the 1000 X and 3 from the
1000 XM to build quality across the
board has been improved tolerance is a
much tighter on the m3 is that there's a
lot less creaking when you flex the
headband and the ear cups pivot and
swivel much smoother than the m2 the
headband on the m3s is also a little
thinner than the headband on the m2 but
one of the most underrated changes on
the m3s from the m2 s is the exterior of
the ear cups the whole ear cup is now
covered in soft touch material which
feels very nice when you hold these
headphones and be awful looking texture
faux leather covering the ear cups and
the m2 s is finally gone and finally the
only two physical buttons found on these
two headphones have also been improved
but perhaps the most important
difference between the 1000x m2 and the
new 1000 X + 3 is the fit the entries
have significantly more padding
underneath its headband and em2 's I
would say it's a little more than
doubled but more importantly the ear
cups on the m3s are significantly more
spacious than the ear cups at the m2 I
know that after a while you get used to
the m2 scrams ear cups but the m3 is New
York of design and just spoil you any
time I was at the airport EMTs and I saw
someone wearing the bose qc25
I would think I know I have the better
tech but I know your ears are more
comfortable but not anymore with the M
trees since the ear cups on the m3s are
bigger and since there's less padding in
contact with your skin
the m3 suffer from significantly less
overheating than the m2 s and even after
a year of heavy usage wearing terror on
the faux leather on the M twos is still
pretty close to new but even though the
ear cups on the entries are much more
spacious than the ear cups on the M twos
the m3 is are much
low profile in your head which is us
make them look all around better now
even though the 1000 xm3 have better
build quality improve comfort or 20
grams lighter and just look better I
know that for some people that still
won't constitute a reason for upgrading
when it comes to tax packs the new 1000
X + 3 is now charged via a USB C port
instead of a micro USB port like on the
m2 and you can only use this port for
charging both the 1000 X + 3 + 1000 x m2
are still rocking a 30 hour battery life
and that's with ANC turned on he can
squeeze a little bit more battery life
out of them if you use them with ANC
turned off for me the m2 is usually will
ask me about 2 weeks in between charges
but battery life on both of these
headphones is still way above average
compared to other and C headphones out
there the only battery difference
between the m2 s and the M threes is
fast charging if you plug the m3s in for
10 minutes from a dead battery you're
gonna get 5 hours of playback time
versus the M twos which are only gonna
get you one hour playback time even
though the 1000 X and 3s have been
upgraded to Bluetooth 4.2 from Bluetooth
4.1 they still perform the same as DM
twos the connection is stable but
there's still a little bit of latency
when watching YouTube videos you still
have so many dsee and other technologies
and you can still only connect to one
device at a time which honestly is one
of the biggest bummer is on both of
these headphones over the past year the
sony 1000 XM to have been my gold
standard when it came to active noise
cancellation they managed to block out
the most men annoys with very little to
no cabin pressure and that's why I would
always compare other ANC headphones to
the M twos and believe it or not the
1000 x m3 is actually managed to block
out a little more noise than the 1000 X
and choose across-the-board both of
these headphones have atmospheric
pressure sensors built in but the m3s
have Sony's new Q and one processor
which analyzes the ambient sound and it
also has a built in amplifier for your
music
noise canceling most agency headphones
have no problem blocking out constant
low-frequency sounds like road noise but
will meet the 1000 XM to stand out for
me was that they were also able to block
out significantly more chatter than
other headphones all while still having
very little cabin pressure and I don't
know how Sony did it but the 1000x m3 is
do manage to block out a little more
noise than the m2 z-- it's not a
game-changing difference but a
difference nonetheless
but another thing I've always liked
about the m2 over other anc headphones
is that they pick up with very little
wind noise and this is thanks to the
recessed ANC microphones since they
aren't as exposed on either of these
headphones you get very little whooshing
in the background of your music when
you're using these headphones outdoors
when it comes to sound quality the
sodium 1000 xm3 still sounds very
similar to the 1000x m2 and that's not a
bad thing and thanks to so nice
headphones yep you can adjust a eq on
either of these headphones so you can
make them sound however you like
depending on what type of music you
listen to
but the biggest difference between the
sound of the M 3 and M 2 is that the
bass on the m3 manages to get deeper and
stays cleaner you're not going to get
bass head levels a bass where your head
is rattling but since it takes much more
for the bass on the m3 Sebata mouth it
does provide an overall better listening
experience and to control your music
playback on the 1000x and threes you
still have the same touch controls on
the right ear cup like another one does
an accent 2 and the touchpad on the m3s
performs exactly the same as the m2 and
after using the touch controls on the
enthuse for almost a year now
this becomes second nature to me I'm
indifferent when it comes to choosing
between physical control buttons like on
the Bose QC 35 or using the touchpad on
the enthuse buttons the touchpad is one
of the more
pure ones out there I'm fine with either
or but still my favorite feature of the
touchpad on both of these headphones is
quick attention this feature is super
handy when you are traveling you can
talk to people without having to take
your headphones off it's a very very
elegant solution
but one of the biggest upgrades the 1000
xm2 got over the summer was Google
assisted integration and the Empress
also have this but in order to use this
feature you have to sacrifice your NC
ambient sound by you know which does
suck but if you're a Google system power
user then this feature comes in is very
handy it's much more faster and
efficient than pressing and holding on
touchpad you just press and talk like
this is chick-fil-a open chick-fil-a
sponsor me please chick-fil-a is
normally open at this time on Mondays
and closes at 10:00 p.m. but these hours
may be affected by Labor Day
and finally the microphone on the 1000x
and three has also been approved from
the microphone on the 1000 XM - there's
no static and echo way cuz for
comparison whenever I took a phone call
with the 1000 X and two people would
always complain about the audio
so overall the news sony WH 1000 XM 3
have a whole bunch of new small upgrades
that really do add up the sony 1000 xm3
have better build quality they fit
better they look better their bass
sounds better and they block out a
little more noise but like I said in the
full review you don't really need to
upgrade but you'll be really happy if
you did mostly because of the fit and
bass but still if you decide to stick
with or pick up the sony 1000 XM 2 then
you still be getting what I think or the
number 2 best agency headphones right
now because unless bows or Sennheiser
put something out the title of
number-one best agency headphones
currently belongs to the Sony WH 1000 X
and 3 now remember this isn't a full
review on the sony 1000 x + 3 for that
please watch the full review because
even though I really like the 1000 X and
threes they're still not perfect if you
made it this far I guess you enjoyed the
video so hit that like button and get
