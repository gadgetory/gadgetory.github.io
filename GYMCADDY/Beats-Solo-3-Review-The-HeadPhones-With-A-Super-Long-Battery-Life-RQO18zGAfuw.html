powerbeats three the solo three look
almost identical to the previous
generation counterpart the real upgrade
here is all under the hood these bad
boys retail for $2.99 95 and they come
in eight different colors these
headphones work the money let's find out
the packaging here is much better than
the powerbeats 3 we reviewed a few weeks
back first you're gonna find the
headphones themselves inside the
carrying case more in the case in a few
under that you're gonna find some
documentation or into information and a
beach sticker if you want to give them
free promo underneath all of that you're
gonna find the cable with an inline
controller fairly similar to the ones
found out of Palm Beach 3 a carabiner
that you can attach to the carrying case
and a micro USB cable you have to bring
your own wall board for this one and
it's kind of disappointing that phones
themselves are made mostly out of
plastic we've got the glossy white
version here which is just going to be a
fingerprint magnet the headband itself
is padded and has a rubber feel to it so
it stays in place when it's on your head
the air comes themselves are very supple
and look to be made out of leather but
who knows it could be faux leather the
headphones are lightweight and
comfortable enough to wear all day long
although they fit rather snug the super
soft ear cups get my delicate and dainty
ears cool and comfortable even after
extended use the hinges were made out of
the metal and allow for the headphones
to fold and get compact for storage and
travel only time will tell if the hinges
will stand up to extended views build
quality of the solo 3 is ok no beats has
never really been known for their build
or sound quality but where beats is
currently excelling right now is in the
battery life Department the beats solo 3
has a drastically improved battery life
of 40 hours versus the 12 hours of the
beats solo2 offer the beats solo 3 also
has fast fuel which will get you 3 hours
of playing from just 5 minutes of
charging I like that on the bottom of
the right ear cup you're gonna find the
power button when they turn on they will
show you a fuel gauge reminiscent to the
one on a Macbook that will show you the
current battery level the beats volute 3
in charge of your micro USB cable which
I find odd because I thought Apple would
have swapped it out for a lightning port
by now just like the power beats 3 the
beats solo 3 also features Apple's new
w1 chip that was introduced back in
September in their iPhone 7 keynote the
W 1 chip helps these earphones be energy
efficient all while providing a strong
and clear wireless connection with your
Apple devices
I found these headphones have a 50 foot
range with direct line of sight and no
obstacles in the way
pairing is super easy it's almost
automatic the
Porter's the w1 chip allows for the
headphones to automatically pair with
all other Apple devices associated to
iCloud account this means if you're
listening to music on your iPhone but
then you want to listen to music or
watching videos on your Mac iPad or
Apple watch all you have to do is switch
the source onset device this is a taste
of Apple's truly wireless and hassle
free future now don't worry if you don't
have an iPhone or a deeply embedded into
Apple's ecosystem the beats solo 3 can
still connect to non Apple devices via
standard Bluetooth just press and hold
the power button for 5 seconds to start
the pairing process to connect with your
Android device the sound quality
headphones is practically the same as a
powerbeats2 they do have a deep bass and
are best suited for hip-hop R&amp;amp;B techno
or dance music you can control your
music by pressing one of the three
buttons found on the left ear cup press
up or down to adjust the volume press
the beats logo once to play or pause
your music double tap the beats logo to
skip a song triple tap the beats logo to
go back a track or press and hold the
beats logo to activate Siri you can also
accept or end cause by pressing the
beats logo as well these headphones have
a built-in microphone so you can argue
with the Siri or wirelessly take calls
now you may be wondering what about to
include a cable does it help great
questions Jimmy yes
can I click the headphones directly to
your phone does improve the sound
quality slightly not drastically when
using a wired connection the headphones
won't draw power from their internal
battery and all control functions will
be moved to the inline controller it's a
great option if you can't connect to
bluetooth for some reason or if your
battery is completely dead the carrying
case here is a letdown yet again like
the poppy spray I don't know this is a
form of cost-cutting on apples or beets
behalf but if I'm paying upwards of $300
for some headphones I would expect to
get a decent carrying case that will
protect them from getting crushed in my
bag the case offers minimal padding and
is water-resistant at least so what's
the verdict on the Beats lo3 it's a
mixed bag they aren't the best sounding
headphones on the market the build
quality is okay and they're pretty
expensive on the other hand they have a
battery life that's just ridiculously
long and are huge convenience if you
have multiple Apple devices if you're
looking for headphones to work out with
then you should consider the powerbase 3
or the jrx 3 links to the video reviews
and where buy them are in the
description but if you're a young
professional that's looking for a pair
of headphones to listen to music while
commuting back home then the beats solo
3 is worth looking at the cushion know
that your
offer passive noise cancellation so you
can listen to your music or watch the
videos in the loudest buses subways
trains ferries or airplanes the super
long battery life also helps ensure they
won't down on you mid commute links to
buy the beats solo 3 will be in the
description below well if you made it
