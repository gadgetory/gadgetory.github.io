error-prone which I feel or currently if
the best wireless earbuds j-bert has to
offer chambered has updated their truly
wireless here but with their new j-bert
run xt and even though they might not be
all that different from the original
table run the run xt do have one major
improvement over the original Jaybirds
wireless urban lineup for 2019 currently
consists of the entry-level Terim which
retells for $99.99 the classic jaybird
x4 which we chose for one $29.99 the
super impressive and highly recommended
J Betar prohm which retails for one
$59.99 and the truly wireless deeper to
run xt which retails for one in $79.99
if you want to pick any of these earbuds
up I'll have them a link down below on
the outside the J padrone xt is
virtually unchanged from the original
j-bird run they have the exact same
Georgian case and are still using mic
USB for charging and when it comes to
the earbuds themselves again they're
exactly the same they're not any smaller
and they're still using the same ear tip
in orphan fitting system just like
before the only physical difference
between the jaybird run and Rennicks
team is that the Rennicks t or now both
sweat proof and ipx7 rated waterproof
because with the original j-bird run
they were only sweat resistant so
theoretically you could swim with the r
NX t if you wanted to but unfortunately
when it comes to tech specs the run xt
remain virtually unchanged they have the
same 12 hours of total playback time
like the original j-bird run and they
have the same fast charging where 5
minutes in the case well when we get you
one hour of playback time but the
biggest letdown is that the run xt are
still suffering from intermittent
connection issues just like the original
j-bird run now the connection issues
isn't as bad as when the j-bird run were
first released but you will notice the
left ear bud will cut in and out on
occasion but regardless if you're
somebody that likes to watch youtube
videos while running on a treadmill then
D 0 by
or a horde pass because they have a lot
of latency when watching videos on an
iPhone so I'm just gonna cut to the
chase if you're looking to get a pair of
JB earbuds I highly recommend you get
the j-bert error-prone over the j-pod
run X team you can watch that full
review by tapping on the I icon above
it's just hard to recommend the jpr NXT
over the Terra pro after day bird truly
outdid themselves with the Terra Pro the
Terra pro has some of the best battery
life and fast charging on the market
right now they're super durable you can
wear them in two different ways and they
don't suffer from a high amount of
latency like to run XT do and to be as
transparent as possible I still prefer
to use wired Bluetooth earbuds at the
gym like the Terra Pro versus truly
wireless earbuds because you don't have
to compromise as much wired air but
typically have longer battery lives
better fast charging cost less and have
that all-important inline controller and
from a marketing standpoint I think it's
very wise Jaber didn't name their new
earbuds the jaybird run too but here's
my wish list for the future Jaber run to
that I think is pretty reasonable
first off starting with the case I would
like to see J put incorporate magnets so
that when you drop your earbuds in they
automatically align themselves and with
the magnets you lower your chances of
dropping your earbuds on the dirties and
Floren when you're putting them in or
taking them out of the case and besides
magnetically aligning earbuds is pretty
common with a lot of other truly
Wireless your butts out there what else
would like to see Jaber swap out the
micro USB port on their case for a USB C
port instead and when it comes to
battery life I would like to see the
j-bird run to to have a total playback
time of 24 hours like the air pods
I think a four hour charge on the
earbuds is decent so that means we'll
have to see a denser battery in the
charging case itself now when it comes
to the ear buds I wouldn't be surprised
if j-bird did away with the two-piece
ear tip and orphan system and instead
decided to use the one-piece ear gel
system found on their new Tara models
and I personally would imagine but most
importantly jaybird has to improve the
connection stability under truly worldly
surebut skits it's the biggest thing
preventing me from recommending them and
I know it's harder sending them they
probably have to redesign whole thing
but from a software standpoint I would
also like to see the j-bird run to to
have an ambient aware feature where
they'll pump in the ambient sound around
you so you can still hear what's going
on if you're running through the park or
in the city this is a very important
feature that's starting to become pretty
standard on a lot of other sports
wireless earbuds as well and since
jaybird has always outdone themselves
with their tapered app I would be a mess
after jaybird run - they don't have this
feature but overall both DJ but run and
JPA Ronix team get a few things right
they both fit well they both sound good
the charging cases are on huge and the
total battery lives are decent but still
have room for improvement but
unfortunately at $180 intermittent
connection issues is just very hard to
ignore and forgive so like I mentioned
earlier in the video if you're looking
into getting a pair of jaybird earbuds
do yourself a favor and pick up the J
Betar Pro because in general those are
one of the best sports wireless earbuds
on the market right now
