we're like yeah yeah
is there anybody here
okay we have Winston okay so sorry about
that we got a phone call and it kind of
like just paused the livestream all
right we got alright everyone's coming
back everybody back okay yeah like I
said it was the first time we're trying
this out I have no idea what I'm doing
but I try to do a little bit every time
so would you guys for me it was just a
phone call that stopped it okay don't
call us back chances are they welcome
alright so last time we left on the lg
pk7 does the lender of a speaker is dead
there is no juice
come on camera no no it wasn't the
cameraman cracker is not my fault so
well we're opening this up let's talk
about if so I think the biggest thing
that got a noise and I have faced so far
personally already Sony 1000 XM agrees
I've been oh wait can you guys hear us
over the AC hello you're still alive
yeah but how many people in the street
you got nineteen Oh came back I got like
42 new headphones Sennheiser are dead in
fact announced new headphones okay okay
so these are fun really quick these are
LG's charging things we're gonna we're
gonna unravel this really cool and I'll
tell you about Sennheiser while we're at
it
so Sennheiser unknowns a new truly
Wireless pair of wireless earbuds and
dirt going for two 99.95 I forget their
name but they're you know they're truly
Wireless and personally I think paying
more than $200 from Terran truly
wireless earbuds is way too much is way
too much if I'm paying more than two
hundred dollars for a pair of headphones
then I'm just gonna want to get no I'm
sorry if I'm paying more than two
hundred dollars for a pair of wireless
headphones your buds actually I want to
either get a pair of them actual
headphones
okay DC in alright so this is gonna
charge in here ports we got it here we
have um we have a launch tag we said how
long I can pair up another speaker two
this that speaker okay so while this
thing charges up I may not know what I'm
doing but I do have notes and why is
this not turning on is my iPad really
not working up there it is there it is
okay I may not know what I'm doing but I
do have notes I came somewhat prepared
all right so just give it a second okay
so Sam Houser cameraman that's on give a
look to the iPad so Sennheiser put out
these it's so loading wearable audio oh
there it is
so some Heiser put out these new truly
wireless earbuds and these guys are
going for 200 99.95 personally for me I
wouldn't pay 200 more than 200 olives
for a pair of wireless earbuds cuz if
I'm paying more than $200 I would rather
get a pair of headphones and right now
the Wachau 700 and come to mind these
are a good pair of 200 all the
headphones but these guys have been
going on sale for like 150 over 130 and
on Black Friday they went to as low as
$99 so so yeah I don't know what the
craze is about all these sports about
all these wireless earbuds but
definitely not my cup of tea but but and
actually talking about sports wireless
earbuds Audio Technica also put out a
pair of new truly Wireless hearing butts
they put out this sports version they
only have like three and a half hours of
battery life per charge and I think the
case gives them like an extra two
charges and hold on cutest and
audio-technica also put out these larger
white truly wireless earbuds and these
are significantly more expensive so like
I said these these things are just too
big and for all this money I would
rather get a pair of headphones and
unfortunately you just got a donation
from JB Oh bass oh cool $0.99 thanks
guys um I know I'm like tripping over
everything here he wants a shadow you
want a shout-out what's your name JBL
bass thank you bro um so so where was I
so you know talking about headphones
I don't worry yeah I mean just well yes
speakers JBL bass just donate a dollar
in 99 that's another two dollars bro
thank you um so anyway let's see here -
hot so also they want to know what tier
what do you more most anticipating well
like your favorite thing Oh from from
esse yeah 1000 xm3 it's definitely
whoo what's your question
Michael and Michael thanks you thank you
it's another buck okay so cooler what is
foolish question yeah so I was most
excited about the sony 1000x and freeze
the XP v OG has usually yes dear the new
key so here actually have that picture
up here here come in zoom out a little
bit so so the new sony yeah the sony
xba-1 g is a smart speaker that's still
portable it's kind of like a shrunken
down XP 60 and it's going to be going up
against the JBL extreme - it's it's
bigger than the xv-21 and like I said as
mobile assistant
so you can see it has a dual transducers
and a big ol subwoofer down there so
we're gonna have to see what sound
quality is going to be like because
unfortunately this speaker doesn't have
any tweeters so that's kind of like
waste of space I think I think they're
short at least have a pair of tweezers
on your speaker because you know it's
just so it's so big
XP 5 1 G versus extreme - yeah
definitely and I'm also going to be
comparing it up against the X beam what
do you want camera zoom out do you like
do you like bows and if not why isn't
that that I don't like bows it's not
that all right it's not that I don't
like bows in a book when it comes to the
Bulls qc3 5-series chew versus these
sony 1000 x 10 - hands down those are
the bows or more
comfortable and they have much higher
build quality and that was the biggest
issue with the solar 1000 xm2 I have no
problem telling you that these
headphones have perhaps the best
technology packed into them they have
the best thing in scene they cancel out
the most sound and they do it without
having so much cabinet pressure on it
because that's one of the biggest issues
with Boz's
like me I'm a dainty little flowers so I
can't get used to Bose as cabin pressure
so anytime I put them on and I use them
for extended periods of time you just
feel that pressure automation against
your enemies okay
all right JBL bass says thanks Brooke
hey do you know when Jay Bueller story
is going to come out
thank you and actually yes so the JBL
charge 3 it's coming out in October in
their press release I think they said it
was going to be 179 euros so I don't
know how much that converts into
American dollars but it should be about
$150 as well I actually have those notes
here as well in your circuit and I don't
know I'm kind of worried about the JB oh
it's on a charge 3 because it doesn't
seem too different from the charge no no
I'm worried about to charge for cuz it
doesn't seem too different from the
charge 3 because here's the charge port
okay the camera man get in there right
yeah it's it's it's a shrunken down
extreme - so you have so you have the
plastic passive radiators here while the
proportions are the same and I want to
say that the end caps are
more stylized but spec wise didn't it
doesn't look it doesn't look too
different because look they go this is
what the press release says lasts as
long as you do it has a 20 hour battery
charge 3 it's wireless obviously so as
to charge 3 ie px5 waterproof so
instacharge three and it has Jamie I'll
connect plus 2 charge 3 so I don't know
when when we saw when we saw the extreme
to come out it was a you know pretty
significant change from the old extreme
the proportions are different the old
quality was improved heavier what else
but and sound quality was improved and
they changed the speaker layout as well
the transducers or the different size
and the tweeters are smaller if I
remember and most importantly the
extreme to God J do connect plus
something that the extreme something
that the extreme one wasn't gonna get
just cuz of bluetooth on limitations so
it was if you had if you had actually I
haven't even turn is going up so if you
have newer JBL speakers like the corpus
3 that I have back here before if you
wanted to pair in the extreme one to
those speakers you could but the torch 3
since there was a little newer than the
extreme one actually got that company so
I don't know I'm kind of underwhelmed
when it comes to the choice floor
you had two questions one what's the
difference between stereo and party mode
for the JBL and two we're gonna review
any Sony's that's okay the difference
between party mode and stereo so party
mode is that you get all your speakers
and they're going to play in sync so
they're going to play exactly the same
on each of the speakers but stereo
moment if you get two extra tubes or if
you get to pull squeeze or if you get to
charge these two of the same speakers
then they're going to play in left or
right stereo mode so the music you know
how like sometimes you have songs and I
can hear the drums go this side and then
you hear the drums go on on that side so
you hear the music moving that's what
stereo mode does so you can you can hear
the music move if that makes sense
partially I don't know why JBL does that
well you have to have to move the same
speakers to get stereo mode because Bo's
they let you have stereo mode on two
different speakers two different models
just got another donation from the same
guy JBL bass thank you thank you
actually you know all those donations
are going to go towards to improving the
content of this video you know just
going back to the
1,000 accent fries I'm really excited to
get that get that get those headphones
on the channel I actually already
ordered mine and they should be here
tomorrow because I ordered rush shipping
on that I wasn't even gonna chance it I
said you know what I need these right
now uh I'm really excited enough for
coming out I I didn't expect them at all
I really thought the m2 or going to be
Sony's ANC's headphones for like another
gear just cause they're so good but now
that they're coming I'm excited to have
them but I am a little disappointed that
they don't have better hardware to make
better videos because I was really
looking forward to getting the elbonian
S but just the price and their
availability I'm not gonna be able to
have that piece of equipment to work on
that video which we're going to be
coming out possibly mid-september
so I guess I'm gonna have to pull the
Deadpool and just try to make something
decent we have like a minimum budget or
equipment so so you know I think I've
grown as a creator I like to think so
like I said I haven't I still have no
idea what I'm doing but I try to do a
little better every time so now that I
have another year of experience making
content hopefully I'll be able to make
the video for the entries that will do
it justice and like I just mentioned
that video won't be out like the actual
review in the actual vs. video it won't
be out until like mid-september
just because I want to make sure I take
my time with those headphones actually
get to know them and if I finally ports
I'll let you guys know so just so just
so I don't want to steal them out
another donation from JBL base another
question are you gonna review the elect
Explorer 8 what you like to explore
so the XP 950 n-words yeah I mean really
disappointed that we didn't see an
updated version of the XP 950 n ones
because I really thought we were gonna
see them I think maybe what Sony did was
that to keep eyes on the m3s
they didn't announce any other pair of
wireless headphones Joe so that
everybody focuses on the m3 and maybe
we'll see the updated version of the
experiment at the N ones and see as 2018
and 92091 when the M choose came out the
end choose and the Huron shoes were
actually announced well at the same time
I think and when I reviewed the M shoes
it wasn't until like a few weeks later
that I even heard about the Huron - oh
my god where did these headphones come
so I think so I think what they're doing
is you got the entries you're gonna let
the spotlight shine on the increase for
a little bit and then SC yes no don't
put out the XP 950 unwise
you know it'll be able to sign it's only
well which one do you prefer the new
Sony or the new JBL's that's all we put
are you talking about the AKG I think is
like the end 700 and C's I got those two
speakers speakers on the party box are
we talking about the party box let's see
I have the 40 bucks here to the party
box came out
yeah no weird yes yeah party box this
thing came out of nowhere I did not see
this thing coming when I saw it I
thought I thought it was a joke I don't
know how I feel about the design I think
the xp6 CMDs p90 their their life
feature look so it doesn't look as gaudy
but who knows if they incorporated the
post threes whatever technology they got
going on and upholsteries into the rings
of the party box it could be interesting
uh let's see I mean do you like to
design I like yes I like these on USB 6
maybe's design a little better and i
don't know if people have actually seen
this picture yet this that's that's
that's where that's where son that's
where that's where reference that's
about three and a half feet I think
right 300 feet
oh that's big that's big nice big all
right let's see this guy guys about my
size all right so let's imagine me going
like this that's the boom box
so imagine huh it's to be to carry like
in the picture what else
how are you j-bird run on runs holding
up
Perry has gotten better through the
stability is still good but they still
they do still
they lag like I am right now sometimes
they like this connect from one another
so maybe the new wireless earbuds that
were being announced
I have faith today they're using
Qualcomm's new chip because welcome
understand you chips a few months ago we
were saying that supposed to have a very
light and a Bluetooth connection
stability so hopefully these new
generation of wireless earbuds they'll
they'll be better any more questions
no I actually don't thank we're gonna
have to look into that alright comes
down it comes down to your budget Zack
the he won't choose or or good but they
do stick out like a lot they stick out
more than the they stick out more than
you to what I've been hearing about the
new m3 is that they're supposed to be a
lot more low-profile so my hair
okay so you see only the M twos they
stick out a lot actually I have the
orchards here so you see how the M to
stick out a lot if you get to watch
shows to watch the 700 and
these guys are much more low-profile the
Bose headphones our BOCES headphones are
a lot more like around this road they're
much more low-profile
so if you think the end choose stick out
a lot
the here on Tues stick out even more so
it comes down to like a design
preference what i've been hearing about
the entries is that they're supposed to
be a lot more low-profile so again we'll
see that on saturday whenever i do in
the alive unboxing we do that but yeah
how much it's a party bucks comments at
the party box I got all of this is in
euros so there's actually two party
boxes yeah there's two but two party
boxes there's the party box 200 and the
40 bucks 300 one's gonna be going for
379 euros the other one's going to be
going for 449 euros so again we gotta
wait until we get American dollars see
what that is going to look like if I'm a
betting man since its JBL I don't know
if JBL would make a party box cheaper
than the boombox and this is a $450
speaker maybe we're looking at about
$500 for the 40 bucks 200 maybe
600 for the party bucks at 3 or who
knows I don't see them discontinuing the
boombox but or maybe maybe they'll price
the boombox and the party box 200 around
the same price but they'll have like
therefore build qualities to them
different features so so we'll have to
see that was actually do you think is
gonna be waterproof actually I can't
tell you right now we got the press
release right here let's see the party
box returns are combined powerful
high-energy sound if ever lighting first
RCA input coburn JBL a signature sound
light shows portable here's the thing
that has me confused about the party box
is that they're saying is that a head of
10,000 million power battery and it was
good for 18 hours of playback time
that's the party box 300 it correct me
if I'm wrong but doesn't the extreme to
have a 10,000 milliamp hour battery I
think I think that's what the extreme to
last so I have no idea how this huge
speaker is going to have that much of a
battery life especially because the
boombox has I think a 200 thousand
milliamp hour battery so I think that my
video typo on the round because yes it's
ten thousand not 100 pounds
I don't know I connected connect
compatible speakers together wirelessly
to 100 there's been a development the
party box doesn't have to be looking at
clubs
it says TWU was an RCA connect to
compatible speakers wirelessly via tws
true wireless stereo using Bluetooth
connection up to two party speakers or
wired you know one or C output to
another that's that's a huge deal
breaker that's a huge deal breaker I I
was under the assumption that the party
much was going to to be able to pair up
to other JBL speakers
and that's yeah that's a huge deal
Terrence wants to know or you know
review any G bird products yeah
absolutely the exporters once they come
in and are there any other new j-bert
products that don't that something I
have that I have those own pulled over
radio to read a second yeah so I'm also
excited for the exports cause the export
I've always liked the expertise I
remember the first time I saw the X 3s
were on m'kay m'kay m'kay pH DS video
and I'm just so like excited like
stumbling over my words I remember
seeing them there and I've always I've
always really liked them because they've
always been a rugged 130 isn't bad they
go on sale on Amazon for like a hundred
bucks usually the only thing I don't
like about them is the way that you got
a choice we got to use that clip so when
I was researching the SP for the J Brand
exports the exporters are also going to
be using that same Georgian clip let's
see if we got here
yeah if you if you look at the product
list you can see that the 10 min give me
a little zoom look here if you can see
the X the X fours are still gonna have
that little proprietary charging Club so
so so that that's one of the drawbacks
we really like to see us be seen but
they probably didn't include it just to
save space either for electronics radio
electronics for like radios batteries
legit cracker wants to know do you feel
like extreme - no yeah I like I like the
extreme - um I like their tree - um the
clip 3 is perhaps my most used speaker
throughout the day because I like to
listen to it for like podcasts any
defenses like video watching experiences
but the extreme - whenever I'm like
gonna be in the studio filming or
something getting b-roll or April
usually people
I'll have the extreme - playing in the
background because you know it plays it
plays well and you know I can't have the
boombox going all the time cause it's
just gonna start shaking the walls and
everything but I like the extreme - I
like the improvement but I do wish the
improvements were a little bit more
significant like I said if I remember
correctly this is a 10,000 milliamp hour
battery
I would like to see maybe a 12 or 15
thousand milliamp hour battery the one
thing I still do hate about the extreme
- which drives me nuts how that really
hurt isn't these hooks I absolutely hate
these hooks um but other than that I
haven't had any word
are you are gonna review the party box
and when can you expect it the party box
will probably make an appearance on the
channel maybe I'll put it up against the
XP 90 but that that review might be out
a little later since the holiday season
is coming up you know there's a lot of
videos I definitely go into the
production and whatnot I'm trying to up
the quality so I think there are some
videos so products that do take priority
over other ones but if you guys want a
party box we will figure something out
I'll answer
yeah that new quick charging on the m3s
is significant so what so for what's
your favorite speaker of any brand like
overall
I don't know I think clip three for
podcast like this thing is like glue on
my hip
but but it's a toss-up between the boom
box and get stream to boombox definitely
if I'm home and if I can put the music
really loud extreme - if I'm gotta take
it to a friend's house or something like
that
definitely extreme - if I can only pick
one only pick one
I think I would really extreme - just
cuz it could be more versatile than
forget your but my thoughts exactly so
so so the question is lighter than
sennheiser released new headphones
forget your buds that i think oh no your
phone just died I think that was exactly
what I was thinking when I saw a
sennheiser announced
I said I can't
yeah when it comes to AMC handfuls
the big players like it or not is the
Beats Studio for use the bose qc25 sony
1000 XM please so the big players on NC
headphones is the B studio freeze
Sennheiser
PXE 5 550 the bose qc25 series 2 is only
1000 X and 3 as it stands right now the
Sun has repiace 550 those are the oldest
headphones in that line followed by
followed by the Bose the beats and of
the Soviets I was really expecting
Sennheiser to announce new NEC
headphones and I effect but since today
is the first official day they could
announce them later because if if
they're gonna stick with the PRC 550's
I think they're gonna get
because I am planning on making a big
versus video I know one of my biggest
videos on the channel was the most PC 35
so many more concepts and threes and
choose so you're saying a prison in
Dobby studio freeze a lot of people ask
why are the beats to do threes in me
even here and I kind of agree
the reason the beats are there what's
four clicks cuz you know a lot of people
whenever they think headphones they go
beats and they go okay on the beast do
do freeze dirt at the Apple Store I'm
gonna pick those up so if I do but why
we do that video I don't know if it's
going to be all for headphones versus
video and just do all four of those so
Sony both Sennheiser and was the last
one of beats or do just do a three
waiting and just have both Sony and
Sennheiser and just not even have the
beasts to your phrase because I've been
very vocal about this I wouldn't pay
$350 for the Beats Studio threes but if
they're on sale on Amazon for like 250
or less than absolutely how long does it
will last and should the boombox get an
update for it to get even louder if I
think goes until the 5th of September so
today's the 30 years so I think it's
gonna go into like to say
also say hi to everyone that came back
everybody that's back I know I'm so
trying to iron this out so if that goes
on from today till Wednesday usually the
big hitters they're gonna announce all
their new stuff on in the first two days
so who knows we might have a new round
of a whole bunch of new pots come
Saturday and then like everything else
is usually for like smaller companies
you know like see yes one see his
foreskin saw everybody announces
everything and then the next few days
everything cools down Julio wants to
know are you gonna do any EXO gear
on the reviews if I'm looking to them
I'll look into that company I honestly
don't even know what what company that
is and there's something interesting
there okay um you didn't answer the
boombox question
no I'm not expecting an update on the
Bulldogs just yet because the boombox
was nervous at IFA last year
and I think I think the party box is
kind of like not replacing the boombox
but you know being shown off instead of
a new I said that makes sense because if
we look the extreme to the extreme to
when I was on the market for like two
years before it actually got an update
so I'm kind of expecting the same thing
for the blue box I think we can expect
another year for that speaker because
the charge 3 is about to be charged
threes going to be two years on them I
think so so so it looks like these these
JBL speakers each one has like a life
time of like two years so at CES
I I think we're gonna see a new flip for
well you know actually actually Jamiel
flipped five foot five so I actually
thought the charge for in the foot five
we're gonna be announced together but I
guess natural so I think five maybe CES
2008 do you wish the boombox was louder
dope do I wish the boombox was louder um
I think now it's fine I remember when I
first got it and I first played music
with it I was unimpressed and again
that's what we're doing on this series
actually I've actually been having so
much fun just talking with you guys I
completely forgot about this blender but
we have a charging we'll give this a try
in a minute um scroll up but you know
there's a bunch of questions
Tarrance okay
the boombox i was unimpressed but after
houston throw things now i'm now i am
impressed i do really like it now but
again that's why we're doing this series
so you guys can get like ball reactions
and it's a concept I'm playing with so
you think you should be loud you just
answer that question no no there was the
extreme tool and the boom I think the
extreme too should be um it could be a
little louder it gets it gets it gets
louder now but the softer one thing that
for some reason got pulled I don't know
why but with like the I think it's the
view 1.16 software update it does get
louder because because before when it
was right out of the box the initial
review has the extreme two with the
initial software update and then I did
put up a new firmware of the video that
did show the difference between the
extreme right out of the box
and the extreme tube with the new form
or okay so
so you can feel me questions while I set
this beautiful speaker up
is the church for bigger than the three
I don't know you got it
I haven't seen any dimensions on it and
there haven't been any product pictures
with it next to other speakers so that's
something we're gonna have to wait to
see once we get it talk Julio says don't
forget about the expo gear
can we
to get this phone a place to go lgt k7
we do say it's a big fan you know I'm
really overwhelmed these last couple of
weeks where the channel growth it's just
been here the last few weeks the channel
has been growing you know got a good
pace I'm really excited but I do want to
up my game I am experimenting with like
new shots new video formats and you know
when it comes to the n3 is I'm gonna
give that down review video my all when
it comes to like the cinematography and
editing what I have to say about them so
yeah overall or were loaned I don't know
how many people run this live stream but
25 25 that's 25 more than I expected
have you heard the new Iowa speaker oh
no I haven't reviewed the Apple home pod
because I want to review it when I get
the iPhone tennis because right now I
have success and I don't know I feel
like just having that speaker not that
that's me yeah yeah that speaker you
know showing off 50 with this cracked
success yeah it's not gonna look as good
and plus I do want to I didn't want to
give the iPhone nothing every home pot
time to get new updates just cuz when
everybody first got the home pods and
like the whole pod we're coming out
everybody was saying it was a dumb smart
speaker so now that it has a few updates
hopefully sooner he gets better
and then then I'll give a bunch of
questions coming in about losing them
you have Instagram no I don't have
histogram maybe once I get that new
iPhone I'll start up an Instagram
because the pictures will actually look
ok so here we go cameraman Oh son oh
there's lights on this oh we actually
stay right there
stay right there we're gonna kill the
lights okay
looks nice feature to look cool oh no
they don't look better than those huh
I'm actually looking at the street here
oh you see what are you got we got you
got lights love those speakers we have a
light strip down here it looks like this
light strip is one solid color so like
when I'm talking about looking I say
with the with the new Saudis the lights
there's like there you can have one
color here and then another color here
and so like my little transition just
phase into one another this here is just
one straight line so sort of leg with
the exponent 30 grand exp 40 we got we
got dual transducers here we have dual
tweeters here something that the XP 41
doesn't have and I feel it does need to
have the extreme to does have the
trainers and
there are passive radiators here
although these are really these are
really tough compared to yeah I think so
like this is taking more force to put in
than the extreme now you're not supposed
to be doing this I'm doing this just
because you know it's kind of what the
channel is about I want you guys to like
see products I'm not I don't abuse
products but I want you guys to like be
able to see them yeah this one this one
takes a lot more force to press enter
we're gonna go ahead and show that yeah
give me a second for that so we are
going to quick I really hope you don't
get in trouble or copy I have no idea
how copyright works but my favorite song
to test speakers with well that speakers
but like really like any headphones or
speakers the first song I like to test
out is or is it I fall apart from
Estonia by post below I just feel that
song has a good range of mids highs and
bass that really gives really for me it
gives me like an idea of what kind of
performance we're expecting from from
the speakers so here comes the may then
playback of the LG p XB k 7p case I'm
Lydia okay let's see what this let's see
what this blender has
sorry
I have no idea how it works
pulls Malone I'm sorry I like your music
I just don't want to get in trouble
there's a lot of reverb going on usually
I try to give speakers a good six hours
of playback time Joe so now you can
stretch everything out at least six
hours so they can get broken in somewhat
before I actually let me make my final
verdict but really I don't know but I
mean there have been times where I got a
product I wasn't impressed when I first
got it and then I got to use it a little
bit more and then I did like it and then
I've been other times where I really
like the product and then I started
using it and I didn't like it I let's
say for example the megablast when I
first got the megablast way too much
bass no means no highs and it sounded
awful
that's when I first got it last year I
got another one not too long ago when I
was doing some video I did the
360-degree speakers video and it
actually didn't impress me this time
around cuz because of those new software
updates let's go into some no copyright
sound okay so for anybody anybody
wondering whenever I play music in a
sound test for these speakers I get the
music from no copyright sounds that's a
YouTube channel uh I do look for
specific songs that do have like a
vocals part and then a bass drop just so
that you can see how the
speaker performs in the mids highs and
bass so like I don't just grabbing
random songs I like auditioned oh my god
I like this part sometimes if like a
song well I don't like how the drop we
be so far away from like the vocals or
vice-versa there's the vocals and then
like there's this huge quiet portion of
the song and then the drop I went to
Final Cut Pro and just cut that up a
little bit so very good extreme to
better compared to the extreme to listen
to these speakers back to back
I can play get to know them I don't know
I don't want to be biased I try to be as
neutral as possible
see this is exactly why
you
okay so vocals on that song or sounding
pretty recessed but when I hear here are
a few things that I that I didn't notice
really quick with this new speaker with
the LG so there's actually modes up here
kind of like what the XP one is there's
live sounds mellow - which I personally
hate so here we have clear vocal and
enhanced bass so you can turn you can
have both of them on at the same time or
you can have one on and the other off or
you can have both of them off when you
have both of them off which we had a
little moment ago this speaker was very
very flat with bass enhanced bass turned
on yeah so with enhanced bass turned on
vocals were really recessed and with
both settings on it did sound a little
money but again I got a thing kinda like
have my time with this speaker but one
thing I did notice that I'm not liking
is
actually lesser
here's what I'm gonna turn on the light
yeah you go is that this print is
looking very cheap this is just
something that's printed on I feel like
I can easily get worn out after a while
because I don't know if the iPhones
camera is doing this justice but here
look at this battery button here this
this that quality is not looking too
good this is this is looking a little
cheap here
and even though this speaker looks like
it looks like it's um like metal like it
has like metal metal rails it's not this
is just really textured plastic made to
look like it was stainless steel or
something so even though this even
though it looks like you know back
somebody up against you can wax over to
this like if it's an apocalypse this
could be like a like a weapon um I'm
kind of worried that if you drop it I'm
kind of worried that if you drop it this
could snap because let's see
because look if you can I don't know if
you can see that but it's bending first
so then I'll back up a little bit yeah
so so yeah alright guys so I think I
lost I think I lost track of time we've
been on this thing for like an hour on
big props to anybody who's been here for
an hour just listening to me ramble I
think we're going to cut her off there
guys if any new Potter's get announced
I'm going to be posting on it on YouTube
channel just you're gonna be seeing the
the pulse I'm gonna be putting pictures
and like my thoughts on whatever
products good announced um we can give
this format another try come the m3s
I'll be posting when those coming as
well
I won't unbox them until we do the live
stream just so that we can maybe do this
again um I did learn a lot so guys if
you've been here for an hour
why that's amazing
I'll see you guys next time and thank
you
for the last power see you guys later
okay
