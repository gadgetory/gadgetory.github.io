headphones, they were a surprise to almost
everyone.
And like I said in the initial review, the
surface headphones were a really good first
try on Microsoft’s part.
But ultimately, when it came down to choosing
between these $350 headphones, or these $350
headphones or THESE $350 headphones…
I’m going to say get the Sony 1000XM3’s
all day, unless if you really need or want
a pair of headphones with super spacious ear
cups and a loose fit, then get the Bose QC35’s.
But now it looks like the Surface Headphones
have gotten a permeant $100 discount…
And at $250 the Surface headphones make a
very compelling argument.
Now I do think that we’ll see the Surface
Headphones 2 later on in the fall, but if
you’re thinking about picking these guys
up here’s how they stack up against everybody’s
favorite Sony 1000XM3’s and the old man
Bose QC35’s.
Now remember, if you want to pick any of these
headphones up they will be linked down below.
Now first let's go over design, fit and build
quality.
The Surface headphone’s design has proven
to be rather polarizing…
But personally, I really like how the surface
headphones look… they’re a style piece
all by themselves.
But what’s important to keep in mind here
is that the surface headphones are very low
profile just like the Sony 1000XM3’s which
is great.
But when it comes to fit, the surface headphones
are the most snug fitting headphones here.
They’re still big head approved cause I
can wear them for hours on end but if you’re
looking for a looser fit then you’ll be
better off with the 1000XM3 or if you want
a REALLY loose fit then you’ll be better
off with the Bose.
But when it comes to the ear cups themselves…
the surface headphones are rather spacious.
They’re more spacious than the 1000XM3’s
but they’re definitely not as spacious as
the Bose QC35’s.
But over all, I do think the Surface Headphones
will have no problem fitting most people out
there.
Now when it comes to the build quality of
the surface headphones, its actually very
good.
Even though these headphones are mostly plastic,
there’s a very satisfying click when ever
you extend the headphones, there’s zero
cracking and squeaking when ever you flex
the headphones and the leatherette used on
the ear cups feels almost as good as the leatherette
used on the Bose QC35’s.
The only design slash build quality draw back
on the surface headphones is that they can
only be laid down flat and not collapsed like
the Sony’s or Bose.
This then directly effects the size of the
surface headphone’s carrying case.
Now don’t get me wrong, the surface headphones
come included with a very good quality carrying
case… but it is much larger than Bose’s
carrying case and Sony’s carrying case.
And I want to point this out for people who
plan on traveling a lot with their ANC headphones.
Personally I think the smaller my headphones
can collapse the better, specially If I’m
trying to cram them into an over packed back
pack.
But now let's get into tech specs, the surface
headphone’s biggest weakness is definitely
their battery life.
These headphones are only good for 15 hours
of battery life on a full charge… and a
15 hour battery life on a pair of $350 or
$250 headphones is way below average for 2019.
These are a pair of headphones you’re going
to have to charge every week or so depending
on your use.
But at least these headphones charge via a
USB C port which means if you’re an android
user you can charge your phone and headphones
with the same cable.
But for comparison, the Bose QC35’s have
an advertised battery life of 20 hours and
the Sony 1000XM3’s have an advertised battery
life of 30 hours.
So definitely if Microsoft is working on a
Surface headphones 2 they really need to focus
on battery life if they wanna be competitive.
Cause obviously battery life is one of the
first things people look at when they’re
looking in getting any kind of electronic.
But something the surface headphones do get
right is their bluetooth connectivity.
They can be connected to two devices at the
same time just like the Bose, which means
you can hot swap from your phone to your computer.
And this is important to point out cause the
Sony’s can only be connected to one device
at a time.
Ultimately this isn’t a HUGE deal, but a
power user might be looking for a pair of
headphones that support multi device connectivity.
But more importantly, whether you’re an
iPhone user or android user the surface headphones
are great for watching videos on your phone
cause they have zero latency across the board
on both platforms.
Now when it comes to active noise cancellation
on the surface headphones, again its also
very good.
Unlike the active noise cancelation on the
Bose QC35 that does cause a considerable amount
of cabin pressure… which as a result usually
ends up giving me headaches.
The surface headphones have very little to
no cabin pressure just like the Sony 1000XM3’s.
Like you may have just seen, the Sony 1000XM3’s
manage to block out the most amount of noise
here across the board.
Where as the Surface Headphones and Bose QC35’s
managed to block out relatively the same amount
of noise.
But like I mentioned earlier, the reason why
I think the Active Noise Cancellation on the
Surface Headphones is better than the Bose
QC35’s is because they have nowhere near
as much cabin pressure as the Bose and they
don’t cause me any headaches.
And the surface headphones also do a much
better job of rejecting wind noise when used
outdoors.
And unlike the Bose, the Surface headphones
also have an ambient mode… so if you want
you can have the headphones pump in all or
the surrounding sound around you so you can
still be aware of your environment when you’re
using your headphones.
Having an ambient mode on your headphones
is great cause you can still hear on coming
traffic if you’re walking around in the
city, or if you’re at home or at the office
you can still hear when someone calls your
name.
And just like the Sony’s the ambient mode
on the Surface headphones has been properly
implemented… meaning that they don’t have
an audible hiss when ambient mode is turned
on which is good for when you’re watching
movies and the scene is quiet.
And the Ambient mode on the surface is smart
enough to block out random loud noises like
a dog barking or if a siren passes by just
like on the Sony’s.
But something the Surface Headphones have
that neither of these other headphones do
is built in proximity sensors.
So when you take your headphones off they’ll
automatically pause your music and when you
put them back on they’ll start playing again.
Personally I don’t care for this feature,
but its also properly implemented meaning
that these headphones aren’t going to start
randomly playing and pausing you’re music
when you walk around with them on.
Now when it comes to listening to music with
these headphones, since they have an adjustable
EQ you can make them sound how ever you want
depending on the type of music you like to
listen to.
But when it comes to instrument separation
and clarity I do have to say the Surface headphones
aren’t as good as the Bose or Sony.
Now don’t get me wrong, the surface headphones
don’t sound bad but if you’re looking
for audio fidelity then you’ll be better
off with the Sony’s.
But if you’re looking for lots and lots
of bass then the surface headphones are going
to have way more kick to them than the Sony’s
even when extra bass mode on the Sony’s
is cranked all the way up and way more bass
than the Bose cause the Bose QC35’s have
a neutral sound signature that you can’t
change as easily.
But when it comes to controlling your music
playback the surface headphones have a very
unique set up compared to both the Sony and
Bose headphones.
Both ear cups have dials, the left dial is
used to controller you’re headphone’s
ANC levels and the right dial is used to adjust
your volume, and in the center of both ear
cups there’s a touch pad.
Single tapping will play or pause your music,
double tapping skips a track, and triple tapping
goes back a track.
Just like the touch controls on the 1000XM3’s,
there is a learning curve… but over all
the controls on the Surface headphones are
super easy to use.
Now over the last few months voice assistants
have been making a big push on headphones,
specifically with always listening Siri on
the both the new Powerbeats Pro and AirPods
2… and both the Sony 1000XM3 and Bose QC35
series II have both Google assistant and Alexa
integration.
Now even though the Surface Headphones also
have voice assistant support they mainly on
Cortana.
And in short, I never really use Cortana cause
Cortana sucks.
And I do think that the majority of people
who end up picking up the Surface Headphones
will rarely even use Cortana.
But when it comes to microphone on the Surface
Headphones its actually very good for phone
calls.
Its much better than the microphone found
on the sony 1000XM3’s
But I do think the microphone on the Bose
QC35’s is slightly better
But over all I think the Surface headphones
are decent enough to take phone calls with,
but there’s definitely still room for improvement.
But over all, for $250 I think the Surface
Headphones make a very compelling argument.
They fit well and they have very decent build
quality.
They support multi device connectivity which
is great for power users and they’re great
for watching videos on your phone which is
great for every one.
They sound decent enough and their active
noise cancelation is almost as good as the
Sony’s.
But more importantly their active noise cancelation
doesn’t cause any headaches like the Bose
QC35’s and they also have a properly implemented
ambient mode.
They only major hit you’re going to be taking
with these headphones is their Sub par battery
life and pretty large carrying case.
But if you’re looking for a pair of very
good ANC headphones and if you’re also looking
for a deal… then I would definitely take
the Surface headphones into consideration.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
