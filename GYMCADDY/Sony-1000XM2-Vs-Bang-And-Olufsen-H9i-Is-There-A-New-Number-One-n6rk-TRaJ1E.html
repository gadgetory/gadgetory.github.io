video by getting the obvious stuff out
of the way the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen h9 I have
far superior build quality materials and
just look way better than the Sony 1000
except you know competition there what I
want to compare is their technology
let's find out which has the better
noise cancellation sound quality battery
life and extra little features are the
Sony 1000 XM 2 still King or are the
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen h9 I the complete package
just to be clear this isn't a full
review on either of these headphones I'm
just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with a purchase decision if
you want to learn more about either of
these headphones then watch their full
reviews pricing on these headphones is
very different and it can be a deciding
factor for many people the Sony 1000 XM
2 retails for $349 and the Bing in all
of sudden h 9i we tell us for $499 if
you want to pick either of these
headphones up I'll have links in the
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel I
suggest you check them out cuz Sony
headphones routinely go on sale so you
might get lucky first let's start off
with what you get with both of these
headphones both headphones come with a
3.5 mm audio cable for Wired listening
and they can both be used passively the
Sony 1000 X and 2 comes with a micro USB
cable for charging while the h9 eyes
come with a USB C to USB a cable because
it has a USB C port while the Sony's
don't but more importantly the Sony's
come with a hard shell carrying case
while the h9 eyes come with the fleece
carrying pouch like I said in the
initial review when I'm paying $500 for
headphones I'm kind of expecting a hard
shell carrying case both of these
headphones are also very comfortable but
if I had to pick one only uncomfort then
it would have to be the ace 9 eyes
they're more plush they have slightly
less clamping force and your ears are
less cramped in the HD 9 eyes and
overheating is less of a problem with
the ace 9 eyes as well I can wear the
Sony's for hours on end but there's
something about the B&amp;amp;O ah9
eyes that you if you wear them you just
you just forget they're there now let's
talk about battery life because these
two are on complete opposite sides of a
suspect
with noise cancellation and Bluetooth
turned on I typically average 30 hours
of playback time with the Sony 1000 xn2
whereas the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen h9 I
typically average 20 hours of playback
time with Bluetooth and anc turned on as
well the battery from the Sony 1000x m2
is above average while the battery life
on the big amounts in each 9i is below
average
both of these headphones also use touch
pads under the right ear cups to control
your music playback they both work well
but I find the touchpad on the sony is a
little more accurate and there's a
little more flexibility with the h9 ah
you have to place your finger just right
and you have to be more deliberate with
your swipes and as a result I usually
have more failed attempts at skipping a
track or trying to adjust the volume on
the 89 I don't get me wrong they're both
good I'm just being hypercritical but I
have an easier time using the touchpad
on the Sony than on the h9 I regarding
noise cancellation the Sony 1000 XM to
you or the gold standard right now they
managed to block out the most sound and
they have very little to no cabin
pressure but the noise cancellation on
the h9 I are very close second they do a
very good job of blocking now constant
sounds like road noise but they do
struggle a little bit when blocking out
voices or random high-pitched sounds
compared to the sony 1000 XM 2 but the
h9 i do have a little bit of cabin
pressure you won't notice it if you're
playing music but it is there the sony
is also do a very good job of rejecting
wind noise while walking outside and i
think that's because of the synthetic
leather surrounding the microphones on
the sony whereas since the microphones
on the h9 i are so exposed they do pick
up wind noise more easily so you might
hear a little sound wind walking outside
on a windy city sony is still the king
when it comes to active noise
cancellation but competitors are started
in the catch-up
but the Sony 1000 XM - it lets you
choose how much noise cancellation you
want and you can even allow ambient
sound and even while you're playing
music so if you're walking around in the
city or in an office and if you have
these headphones on and playing music
you can still be somewhat aware of your
surroundings regarding sound quality
these headphones will appeal to two
different types of listeners the h9 eyes
have the superior soundstage instrument
separation and the lows resonant quite a
bit which is nice but I find II struggle
to put an emphasis on the vocals no
matter how much you play around with
their sound settings in their app but
listening to instruments like the piano
or a guitar on the h9 eyes is much more
dramatic than on the Sony's but on the
Sony's the sound stage is a little more
narrow and a trouble and vocalist or
more defined even though both of these
headphones don't have a lot of head
thumping bass cuz they're meant for easy
listening when cranked attend the Sony's
do have more thump in their base than
the h9 eyes I also noticed that the h9 I
suffered considerably more distortion at
higher volumes than the 1000x into the
bass sense the bottom L more frequently
whereas the Sony suffered less
distortion and still managed to get
louder than the 89 eyes but a very
important thing I need to point out here
is that the h9 I sound much better when
they're noise cancellation is turned off
when ANC has turned on the h9 eyes
soundstage tightens up and the lows
won't resonate as much whereas the
Sony's managed to perform almost the
same with or without a and C turned on
for the best listening experience I use
the h9 eyes with ANC turned off as much
as I can now let's do a quick rundown of
these headphones apps
the ace nine eyes app is very simple and
all you can really do is control your
music playback and play around with the
sound settings piano sound settings
approach is very simple but I find you
can't customize it as much as Sony's EQ
settings Sony's app on the other hand
allows you to fine tune your noise
cancellation and ambient sound settings
you can play around with effects and
sound positioning and their EQ gives you
full control over their sound signature
B and O's app is pretty while Sony's app
is more useful both of these headphones
also have special features to take into
consideration most noticeably the h9 i
have proximity sensors built-in so when
you take your headphones off they'll
automatically pause the music and when
you put them back on or start playing
your music again and this feature works
pretty well they don't randomly start
playing and pausing music if you move
your head around too much and I actually
do stand corrected you can turn this
feature off and I typically keep it off
cuz just cuts the h9 I also features a
removable battery and this is nice
because it effectively extends the life
of your $500 headphones we should all
know that as batteries age they don't
perform as well so if you get to a point
where your battery can't hold the charge
you can just swap out the battery
instead of replacing your headphones now
I've had my 1000x m2 for over seven
months now and the battery still
performs very well but it's a good touch
from being owned nonetheless another
small but very important thing to take
note of is that the h9 I can be paired
to two devices at a time whereas the
Sony's can they gonna be paired to one
device at a time so if you're going to
be switching from your phone to your
computer on a regular basis like I do
then life is a little easier with the h9
I but also very soon Sony will be
releasing a former update to a few of
their products so that they will get
Google assistant integration so soon
Google assistant will be a tap away on
the 1,000 X + 2 just like the Bose TC 35
series 2 and Google assistant
integration is different from just
pressing and holding on the touchpad on
either these headphones to activate your
voice assistant both of these headphones
also have a very useful feature that
allows you to talk to people without
having to take your headphones off you
do adjuster on the touchpad and
fools will pause or lower your music and
pump in all of the ambient sounds so you
can hear what people are saying to you
Sony calls a quick attention and being
in all of them calls to transparency
mode and you act the victim very
differently on each headphone what the
Sony's you have to fully cover the
touchpad
and keep it covered so you essentially
only have one hand free but as soon as
you uncover the touchpad everything goes
back to normal with the h9 i when you
swipe up they have little positive music
and pump in all of the ambient sound so
both of your hands are free and when you
swipe up again the headphones will go
back to normal here is pretty tough
right now because I really like both of
these headphones the Sony 1000x m2 is
still the better choice for traveling
because of their superior anc
performance with almost no cabin
pressure and long battery life and when
I want a more dynamic listening
experience I go for the 1000x m2 but
whenever I just want its own out I go
for the h9 eyes cuz you're so
comfortable and the resonating loads
analyze sound stays just make for the
perfect background noise to block out
everything else and the h9 eyes premium
materials in superior design is a huge
plus over the Sony 1000x m2 the Sony's
are not the best looking headphones out
there and I've been very vocal about
this their build quality is nowhere near
as good as the ace 9 eyes but I have had
the Sony's for over seven months now and
cracking hasn't been an issue for me the
Sony 1000 XM 2 is still the safest bet
right now because of the performance and
price but the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen h9 eyes are
a very close second because of their
comfort and design the ace nine eyes are
great for hours and hours of continuous
use the Sony 1000x m2 has the better
software while the Bing in all of sin h9
I have the better hardware Hey if you
