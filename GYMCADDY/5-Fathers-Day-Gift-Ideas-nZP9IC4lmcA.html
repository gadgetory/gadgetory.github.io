June 18 to be exact
and I thought I'd share my top 5
Father's Day gift ideas having a cookout
and spending time with your father is
perhaps the best gift of all but if you
want to get him a little something
that's a big plus 2 and no matter what
your budget is there might be something
on this list for you please remember to
Like and subscribe and if there's
anything on this list that catches your
attention I'll have links in the
description below for their full reviews
and where you can get them first up on
this list is the JBL flip for Bluetooth
speaker the JBL flip for currently
retails for 99.95 over at amazon and
comes in seven color ways when I
reviewed the JBL flip 4 I was very
impressed at how good it sounds for its
size it's also ipx7 certified which
means you can submerge it in water and
not have any problems and it has a very
long battery life that's good for more
than 12 hours of playback if your dad
likes to listen to music while he's in
the shower or shaving the JBL flip 4 is
a great option and you can take it with
them and play music if he's working on
to garage or grilling 6 outside 2nd to
audio if your dad likes to workout at
the gym another great idea are the power
beats 3 every time someone asks me which
wireless earphones they should get I
always say power beats 3 because for the
most part they have exactly what
everyone is looking for they have a 12
hour battery life they are fast feel
their ear hooks I'm sure that they never
fall out and if you're heavily invested
into Apple's ecosystem the w1 chip is
awesome and best of all Amazon has them
on sale for one $29.99 versus the normal
price of one $99.99 a second set of
theme of headphones if you want to get
to that something with noise canceling
capabilities then the Sony xb9 50 and
one is the way to go these were released
by sony a few months ago in four $248
you're getting some pretty solid noise
cancellation the 950 and one has in my
case become my favorite over your
headphone they have a very punchy bass
or long battery life of 22 hours and in
my case the active noise cancellation
doesn't cause me any headaches so
whether your dad wants to listen to
music or watch movies with great
headphones or travels a lot the 950 n1r
certain press so if your dad is just
getting into fitness as always liked
working out being able to track your
progress is pretty important and when it
comes to fitness
there are two pretty solid options in
the flooded market first up is the
Fitbit charge - I've said it before I
think that has the best mobile fitness
app on the market right now
it'll very clearly show you your stat
and it's super easy to use you can track
your sleep steps calories burn and has a
built-in heart rate monitor Amazon right
now has it on sale for one twenty nine
ninety five versus the normal price a
one forty nine ninety five but if you
want something a little sleeker a little
less noticeable and in my opinion a
little more comfortable the government
PeopleSmart three is also a good idea
just keep in mind
Gorman's phone app isn't as easy to use
as fitbit but it is very thorough but if
your dad is really into fitness either
marathon training cycling or mountain
sports specifically the Garmin Phoenix
slides will leave him speechless at $599
the Garmin Phoenix five isn't cheap but
it is a monster of a sports watch like I
said in my initial review it's just a
great look at what period something you
can wear almost anywhere and with the
easy to remove band you can easily
change styles but this watch isn't just
a look it's also very capable
it does have SmartWatch capability so
you can get phone notifications and you
can control your music playback but
there's also a whole bunch of sensors
that will map your ones accurately
calculate your distance pace Cayden
stride altitude gain or Los Angeles just
goes on if your dad is really into
running cycling or bounce sports chances
are he's already looking into this watch
unless he already has the Phoenix three
at which case there's really no need to
upgrade but yeah these are my top five
Father's Day gift ideas for you
hopefully one of these are within your
price range when I reviewed the products
on this list they all impress me one way
or another I'll have links in the
description below to each of these
products individual review and we can
get them and if you do get your dad
something from this list I hope you
likes it happy Father's Day to the dads
watching and I'll catch you guys later
I'm working on something big right now

it's done hey if you enjoyed the video
