reduced it down by 25% you've got
yourself the sony xba-40 they're
identical in almost every way except for
speaker size and price tag so does
having slightly larger speakers then the
sony xba-4 most double for the sony
xba-40 in some circumstances we're about
to find out don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe and you can watch some of
my other videos here after you're done
watching this video and there will be a
sound comparison between these two
speakers at the end of this video as
well I kind of wish I made this video
sooner for the last couple of weeks the
sony xba-40 was selling for $198 over in
amazon and most other retailers but now
the price is back up to $248 click the
link in the description below because
depending on when you're watching this
the price might have gone back down the
smaller XP 30 usually retails for 148
dollars but right now you can get it for
$118 both of these speakers come in a
few colorways black blue and red and the
XP 30 has an additional gray colorway if
you want to pick either of these
speakers up I'll have links in the
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deal
possible like I said the XP 30 is just
slightly smaller than the XP 40 they
both have the same soft touch rubber
outer body they both have painted middle
grilles on the front they both have the
same button layouts on the top and they
both have an NFC touch point you can
control your music playback answer and
end calls activate Siri and even pair up
to 10 Sony speakers together
on the back there's a stiff plastic
garment that houses an audio jack a DC
in for charging and a USB out so you can
charge your own devices build quality on
these speakers is identical and it's
very good they also both have light
features on the front that flash to the
beat of your music except on the XP 40
there's an additional set of lights that
eliminate the speakers concerning
technical specifications both of these
speakers are using bluetooth for that
too and they both have a range of around
40 feet with direct line-of-sight to
your device and they both can be
connected up to three devices at the
same time and both of these devices are
IP x5 certified which means they can get
wet but they should not be submerged
underwater
both of these speakers even have the
same advertised battery life of 24 hours
but that's what the light feature turned
on
and the volume set relatively low
real-world battery life on these
speakers with the volume set at 50% in
the light feature turned on is around 18
hours still not bad but here's the first
major difference both of these speakers
have passive radiators and dual fuel
range speakers on the front but the
speakers on the XP 40 have a diameter of
2 point 4 inches or 61 millimeters and
the speaker on the XP 30 has a diameter
of one point eight nine inches or 48
millimeters and as you'd expect the
passive radiator on the XP 40 is
slightly larger than the one and the XP
30 exp 40 weighs in at 3.31 pounds or
1.5 kilos and the XP 30 weighs in at two
point one six pounds or point nine eight
kilos so larger size of the sony xba-40
means it does get louder and there's a
tiny bit more based in the XP 37 max
volume the sony xba-40 s average decibel
range is in the high 70s whereas when
the XP xxx seven max volume its average
decibel range is in the low 70s but if
you were to listen to these two speakers
at the same decibel level they sound
almost identical and the overall sound
quality for both of these speakers is
that they have a wide soundstage a good
amount of death and lots of bass
there's no rasping as for tuning in the
mids and highs and Sony does a really
good job of not distorting the sound
with the wrongness cranked all the way
up the biggest difference I did notice
between the xB 40 and exp 30 is that the
xB 30 does rattle a bit when the bass
really gets going both of these speakers
are also connect to Sony's music center
AB and from there you can adjust both of
these speakers light settings you can
choose from rave chills strobe or rave
mode without the strobe lights on the
side and there's also a few common
options as well but for some odd reason
only the xB 40 can be used with Sony's
Fiesta Bowl app although Sony's Fiesta
Bowl app isn't that good
I just think Sony is lacking in the
customization option Department for
these speakers pairing these speakers
together is relatively simple all you
have to do is press and hold the Add
button and the plus button together for
a few seconds on one speaker until the
speaker beeps and then you do the same
thing on the other speaker you can
either have the speaker's played music
simultaneously or have them play left
and right stereo audio when pairing
these two speakers together they are
eight
to reach an average decibel rating of 82
decibels and max volume but I feel
Sony's parent protocol isn't as good as
JBL's JBL connect plus and it's not
because with Sony you can only pair 10
speakers together and with JBL he can
pair up to 100 speakers together with
Sony if you're playing music on multiple
devices and you lower the volume on your
phone only the volume of the main
speaker will change so let's say the
main speaker in this example is the xB
40 and the added speaker is the xB 30 if
they're chained together and playing
music if I lower the volume on my phone
only the volume of the xB 40 will change
you would then have to go in manually
change the volume on the xB 30
whereas with JBL adjusting the volume on
your phone will affect the volume of all
the speakers that are chained together
and not to mention pairing multiple JBL
speakers is a lot easier you
legitimately just press one button on
each speaker and that's it a few minor
things before wrapping this review up if
the battery on the sony xba-40 or XB 30
gets below 20%
it'll abruptly stop the music say please
charge and you'll have no other option
than to put the speaker back on the
charger because the volume won't go past
30% this is a feature I'm still trying
to figure out how to turn off I
absolutely hate it and speaking of the
charger both of these speakers charge
via a DC converter and they're both
different sizes the xB 40 takes a 9
point 5 volts while dxp 30 takes 5 volts
so you can't even charge these two
almost identical speakers with the same
power cord and since these speakers
don't charge via a microUSB like most
other speakers on the market you have to
remember to take their respective power
cables with you if you plan on taking 2
speakers with you on the go so is it
worth paying almost double for the xB 40
if you're trying to choose between the
xB 40 and the xB 30 unless you need a
slightly louder speaker I don't think so
these speakers sound almost identical at
the same decibel level aside from the
slight rattling in the xB 30 from time
to time and for comparison's sake the
JBL extreme and max volume has an
average decibel reading of 81 decibels
and the charge 3 and max volume has an
average decibel reading in the low 70s
so the loudest difference between the
JBL extreme and the JBL charge 3 is much
more pronounced
and aside from their size difference all
the other technical specifications are
the same between the XP 40 and the XP 30
if you do decide to go with the HP 30
over the XP 40 you're not going to be
missing out on much and here's a sound
comparison both of these speakers are
playing at the same decibel level in the
same room streaming from the same device
