earbuds when I worked out specifically
my priority 3 but there are some people
out there that prefer to wear over the
ear headphones when they work out but
wearing the beats solo 3 isn't the best
option at the gym and soul electronics
know this and that's why they made their
extra wireless headphones so how do they
compare let's find out the extra
wireless headphones currently come in
two colorways you can get an all-black
one or you can get one with blue accents
and the Curley retail for one $49.99
like to pick these up will be in the
description below packaging here is very
nice actually
it feels very premium when you open the
lid the carrying case is front and
center under that you'll find more
information and a user's manual you're
really gonna need you get a horde
clamshell case more on this in just a
second inside you'll find the actual
headphones a headphone cable and a micro
USB cable that's all themselves are very
lightweight they're made mostly out of
plastic and the overall quality is okay
it's what I would expect from a pair of
hundred $50 over the ear headphones I
can see the headband snapping in half if
you were to flex it too much there's
also a horde silicone headband that
offers minimal padding and does prevent
the headphones from slipping if you were
sweaty the padding under your cup
themselves are much stiffer and is not
as breathable than what you would find
another headphone these earphones are
wireless and connect with your standard
Bluetooth connection in order to power
them you just press and hold the middle
button found on the right ear cut you
can also adjust the volume by pressing
the plus or the bindings button if you
want to skip a track you have to press
and hold the plus button for two seconds
and if you want to go back a track you
have to press and hold the minus button
for two seconds in order to play or
pause your music just press the center
button once and if you want to read all
your last call just double click the
center button
overall the blends are very tactile but
they aren't very easy to tell apart by
just touch and when it comes to sound
quality these earphones on today but
these earphones aren't supposed to be
your daily drivers that you wear while
relaxing around the house or a long trip
these earphones are meant to be won
exclusively at the gym that's why
they're so lightweight and relatively
low profile the ear cups also snap off
super easily so that you can wash them
and air dry them after your workout
these earphones also have built-in LEDs
on the back which you can turn on and
off or even have them blink if you want
to personally I don't know of any other
headphones
have this feature and it's great if you
want to run outside at night the extra
charge if you have the micro USB cable
that came included in the box and just a
heads up it can be a little hard to get
into these your photos have a 24 hour
battery life if the LEDs are turned off
if the LEDs are turned on then expect a
battery life of 15 hours these your
phones also have fast charging
capabilities charging them for 15
minutes will get you two hours and a
half of playback time if we're some
reason you can't charge your headphones
back up you can also use the included
headphone cable using a wired connection
doesn't do much to improve the sound
quality for these headphones ability Sol
electronics you really impress me with
their included carrying case it's a
hardshell clam design that can really
take a beating you also get a carabiner
so you can hook it on to your gym bag I
really appreciate this carrying case
because there are other bigger more
expensive brands that gives you really
crappy cases you know who you are inside
there's another pocket where you can
store your cables as well overall the
sole extra wireless earphones isn't a
high premium product that you want to
wear all the time and it's not supposed
to be these headphones are meant to be
worn while you're at the gym going ham
and they have certain character extras
that help them fill that niche like your
light weight construction low profile
design easy to remove and wash your cups
fast charging and LEDs on the back for
visibility personally I would like to
see Sol electronics improve their hinges
improve the readability of their ear
cups and maybe bring down the price a
little maybe around $100 or $125 hey if
