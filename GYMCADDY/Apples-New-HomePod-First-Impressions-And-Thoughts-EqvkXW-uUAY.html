product the home pod and I just love how
when Tim Cook told the audience there's
one more thing
he had the slightest giggle because he
knew we all knew what that one more
thing was and after announcing the home
pod Twitter was already flooded about
how people didn't like the name and
other people comparing to the design of
the home pod to a large trash can and to
be honest I'm not a fan of the name
either but out of all of the things
announced at WWDC this year people will
be talking about the Apple home pod the
most apple claims they will release
their home pod this December but looking
at their past track record I wouldn't be
surprised if it gets delayed it happens
to both Apple earpods
and the beats X Apple site still claims
it will take six weeks for your ear pods
to arrive and rumor has it the iPhone 8
or iPhone X is also going to be delayed
granted the ear pods are very small and
presumably complex and the iPhone being
delayed is just a rumor
I hope Apple doesn't have to delay the
home pods since it might be a little
easier to manufacture but again that's
speculation so what exactly is the Apple
home pod well as Apple's entrance into
the smart speaker home voice assistant
market right now the two main players
are Amazon's Alexa and their suite of
speakers in the Google home and
basically what they do is allow you to
control your smart home with your voice
you can ask it questions and set timers
or stuff online play music and the list
is growing every single day thanks to
developers and today is a bit of a
repeat when Apple first introduced their
iPod almost 15 or more years ago there
were a whole bunch of mp3s on the market
at the time but no one was really doing
it right but Steve Jobs thought he was
able to crack the code with the iPod
obviously Steve Jobs had nothing to do
with the home pod but Tim Cook and Apple
are taking a different approach with
their smart speaker in hopes they've
managed to crack this code Apple is
really focusing on the music and sound
quality with the home pod a quick well
none of the internals it has a seventh
tweeter array which gives you 360 degree
sound a high exertion woofer which means
bass there are six microphones and is
all powered by an Apple a8 chip apple
claims that no matter where you place it
it will deliver high stability sound
throughout the room and they managed to
cram all of the stuff into a 5.6 inch by
six point eight inch cylinder
Appl focusing on the sound quality of
the speaker first is a good idea because
you'll be more inclined to use it while
you're at home listening to music
because listening to music on my Amazon
echo or Google home isn't always the
best apple also mentioned on the site
that you can pair two home pots together
and you'll play music simultaneously but
interestingly enough Apple hasn't
mentioned it if you can pair more than
two speakers together which sucks
because JBL lets you pair up to 100
speakers together obviously that's your
sarcasm you don't need to pair on your
speakers but you can still link other
speakers together using Apple's new
airplay - and Apple claims that with
their microphone array the whole pod
will be able to hear you say hey Siri
even when the music is playing at full
volume but in order for Apple to really
win the smart speaker market Siri needs
to be up to the task if you compare
Alexa Google assistant and Siri together
Siri usually comes in less in terms of
helpfulness when you ask it something I
have an iPhone and when I need to use my
voice assistant I always ask for Google
unless I know for a fact Siri will do
what I ask it to do but with everything
we saw at WWDC this year it looks like
Apple knows they need to step up Siri
especially with the launch of the home
pod now I want to touch on the price and
the design of the home pod the home pod
will retail for $349 when is release in
December we will home on the other hand
we talk to our 129 96 and the Amazon
echo retails for $179.99 obviously
there's a huge price difference between
the speakers but you need to remember
Apple is going all in on the sound
quality it's thanks to assume the home
pod is aiming for sound quality on the
level of the Bose Soundlink Raval plus
which i've reviewed a few days ago
shameless plug and retails for $299 but
design wise I'm not a fan yes it looks
like a wired trashcan it's wrapped in
the seamless mesh fabric which Apple
claims is for aesthetic design and
acoustic performance but for $349 I
don't like it I would have expected
Apple to really something similar to
what the Bose Soundlink evolved plus
looks like something made out of
aluminum with maybe a little chrome
finish or mirror surfaces like the Apple
logos on the MacBook and on the back of
your iPhone
nap does mesh and the top of the device
blinks with the Siri waveform when it
starts to listen to you but I feel the
placement is off because if you're
standing a few feet away
and if the speaker is a little high up
you won't be able to see the top of the
lights that let you know the speaker is
listening to you from a UI standpoint
there might be a sense of uncertainty
not knowing if the speaker is listening
to you the top rim of the Amazon Alexa
glows and is much easier to seeks of its
placement and when you see the rim glow
you can confidently talk to Alexa and
know she's listening to you the same
thing can be said with Google since the
top is angled towards you it's a little
easier to see the lights and I wouldn't
be surprised if Apple released their
whole pot - or whole pot series - or
whatever with the circular screen on the
top of the device next year I feel the
design of the whole pot is another
example of Apple's poor design choices
like their external battery case and the
mad Pro Apple also talked about security
with their home pod and how they're
basically going to make it your music
ologists for you that helps you discover
every song you've ever wanted to hear
but until December we won't be able to
see how the home pod truly performs and
sounds but comment below what do you
think about the Apple whole pod do you
have a better name for it what would you
have done differently and are you going
to buy one when it comes out hey if you
