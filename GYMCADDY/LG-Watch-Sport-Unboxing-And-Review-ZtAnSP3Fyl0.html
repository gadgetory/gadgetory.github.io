announced Android wear 2.0 a much-needed
update for Google SmartWatch OS and with
the announcement of Android wear 2.0
came the LG watch style and the LG watch
sport I've already reviewed the LG watch
style so you can check that out after
this video but today we'll review is
more expensive and feature-packed
LG watch sports first up what's the
difference between the LG watch style
and the LG watch sport well for starters
the LG watch style retails for 249 while
the sport retails for 349 that hundred
all difference gets you a slightly more
premium watch with the built-in heart
rate monitor GPS and LTE connectivity
and a built-in speaker and a few other
goodies here and there like NFC and
slightly more RAM with that out of the
wait let's go into the unboxing
thankfully the box for the LG watch
sport it's much smaller than the LG
watch style when you list a list front
and center is the watch itself under
that you will find a wall board and a
charging cradle the LG watch sports
charges wirelessly and one place and the
charging cradle can be used as a
nightstand something that I think all
smartwatches should do inside the
smaller box you will find a USB cable
some documentation and a simple mobile
tool like I said earlier what separate
set of UI support from the LG watch
style is LTE connectivity you can pop in
a nano SIM card into the back of the
watch by removing the backplate with the
spin tool personally I don't really need
LTE and my SmartWatch and it's never
feature I look for if LG didn't include
LTE in the SmartWatch they could have
made it much slimmer
well I think this is a good enough segue
to start talking about the design of the
watch the LG watch support has a
stainless steel case that comes in
either dark blue like this one or
titanium
you only get one CPU wrist strap that is
not interchangeable but it's still
comfortable enough to wear all day long
the watch itself is fourteen point two
millimeters thick and weighs in at a
hefty eighty nine point four grand this
watch really isn't suited for people
with a smaller wrist on board is a one
point three eight inch full screen Pio
LED screen with a 348 PPI covered by
Corning Gorilla Glass 3 the LG watch
sport has a slightly larger in more
pixels than screen Danny's little
brother the LG watch style running the
whole thing we've got Qualcomm
Snapdragon wear 2100 processor doing
processing things you also get 768
megabytes of RAM versus the 500
megabytes of RAM found in the LG
whitestyle there's also four gigabytes
of on-board storage the LG watch sport
also has a 430 milliamp battery set if
you go easy on it you might get a whole
day's use out of it there's also a
built-in microphone and speaker so you
can take calls from your wrist or argue
with Google assistant connectivity wise
there's Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.2 Low Energy
GPS LTE and NFC for Angela Spain when it
comes to sensors there is your standard
accelerometer and ambient light sensor
but more importantly there's a barometer
gyroscope and a heart rate monitor I
mentioned earlier and finally this watch
is ip68 water ingress resistant this
means the watch is water resistant up to
1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes and it's
not intended for prolonged or consistent
submergence which basically means you
can't swim sasquatch normally keep track
of your lab using the new Android wear
2.0 OS it's similar to the original
Android where blood is much quicker and
a little more intuitive the LG watch
Sport and style both have new rotating
crowns that allow you to scroll through
cards and the after without having to
smudge your screen obviously this is a
feature that has been copied from the
Apple watch but it is welcomed on the
Left LG watch sport also has two
programmable buttons on either side of
the crown these programmable buttons are
a great feature for any power user out
there I've said it before and I'll say
it again more watches are great for
people who are always on the go and need
to be on top of their emails text
calendar events and phone calls and just
as you'd expect the LG watch sport does
a great job at doing just that when you
get an email or text messages open up
quickly and you can respond in a few
ways you can either use canned responses
voice to text or even the new onboard
keyboard that is fairly accurate but
some smartwatches have never taken off
as much as manufacturers head over Joey
hoped they were now leaning towards the
more active community specifically
runners and cyclists with the added
features of the LG watch sport you are
able to track and map your runs and
rides get out to do readings and monitor
your heart rate during the workout you
can also use these features if you're on
a treadmill or stationary bike and even
when you lift weight all this data can
be stored within Google spit app or you
can go into the Google Play Store and
download
any other figments that we might prefer
overall the LG watch sport is a much
more rugged and premium watch than the
LG watch style
it's leaps and bounds much better than
the New Balance run IQ I reviewed a few
weeks ago and those aiming for the same
type of consumer all those are LG watch
sports size isn't ideal for people with
the tomorrow risk it is small enough
that will make you wonder how they act
so many features into it the non
interchangeable wrist wraps means you're
stuck with only one look and it might
not be suitable for office life but the
LG watch sport is a good enough watch
but it is a little too bulky if you're
genuinely interested in the LG watch
sport then pick it up you won't be
disappointed but if you can hold off for
a while I would there are a whole bunch
of new small watches in the pipeline for
2017 hey if you made it this far I hope
