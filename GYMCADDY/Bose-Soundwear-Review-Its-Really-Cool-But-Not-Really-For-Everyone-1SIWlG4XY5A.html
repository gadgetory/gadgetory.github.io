product at best it's a wearable speaker
that you place around your neck it
sounds good we can't really use it
everywhere it's an odd product that if
you can only be used in certain
circumstances it's cool but it's pretty
neat so let's find out if the Bose sound
where it is right for you don't forget
to Like comment and subscribe and you
can watch some other videos here after
you don't watch in this video although
I'd feel the bow sound where is only
useful in a handful of scenarios it's
not cheap at all the Bose sound we're
currently retails for $2.99 95 which is
slightly less than the more useful bose
qc25 2 headphones and the same as the
Bose Soundlink revolve plus speaker Bose
also sells different color fabric covers
for 29.95 each if you want to pick this
product up I'll have ones in the
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you think that the best deal
possible the bose sound wear comes
included with a black fabric cover on
micro USB cable for charging some
documentation and that's it and first
let's talk about the fabric cover the
fabric itself is very soft and smooth to
the touch it also stretches so it'll fit
the sound were perfectly no matter what
position it's in on the bottom the
synthetic leather that keeps the speaker
in place when you're wearing it but it
does get warm quickly and it zips up it
comes pre-installed in the box but
removing it and putting it back on is
pretty easy once you get the hang of it
with the fabric cover on the bose sound
wear weighs in at 280 for grants the
actual body of the sound where is
covered in silicone it also bends in
flexes and it'll keep its shape so he
can adjust it to your liking and after a
while you forget you've been wearing the
thing on the right side there's your
volume control buttons and a
multi-purpose by it
tap wants to play or pause double tap or
triple tap to skip a track or go back a
track and press and hold to activate
Siri and if you've got a phone call the
sound where itself will vibrate and you
can accept in and cause by pressing the
multi-purpose button on the left side
you'll find the power button or microUSB
port for charging and led battery gauge
underneath and a Bluetooth button and
whether you have the fabric cover on or
off it's very easy to tell which button
is which just by touch concerning tech
specs I'm assuming the Bose sound where
is using the same bluetooth for that to
set up as the bose qc25
2 it can be paired to two devices at the
same
time and wireless range is at about 40
feet it also does a great job of keeping
us on connection through multiple walls
which I feel is even more important for
this type of product advertise battery
life on the Bose and where it is twelve
hours but realistically I've been
averaging about eight hours but it does
have quick charging plug them in for
fifteen minutes and you get three hours
of playback time and technically the
quick charging on the sound where is
slightly better than the bus QC
thirty-five to the Bose Anwar has two
upward facing speakers that literally
should sound right into your ears it's
like having surround sound with you
everywhere you go
actually listening to the sound where
while you have it on sounds completely
different than if you were to listen to
it slightly away from you in general it
sounds really good there's a lot of the
bass summer so it will even rattle on
your neck sometimes though low winds
might be a little weak but that's
because the speakers themselves are
pretty small but if you crank the volume
all the way up it gets so loud that
people have to shout to get your
attention and there's very little
distortion at those higher volumes mids
and highs are also very clear and
there's almost never any raspy miss my
one complaint is that I do feel the mids
and vocals might be a little pushback at
times the sound or also connect supposes
connect that I start from being able to
see your current battery status and
adjust your settings you can also reduce
the amount of based of sound where has
but interestingly enough you cannot
increase the bass but that's not really
a problem cuz they do have a lot of bass
to begin with but obviously if you
listen to music with the sound where
people around you are going to hear it
and if you're in an area with a lot of
noise pollution then you're not going to
be able to hear your music clearly you
can't really wear them on your commute
to school or work or at the gym or at
the office cuz people will hate you
unless you have your own office but
still you're better off with headphones
and if you want to listen to music while
you're at home doing chores or working
from home you can achieve the same
surround sound effect by syncing to
cheaper portable speakers together and
set the
either side of you a few scenarios I can
think of where the Bo's Sandler might
come in handy might be for people who
want to hear music while they're
casually bike riding around the city and
need to be aware of their surroundings
it could also be useful for people who
want to have music with them when
they're out walking their dog out on a
stroll or maybe even hiking if you're
doing something that requires you to go
from room to room but you still want
your music with you the sound war might
also be handy it might even be useful
for VR but even though the sound where
is water and sweat resistant I wouldn't
recommend it for running or cycling if
you run with them on you're just gonna
have this mass dancing on your neck and
if you start with them the sound where
is just going to collect more sweat and
it's going to become this hot spot on
your neck but I do think the sound war
might be a good solution for people who
live in an apartment and still want that
surround sound without risking bothering
their neighbors a max volume the sound
where is no louder than a small portable
bluetooth speaker playing a 75 percent
volume but when worn around your neck
the sound is very immersive and
impressive so I think you'd use it to
watch movies with the surround sound and
feel like you're at a movie theater
without risking having your landlord
knock on your door I also think the Bose
sound where it is great for taking phone
calls it has a really good sounding
microphone even if you talk very softly
it has no problem picking you up even if
you're walking or if you adjust the
sound of our conversation it's not
really going to mess up the audio but
again this audio clip is being recorded
by the microphone on the Bose sound
where so you can be the judge of that
although the boats Anwar has a great
sounding microphone and you're supposed
to wear a most at a time I think both
messed up by not including the quick
action button like they did on the boss
QC 35 - if the salwar had an action vine
that gave me quick access to Google
assistant I think it would have been
more of an incentive to actually wear it
most of the time because that way it
would have been more than just a speaker
that rests on my neck but I guess Bose
needs an excuse to come out with the
sound we're serious tunas although the
bow sound where is cool and sounds great
I can't really recommend it to most
people for starters it's not cheap it
costs $300 and sometimes when I put it
on I can't help but wonder why did I buy
this and wouldn't I be better off using
headphones or a speaker for this
situation like I said he got really
weird in public cause you're going to
the start people around you and
just going to use it at home then you
can get some great sounding speakers for
less and you can't entertain multiple
people with this Speaker I commend Boas
for trying new things but unless you fit
the scenarios I mentioned earlier I
wouldn't recommend picking the Bose and
we're up become below how would you use
the Bose and where or another similar
