three a few days before the iPhone 8 and
iPhone 10 keynote and surprisingly they
didn't even mention the Beats Studio 3
at all during your keynote like they did
with the beats solo 3 and the beats XL
last year and personally I expected a
lot more from these headphones so let's
review the Beats Studio 3 and here are
my suggestions for the Beats Studio 4
beats have always had a reputation of
being expensive and not sounding so
great but they are very stylish and come
in multiple color weights right now you
have 6 colors to choose from and I know
new colors will be released in the
future
unlike the Beats Studio 2 which used to
retail for 379 99 the Beats Studio 3 did
get a price cut and sell for 3 49.95
if you still want to pick these
headphones up I'll have links to
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deal
possible beats frequently go on sale so
you make it look a part of the reason
beats are so expensive or because of
marketing and packaging unboxing the
Beats Studio 3 is like unboxing any
other Apple product it's an experience
that makes you feel like you just bought
something great when you open the lid
the first thing you see is the hard
shell carrying case inside the case are
the headphones themselves and I'm gonna
tell you right now the camera does not
do the color justice it's so really
bright red but I like it underneath
you'll find your audio cable
documentation a carabiner and no micro
USB cable for charging and I know a lot
of people have already pointed this out
but it is beyond me why Apple decided to
keep the microwaves me point instead of
throwing in a USB type-c port or a
lightning connector because I really
enjoy being able to charge my iPhone in
the air pods with the sync cable and on
the other side there's your audio jack
which I don't see gonna remove to
anytime soon I hope build quality is
questionable at best the plastic used
has me a little worried because you can
actually see through it but maybe it's
for weight savings cuz these headphones
are slightly lighter than the Sony 1000x
m2 and the bose qc25 to weighing in at
260 grams the headband itself doesn't
have too much padding but there is a lot
of grip on the bottom so it keeps the
studio threes in place then here comes
themselves are plush and Apple claims
they rework the stitching to make them
more comfortable but I do want to point
out the ear cuffs themselves are
slightly smaller than
there over ear headphones I have what I
think are average sized ears and the ear
pad still press against my ears unlike
the bose qc25 ii was completely in case
my ears and the 1000x empty which
slightly press against adjustment your
lobe the headband itself doesn't flex
too much and there is slightly more
clamping force 10 to 1000 X m2 but it's
still comfortable to wear and since they
do have a tighter fit they also stay in
place better especially when running the
studio threes can only fold up and can't
be laid flat which I personally prefer
cuz it makes touring headphones much
easier when traveling on the left ear
cup you've got your buttons for basic
music playback controllers and if you
press and hold the beats logo you can
activate Siri or you can just say hey
Siri and under the power button you've
got a battery gauge which is nice also
if you double press the power button
twice you can toggle the active noise
cancellation on and off now I don't know
if this is a result of cheap hinges or
if Apple did this on purpose but that's
pretty cool I mean the Bose and Sony
can't do that it's like it's like a
quick release now I know your average
consumer already touched on this but
with the beats to do 3 you can't use the
wide connection when the headphones
themselves are turned off so if you have
absolutely no power then you got
yourself a 350 dollar headband but the
quality of the included audio cable is
pretty good it has the same rubber outer
layer like lightning cables and it has
the same inline controller that you were
fine on the power beats 3 and speaking
of accessories the included carrying
case isn't half bad either the outer
layer is covered in synthetic leather
and the case itself is very sturdy sure
if you were to pack your headphones in
your luggage they should be just fun or
if you decide to hang the case with your
carabiner your headphones should be just
fine if they bump into something
personally I dropped the case down a
flight of stairs while I was out getting
b-roll and the headphones themselves
were just fine
since Beats is owned by Apple beats are
usually better with use with Apple
devices the Beats Studio 3 now have
apples w1 chip which was introduced last
year and let me tell you being able to
seamlessly switch from either V Apple
devices is very convenient you could be
listening to music on your iPhone watch
a video on your iPad and then switch to
your macbook all without having to pair
your headphones but if you want to use
your studio threes with an on Apple
device all you have to do is press and
hold the power button for five seconds
and pair them via bluetooth the Beats
Studio 3 also advertised a better life
of 22 hours with pure ANC on but in my
testing they actually lasted me for
almost 25 hours and with noise
cancellation turned off beats advertises
a battery life of 40 hours but again in
my testing they lasted me for almost
forty seven hours not bad at all but if
you were to compare the battery life of
the Beats Studio 3 with other noise
cancelling headphones on the market if
they were battery life with the noise
cancellation turned on is pretty average
because the sony 1000 XM 2 has a real
double battery life of 35 hours with
noise cancellation turned on but beat
kills it when it comes to quick charging
a 10 minute charge gets you 3 hours of
playback time which is better than both
the sony 1000 x m2 and the both QC 35 to
the Beats Studio 3 have what Apple is
calling pure adaptive noise cancellation
and basically the noise cancellation
will automatically adjust depending on
your surroundings when you want to quiet
room the noise cancellation is low you
feel no cabin pressure and it does an
okay job of blocking out some cell and
then when your surrounding sounds get
louder you'll notice the noise
cancellation starts to get stronger but
when that happens you also feel the
cabin pressures start to kick in not as
much as the bose qc25 2 but it is very
noticeable like I could only wear them
for a while before having to take them
off to take a break and even when the
noise cancellation is turned all the way
up it's still not as good as the bow or
with the Sony but at least these
headphones don't pick up as much wind
noise as the Bose you see like right now
I just have to pop my ears beats have
also had a reputation for being super
bass heavy headphones but that's not the
case with the Beats Studio 3 they still
have a good amount of bass of them but
it's
overpowering I just feel the mids and
instrument separation does need
improvements they don't sound as good as
to 1000x am too but I do prefer these
over the bose qc25 - but I think Apple
really dropped the ball to be Google at
its own game right now voice assistants
are the next big thing
Google just announced our pixel buds and
bulls release the bose qc25 2 with a
dedicated button that streamlines your
interactions with Google assistant a
single press reads out your
notifications and if you tap and hold
your instantly talking to your assistant
there's no awkward waiting period
what's Tesla stock price Tesla is
trading at 350 dollars and 67 cents a
share after hours down 0.12 percent from
closing its 442 p.m. you don't have any
recent updates and that will get a head
start when they release the arrow pods
and there's no reason the beats studio
shouldn't have features from the ear
buds first when I take my ear pods out
they automatically pause my music I want
the beats to do floor to do that and I
want them to start the music back up
when I put them back on I also think
it's time Apple upgraded the controls on
the left ear cup buttons are nice but
what if it was a touch pad like the 1000
X and - and what if that touch pad had
multi-touch so I depending on how many
fingers want a touch pad you could do
different actions or maybe even launch a
preset app on your phone but more
importantly what if with two fingers on
the touchpad you could quickly talk to
Siri just like how you talk to Google
assistant on the post-pc 35 - so again
this would mean much faster notification
readouts and a much more streamlined
experience when using Siri and here's
the microphone test and I gotta say the
microphone on the Beats Studio 3 is
perhaps the best mic I've tested on a
pair of headphones so far I mean it is
very hard to tell the difference when
you're using the headphones versus when
you're using the phone but again this
audio clip is being recorded by the
microphone on the Beats Studio 3 so you
can be the judge of that
but it's it's pretty solid ok so let's
wrap this up I feel the Beats Studio
three are over priced at $350 their
sound quality is decent but Barry leaf
is average and the noise cancellation
needs improvement
but if you're heavily invested in the
Apple ecosystem then the w12 makes life
a little easier not to mention you get
some pretty solid range and they almost
never drop out and I do have to admit
the beats to do threes look great and
they give you a lot of good-looking
collages to choose from because I'm
gonna be frank the Sony 1000x m2 and the
bose qc25 two don't look as sleek as
these but I would only consider getting
these if they were on sale but if I had
to pick a pair of headphones to work out
in I would go with the B studio threes
they just stay in place so well and the
quick charging is perfect if you forget
to charge your headphones before your
workout but here's my wishlist for the
beats to do for or whatever they call it
for sure keep the audio jack because
you're gonna need that for plane rides
throw in a lightning connector or USB
type-c port improve the battery life to
at least thirty hours with ANC on add
proximity sensors like I'm the air pod
so the headphones know when I'm using
them and either integrate touchscreen
controls like I said or add an extra
button so I can talk to Siri or whatever
voice assistant in a much more
streamlined fashion like I'm the boss QC
35 - but I want to hear from you what
would you like to see on the beats to do
for
