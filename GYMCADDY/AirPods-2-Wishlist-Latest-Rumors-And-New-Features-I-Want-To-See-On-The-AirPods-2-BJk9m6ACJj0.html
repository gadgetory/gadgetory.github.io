were ridiculed cause of how they looked.
But then they became iconic and for better
or for worse, they’ve become a status symbol.
But now there are rumors going around that
we may see the much anticipated Airpods 2
on March 29th with some new upgrades to both
the charging case and the AirPods themselves.
So first im going to tell you what those new
rumors are and then im going to tell you what
other features I would like to see in the
AirPods 2 that I think apple could easily
and should add into their new AirPods 2.
So, you should take the latest rumors that
came out of EverythingApplePro’s most recent
video with a grain of salt.
But in it there are claims that the AirPods
themselves wont be as glossy anymore, but
instead have a matte finish similar to the
Apple Pencil 2.
And I think that would be great cause that
would mean you get more grip when handling
the earbuds.
Cause even though my AirPods never fall out
of my ears, Ive found im more likely to drop
my AirPods when im taking them out or putting
them back in their case.
The next major rumor around the AirPods 2
pertains around the carrying case.
Now we already know wireless charging is coming
to the AirPods 2 cause apple already told
us.
But now there are rumors going around that
the case itself will be able to go from a
zero percent charge too 100% in just 15 minutes.
And thats impressive cause currently it takes
about 3 hours for the AirPods case to fully
charge.
But in order for the AirPods 2 to have wireless
charging theres also a rumor going around
that the case will be getting slightly larger
and heavier.
But still compared to all to other charging
cases other I think the AirPods 2 will still
be one of the smallest and longest lasting
charging cases.
Cause competitors are still struggling to
match the battery performance of the current
AirPods charging case.
But this leads me to wonder if Apple will
be improving the quality of the batteries
found in their AirPods 2.
The AirPods have an advertised battery life
of 25 plus hours when they’re brand new.
The AirPods could last for 5 straight hours
and the case could supply an additional 4
or five charges.
So when I first got my AirPods I would have
to charge them every 4 or five days.
But due to battery degradation when my AirPods
were about 16 months old I noticed my AirPods
could only last for about 3 and half straight
hours and I would have to charge their case
every 3 days.
But now that my AirPods are over 2 years old
they can barely last for 2 straight hours
on a single charge and I have to charge my
case every other night.
So im not asking for a longer battery life,
but I wonder if the AirPods 2 will be able
to deal with battery degradation better and
keep their performance for longer.
But I doubt it cause ultimately it not in
apple’s best interest.
But this leads me into the first feature that
I think Apple should defiantly add to their
new AirPods 2… and it has to do more with
iOS honestly.
And thats I would like iOS to give me a drop
down notification whenever the Airpods charging
case gets down to 20% battery sort of like
how you get that notification when your iPhone’s
battery is low.
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been
caught with a dead AirPods case just cause
I didn’t know I had to charge to them.
Now I know theres the battery indicator light
on the case and you can pull up the AirPods
card on your iphone…
But I just feel a drop down notification would
be much more effective.
Another feature that I would like to see make
its way to the AirPods 2 is a transparency
mode.
A lot of other headphones and earbuds now
have a transpanacy mode where they’ll pump
in the ambient sound around you so you can
still be aware of whats going on when you’re
listening to your music or podcasts.
There have been a lot of times where Ive been
in an office waiting room listening to something
while I wait, but didn’t hear when the receptionist
called my name.
And Apple already sort of has this feature
with their live listen mode.
But instead of using the built in microphones
on the AirPods, Live Listen broadcasts what
ever the microphone on the iPhone is picking
up and plays that through your AirPods.
And like I said, transparency mode is quickly
becoming a standard feature on a lot of newer
earbuds and Headphones, and I feel apple can
easily add this feature to their AirPods cause
they already have the built in microphones.
And finally theres better voice support, and
apple has already subtly hinted at this through
promos and leaks.
But I want to be able to simply say hay siri
and just keep talking like we already can
with our iPhones and smart speakers.
Cause right now if you want to talk to siri
with the current AirPods you have to double
tap, wait a second or two and then start talking.
But thats pretty much it, even though I’m
really looking forward to the AirPods 2 with
wireless charging…
I really think apple desperately needs to
add a transparency mode to their new AirPods
2.
Cause even though I feel the current AirPods
are still the best truly wireless earbuds
on the market when it comes to price and performance
I really miss having that transparency mode.
But comment down below, what other improvements
would you like to see on the AirPods 2?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
