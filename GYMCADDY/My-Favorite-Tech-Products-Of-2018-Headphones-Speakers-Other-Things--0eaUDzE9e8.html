thought it would make a list of some of
my favorite products that I've reviewed
in 2018 these are the products that I
feel you can't go wrong within their
respective categories and the products I
have no problem recommending on a
regular basis now just adds up there's
going to be a lot of headphones on this
list cuz the headphone market is really
heating up and I'm really excited to see
where it goes in 2019 but don't worry
other things like speakers drones and
accessories also made their way onto
this list so first up I think it's
pretty obvious if you watch my videos on
a regular basis but my number one most
favorite product of 2018 period or the
Sony 1000 XM threes even though I didn't
expect to get them so soon I'm really
glad we did
I feel the 1000 X and 3s are currently
the best ANC headphones on the market
right now they managed to block out the
most amount of noise and they do so with
very little cabin pressure their build
quality and fit has also been vastly
improved from the predecessors thanks to
their much larger and spacious ear cups
and new low-profile design don't bring a
lot of features like Google assist and
integration have an ambient aware mode
which is very useful when you're walking
around with the city or if you work in
an office and they also have cook
attention which is very useful for short
conversations these headphones also have
a very long battery life even with ANC
turned on and they're fast charging is
great for commuters as well but most
importantly these headphones sound very
good
the bass is deep in punching they have
very well-defined mids and the highs
never crash right now these are the
headphones to beat in 2019 now as a
reminder if you want to pick any of the
products up and mentioned on this list
I'll have links or description below and
if you use the links it really helps up
the channel but I know dropping $350 on
a pair of headphones isn't an option for
everyone which brings us to the Sony
watch 700 n even though they have a
retail price of $200 they typically go
on sale for about 150 and occasionally
go on sale for even 50% off and even
though their build quality isn't amazing
they are perhaps the most featured pack
sub 200 all the headphones out there
just like the 1000 X and threes they
have Google assistant integration they
have an adjustable EQ and they have an
extremely long back
life of 35 hours now even though these
headphones have active noise
cancellation don't expect them to block
out as much noise as the 1000s and
threes but thanks to very very
comfortable and spacious ear cups and a
and C I think the watch a 700 and are a
great pair of headphones for high school
and college students on a tighter budget
looking for headphones to wear while
they study but for those of you looking
for a pair of headphones to have lots of
fun with there's the Skullcandy question
360 now just like hell the sony 1000 XM
threes or currently the best anc
headphones out there these are the best
base set headphones on the market right
now the based on these headphones is
honestly like nothing I've ever heard
before and they make the bass on the
sony xba-1 look like a joke but I'm
telling you any time I wear these
headphones I can't help crack smile now
yeah I know $300 does seem like a lot
for a pair of basehead headphones but
Skullcandy makes up for it with their
build quality there's a lot of metal on
these headphones whatever isn't metal is
softest material and the faux leather
feels pretty good as well and even if
you use these headphones with their base
feature turned off there are a
good-looking pair of headphones period
with a decent battery life of twenty
nine hours and the last headphones on
this list or the audio technica ath and
50x speed team just like how those
sony's are great for commuters and how
the skull candies are great for people
looking to have fun these are great for
creators looking for a pair of
headphones they can use after the done
editing their videos or for people who
just prefer under to sound signature
these headphones have all the great
characteristics found on their
predecessors which have a cult following
and even when you go wireless
they still perform pretty well but
before we wrap up with headphones on
this list I do want to give an honorable
mention to the windows surface at phones
even though they have great styling and
build quality
I really like their dials and they also
have lots of features like a and C and
ambient mode and voice assistant
integration I still think they have lots
of improving to do if they want to catch
up with the Sony 1000x and threes but I
really hope we see a follow up to these
in 2019 but now is gone into my favorite
speakers of 2018 I'm gonna be honest the
only reason I first reviewed the JBL
clip 3 was because my pre-order for my
JBL extreme 2 was late and I really
needed to put out content but after you
in the clip three I just really liked it
a lot now no it doesn't sound as good as
the bow sound like micro but for a sixty
dollar speaker the clip three performs
very well besides I don't use the clip
three to listen to music I use it as my
dedicated podcast machine whenever I'm
working around the house or when I'm in
the shower and since it has a much
longer real-world battery life than the
sound like micro I don't have to charge
it nearly as frequent but if you're
looking for a large portable speaker
then you can't go wrong with the JBL
extreme - what really impresses me about
this speaker compared to all of the
other speakers I've compared their
speaker with is the amount of hardware
this speaker packs in such a small
package not a lot of other speakers out
there have a dual transducer dual
tweeter and dual passive radiators setup
and even though the LG pk7 does have a
similar setup to the extreme - it
doesn't sound or perform nearly as good
so that's why the extreme to you is one
of my most recommended portable speakers
of 2018
it sounds great JBL connect plus makes
it super easy to pair with other JBL
speakers if you plan on getting more in
the future and the new bottle opener
built into the carrying strap has proven
to be more useful than I thought if you
routinely take the speaker to your
friends house whenever there was a
get-together but if you're looking for a
great at-home speaker then that's where
the new Marshall Stanmore 2 comes in the
Stanmore 2 gives you JBL boombox levels
of wall shaking bass at a lower cost and
in a much smaller package it's just a
little bigger than in the extreme tube I
just mentioned and I also feel this as a
great at-home speaker because I'm a
really big fan of them Marshall classic
design so I think the speaker will look
great in almost any living room now when
it comes to drones DJI in particular has
had a very busy year with the release of
their pneumatic air Mavic 2 pro and zoom
ronin s Osmo pocket and ozma mobile -
there's a lot to choose from but I do
think the DJI maverick era is the most
impressive and important product DJI
announced this year the Medicare not
only is a great foldable drone period it
brings uncompromised aerial
cinematography to the masses at a
natural scary price compared to the
magic
and finally the last thing I want to
talk about on this list is Apple's new
18 watt charger even though I think
Apple should have included this charger
with their new iPhones and I really do
think it would really help with their
selves if you do get a new iPhone or
have an iPhone that supports fast
charging you got to do something about
Apple's outdated and slow 5 watt charger
and there you have it there are some of
my favorite products I've had the
pleasure of using this 2018 and I feel
you can't go wrong with any of them if
you choose to pick them up but I'm
really excited to see what 2019 brings
and I can't wait to see how headphones
evolve this coming year if you made it
