announce any new headphones to
complement their 1000x m3s I was
personally expecting them to announce a
new pair of here on three headphones and
an updated version of their XP 950 and
one extra bass headphones they did
however announced that their headphones
will now be getting asset integration
and like I've been saying for a while
now
one more headphones are going to have
voices as an integration here are now I
mean just look at how prominent Cortana
is on the surface headphones but over
the last few days I've been getting a
lot of comments about how the new 4.1.1
former update has negatively affected
the active noise cancellation on the
Sony 1000 XM threes so to get to the
bottom of this I updated my 1000 XM
threes to 4.1.1 and did an ANC test with
another pair of Sony 1000x and threes
running the previous two point zero
point zero for more
and here's what I got but first let's go
through what this new firmware update is
all about a lot of Sony's headphones
already support Google assistant if
you're running the latest firmware even
the older 1000 xm2 and as voice
assistants or maturing and becoming more
prominent in our daily lives Sony's now
pushing to add Alessa integration to the
headphones as well so now you can choose
which voices system you would like to
use if you even want it because in order
to use your voice assistant on your
headphones you have to sacrifice your
ambient sound button meaning that you
won't be able to manually toggle between
having a and C on or off or ambient mode
you would have to open up the app every
single time which is annoying if you
frequently switch between modes like I
do but if you choose to have a voice
assistant in your headphones as soon as
you press and hold this button you can
start talking to your voice assistant
like this turn on the lights in the
studio okay play some music
here's a station you might like Jay Cole
on Amazon music and personally I find
voices integration is very useful in a
pair of headphones if you're working at
home or at the office you can quickly
ask it to do basic math or
conversions for you or if you're walking
around the city you can ask it to play a
specific song or playlist or get walking
directions of somewhere without having
to take your phone out of your pocket
and I find that having a dedicated
physical button on your headphones for
voice assistance is more efficient and
faster than having a present hold a
touchpad or multimedia button on other
headphones and it's more efficient than
having to say hey Cortana on the surface
headphones but shortly after the new
4.1.1 formula up they've started to roll
out I started to get a few comments
about how some owners notice the active
noise cancellation under 1000x and
threes wasn't performing as well as they
used to and that people's voices were
much more audible there's even write a
thread dedicated to the issue and
there's even a few Sony help forums post
as well so to be as fair and as
objective as possible I performed an ANC
test in a controlled environment with a
pair of m3 is running the 4.1.1 for more
updates I'll pair of m3 is running the
two point zero point zero firmware that
the majority of people still have and I
also threw in the surface headphones cuz
I got to put them to work just keep an
eye on the lower right corner of your
screen
[Laughter]
so after performing an ANC test where I
was able to keep the ambient sound
around me at a constant volume I can
objectively say that there is no
difference in performance of the ANC on
the 1000 X and 3s whether they're
running the 4.1.1 former update or a
two-point 0.04 morrow and subjectively I
can also say the same I haven't noticed
any performance decrease in the ANC on
my personal pair of 1000 X and threes
and to avoid any confusion there's no
3.0 firmware for the 1000 X and threes
Sony just jumped from two point zero
point zero to four point one point one I
mean Sony is notoriously bad at just
naming their products there are also
some people claiming that the microphone
audio quality has been improved on the
Sony 1000 X and threes from firmware to
point 0.02 firmware 4.1.1 but personally
I don't hear any difference between the
microphone on either of these headphones
and if Sony did in fact improve the
microphone quality on the 1000 X and
threes I think they would have mentioned
it in their changelog so overall I think
people shouldn't worry about updating to
firmware 4.1.1 cuz contrary to what some
people are saying the ANC hasn't been
negatively affected on the 1000 X and
threes but if you just want to be safe I
don't think there's really any need to
update to 4.1.1 in general because
there's always the possibility of small
portion of users could experience issues
when updating the products it just
didn't happen to me but after using also
for a few days on my headphones I found
that she's not as useful as Google
assistant with Google assistant if you
press the ambient mode button she will
tell you the time and any notifications
you might have like this it's 1:21 p.m.
you don't have new notifications right
now and Google assistant also notifies
you as notifications come in and you can
interact with them like this the
comments section
message from the comments section the
comments section says when are the bose
QC 45 coming out and finally before we
wrap this video up also wanted to adjust
a cold where the touchpad issues
circulating the Internet's right now
partially I never experienced that issue
when my 1000 xm3 we're running the older
firmware and I still haven't had that
issue with my 1000 X and three is
running the newer firmware and if you
were hoping that the new firmware update
would fix that issue somebody makes no
mention of it in their 4.1.1 changelog
either so again I really don't feel
there's any rush to update to 4.1.1
because like I said earlier I think
Google assistance is more useful than
them but if you really need to have a
loss in your headphones I think you're
alright updating to 4.1.1 because like I
demonstrated earlier in my control the
anc test there isn't a drop in
performance when it comes to active
noise cancellation if you made it this
far
I guess you enjoyed the video so hit
that like button and get subscribed to
how someone didn't you realize if you
want to pick another part except mention
in this video those will be linked in

support the channel by checking out the
merch store but other than that I'll get
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
