compromise they sound great and they'll
get you to your destination in style but
you really wouldn't use them as your
daily driver and that's kind of the case
with the reload of chronophage wireless
although I really do like them the only
perfect for everybody but I do like them
so much
the modem was actually cool enough to do
a giveaway just like the video be
subscribe and comment down below with
what your all-time favorite album and as
soon as this video hits a thousand likes
I'll pick a winner and let into your
dance the v-moda cross made to wireless
come in three colorways white black and
a black version with world's gold
accents it's important to take note that
the rose gold version of the crossfade
to supports the apdex codec which means
clearer audio quality over just standard
Bluetooth while the black and white
versions don't support the aptX codec
which really only matters if your device
supports the apdex codec namely premium
Android devices whereas iPhones don't
support app decks and the app tech
support also carries a price premium the
rose gold via motocross phase two
wireless sells for $350 in the white and
black versions retail for $330
personally I would prefer it if all
three of these headphones supported the
apdex codec but if you want to pick
either of these headphones up I'll have
a link in the description below with the
best price and if you click on the link
it really helps out the channel the
v-moda crossfade to wireless come
included with abraded an audio cable
with inline controller a micro USB cable
for charging or quarter inch adapter and
a very stylized hard shell carrying case
that looks amazing all on its own
and without a doubt the v-moda crossfade
to score very high when it comes to
design and build quality first up I
absolutely love the angular design of
these headphones they're a fashion
statement all on their own I also really
like the exposed steel frame which not
only looks great but it's also very
durable the headband and ear cups are
wrapped in vegan leather which feel
great to the touch and there's hard
plastic on the rest of the ear cups
which side note does stand up very well
to drops but does scratch a bit if you
constantly plug and unplug the audio
cable on a regular basis on that in a
second when it comes to actually wearing
these headphones I was surprised how
comfortable they were right out of the
box they have very little clamping force
and there are also very low profile
compared to the Sony 1000 X and 2 Beats
Studio 3
the both QC 35 series - but we do need
to address the ear cups yes the padding
is very plush and overheating is an
issue with me but these ear cups are a
little cramped for most guys I feel
these ear cups are going to end up
resting on years but oddly enough it
didn't bother me but for a fact I prefer
the fit of these ear cups over the fit
of the ear cups found on the Beats
Studio 3 and another thing I really like
about the crossfade 2 is how small they
get when you fold them up I have no
problem leaving these headphones out of
my desk because they take up so little
space and still look great doing so and
since they fold up so small I really
like taking these out for short commutes
or I know lack of a and C isn't going to
be a problem and no these headphones
don't have active noise cancellation
instead V motive relies solely on
passive noise isolation so they block
out some sound but not a lot but they do
prevent a lot of sound leakage on the
top of the white ear cup you've got your
volume control buttons and a
multi-purpose button the buttons enter
tactile feedback are ok but what a
preferred if they had a little more
click to that if you press the center
button once you're playing pause your
music double tap to skip a track triple
press to go back a track and press and
hold to activate your voice assistant
and although finally these buttons by
touch is relatively easy I would prefer
to the setup button with a little raised
or lower than the other two buttons off
to the side instead of all of them just
being flush it will just make
identifying each button much easier on
the first try but another thing I really
like about these headphones is the power
on switch there's just something that's
so satisfying about switching the power
on on these headphones it's a small
detail that you just don't see much of
these days and it really takes me back
to when I used to power on my gameboy
color the v-moda crossfade - also
advertises a battery life of 14 hours
and that's pretty much in line of what
I've been running after testing these
headphones and even though these
headphones are still using bluetooth 3.0
wireless range is at about 30 feet and
they have a strong wireless connection
that never really cuts out and they have
very little latency which is good for
watching lots of YouTube videos but the
v-moda crossfade - don't sound amazing
well used with a wireless connection
their audio quality isn't as clear as
other headphones I've tested and they do
tend to bottom out while listening to
bass heavy music although they don't
have
sharpy v-shaped sound signature they do
have deep blows and surprisingly very
well-defined made sit vocals which I
like a lot and these headphones don't
have too much punch in their bass which
some people might like and they're just
other people that just have to have
debates but when use with a wired
connection dad's when these headphones
start to sound truly amazing the first
thing you'll notice is that they're
sound stage widens up instrument
separation is improved the low is the
bottom out anymore and everything just
sounds clearer and obviously this has to
do because of the wired connection and
with a wired connection these headphones
sound better than the Sony 1000x and -
they're younger and cooler brother
there's somebody here on - which I raved
about a few videos ago and the bose qc25
in the B studio threes but they still
don't sound better and then something a
little bit more expensive like the
Bowers and Wilkins px and v-moda CEO has
stated that their headphones are
foremost designed to be used as wired
headphones and their wireless
capabilities are just there as a
convenience not their main priority and
if you're truly an audiophile you're
probably opting to use a wired
connection regardless you're maybe even
using a phone with a proper built-in
deck or you maybe even have your own
external deck and maybe even an app but
in a world war a phone having an audio
jack now is considered a feature it'll
be very interesting to see how v-moda
adapts with their future products even
though I still use these headphones in
their Wireless mode when I'm commuting I
find myself using these headphones
extensively with a wired connection when
I'm home working on my computer these
are connected directly to my iMac or
connected to my iPhone 6s plus but if
the motor really wants to keep a wired
connections alive they need to give you
a reason to want to use a wired
connection because there are wireless
headphones that sound just as good as
these headphones while wired in Wireless
mode even without the use of the apdex
codec namely the Bowers and Wilkins px
but those go for $400 and you don't get
anywhere near as compact right now I
feel the V Motocross fate - Wireless are
better suited for people who want great
sounding and very compact wired
headphones that also give them the
freedom and convenience or Wireless
usage not the other way around and with
that being said I think these are still
great for on mobile video editing set up
a sound engineer out in the field or a
DJ that just wants something small and
rugged
and he can throw into their bag without
having to worry about them breaking and
that don't take up too much space and
here is the microphone test with the
v-moda crossfade to wireless while in
Bluetooth mode and no it doesn't sound
that great my voice is very push back
and everything just sounds pretty raspy
but here's a microphone test with the
included audio cable and you can clearly
hear a sound difference everything is
much more than fine and just clear but
you can be the judge of that
so like I said at the beginning of this
video there's a lot of compromise with
the V motocross wave 2 Wireless their
battery life is below average compared
to other headphones on the market at the
same price point and you're better off
using these headphones with a wired
connection as opposed to a wireless
connection but still I really do like
these headphones for a few reasons first
off they do sound really good when used
with that wired connection and I'm a
huge fan of the design their build
quality is top-notch they can take a
beating and they get very compact when
you fold them up I have no problem
falling these into my bag and not having
to worry about them because admittedly I
do have to baby the Sony 1000 XM to Sony
here on 2 and Beats Studio 3 but if
you're planning on picking these
headphones up just know what you're
getting yourself into
