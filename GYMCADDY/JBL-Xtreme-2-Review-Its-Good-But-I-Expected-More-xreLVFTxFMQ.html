popular speaker and it's light up and
it's with good reason it sounds good
it's durable and it's versatile and now
we have the highly anticipated sequel
the JBL Xtreme - it's also a good
speaker I mean it's basically a refined
JBL extreme but personally I did expect
a little more here's what I like and
what I don't like about the new JBL
extreme - and do you really have to run
out an upgrade if you we have the
original JBL extreme the original
extreme was first released back in
September of 2015 and it currently
retails for $200 the new JBL extreme 2
was released in May of 2018 and
currently retails for $300 any of you
color options to choose from black blue
like I have here or green if you want to
pick either of these speakers up I'll
have links on description below and if
you use the links it really helps out
the channel I suggest you check them out
because you never know when the extreme
two might go on sale you might get lucky
design-wise the extreme and extreme two
are very similar to one another they
both have the same basic shape they both
have control buttons up top they both
have a fabric mesh covered body and they
both come included with carrying straps
for when you take either of these
speakers on the go with you but the
extreme 2 is slightly all-around bigger
and heavier than the original extreme
the extreme 2 is also slightly more
stylized than the extreme especially
regarding the feet and softer rubber and
cabs but one of the first things that I
came to dislike about the new design
under extreme - was just how hard it was
to actually clip on the carrying strap
compared to the original extreme under
extreme it's fairly easy to clip on and
clip off the carrying strap cause the
hook has a good amount of room to move
around but in the extreme - since the
arches are so low profile you do have to
clip on the strap in a certain manner
I just wish these arches had a little
more clearance for a better usability
now I know this might be a non-issue for
some people but the extreme - has a few
of these Forks that just make you think
JBL should have thought things to do
better but since we're on the topic with
the carrying strap the carrying strap
itself has also gotten a few changes to
make it look a little more premium most
notably there's a built in bottle opener
on the cang strap which is definitely
only supposed to be used for soft drinks
my only gripe with the new strap is
essence it is a little more narrow it
does move around a lot more I would like
to see a little rubber on the bottom for
better grip okay let's focus on the
speaker itself on the back of the
extreme tooth there's a rubber garment
that houses your audio jack for Wired
listening on mic USB port for service a
USB out for charging your own device and
in AC port for charging and the new
power brick that comes included is
slightly smaller than the power brick
that comes included with both the
original extreme and JBL boombox but JBL
decided to get rid of one of the USB
outs so you can only charge one device
at a time whereas the original extreme
lets you charge up to two devices at a
time when it comes to battery life
unfortunately things having changed both
of these speakers come included with
10,000 milliamp hour batteries and since
the extreme two is slightly bigger and
heavier than the outgoing extreme I just
don't get how none of it went towards
improving the battery life now don't get
me wrong
both of these speakers have good battery
lives but I would have liked to see in
JBL increase the battery life on the
extreme - from the original extreme JBL
advertises the battery life of 15 hours
on both of these speakers and in my
testing with the volume set at 50
percent the extreme - actually managed
to average 16 and a half hours of
playback time and with the volume set at
80 percent extreme to average 10 hours
of playback time even though these are
all pretty good battery lines I would
have liked it if JBL upgraded to a 12 or
15 thousand milliamp hour battery but
one noticeable upgrade the extreme 2 has
over the extreme is durability the
extreme 2 now carries an IP x7
certification so it's waterproof to a
certain extent whereas the original
extreme is only water-resistant a splash
of water isn't a problem but the extreme
2 can be submerged in water without any
issues and also found that it floats ok
now let's talk about speaker setup
because it has been tweaked a little the
original extreme comes included with duo
63 millimeter diameter woofers duo 35
millimeter diameter tweeters and dual
passive radiators on each side the
extreme two on the other hand has
slightly larger 70 millimeter diameter
woofers slightly smaller 20 millimeter
tweeters and dual passive radiators on
each side as well
now before we got into the sound test I
do want to point out that both of these
speakers do benefit from a break-in
period when I first got the extreme two
there was a little distortion going on
when the base really got going but after
the break-in period the base and the
extreme two has smoothened out and the
boombox is playing indoors about
the older JBL charged three and JBL
extreme has sell signatures that put an
emphasis on the mids in trouble but ever
since the poll story came out JBL iself
signature has changed to be more neutral
but with a good amount of bass and
treble that should make most people have
you and as a result I feel the JPL
extreme - sounds more balanced and
clearer than the outgoing JBL extreme
and personally I prefer how the extreme
two sounds over the extreme now when it
comes to Max's volume both of these
speakers get equally as loud but since
the original extreme has such a big
emphasis on the trouble you may perceive
it as being louder and as such the sound
will also travel a little farther
outdoors and this is what the boombox
does when set to outdoors mode it
relaxes the bass and puts an emphasis on
the mids in trouble so it sounds louder
whereas since the extreme two doesn't
have as much emphasis on the trouble it
might not sound as loud but it does
sound overall better and max volume
dandy extreme because you're actually
getting a good amount of bass and mids
instead of just blaring trouble that
sounds way too bright well personally I
would have liked to JBL also included
and outdoors mode button on the extreme
- like on the boombox for when I'm using
the extreme - at home or for when I'm
using it outdoors with friends again
this is one of those things I feel JBL
should have thought through since they
are trying to market the speaker as this
great companion for when you're outdoors
hanging with your buddies but if you
really want to get a little more volume
out of the extreme - you can also just
use your wall as plugged in and it
immediately gets louder and even when
the speaker is plugged in and playing a
max volume the speaker still sounds good
there's barely any Distortion
now while the extreme 2 is plugged in
it's rated as a 40 watt speaker but
unfortunately I don't know what it's
rated at when it's used with just its
battery power I'm guessing maybe 30
watts but that's just a guess but
perhaps the most important difference
between the original extreme and the new
extreme - is that the extreme tuned
has JBL connect plus so you can pair it
up to newer JBL speakers and get them
playing in sync and if you have another
extreme shoe then they'll play in stereo
mode and JBL connect plus is the best
and easiest way to pair of multiple
speakers together you literally press
one button on each speaker and the
speakers will figure out the rest by
themselves you don't have to mess around
with any Bluetooth settings and you
don't have to mess around with any extra
apps but unfortunately the original
extreme uses the older JBL connect so
you can only pair it up to older
speakers that also use JBL connect like
a post to or the JBL charge 3 right out
of the box now Vera is a former update
for the charge 3 so can get upgraded to
JBL connect plus but JBL has stated the
original extreme won't be getting such
firmware update cuz of hardware
limitations so no the extreme can not be
paired up to an extreme - now when it
comes to Bluetooth connectivity the JBL
extreme 2 has a stable wireless
connection and it has no problem going
through multiple walls but I have
noticed there is a little latency when
watching youtube videos it's not awful
but it is noticeable ok and here's the
microphone test and to be honest it's a
lot better than I expected but this
other clip is being recorded by the
microphone on the JBL extreme - so to
wrap things up the biggest differences
between the original JBL extreme and the
new JBL extreme - is a slightly better
sound signature and ipx7 certification
and JBL connect plus the JBL extreme to
you is a good speaker but I would have
liked to have seen better life
improvements and indoor and outdoor mode
button like on the JBL boombox and maybe
even quick charging if you already have
other JBL connect plus enabled speakers
or if you plan on buying more JBL
speakers in the future then I would
consider upgrading to the extreme - but
if you just want a single large portable
speaker that he can throw around the
summer then I would get the orbital
extreme while supplies last I just want
to make it perfectly clear the JBL
extreme 2 is a good speaker and I like
it but I did expect a little more if you
made it this far I guess you enjoyed the
video so hit that like button and guess
scribe helps up more than you realize
