to dropped a few weeks ago and or a
slight redesign from the original Nike
Luna at the glow planet wedding shoes
the main difference between the two is
the upper but they still share the same
itzel and since the lunar epic loaf
limits you are now out that means you
can save some bucks with the original
version you can clearly pick up the
multicolored colorway for around 120
dollars over a finish line with free
shipping or if you really want to
bargain you can pick up the black
colorway for 99-98 All Things Considered
that's your really good price since the
newer version retails for 160 review on
those coming soon as the name implies
the nike lunar ever glow is a low top
version that doesn't have the huge stock
liner like the rhythm of it the original
design was polarizing ss4 personally I
didn't mind it the author of the shoe is
constructed box liner which is similar
but different from adidas primeknit
climate is as breathable as primate but
is nowhere near as stretchy as fine the
less elastic cloth upper means of snug
fit when you put on the shoe something
that some runners will prefer over
primate we the within the planet itself
it's also Nikes fly wire system fly wire
is specific to Nike and it does a really
good job when it comes to lock down when
you tie your shoes it's far superior
than maybe this is caged time on the
otakus also there's an extra lace loop
if you want to make a lace lock for that
extra lock down the fleming offer also
means the shoe is very lightweight one
big issue I do have at the upper of the
shoe is the tongue since the turn itself
is a separate piece it does tend to
shift when walking or running it's also
very thin and doesn't provide any
padding so if you really tighten your
laces all of that pressure goes to your
instep I don't know what it is about
Nike but they really just love using
thing comes on the shoes this is the
same issue I had with the Wilma leo 3
but at least a heel counter on the shoe
actually keeps your feet in place when
you walk in them and lastly there's a
little hit of 3m on the back of the shoe
so people can see you if you want at
night but for safety reasons you should
really be wearing more reflective
materials if you're running at night
whether you get the Nike lunar epic loaf
limit or the Nike lunar loaf limit - you
still get the same midsole which
honestly is probably the main reason why
you would get these shoes first up
there's no proper hour to long issues so
traction is OK at best they perform best
when they're on pavements the missile is
made up of two different materials the
outer or white layer is your standard
foam and the green portion of the shoe
is the actual lunar mod Lunarlon
isn't as soft as adidas ultra boost
material which might interest you
you're looking for something a little
surfer to run it there are some people
like myself that absolutely love boots
but there are some other people that
don't like it as much because they feel
like it's too squishy on the side of the
shoe you will also notice these grooves
and that's there to give the foam layer
a little more compressibility to keep up
with the lunar lock and on the bottom of
the shoe you will see Maggie's flexbox
system if there's one thing Nike is good
at its engineering the super stylized
outside the Flex pod system is very
unique and you notice them the moment
you put on the shoe the Flex pods are
placed strategically on the student so
that they can absorb as much energy as
you can when you want but fair rewarding
I have heard that gravel insult like to
get wet in between the grooves of the
Flex pot clubbing them to leave a trail
of debris so when they eventually fall
out over all the Nike lunar epic low
flying it is a great shoe for anyone
looking for something a little firmer to
run in there are also a neutral shoe
with the 4 millimeter kill jobs
they're also lightweight and comfortable
things with their planet upper
confronting size you can just go true to
size then climate is an extra key as
Prime it your feet will be snug and
secure and running if you do decide to
go with the black colorway from finish
line you were getting a lot of
technologies for 100 bucks hey if you
made it this far I hope you enjoyed the
