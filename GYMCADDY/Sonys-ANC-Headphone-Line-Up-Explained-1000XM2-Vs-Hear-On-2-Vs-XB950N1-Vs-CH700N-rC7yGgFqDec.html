they have the best active noise
cancellation on the market right now and
in general I like so many NC headphone
line up period but I know choosing
between the 1000 XM - here on - xB 950
n1 n CH 700 ends can get a little
confusing because they each have their
own pros and cons so today we're going
to break down Sony's an ANC headphone
line up so you can choose the right ANSI
headphones for you just so we're clear
this isn't a full review on either these
headphones I'm just trying to point out
the most important differences between
them so I can hope you a purchase
decision if you want to learn more about
either of these headphones then watch
their full reviews the sony whch 700
ends are the newest and most affordable
anc headphones here retailing for one
$99.99 the sony MDR XP 950 n ones or the
oldest headphones here in retail for two
$49.99 the sony here on tuesday till
four to $99.99 and are a few months
younger than the 1000 x and twos which
were released in the fall of 2017 and
retail for three $49.99 if you want to
pick either of these headphones up I'll
have links in the description below and
if you use the links it really helps out
the channel check them out because Sony
headphones routinely go on sale so you
might get lucky
first let's get some simple button
points things out of the way all for
these headphones charge via on my
curious B port and I'm shocked that not
even the 700 ends which are the newest
headphones here use a USB C port but all
for these headphones have an easy to
reach 3.5 mm audio jack which is good
news for my audio files out there who
might want to get a better quality audio
cable for their headphones and they can
all be used passively but only the Sony
1000 x m2 comes included with a hard
shell carrying case which is a must if
you're going to be traveling or
commuting a lot with these headphones
whereas the here on - and XP 950 n ones
come included with carrying pouches the
Huron twos come included with a body
color matching polyester carrying pouch
which is pretty durable and good at
repelling water whereas the carrying
pouch included with the XPS is made of a
kind and it's not as durable and the 700
ends don't come with a carrying case or
pouch at all but still I suggest you
invest in a hard shell carrying case
regardless regarding build quality in
general
sony does a really good job of packing
in technology and features into their
headphones but their build quality isn't
spectacular all for these headphones
have a stainless steel headband plastic
body panels and synthetic leather on the
ear cups of headband but the plastic
used on the 700 ends and XP 950 enones
is textured whereas the plastic used on
the here on 2 and 1,000 exempt you is
completely smooth the synthetic leather
used on the 1000 xm2 here on - and XPS
all feel the same whereas the synthetic
leather on the 700 ends doesn't feel as
nice now I've had the 1000 X M - since
they first came out and they are my
daily drivers and I haven't had any
cracking issues under the headband which
was a big problem with the previous 1000
X's so either these headphones should be
just fine if you're mindful of them when
it comes to comfort all four of these
headphones fit very differently but
without a doubt the most comfortable
headphones here are the here on tools
and the 1000 X M shoes are of very close
second but they're both big head
approved as in if you have a bigger hell
like me they should fit you just fine
and they aren't going to crush your head
like the Bowers and Wilkins px or the
school can be crushers but the human
tools are the most comfortable
headphones here because of their ear cup
design
there's the Rooneys ear cups here and
they in case your ears and since so
little padding actually makes contact
with your skin overheating isn't an
issue but the here on Tues aren't as low
profile as the 1000 X and choose they do
stick out a bit but the ear cups on the
1000 X and twos are a little more
cramped and says they have a little more
padding in contact with your skin
don't might overheat or if you have
larger ears then don't might rest on
your earlobes in third place or the 700
ends because they do fit a little snug
but your ear cups are very similar to
the here on Tues they're roomy and there
isn't too much padding in contact with
your skin and then last place is the XP
950 n1 they also fit a little snug like
the 700 ends but they're not unbearable
the reason the XP 950 and ones you are
in the last place is because of the
sheer amount of padding they have since
there's so much padding in contact with
your skin they will overheat very
quickly if you're walking around with
them on or if you're in a warm room and
these ear cups will rest on your
earlobes and not to mention the XP stick
out
like you can actually see them in your
peripheral vision regarding battery life
the 700 ends outlast all of the other
headphones here with ANC and Bluetooth
turned on and with the volume set at 50%
the 700 ends the average 37 hours
playback time under the same conditions
the 1000 XM to average 32 hours of
playback time and the here on to average
27 hours of playback time but the xB 950
anyones have the worst battery life here
averaging just 18 hours of playback time
with ANC Bluetooth and a extra bass
feature turned on all four these
headphones also have a wireless range of
about 30 feet and then really suffer
from any type of connection issues which
is good and since the latency on either
these headphones isn't that bad either
these headphones will be just fine for
watching videos but all for these
headphones can only be connected to one
device at a time which does suck if your
power user
I just feel these headphones should be
connected to at least two devices at a
time all four of these headphones have
active noise cancellation and for the
most part as you go up in price I found
the anc performance does it improve but
the main reason I like Sony's any NC
technology so much is because they don't
cause me any headaches or have any cabin
pressure like the bose qc25 the 700 ends
have the worst anc performance here and
it's really only worth using when used
on a bus ride commute because it does a
better job of blocking out constant
low-frequency sounds then it does
blocking out chatter the anc on the XP
950 enones
is a little better but they also have a
lot of passive noise isolation because
of all that padding the anc on the here
on two should be good enough for most
people but if ANC is your top priority
and the 1000 XM to you is the way to go
noise cancelling with the 1000 xm2 is
you can also go in and calibrate the ANC
so you can better adapt to your
surroundings and this isn't just
marketing fluff there have been multiple
times where I've gone through the
calibration process while traveling and
noticed a real performance difference
also since the ANC microphones are on
the 1000x m2u is a little recessed under
the synthetic leather on the ear cups
they managed to pick up the least amount
of wind noise when walking around the
city on a windy day whereas since the
ANC microphones on all of the other
headphones are so exposed
you might hear on sound here and there
the 1000 x m2 is also a choose how much
ambient sound he will like to live in
and this feature is good because you
still be able to hear your surroundings
if you're walking around the city or if
you're working in office you can still
hear if someone calls your name the here
on Tuesday also have an ambient sound
mode but it's a set amount
regarding sound quality let's focus on
the 700 n here on 2 and 1000 xn 2 for a
minute
they all sound good but the 700 ends
don't have the same soundstage or an
instrument separation as they here on to
you or 1000 X empty but they do have a
surprising amount of bass with your size
when it comes to the sound quality
between the 1000 x m2 and here aren't
you no matter how hard I try I can't
find any noticeable differences between
the two but definitely there is a sound
quality improvement when choosing
between the 700 n and the 2 more premium
headphones and through Sony's headphones
app you can adjust EQ on either of these
3 headphones so you can dial them in and
make them sound however you like
depending on the type of music you
listen to but listening to the same
music with the XP 950 anyones is a
completely different experience neither
the other three headphones come close to
achieving as the name implies the XP 950
and ones are all about bass that's what
the XP stands for and they're
specifically targeted to people who
listen to rap hip-hop EDM and so on and
the base on the XP 950 anyones doesn't
sound artificial or forced the bass is
also its own entity so it's not going to
muddle or overpower the rest of the song
what it does is that it adds an extra
dimension to your music they're going to
rattle your head and they're going to
make you feel like you're actually at a
concert and you can also go in and
adjust how much extra bass you want
through Sony's app and obviously you can
also use them with the extra bass
feature turn off for a more traditional
headphone listening experience but what
I do find odd is that you can't fully
adjust see EQ on the XP 950 and ones
like you can on the other three
headphones for the most part I like how
they sound but there are times I want to
bring them it down a little bit but now
let's talk about how you go about
controlling music playback on either
these headphones both the 700 n and xB
950 and ones have a falling marker and
music playback switch combo which I
really like because they're both very
easy to find and use to hear on to you
and 1000 extent to you or both using
touch pads now they aren't the only
headphones on the market to use touch
pads but they are arguably the best and
most accurate but what I really like
about both of these headphones is that
they both have quick attention so if you
fully cover the touchpad the headphones
were lower your music and pump in all of
the ambient sound so you can talk to
someone without taking your headphones
off and when you uncover the touchpad
the headphones will go back to blocking
out all of the sound and playing your
music different color temperatures for
that lighting we have launched security
lights red security lights and finally a
small button point thing to take note of
is that the 1000 xm2 here on - and 700 n
will be getting Google assistant
integration in the near future like the
bose qc25 series - through a software
update since the XP 950 n ones are the
oldest headphones here they won't be
getting this feature and also feel the
XP 950 N ones are the next pair of
headphones here that will be getting a
hardware refresh since they are a part
of sony's MDR lineup instead of their
newer lwase lineup I just don't know
what so which of these headphones should
you choose obviously if you're on a
tighter budget get to 7-under ends but
still they're low profile design stupid
long battery life and ANC performance
make them a great pair of budget ANC
headphones for commuting I really enjoy
the XP 950 and ones but they are made
for a very specific type of person who
absolutely loves bass but I wouldn't get
the XP 950 and ones if I needed a pair
of headphones for commuting there Big
Show they're harder to store in a bag
and since overheating is an issue you're
going to get sweaty ear cups if you walk
around with them on even though I love
the Sony 1000 XM - I think most people
will be better off with the here on -
because of their slightly lower price
point and much more comfortable ear cup
design you're getting the majority of
the features found on the 1,000 XM - but
the 1000 XM 2 is still the better option
if you want a sleeker design and if you
want the best agency performance on the
market right now but if Sony is
listening we really want to see USB
type-c on these headphones improved
quick charging and we want to be able to
connect these headphones to more than
one device at a time
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
