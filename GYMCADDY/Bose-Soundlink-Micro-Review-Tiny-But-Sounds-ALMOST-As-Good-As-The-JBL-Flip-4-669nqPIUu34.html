so underrated this speaker is slightly
bigger than the JBL clip to sound so
almost as good as the JBL clip 4 and the
strap on the back makes it super
convenient in so many different
situations it's a little pricey but
definitely worth the money don't forget
to Like comment and subscribe and you
can watch some of the videos here after
you don't wants in this video like I
just said the Bose Soundlink micro lis
is a little pricey compared to its
competition retelling for 110 dollars
but it does come in three colorways
black blue and orange for comparison the
JBL clip 2 is currently selling for $60
and the JBL flip 4 which I feel is the
best small portable bluetooth speaker on
the market right now is on sale for $80
if you want to pick either of these
speakers up I'll have links to
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best view
possible unboxing the Bose Soundlink
micro is pretty bare-bones you get the
speaker a micro USB cable for charging
some documentation and that's it the
speaker itself is slightly bigger than
the JBL clip 2 but it is 100 grams
heavier than the clip 2 weighing in at
287 grams whereas the exteriors of the
JBL clip 2 in flip floor are made up of
fabric and soft Tufts rubber the entire
body of the Bose sound like micro is in
case buy a silicone shell so it's pretty
rugged but it still looks good
the term resistance strap on the back is
also made out of silicone but as much
tougher and doesn't really stretch all
that much but this strap on the back is
so handy it really makes the speaker the
perfect outdoor companion you can
quickly attach it to your bike frame
your backpack your beach umbrella or
whatever without having them a guide for
anything or get extra equipment and the
strap itself is super easy to use but
once it's on it's on but for those
wondering no it does not come off
regarding speaker setup you've got your
power button Bluetooth button micro USB
port for charging and led battery gauge
and Bluetooth indicator light on the top
but unfortunately there is no aux jack
on the front you've got indented volume
up and volume down buttons and in the
centre you've got your texture and
multi-purpose button to control your
music playback
single press to player pause double
press to skip a track triple press to go
back a track and press and hold to
activate Siri there's a single
transducer on the right side and on the
left side there's a past radiator that
produces a surprising amount of base for
a speak of this sized battery 70 percent
connected to I phone when it comes to
wireless range the Bose Soundlink micro
is good for
forty feet but it did have issues
keeping a solid connection when there
were multiple walls between it and my
phone it wasn't able to keep a solid
connection as good as the bose sound
ware or bose qc25 - i also noticed there
was some significant latency when
watching videos but just like all other
bose speakers to sound like micro can be
connected to two devices at the same
time the bose sound like micro is also
ipx7 certified so besides being super
rugged water isn't a problem either you
can submerge it down to one meter and
you won't have any problems the only
downfall is it doesn't float regarding
sound quality the Bose Soundlink micro
sounds way better than the JBL clipped
to the clips - sounds very tinny and
gets round out by all of the bass
whereas it sounded like micro gets much
louder has an even sound signature has
more than enough basic keep you
satisfied and has a pretty good
soundstage
but although the Bose Soundlink micro
does sound really good for its size it
doesn't sound as good as two JBL flip
for the JBL flip before it gets a little
louder
there's deeper bass more trouble and
instrument separation is a little better
a proportional listen when you're out
hiking or on a bike ride the bow selling
micro will get the job done with no
problems
but remember the Bose Soundlink micro is
a very directional speaker almost all of
the sound comes out through the front
and a little bit of bass comes out the
back so if you're gonna listen to music
I suggest you face it towards you
instead of placing on a table and having
all the music shoot upwards but when it
comes to battery life dad's where the
Bose sound like Micro falls short Bose
advertises to battery life of six hours
and that's what I've been getting six
hours and some change unfortunately
there's no official quick charging and
to charge the speaker from empty to full
is gonna take about four hours for
comparison the JBL clip two has a
battery life phone for eight hours and I
routinely average about 14 hours of
battery life on the JBL 54 which is two
hours more than the advertised battery
life of twelve hours so if you plan on
taking the Bose sound like micro with
you on the camping trip or long hike
bring a portable charger okay right now
the Bose sound with micro is about three
feet away from my mouth and to be honest
it's not the worst sounding microphone
but it's also not the best there's a
good amount of static in the background
but again this audio clip is being
recorded by the microphone on the Bose
Soundlink micro so you can either do
that
and finally the bose sound like micro
can also connect to pulses connect that
there's nothing really special you can
adjust your settings check your battery
status measure bluetooth connection and
toggle voice prompts on and off but if
you have other Bose sound like speakers
you can pair the micro up to them
through the app so you can chain them
together or get some cereal sound going
if you have to sound like micros but
overall I didn't expect to like to both
sound like micro as much as I did
it's super tiny and tough making it
perfect for outdoors people looking for
a speaker and the strap in the back
allows you to attach it to almost
anything and quickly will remove it
without any hassle since this is a
really cool outdoorsy speaker I think
it'd have been even cooler is Bose built
in an LED flashlight but like I
mentioned earlier battery life isn't the
best but for a size it sounds very
impressive almost as good as the JBL for
four but in a much smaller form factor
but for one hundred and ten dollars the
bose sound like micro is well worth the
money hey if you enjoyed the video
