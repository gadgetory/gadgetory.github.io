look all that different from the original
Wonderboom...
But if you look a little closer, you'll see
that Ultimate ears has refined and improved
their compact and ultra portable Bluetooth
speaker in all the right places.
And besides some minor lint oicks, I actually
really like the new Wonderboom 2, so much
in fact that I'm going to be giving away this
little guy.
Just be subscribed, hit that like button and
comment down below with what your plans are
for summer 19.
Just like the original Wonderboom, the Wonderboom
2 retails for $100 which means the original
Wonderboom is going to be going on sale now...
But as I'll explain over the course of this
video, if you're thinking about getting a
Wonderboom...
I highly recommend you get yourself the newer
Wonderboom 2 cause it truly is an overall
better product.
But if you want to pick any of the speakers
up mentioned in this video, they'll be linked
down below.
Just like before, the Wonderboom 2 is vying
to be that ultra portable and ultra durable
speaker you take with you with everywhere
cause it can standup to almost everything
thanks to it's mostly fabric body, hard plastic
end caps and IP67 rating meaning that water
means bassicly nothing to this speaker.
And just like before you've got your volume
buttons upfront but now this time around the
multi purpose on the Wonderboom 2 has been
explicitly laid out which is a very small
detail I personally really like.
And you'll also notice that the bungee on
the Wonderboom 2 is much more elastic and
durable which makes it easier to latch onto
things than the original Wonderboom.
But unique to the Wonderboom 2 is this new
out door boost button which I'll go into deeper
in a little bit.
But continuing down the list of improvements
on the Wonderboom 2, this speaker now has
an advertised battery life of 13 hours, 3
hours more than the original Wonderboom.
And in my testing with the volume set at 80%
I got a real world battery life of 9 hours
of playback time, not bad at all especially
considering its size.
But one of my knit picks about this speaker
is that it's still using a micro USB port
for charging.
Personally I would had really like to have
seen a USBC port here cause this way an Android
user would be able to charge their phone and
speaker with the same cable.
And while we're talking about ports I also
want to point out that this speaker doesn't
have an audio jack.
Personally I don't mind it, but just know
you can only use this speaker wirelessly.
But when it comes to wireless connectivity
the Wonderboom 2 has a very stable connection
just as you'd expect, it has a 100 foot range
which is way more than what you need and it
can be connected to 2 devices at the same
time so you and a friend can both be DJ.
So over all wireless connectivity on this
speaker is really good.
But I can only recommend the Wonderboom 2
strictly for listening to music.
Since this speaker is only using the SBC codec
there is a slight latency whenever you try
to watch videos on both Android or Apple devices.
Its a very slight latency but if you’re
as particular as me you will notice it.
But when it comes to speaker set ups, the
Wonderboom 2 has a dual transducer and dual
passive radiator set up.
Half of which shoots out the front and the
other half shoots out the back.
Meaning that this speaker is a 360 degree
speaker.
Which makes this speaker great to use with
friends cause you can just put it down and
cover a large area with music without having
to crank the volume up super loud.
But definitely one of the biggest reasons
why I prefer the Wonderboom 2 over the original
Wonderboom is cause it genuinely sounds better.
This speaker has way more bass than before
so as a result it just sounds much Fuller.
If you use this speaker indoors, it genuinely
sounds much bigger than it has any right to
be.
But if you're going to use this speaker out
doors then you can use the out doors boost
mode.
Now what out doors boost does is that it significantly
reduces the bass on this speaker, but in return
its boosts the mids and highs.
Now yeah it's going to make this speaker sound
pretty bright, but it's also going to make
this speaker get louder and overall your music
is going to travel much farther outdoors.
But just so that you can see for yourself
were going to jump into a sound test.
All of these speakers are playing at the volume,
but the blue Wonderboom is playing in out
doors mode.
So like you may have just heard, the Wonderboom
2 and original Wonderboom have the same sound
signature and in general they do sound pretty
much the same in this sound test, but the
Wonderboom 2 has significantly more bass than
the previous model and it also gets slightly
louder.
You can literally feel your music more with
the Wonderboom 2 especially when you use it
indoors.
And when you're going to use this speaker
out doors you can quickly switch to outdoors
mode and make this speaker get louder and
make your music travel farther.
But if you want to get technical, the bass
doesn’t bottom out, the highs don’t get
tinny, instrument separation is decent, and
distortion isn’t a problem at higher volumes.
But another improvement found one the Wonderboom
2 is it's double up feature.
Just like before, you can get 2 Wonderboom
2 and pair them up to play in sync.
But now, if you have 2 Wonderboom 2's you
can also have them play in left and right
stereo mode.
Pairing these two speakers is super easy and
switching between sync and stereo mode is
just a matter of pressing and holding down
the multi purpose button.
And thankfully the newer Wonderboom 2 can
still pair up to the original Wonderboom.
But keep in mind, they can only be paired
up to play in sync, stereo mode is exclusive
to dual Wonderboom 2’s.
But this leads me to another knit pick about
the Wonderboom 2… unfortunately this speaker
can’t be paired up to UE’s other speakers
like the Megablast, Megaboom3, or Boom3.
And the Wonderboom 2 still can’t connect
to UE’s Boom app so you can’t directly
change this speakers EQ besides pressing the
out doors mode button.
But overall, I still really do like and recommend
the new Wonderboom 2.
Even though this speaker is tiny compared
to a lot of other speakers in this category
the sound quality and amount of bass coming
out of this little guy is truly impressive,
its real world battery life of 9 hours is
going to have no problem keeping up with you,
its 360 sound makes it a great choice if you’re
looking for a speaker to use with friends
on a regular basis, and just its sheer small
size and ruggedness makes this little guy
a great speaker to always take on the go with
you.
But since I really do like the Wonderboom
2, its already got me thinking about what
I would like to see from the Wonderboom 3…
and right now that would have to be USB C
charging, support for higher definition audio
codecs, being able to connect with UE’s
Boom app, and being able to pair with UE’s
larger Boom and Megaboom speakers.
But still, if you’re looking for a small
speaker for the summer, you can’t go wrong
with the Wonderboom 2.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
