looks freakin awesome that RGB base you
don't pick a speaker based on how it
looks you pick a speaker based on how it
sounds so I'm gonna compare the razor
noma chroma
to two other speakers in the same price
range the bose companion 2 series 3 and
the logitech z 623 and if you didn't
know I'm actually doing a giveaway for
the Razer Naga chroma so watch that
video after you're done watching this
video so you know how to answer so money
wise the bose companion series 3 is the
least expensive speaker here retailing
for $99.99 now you could get the base
razor no more speaker without the RGB
bass for $99.99 as well but you're also
giving up a few key features that i will
go into in a minute
the logitech z 623 retails for one
$49.99 but they're usually on sale for
$99.99 over at Amazon and the Razer Nomo
chroma are the newest and most expensive
speaker's here retailing for one $49.99
if you want to pick either of these
speakers up I'll have links in
description below and if you use either
of the links it really helps out to
channel
okay let's talk speaker setup the razor
Nomo chroma has a dual channel setup
with 3 inch diameter drivers and we are
firing base ports it's also worth
mentioning that it connects to your
computer via a USB port whereas with the
base razor normal speaker you're giving
up that USB audio connection and
built-in deck and instead you have to
connect your computer via a 3.5
millimeter audio jack and on top of that
you're giving up the RGB goodness the
Bose speakers connect to your computer
via a 3.5 millimeter audio jack also has
a dual channel setup and has a single
driver in each housing unit and then
there's the Logitech g600 23 which also
connects to your computer via a 3.5 mm
audio jack but if you wanted to you
could also use an RCA connection but the
Logitech is a 2.1 speaker setup you have
your dual satellite speakers with two
and a half inch diameter drivers and a
subwoofer with a diameter of 6 inches
now before we get into the sound test
just know that all three of these
speakers are playing at the same
loudness so you can get a fuel for their
sound quality
now I just want to put it out there that
the Logitech gets the loudest hear when
the computer and the speaker's
themselves are turned all the way up but
at that Max's volume everything is just
distorted personally I think the
Logitech Z 623 sounds decent up until
the dial is turned three-quarters of the
way up after that it's just a mess but
even then the Logitech still gets louder
than the Razer or the Bose the Nomo
chroma is the second louder speaker and
when the Bose is at max volume it gets
as loud as the normal chroma when it's
at 80% volume now I'm making this video
with gamers in mind and it's no surprise
that the Bose speakers are the most
ain't here and in both fashion they have
a very well-defined meets in vocals and
they also do a very good job of
preventing sound distortion and max
volume but granted they don't get that
loud but to my surprise the Razer normal
chroma actually performs pretty similar
to the Bose speakers when they're in
their music preset and just like the
Bose speakers they have very
well-defined mids and vocals but with no
punch in their base they also get louder
and they do a pretty good job of
preventing sound distortion when the
volume is all the way up whereas the
sound quality on the Logitech isn't the
best for listening to music instrument
separation is very weak everything
sounds like throwing the same plane and
the highs tend to sound tinny but like I
mentioned earlier I'm making this video
with gamers in mind and the subwoofer
included with the Logitech can really
get all rooms shaking if you're playing
a game and if there's no rocket
launching in the background you're going
to feel like you're actually there if
you're firing a gun you're going to feel
every shot in your chest the subwoofer
that comes included with the logitech
just gives you an extra dimension of
immersiveness that neither the bose nor
the nomic roma can offer the reason roma
chroma does have a gaming preset which
pushes the mids back and puts an
emphasis on the low so that when you
fire a gun you feel the punch in your
chest but the effect is nowhere near as
immersive or as impressive as the
logitech for $100 plainly said if you're
looking for a budget speaker set up
strictly for gaming you're better off
going with the logitech z 623 over the
normal chroma for $100 you're getting a
dual speaker setup with us
hurt that shakes everything around you
if we're gaming that's kind of what
you're looking for but normal chroma
also has a good amount of punt in space
but nowhere near as much as the lights
attack for obvious reasons the reason
roma chroma are a pair of well rounded
speakers that sound good and look even
cooler with their RGB lighting but like
I said on my initial review build
quality isn't the best personally I
think if you go for the normal chroma
it's more about aesthetics if you're
looking for wall shaking bass like the
Logitech g600 23 you're going to have to
wait for the razer normal Pro and pay
five times the price but given the
performance found under Nomo chroma I'm
pretty excited to see what the inclusion
of a subwoofer and dual tweeters will
bring on the razor normal Pro I just
hope razor will use some beefier screws
