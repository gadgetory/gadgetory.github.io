megablast I didn't like it at all but
then when I revisited the megablast
eight months later thanks to some
software updates and new features I
warmed up to it even though it still has
its problems but now that we have the
boom three and mega boom three I
actually really liked both of these
speakers I feel the mega boom 3 is so
good it can actually keep up with the
big boys like the sony xba-40 one and
the j bo extreme 2 now even though the
mega blast and mega boom 3 look very
similar to one another there are some
key technical and physical differences
that will dive into deeper later on in
this video the mega blast is an Alexa
table speaker that retails for 250
dollars whereas the mega boom 3 and boom
3 or standard speakers that retail for
200 and $150 respectively if you want to
pick either of these speakers up I'll
have a little description down below in
a few user links it really helps out to
channel I highly suggest you check them
out because you never know when these
speakers might go on sale she might get
lucky and also check out the new mesh of
down below first let's go with the basic
stuff just like most of the premium
speakers out there both the boom 3 and
mega boom 3 have a fabric body with
offsets and caps that make them very
durable and both of these speakers are
also rocking ip67 certifications which
means they're both dust and waterproof
and for those wondering yes these
speakers do float on top of both of
these speakers you have your power
button Bluetooth button and this new
quote-unquote magic button which is just
a multi-function button that has been
sorely lacking on the mega blast on the
mega blast even though there is a huge
button in the middle you can only use
this button to call Alexa and in order
to control your music playback on the
mega blast you either have to use Alexa
voice commands that only work on select
streaming services or you have to
control your music directly from your
phone and like I've said before I don't
care how smart your small speaker is
sometimes it's just easier to have
physical control buttons on your speaker
so you can do basic things so that's why
I'm so happy the mega boom 3 finally has
this multifunction button either you or
your friend can physically play or pause
your music and double tap to skip a
track directly from the speaker but you
can't go back a track and personally I
prefer having a physical button versus
the mega boom where you have to hit the
top
Skype attract another thing that I hated
about the megablast was the way you had
to charge it now all three of these
speakers charge via a micro USB port and
I do feel the boom three and mega boom
three should have had come included with
a USB C port instead but with the mega
blast
since the micro USB port is on the
bottom you have to stand a little side
damage charge it now obviously this
isn't gonna affect your music in any way
but I just find it to be some very
sloppy designing almost as bad as having
to charge Apple's Magic Mouse upside
down but since the ports on the boom 3
and mega boom 3 stick out the back
these speakers can stand upright when
you charge them you may have also
noticed that these speakers have their
power of charging the contact points
built into the bottom whereas with the
mega blast you would have to switch out
its quarter-inch tearing now the power
of charging dock is an additional $40
accessory and by no means do you have to
get it but it does play nice with both
the mega blast and make a boom 3 and if
you get it you never really have to
remember to charge your speaker if you
just place it on the dock when you're
done using it it's kind of like wireless
charging on a phone you don't need it
but it does make charging your device
more passive regardless the boom 3 has
an advertised battery life of 15 hours
and with its volume set to 80% the
speaker managed to average seven hours
playback time whereas the larger mega
boom 3 has an advertised battery life of
20 hours and with its volume set to 80%
the speaker managed to average 9 hours
of playback time and for comparison the
larger and heavier mega blast has an
advertised battery life of just 16 hours
we're going Bluetooth just as you'd
expect these speakers have stable
connections that don't cut out but more
importantly these speakers can be
connected to two devices at the same
time and if you're an iPhone user these
speakers have a very low latency so
these are actually pretty good for
watching YouTube videos on your phone
now before we go with the speaker setups
there is one major hardware difference I
want to point out between the mega boom
3 and the outgoing mega boom for the
audio files out there you ease newer
speakers like the mega boom 3 boom 3 and
mega blast don't have 3.5 man audio
jacks personally I don't really care cuz
I never used the audio jack on any of my
speakers these days but I can see why
some people would really hate this from
an audio quality standpoint Bluetooth
just doesn't sound as good as having a
wired connection or
sometimes you just want to have a wired
connection because it's easier than
having to go through the Bluetooth
settle process I don't mind if smaller
single channels do switch speakers like
the bow sound like micro don't have an
out of your jack but I think a larger
speakers like these should still have it
but when it comes to speaker setups the
boom three and mega boom three are
almost identical but the boom three and
mega boom three have two inch diameter
transducers shooting out the sides and
both of these speakers have dual passive
radiators but the pats radiators on the
mega boom three are slightly larger than
the ones on the boom three regarding the
mega blast it also has dual transducers
and dual passive radiators but it also
has a pair of tweeters that just aren't
present on the mega boom three now we're
about to jump into a sound test since
all three of these UE speakers sound
identical to make things more
interesting I'm also going to be
including the sony xba-40 one with extra
bass mode turned on and the JBL extreme
two and also all three of these UE
speakers are running the the standard EQ
setting
in general the new boom three and mega
boom three sound really good they both
have good clarity good in some and
separation and they don't suffer from
distortion at higher volume but the
biggest difference between the boom
three and mega boom three is going to be
the bass since the mega boom three has
larger passive radiators you're going to
feel the bass more so it's more fun to
listen to music with this speaker than
with this speaker but objectively the
mega blast still sounds a little better
than the mega boom three due to its
tweeters this speaker is able to
separate the mids and highs a little
better than this speaker but unless you
listen to these speakers back-to-back
and you're actively looking for these
nuance differences you're not really
going to notice but when it comes to
comparing the sound quality on the mega
boom 3 to the sony XP 41 and JBL extreme
- i can confidently say the mega boom 3
outperforms the sony xba-40 one compared
to these other speakers or Sony XP 41
sounds pretty muffled and even though
the mega boom 3 is smaller than the XP
41 it still has as much if not more bass
than the XP 41 but when it comes to
comparing the mega boom 3 to the JBL
extreme to the extreme 2 is still the
better sound speaker hardware wise the
extreme 2 is rocking a dual transducer
dual tweeter and dual passive radiators
set up so besides having more hardware
the JBL extreme 2 still has deeper
punchy bass it's instrument separation
is better and the soundstage is wider
but since I feel the mega boom 3 sound
quality is up there with the extreme -
it does make the mega boom 3 a
compelling option for some people
because you're getting near JBL extreme
- sound quality from a speaker that cost
less and takes a fraction of the desk or
shelf area and badge why I like it so
much but the mega boom 3 does take a hit
when it comes to its max volume compared
to these other speakers now the mega
boom 3 obviously gets a little louder
than the smaller boom 3 and both of
these speakers have no problem filling a
large room with music but a max volume
the mega boom 3 lives in the 105 decibel
range and struggles to break through its
110 ceiling whereas the mega blast XP 41
and extreme to have no problem breaking
one-ten sealing and getting all the way
up to 120 decibels so what I'm saying is
the mega boom 3 sounds good and gets
loud enough but it's not as loud as
these other speakers but for its size I
feel it does get loud enough unlike the
ljpk 700 reviewed a few months ago that
speaker was a joke but another important
thing to keep in mind about UE speakers
is that even though you eat markets them
as 360-degree speakers they're really
not they're just shooting their music
out of either sides if you're using
these speakers indoors where the music
can bounce off of walls they're gonna
perform like 360-degree speakers but if
you use them outdoors then they are
going to have some major dead zones on
the front in the rear of the speaker so
even though these wouldn't be my first
choice for an outdoor speaker indoors
they're great but now let's talk about
you ease app because it's very useful
and it has a lot to offer first off you
can remotely power on or power off your
mega boom 3 you can also go in and
select from a few EQ settings or make
your own personally I just like set a
standard one but you can easily make
either these speakers sound however you
want for the type of music you listen to
also if you're going to pair multiple
speakers together you just have to go
into the party up tab and drag the
speaker's up you don't have to go
through any pairing process if they're
nearby they'll show up just keep in mind
you can only pair of booms boom - boom
threes mega booms and mega boom 3s
together and nothing else
and finally there's block party where
you can have up to three devices
connected to the mega boom 3 and you can
select from one of the three devices to
play music and when you and your friends
are done hanging out you can turn off
block party and disconnect them from
your speaker or you can even kick them
off if you want but overall I am a fan
of the new UE boom 3 and mega boom 3 the
majority of the gripes that I've had
with the mega blasts have finally been
fixed with these speakers sure I do wish
the boom 3 and mega boom 3 had a USBC
charging and I would at least like the
option to be able to have a wired
connection with these speakers but
everything else is pretty good
they're very good sounding indoor
speakers that have a very small
footprint but having no problem filling
the room with music and I feel very
adequately priced their app is more
useful than most other apps and since
they have a good microphone for phone
calls and low latency for watching
videos too
really isn't much to complain about this
time around even though the megablast
sounds slightly better than the mega
boom 3 unless you're a hardcore Alexa
user and you just need voice commands
and have no interest in pairing multiple
Yui speakers together I think the
majority of people are going to be
better off just going with the mega boom
3 or boom 3 if you made it this far I
guess you enjoyed the video so hit that
