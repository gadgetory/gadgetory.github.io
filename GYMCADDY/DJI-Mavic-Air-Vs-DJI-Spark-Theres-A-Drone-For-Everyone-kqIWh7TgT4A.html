people just really want one but it is
hard to justify dropping several hundred
dollars on one unless you're a
professional last year every time I
would go to the store I would just stare
at the drones and try to convince myself
that today was the day I would get my
own drum
but if today's the day you've decided to
finally pull the trigger on getting your
old room then you might be wondering
should you just get the DJI spark or pay
double and get the brand-new DJI Mavic
air now remember this isn't a full
review on either of these drones so I'm
just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with your purchase decision
if you want to learn more about these
drones watch their full reviews the DJI
spark in the data I'm a Vaquero are the
two most affordable drones DJI currently
has on sale not including the Telo cuz
that's a toy the base Deeja automatic
error is currently retailing for seven
hundred ninety nine dollars and the base
DJI spark is currently retailing for
$399 $100 discount from its original
price of $499 if you want to pick either
of these drones up I'll have links in
the description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel
check them out because these are icons
sometimes go on sale so you might get
lucky first let's talk about what you
get with these drones when you get the
base package both drones come with one
battery charging cables two extra sets
of propellers and a carrying case
neither one come with an SD card so you
have to bring your own only pneumatic
error comes included with a controller
in the base package whereas with the
spark you have to pay extra for
controller you can either get the fly
more combo pack for $599 and get
everything you do with the base DJI
spark package plus an extra battery and
extra accessories and the controller or
you can get the controller on its own
for $119 and personally I don't think
it's worth getting two controller
through the spark because of the sparks
short flight time of 16 minutes a max
range of 2,000 meters with the
controller under ideal conditions and
overall the Sparks camera and fly
performance isn't worth paying upwards
of $500 I feel that if you get the spark
you're better off just flying in with
your phone it's worth just fine for me
even though the spark is smaller than
the air in its folded State the
Navigator is much easier to carry around
than the spark both drones are also come
with hard shell carrying case that
protect them from getting crushed in a
bag or if you accidentally drop them but
again Medicare's case is smaller and
more premium than the sports case now
let's talk about the hardware the spark
has a 3d sensing system on the front
that helps to detect obstacles that are
directly in front of it and sensors on
its belly that help it detect obstacles
beneath it
this camera is housed in a two axis
gimbal that can compensate for pitch and
roll and in order to get smooth video on
the spark when turning DJI uses digital
image stabilization the slightly bigger
Mavic air houses its camera in a 3 axis
gimbal that can compensate for pitch
roll and yaw and the video is a little
smoother
especially when turning the Mavic arrow
also has sensors on the front and on his
belly that help it detect obstacles in
front and underneath it but it also has
sensors on the rear so we can detect
obstacles behind it when flying
backwards something the spark can't do
although these systems are great and
they have prevented crashes on both the
air and the spark it is important to
keep in mind that you still run the risk
of crashing if you fly from side to side
on either of these drums something I
regularly do to get panic shots the
Mavic arrow also has a new feature
called advanced pilot assistance systems
or AAPIs for short and when this
features turned on the Medicare will
automatically avoid obstacles all you
have to do is tell it's a foot forward
and it also works from flying backwards
granted the medic year will drastically
slow down with it's automatically
avoiding these obstacles but it's still
impressive nonetheless but once it
detects there is nothing in front of it
again it'll speed back up this feature
makes flying in cramped environments
much less stressful now let's talk about
the flying dynamics on these drones
sessom advocare is bigger than the spark
and has larger propellers it's much more
stable to fly especially in windy
conditions now don't get me wrong the
spark does a really good job of
compensating for random gusts of winds
but if you're by a river or at the beach
or any other area with high winds it is
very hard to keep the spark stable and
get decent shots if you're shooting a
specific subject the larger size of the
Medicare and the included controller
means you
able to fly the air much faster and much
more aggressively than the spark when
flying the spark with your phone it has
a max ascent speed and Max descent speed
of 3 meters per second and when flying
in the air with the controller it has a
max ascend speed of 4 meters per second
and a maximum descent speed of 3 meters
per second and this matters because it's
how fast these drones can gain or lose
altitude when controlled with your phone
to spark has a max linear speed of 30
miles per hour or five point eight
meters per second whereas the air has a
max linear speed of 20 miles per hour
where nine meters per second when using
the controller but the controller also
allows you to unlock sport mode on the
air way you'll be able to reach a top
speed of 42 miles per hour but remember
the sensors are turned off while in
sport mode so you're on your own and if
you get the controller on the spark then
you'll be able to get a top speed of 31
miles per hour in sport mode and keep in
mind if you decide to find the magic air
with just your phone control input or
knock down a bit when flying the spark
with your phone you get a max range of
about a 100 meters but keep in mind this
is under ideal conditions with direct
line-of-sight and with minimal signal
interference of other Wi-Fi signals or
tall metal structures if you were to fly
the Maverick air with just your phone
you'll get a max range of about 80
meters under ideal conditions ironic I
know I expected the air to get slightly
longer range over the sport but if you
fly the Mavic you're with the controller
then you get a range of up to 4000
meters but again this is under ideal
conditions in highly populated areas I
haven't come close to this range
another thing that requires ideal
conditions for peak performance is
battery life the Mavic air has an
advertised flight time of 21 minutes and
the spark has an advertised flight time
of 16 minutes what factors like cold
weather wind speed and just how
aggressively you fly a drone will play
into your flight time and if you fly in
sport mode that new battery will drain
even faster in the spring and summer my
spark routinely achieved a flight time
of 16 minutes and even sometimes 18
minutes but in the NYC winter where
temperatures are below 30 I usually get
a flight time of about 13 minutes and
like I said in my initial review my Mady
Cara hasn't hit that 21 minute flight
time I've been averaging about 18
minutes but remember
is what the temperature anywhere between
20 and 40 degrees I hope to hit that 21
minute mark in the spring and summer and
charging these batteries is another
factor to consider in order to fully
charge the battery under spark it's
going to take about 80 minutes if you're
doing it through the micro USB cable and
it's going to take about 50 minutes to
fully charge the battery under Mavic era
with the included charger okay let's get
into the cameras both the Medicare and
spark have the same 12 megapixel sensors
but their lenses and apertures are a
little different the spark has a 2.6
aperture and a field of view of 80 1.9
degrees and the air has a 2.8 aperture
any field of view of 85 degrees this
means you'll be able to capture more of
a subject with the air than the spark
when you're looking at the same thing
away at the same distance from the same
subject what the spark you can only
shoot video in 1080p 30 frames per
second which is just fine for social
media even though the spark has the same
sensor as thematic error it can't shoot
4k cuz DJI uses digital image
stabilization to compensate for not
having a 3-axis gimbal on the spark
whereas on the Mavic arrow you can shoot
in 4k 30 frames per second 1080p 60
frames per second 1080p 30 frames per
second and even capture slow-motion
video in 1080p 120 frames per second and
these are just a few of the shooting
modes the magic air has to offer these
are the ones that just matter the most
to me now the reason you want to shoot
in 4k is because you will be able to
capture more detail and if you wanted to
you could zoom in on subjects in post
without losing too much detail and
personally I like shooting in 1080p 60
frames per second because it means much
smoother video and if I need it to I can
slow down the video a bit and still have
it be pretty smooth
both of these drones obviously also take
pictures and they both have some very
useful panorama modes but only the Mavic
era can take HDR photos and when you
take a panorama two drones will hover in
place rotate and take the necessary
pictures and the DJI app will stitch
them together on your phone both of
these drones do a great job of staying
stable under windy conditions and the
end results are stunning on both Jones
but the Medicare is able to take the
necessary pictures for these panoramas
in a fraction of the time it takes to
spark and speed matters here because you
want to be quick to capture a moment or
if your drone is hovering for too long
it's obviously going to drain your
precious battery life both of these
drones are also have some pretty cool
quick sup modes where they will
automatically track a subject and
they'll automatically fire themselves
and capture some epic video and they
both work very well no problems there
and both of these drones will also have
gesture controls really they will track
you and you can position them just by
waving your hands and these desert
controls works very well on the Medicare
there are a few hiccups here and there
but the overall experience is great but
the gesture controls on the spark are
very hit-or-miss
there are times where it will work okay
and there are just some other times
where it won't work at all and if you're
in an environment with the slightest
wind then you run the risk of crashing
the spark with palm launching it happens
to me all the time with all this being
said the DJI spark is still a great
little entry-level drone especially at
$399 it's very capable but like I said
in past videos it's an epic selfie
machine it's great to have when you're
with friends or if you want to record
yourself doing something or if you're a
parent it's a really easy way to capture
some stunning videos of your little one
and the spark does have some major
conveniences over the Mavic air first
off it's built like a tank my spark has
survived some major crashes that even
I'm surprised it survived drones are
only fun after you gotten over the fact
that you basically have 400 or $800 just
zipping around in the air that just
might not come back the spark also
charges with the phone charger and a
microUSB cable so if you take the spark
to a friend's house you can fly it and
just ask your friends for a phone
charger and come back an hour and a half
later and do it all over again with the
Medicare you have to carry around the
charging cable if you don't have extra
batteries but most importantly the DJI
spark looks like a toy which is clearly
not while I was out getting b-roll with
the Medicare and spark everyone would
freak out because of the Medicare oh is
that whose drone always it gonna crash
into me
oh you can't fly that drone here but
with the spark since it's so small
people don't really care they just go oh
cool toy if you want to capture video of
yourself or if you just want to get
comfortable with flying a drone
and the spark is great but if you're a
content creator or you just want a more
capable drone then the DJI Medicare is
more your speed flight autonomy 2.0 is a
huge game-changer which makes flying in
cramped environments much less stressful
all of this capability cramped into such
a small package is what makes the
Medicare so amazing if you're ok with
the 21 minute flight time and a max
video recording of 4k 30 frames per
second then I would get the air over the
current generation Matic pro the
Medicare is clearly giving the supreme
you of the second generation Matic pro
but I think will be launched in the next
eight to ten months I think will be
smaller than the current gen Matic pro
have all the sensors built in cinematic
air plus sensors off to the side and I
would really like the Matic pro 2 to
have a 30-minute flight time and be able
to shoot in 4k 30 frames per second and
1080p at 240 frames per second those are
the specs I would need the second
generation Matic pro is to have so I
would pay a premium over the mapa care
