current portable speaker line-up
everything from the small and affordable
but surprisingly useful jbo clip three
but were coins that is the flip for the
old man charge three the incredible
looking pulse three the versatile
extreme two and the big Daddy
JBL boombox let's find out which of
these speakers are ready for you just so
we're clear this isn't a full review on
either of these speakers I'm just trying
to point out the most important
differences between them so I can open
your purchase decision if you want a
little more about either of these
speakers then watch their full reviews
the JBL clip 3 is the smaller speaker
here and we tell us for 60 bucks the
flip for we tell us for $100 the charge
3 retails for $150 the polls 3 retails
for $200 the extreme 2 retails for $300
and the JBL boombox we tell us for $450
if you want to pick either these
speakers up I'll have links for
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel I
suggest you check them out cuz JBL
speakers routinely go on sale and also
check out the numerous shelf down below
first off JBL's whole speaker line-up is
all about durability and portability all
of these speakers have a fabric mesh
cover body that does a very good job at
standing up to bumps and scrapes they're
all ipx7 raiders so they aren't afraid
of a little water and except for the
clip 3 they all share a similar pill
like design with exposed passive
radiators on each side when it comes to
charging the speakers the clip 3 foot 4
charge 3 and post 3 all charged via on
mic USB port whereas the larger extreme
2 in boombox charged via an AC port on
the back and this small detail is going
to be very important when we talk about
sound quality in a minute regarding
battery lives
JBL advertises double-digit battery
lives on all of their speakers but only
expect to hit those numbers if you're
using these speakers at around 50%
volume but I found that using these
speakers at around 80% volume which I
feel is more realistic either one of
these speakers should have no problem
lasting at least one day of extended
listening if you were to take them to
the beach or something except for the
pulse 3 even though the post 3 does
advertise our 12 hour battery life since
it also has a light feature to power it
it's better
life is all over the place depending on
the brightness and which light motor
you're using your actual battery life
will vary you can get anything from four
hours of playback time all the way up to
maybe fifteen hours if you're using
light setting like jet at a lower
brightness even though I love the poster
II and it's perhaps the coolest looking
speaker out there right now I would
really only recommend it if you're
planning on strictly only using it at
home the pole story is one of those
speakers that constantly lives on the
charger and even though the acrylic top
is pretty durable you could possibly
scratch it or crack it if you constantly
take it on the go with you I've dropped
my pulse tree a few times in the studio
without any issues but it's always
landed on padded carpet okay now it's
all about speaker setups the clip three
has a single 40 millimeter transducer
and a single bass radiator the flat four
has dual 40 millimeter transducers and
dual passive radiators on each side and
the post three is kind of like a souped
up floor for it has three 40 millimeter
transducers are all underneath the
fabric portion of the speaker which also
makes the pulse three the only
360-degree speaker here and since the
pulse three has larger passive radiators
and a higher wattage down of the floor
it also manages to get louder and has
more base than the flip for the charge
three has the same layout as the
platform except it has dual 50
millimeter transducers and it's passive
radiators are slightly larger as well
but things start to change with the
extreme - it has dual 70 millimeter
transducers but it's not just a larger
charge 3 the extreme tool also has dual
20 millimeter tweeters and finally
there's the boombox which has the same
layout as the extreme 2 but larger it
has dual 101 millimeter transducers the
same 20 millimeter tweeters and dual
passive radiators on each side now
Before we jump into the sound test just
know the boom box is in indoors mode and
the extreme 2 has the latest firmware
update which then overall improve its
sound quality
the older speakers here like the flip
floor in charge three have cell
signatures that put an emphasis on the
mids and trouble and even though they do
have a good amount of bass and how our
volumes do might start to sound a little
bright but all the other speakers here
have a neutral sound signature with just
the right amount of bass in trouble so
they sound good for almost every genre
of music and personally I do prefer the
new neutral sound signature over the
older brighter sound signature obviously
the larger the speaker here the louder
and more bass is going to have but the
clip 3 has quickly become my most used
speaker here just cuz I love using it to
listen to podcasts the flip for it is a
good little speaker that's good for both
listening to podcasts or music but there
is a benefit for going with either the
larger pulse 3 or the charge 3 but
personally I prefer how the pull story
sounds over the torch 3 it sounds more
balanced and it has a little more bass
than the charge 3 now remember at the
beginning of this video when I said the
extreme 2 and boombox charged via an AC
port instead of a microUSB port like the
other smaller speakers well that matters
cuz these speakers sound different when
they're running off with their battery
versus when they're plugged in the
extreme 2 is rated at 20 watts when
running off of its battery and 40 watts
while plugged in or as the boombox is 40
Watts when running off of its battery
and 60 watch while it's plugged in and
when either of these speakers are
plugged in they're going to get louder
and they're also going to sound fuller
the extreme 2 does get more than loud
enough and is able to easily fill a room
with music but if you want that
thunderous bass that's going to shake
your insides then the boombox is the way
to go when it comes to bluetooth
connectivity all of these speakers have
solid and reliable connections with very
little late
which is good for video and all of these
speakers have JBL connect Plus which is
by far the easiest way to pair multiple
speakers together you literally just
press one button on each speaker and the
speakers will figure out the rest back
themselves you don't have to mess around
with any Bluetooth settings and you
don't have to miss wrong with any apps
it just works
but unfortunately the clip 3 does not
have JBL connect plus you can't pair it
up to any other speakers which is a huge
letdown when I first got it I assumed
that it had it so let's wrap things up I
personally really like the clip 3
because I love using it to listen to
podcasts since it's super small and has
a very strong Bluetooth connection and
could leave my phone charging in one
room and easily move about the house
while I'm doing chores without missing
any of my taking news and since it has a
good battery life I can use it for
multiple days if you're on a tighter
budget you can't go wrong with it for
it's an all-around good speaker for
personal listening but if you want
something larger than the platform and I
would get to charge 3 if you plan on
constantly taking it on the go with you
or if you need that consistently long
battery life but if you just want a
speaker strictly to use at home then I
would go for the pulse 3 instead of the
charge 3 but if you're going to spend
the big bucks then I would get the
extreme 2 if you plan on using it at
home equally as much as taking it on the
go with you it's much easier to travel
with the extreme 2 instead of the boom
box because of that caring strap but if
you want a big speaker that's mostly
going to live at home and only
occasionally plan on taking it somewhere
then I would get the JBL boombox each of
these speakers have their own pros and
cons and depending on your needs one is
definitely going to be better than the
other now the majority of these speakers
are pretty early on into their life
cycles but personally I think for charge
3 and maybe looking for or next in line
to be upgraded as CES 2019
aside from sound and battery
improvements I would like to see fast
charging and maybe even tweeters on the
charge for if you made it this far I
guess you enjoyed the video so hit that
