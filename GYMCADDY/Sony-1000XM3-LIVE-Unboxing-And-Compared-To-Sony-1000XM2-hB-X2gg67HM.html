so
you're watching yeah we got two people
here cool okay so everybody welcome to
our second livestream I know yesterday's
livestream was a little bit of a
disaster but I think maybe today will be
not as bad but still a disaster so the
reason we're doing this new live
unboxing series is because like I said
in life in the last livestream I'm not a
really big fan of unboxing videos I
don't really care for somebody unboxing
a product and then just reading off the
spec sheet for me but I think that if we
do it live and if you guys are involved
in the process I think this could be a
little bit more fun we can talk about
the product you can ask questions about
upcoming products or maybe how the
product that's being unboxed compares to
another product that might already be
out or be coming out show and what else
and you also get my raw reactions
because sometimes when I do unbox a
product when I'm first getting it in
hand you know there's there's some type
of reactions that I just can't recreate
in videos so I think if you get them
here they'll be pretty cool and then
also you guys are gonna get on for a
suppression so without further ado let's
get started so these are the Sony 1000x
m3s I'm gonna be honest I did not expect
these these headphones to come out so
soon I really thought that the m2s were
going to be Sony's agency headphones for
another year at least just cuz these
headphones do are just so so good they
have the best active noise cancellation
the best technology but their build
quality isn't their best and they're a
clamping force is fine but their ear
cups can be a little cramped compared to
the bows or Sennheiser's but they're
definitely more comfortable than the
Beats Studio freeze over the year these
headphones have
my main headphones I use these
headphones whenever I travel I use these
headphones whenever I'm gonna edit a
video and I use these headphones what
I'm gonna listen to music but not watch
videos because these headphones do have
a bit of latency to them so I don't
really like wearing stuff in the 96 so
these are not my headphones of choice
for watching videos but for everything
else for work and travel these are my go
to the biggest thing these headphones
have gotten over the last year is Google
assistant integration I know you guys
might have noticed that this thing is an
on yet cuz I just wanted to give you
guys a quick little live demo of Google
assistant which it has gotten better
since they first came out in July or
late June something something something
along those lines
turn on the studio light
okay
SEPA studio later red
all right thank you so
even though the m2s are the only
headphones that have a little system
right now aside the m3s well things are
supposed to Adam we're gonna find out
anyway all of other the stonee
headphones are going to be getting
Google assistant as well so like let's
say though what 700 entities are
supposed to go and Google assistance
sometime in the future
the here on Tues are also going to be
giving Google assistant a few other
wireless earbuds also going to go Google
system except for the NPR XP 950 and
ones those headphones they're not going
to be upgraded to Google assisting and I
really thought that we were gonna see an
updated version of those headphones and
if but as it stands right now we so the
box
I've actually got these headphones about
an hour to ago I haven't even unwrapped
it one thing I did notice about these
headphones I got the the gold version
just like the and choose but one thing I
did notice about the packaging here is
that these aren't gold so he calls them
platinum silver which is kind of because
to me this looks almost the same as the
N choose and here Sony calls them
champagne gold so let's see what uh how
this color differs from that color and
they're asking me to connect date with
two different devices at the time that
is one of the things that I absolutely
hate about the m2z I've been very vocal
about that I'm really hope we can get
the m3s to hook up to our two devices at
the same time I'm when I was looking
over the spec sheet I I haven't I didn't
see any mention of that actually let's
looking on the products because
a lot of other headphones like the Bose
like to pimp out that they say oh we can
connect the two devices at a time
voices system function compatible app
Siri I don't know bro that to the m2 is
that for that one communication the
audio held back it doesn't say anything
about pairing up to two devices and if
that's the case sony what are you doing
i mean come on is maybe maybe sony
hasn't been able to connect two devices
at the same time maybe cuz of the
processing that they do to like get your
audio to be a little bit more clearer or
something along those lines i don't know
it's a it's a really even though it
seems like it's not a big deal if you're
a power user like me i love using my
phone and then just switching off to my
computer but with the PM juice I can't
do that but you're definitely gonna find
all that out during the full review
again this is a review on the m3s I'm
just unboxing these things and I'm also
rambling a bit
am I not okay so let's get these things
out of the box
cameraman give me give me enough clothes
shot yeah
now remember if you want to pick any of
these products up I'm gonna have links
in the description below for the m3 is
the M choose to watch other 700 ends and
if you use those links it helps me out
so I can continue bringing you these
reviews without having to rely on
companies to send them out so I can tell
you they're good the bad and the nasty
you know I try to make more reviews
perfectly balanced as all of things
should be I quote that right I hope I
did I'm gonna bout to get roasted
alright so let's get this thing out of
the box okay I already see tough shot
here don't be afraid to be a little
handsy easy subtle can download the app
we have the app already already updated
the app there's nothing here oh here's
the case alright so one thing I pull
back so one thing that I've been grabbed
the camera alright sorry you can be
carrying it okay so one thing that I've
been doing to make this reaction a
little bit more authentic
I've actually haven't launched any other
videos aside from sony's promo just cuz
i don't wanna i didn't want to see i
didn't know i didn't want to know what
to expect if that makes sense i wanted
to be as authentic as possible
one thing is this case is way nicer i
actually I am I am actually really
diggin this case and let's see we've
still got the loop but the loop doesn't
snap off okay all right Cameron do we
have any questions so far no not really
dying can see alright um alright so this
little thing here is different also Sony
that's nice
Wow they actually really updated the
case it's an all-around really solid
update on the case
alright Konan getting a good shot on the
headphones here we go
first-time reveal possibly not the most
famous and threes but these are
to be seen by a good amount of people in
there they are oh oh I don't know why
they call this silver still that's great
I still like shim pack all about oh wow
this is really this is completely
different
okay just get this thing out of here oh
all right just to just um that's let's
look at the cables really quick well
let's make this the grand reveal at the
at the end okay so here is the USB see
charging cable all right all right it's
actually it's a nicer than the micro USB
cable you get with the Sony's I wonder
if check in here if we have yeah no no
these are these are not so those are
okay so so this is the USB see cable
this is the micro USB cable yeah this is
this looks a lot nicer and I'm not just
saying that it does look it's a lot
shorter which does suck but it is nice
alright let's put that back okay so you
and here's the USB C charging cable here
is the audio cable how many we got yeah
64 that's that's more than yesterday
because I'm not messing up as bad yeah
okay um oh this cable is not as thick as
the N choose will know me get them
choose out okay so
the first so here are the big
differences between the m3 and the m2
it's a lot smaller it's a lot thinner
you know this is the part that goes into
the headphones okay and the cable itself
is also much thinner I want to say this
cable is as thin as the cable you get
with the election on 700nm Amanda Nia
Shonda watching us on the genetics yes
so the cable here is similar to what
comes in there that cable is actually
end watchos um box so we can't get that
out really quick but we still have this
magnet agree thing here so this audio
jack I'm still stumbling over my words a
little bit but um but um you may be you
know the cable isn't as premium as the
cable on the entries I'm sorry the cable
from the entries isn't as premium as the
cable on DM twos probably because Sony
knows everybody is straying away from
using a wired connection and sticking
more to bluetooth as a content creator I
still definitely do use um V and the
audio cable whatever I'm gonna add a
video camera man can zoom out a little
bit
how long is this stream going for 12
minutes 12 minutes okay so this is the
m3s cable all right next up you get an
airplane adapter you know nothing
nothing crazy there but this carrying
case is also actually that way okay can
you play audio with the USBC connection
I don't know
again full review I'll tell you the full
review so again you see there's a lot
more stuff going on here with the with
the carrying case there's no pockets of
holes I like that I like that alright
I'm the truth I'm gonna take the end
fries out oh man all other light
oh no 20 I know they're like 20 grams
lighter I didn't expect I didn't expect
to actually really notice it a little
bit oh yeah
wow those 20 grands does make does make
a difference I thought I really I know I
didn't mention it in the leaked video
just cause I thought wow it's 20 grams
but having them hearing in there is a
bit of a difference there let's see
oh okay so what are the biggest things
that that that the m2s lack were the ear
cups these ear cups they're very you
know they're little cramped
I have average-sized ears so it wasn't
awful but not yours they feel a little
bit cramped
compared to other headphones out there
except for the beats the bass to do
three is those or super crammed the
beach or almost like on ear headphones
so that's one of the biggest changes I'm
looking forward to for the N threes and
just looking at them let me get you a
better shot you got that yeah just
looking at that there is a huge huge
difference and I've also noticed this
here this little fabric feels a little
bit it it's not as grainy okay we just
put these m twos here those headphones
have served me very well these are I'm
still getting used to how light these
headphones are let's see okay he's still
a step all in this don't have the
stainless steel band here so the
headband here this is completely new I
don't know how I feel about this being
covered in leather that guy looks I do
prefer the stainless steel here it makes
the headphones look a little bit more
they stand out a little bit more the
shape is the same there's plastic here
it's if they're it does feel a little
different from the plastic on the m2 all
right so alright cameraman get me in a
shot of my face and head cuz we're about
to put these headphones on for the first
time so ready okay so these are much
more comfortable oh oh this is not this
is night and day oh okay you know I'm
not I'm not trying to be like fake I'm
gonna trying to you know trying to amp
it up for the views and the people but
oh man these are much more Paul and
these are much more comfortable these
are clamping forces is perfect okay I
have a big head I can tell you right now
these are big head approved
I did make hoodies and I'm gonna be
getting those hoodies in very soon if
you want to support the channel pick up
a hoodie and I have a black on black
version it's big head approved use those
whenever you're rockin your headphones
but these these are big and approved
these headphones
alright so hold on I've said that the
watch 700 ends are more comfortable than
the em twos okay the ear cups on the
what shows are are a little bit more
spacious
yeah the ear cups on your the ear cups
on these are more spacious than the ear
cups on the entries but but the m3s are
still are still are still very
comfortable all right now let's see okay
yeah oh I like these
yeah yeah these are comfortable okay so
let's power oh wait I don't even look at
the buttons okay so let's look at the
ports let's look at the ports in oh
that's that's a problem hmm okay so we
have the power button so let's power
that on hope you have juice bluetooth
pairing hold on so let's get those
paired up really quick these headphones
should have juicy Sony headphones
usually come with juice in them WH 1000x
in threes and bluetooth connected
alright alright so this here oh this
isn't straight no plastic anymore either
there's a little bit of TPU here this is
soft touch oh this feels nice this shows
next and this this isn't this isn't
textured anymore this is um this is
completely smooth as well this this
really very nice little touch um so the
buttons have been changed you these are
way nicer actually and they have a
really good click to them hold on let me
get the unchoose for comparison so these
are the N choose button they're not
during that awful but they're also not
great okay cuz like what you have to use
to like find them is these little tabs
here you know it's not awful but they're
not great the buttons on the m3s
I I didn't need them but I'm glad
they're there these vines are way nicer
there's the audio jack here USB C port
right here thank you
umm but my biggest fear and I know it's
a really first world problem if this is
my biggest fear for a pair of headphones
there is no dedicated button for Google
assistant that that sucks
that sucks Oh oh wait it just there's
something oh no no that's it go easily
this is their like baby method was
Google but not a Syrian alright so what
I'm gonna do now oh and Miyamoto's I'm I
can hear myself
it just said envious sound control off
so I don't know if ANC has turned on
hold on
okay I just turned on noise-canceling
before nothing was on and I could hear
the AC and this AC is set to set to low
now AMC has turned on I can't hear that
that AC AC actually I think right now
it's a good test for the AMC so on the
Box in the press releases sony says that
the ante on these headphones is supposed
to be four times better and then at the
end choose because of this new process
or the rocket obviously whenever a
company is gonna put out a piece of a
new piece of hardware they're going to
say hey this is four or five ten times
better than the one that came out last
year so you know I'm just a in the full
review I'm gonna be really testing that
agency but in first impressions is Wow
what separates good headphones from
great headphones from amazing headphones
is good good AMC headphones are able to
block out low constant low-frequency
sounds so whenever you're on a bus
whenever there's an AC unit these are
low frequency sounds and are constant so
though so a and C headphones better be
able to block that type of sound out or
else they're junk great ANC headphones
are able to block out low-frequency
sounds like like a road noise and the AC
but they're also able to block out a
good amount of chatter whenever people
are talking that that type of that type
of noise is a little harder for ANC
headphones to block out just cuz you
know the sound frequencies are higher
and they're much more random but amazing
agency headphones are able to do all of
that with very little to no cabin
pressure
I don't know if you've noticed by now
I'm a dainty little flower and I can't
use the boast qc3 fives because their
ANC does put a considerable amount of
pressure on my eardrums so dude so does
JBL ANC so I remember whenever viewed
the e65 BTN sees and the Everest elites
700 ANC something along those lines
Nancy was good but there's just a lot a
lot of cabin pressure
these are blocking out a lot of sound
and these have no more cabin pressure
dandy and choose which is amazing so now
we're going to do a quick simulation for
chatters so this is a coffee shops in
your your phone users take them out
because it's about to get a little loud
okay ready it's about to get loud three
two one don't say I didn't warn you
over
I don't think it's four times better
okay so he's nut first impressions is
sorry
Thank You boom box
okay so first impressions ANC is better
on the entries but it's not four times
better so I think Tony's probably mad at
me right now um okay but it's still very
good still very good I think I really do
like yo these these swivel about these
swivel a lot more well not a lot more
but my smooth oh yeah
these miserable the untraceable much
more than away and these going needs
doing
ha the entries actor they struggle a lot
easier
nem Chua which are sounded right okay
now what does let's let's turn this
trainees guys off second
and you're this down so we're gonna
connect to the headphones out connect
with my headphones yeah that's on let's
see if we have any new settings on
he's only had one that if it works I
don't know Sony's apps they're not
they're not amazing
there have Sony's headphones that is is
solid when it works
they're their speakers after musics
unwrapped yeah that that one is just
mess latest version of meth was
connected necessary to use the cell
phone say I'm not from the outdoor okay
so Wow this is down the stem oh okay
okay
yeah
yeah it's telling me to like update the
headphones out but then we go to the App
Store and the headphones that there's
updated I don't know what they're asking
for
okay so we'll leave that for the full
review will be a little bit mystery for
the full review all right so let's open
it up for questions let's open it up for
questions anybody have any questions how
long
26 Wow I know when I was making videos
when I was like 5 I know those videos
that I think I think my videos only
they're not amazing but definitely not
as bad as they used so we have any
questions we have any questions
concerning the end please if not 4k
better how much better than the ANC not
4k Forex like 4 times better off isn't
that four times better it is it is
better but you know I mean it's not you
know it is slightly better but I don't
see it being but it's still but it's
still very good I mean it's the ANC on
these headphones from what I can tell
right now is better slightly better than
the ANC on the M twos
I'm still trying to get this going but
four times better I don't think so I
mean what I do the ASC test and I get
like the audio when I see whatever
they're actually blacking out look into
that but from from I'm seeing oh wait
actually this isn't fair this isn't fair
because these haven't been calibrated so
so so disregarded what I said about it
and not being four times better it could
get better after we calibrate this
headphone these headphones if if Sony 11
I'm probably gonna have to I'm probably
gonna have to delete that app and
download it again so you know what
disregard what I said the ANC on these
headphones could be better because I
haven't calibrated them yet
because I know whenever I travel with
these headphones
sometimes I go home I say in C so man I
do go through the calibration process
and it does work and these headphones I
calibrate them I can't buy them pretty
frequently so disregarding what he said
this isn't fair because I completely
forgot about the calibration process so
right under the box but they're better
than the EM choose let's see how the ANC
on except phones is out of calibration
process question how much better those
compared to those build quality I think
the biggest the biggest most useful the
biggest most useful of upgrade on the
m3s
from the gun choose is the fit these
headphones feel way more comfortable
clamping force on the entries have never
has never been a problem but they're
cramp ear cups is so so if you're trying
to decide between the entries and the
entries get the entries if you want
that that that that that really
comfortable fingers my ears are a lot
more comfortable than they are on the
end choose question
oh oh oh yeah let's see um so hold on
let's see actually I need like a little
mirror or something yeah yeah um sorry
was saying that that um that these
gherkins are supposed to be more
low-profile because that was also oh
yeah just from like touch it feel yeah
and you know what I don't want to be
like biased or you know just look at the
entries to you know Rose glasses but the
you can tell how light these are and you
can right off the bat you can tell the
difference and they do seem a little bit
more low-profile actually this feels a
little different because like whenever
we use a test for chose actually it's
playing music but ah man that's that's
the thing that sucks it looks like these
headphones don't have a dedicated mobile
assistant button which if you're gonna
if you're gonna be using Google
assistant if Sony if you're gonna be
marketing Google assistant on headphones
that headphones need to have a dedicated
system button or like I said on the lake
the video I would really like these
headphones to like having upgraded
touchpad where if you you know if you
double tap you play your positive music
if you swipe you can skip through the
music this is one down but if and this
is this is the
like like well you don't talk about but
I would really like if we could put two
fingers on the touchpad and they just
talk to Google assistant like that
apparently this this isn't working that
is gonna be a strike on the m3s okay all
right any other questions which is
better dotard the 900 end there's a sony
900 through the question oh oh that here
on sirs oh wait these die
I'll probably do a I so these are the
videos I'm planning out for the m3 this
is probably a sneak peak
obviously there was gonna be an m3
review video but I'm also thinking about
doing a hybrid of of an end of an m2 1
year later review video how it's held up
because I know a lot of people say that
the insides are still cracking I don't
know what you guys are doing you guys
like throwing them out the window and
expect it to survive because my phones
have been perfectly fine but granted I
do baby them because if they're not on
my head or in the case but also like
compare the m2 to the m3 is because you
know I know very well that dropping 350
dollars on a pair of anc headphones is a
lot for some people so now that the
entries are out the M shoes are probably
gonna go on sale so for the people
trying to decide to get the end choose
or the entries
I'm gonna be making that video where
it's the unchoose one year later review
see how the build quality has held up
Google assisted integration and how they
compare to the entries so you guys can
decide to get the M choose which are
still a pair of very good headphones or
pony up the extra cash and get the M
threes which unless Bose and son Heiser
you know put something out I think these
are already gunning for best ANC
headphones of 2019 cuz I know there have
been rumors about Apple putting out a
premium a pair of premium ANC headphones
but I'm starting to doubt it personally
because we haven't seen anything about
them we haven't seen like leaves any
parts nothing so you still haven't
answered their question which one is
better at the Sony or goes okay here on
choose or the Sony's um the hero twos
are more like stylish and these are more
for like travel the hero twos they stick
if you think the
choose stick out a lot okay if you think
these stick out a lot the Huron choose
stick out even more the here on Tues
stick out almost as much as the XP 950
and ones so design wise I would
personally prefer going with the m3s
cause they're more low-profile we still
got a test the sound quality because
apparently these are supposed to sound
better
so we'll see about that because
personally I think the here on Tuesday
at the end two's sound exactly the same
there is a sound difference between the
and choose and the watch 700 n so we'll
see if the here on to sound any better
than almost will see at the m3 sound
better than the here on choose so if
there's a lot of what if there's a lot
of questions about that then you know
what that video will also be me what's
more comfortable the X twos I'm a 90 X
to the M tooth and or the M 3 B's I
don't know if you were here earlier you
would have seen how like these are like
super comfortable are they here's the
real question
are they as comfortable as the bose qc25
because the bose qc25 s are the most
comfortable headphones on the market
well they have been
I think these I got it I got to get a
pair of QC 35s again but I think these
are neck and neck now I think these are
I think yeah I think she's only like
this now before it was Bose
it was Bose Saudi beats now Bose in
sodium next question
next question walking laptop cuz you
answered the one we're gonna give you a
bucket Bose yeah yeah that video is
coming I don't know if is gonna be a
dedicated but I don't I'm still waiting
on bones to put something out because
because I just find it so incredibly
weird that Bose put their headphones on
sale for to for for $300 $50 off and
they still haven't mentioned anything
obviously you know they could come down
in a few weeks I still I still still
think we're gonna see new Bose
headphones but if they don't if buzzes
and put new headphones out then Sony
it's the the reason look the reasons I
liked Sony's headphones over Bose
headphones was cause of the technology
behind them with the Sony's you have the
best anc with very little to no cabin
pressure which was the biggest thing I
took into consideration when comparing
those two ANC headphones sony also had
all quick attacks and that's what it was
for sony also has quick attention that
feature is super useful that's a feature
that bose doesn't have in the sony's
also have me ambient control slider so
you can control how much sound comes in
from the outside world on the boat all
you can do is just have your anc
high-low or off so so the with bose if
you and that i'm not hating on Bose Bose
headphones had the best build quality
and the best comfort build quality
I don't like I'm probably gonna have to
do some research on the build quality on
the m3s these are lighter the leather
over them like I didn't even talk about
the leather
well it's fake leather just so we're
clear and it is a lot nicer than the
leather here doesn't feel it doesn't
feel like plastic it's plastic is there
worth the upgrade is it worth the
upgrade
if you have the unchoose you don't
really have to rush out and get the
entries unless you want that fit because
the fit the fit is it is a big thing but
if you have um shoes and you're happy
with the em to use and you don't feel
like it in the entries right now I don't
think you have to run out and get them
but if you but I think I don't think you
have to run out and get the M shoes but
if I mean if you have the em shoes I
don't think you have to run out and get
the m3s
but if you do get the entries I think
you're gonna be happy
because I'm pretty I'm pretty its that
fit ok can i connect to multiple devices
I don't know we got to figure that out
we're actually getting cut a little bit
for time so I'll let you guys know the
full review actually no we can figure
this out right now
these are DJI
Bluetooth can it connect to multiple
devices let's see here
okay so let's connect it to the iPad is
it connected to the end choose we still
have we have 85 people here I'm very
impressed
guys it looks like you can't
it looks like you hold on
Oh
hold on it's us connected yes I was
connected there let's play
okay
because it alright so it sells connected
on the iPad and you can see the iPad on
if we you can see on the iPad that the
entries are on the Bluetooth list it
also said that is connected on the
iPhone and I see here on the Bluetooth
it says that is connected but if we look
here until like the sources your camera
man give me a give me a view of that oh
man dad that sucks
so so you see 1000 X + 3 is there no M 3
is there but it says right here M 3 it
says that it's connected
I know there is a way to connect the M
choose to two devices but you you can
only use one device for music use
another device for phone calls it's it's
weird and it's harder than it should be
but it looks like the n3 s can't connect
the two devices at the same time that
that is a letdown that is a letdown that
I don't know I'll look through the
manual I'll play around with them but it
looks but it looks alright next question
what's your favorite sounding I'm
headphones currently I like the Bowser
Wilkens px but they are very
uncomfortable for me because I got a big
head but I like the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px
those over my number one
was built probably look like it's gonna
crack I hope not if so the question was
does build quality look like it's going
to crack I don't know like I said I'm
probably I'm gonna do some research into
these headphones plastics whatever what
whatever they don't like you know see if
the materials are different from the EM
twos I hope they are like I said the the
user experience as I'm actually touching
them and using them this is much
smoother it's no longer you know that
texture this texture plastic here well I
mean this texture faux leather this is
soft touch now um this is this this
little portion here this is all soft
touch now whereas this is just
straight-up plastic
you know these planet you know these two
planets exactly the same
oh these happens all this heaven is much
thinner look at must learn okay but
again we got this leather covering here
I think I would prefer if we have the
leather going around here I mean not the
leather is stainless steel but um but
all build quality has been overall
improved I kind of feel I was thinking
about this yesterday I kind of feel the
Saudi 1000x
none of the Sony and er 1000x
the first ones were the iPhone 6 then
the Sony 1000 xm2 were the iPhone 6s
they look identical on the outside build
quality everything still looks the same
but I think they'll probably then get
slightly improved on the em twos but the
biggest changes were on the inside.you
agency better sound better battery life
better everything but everything was on
the inside I kind of feel of these sony
1000 x m3 or the iPhone 7 so you get
better insights but the outside it's
still very similar to what was going on
before but there have been revisions so
that makes sense right kind of make
sense
Cattleman's doesn't make sense doesn't
make sense well nobody tell me if it
makes sense before you leave I just want
to say
Thank You Terrance thank you um you know
this is a new series will actually let
me turn decide this is a new series
still hiring ironing kinks out we're
probably going to do this again once if
if I get the new iPhone 10s and so
William BOTS dogs because I actually
have it I haven't gotten a new phone
since I got this iPhone 6s and then
we'll probably do it again when I get in
the school can the Skullcandy venue cuz
those are I think I remember throw the
$200 ANC headphones so 200 all the ANC
headphones I remember when I unbox the
Sennheiser Sennheiser 4.5 OBT mcs I'm
boys like taken back I was in I was I
was incredibly impressed by their build
quality cuz I was like oh my god these
are 200 all the headphones know there
why don't you eat it all the headphones
but their build quality is is is way
better than the NB 100 ends and I was
really impressed by the build quality
guys were so that's what we're doing
this series just like you saw me freak
out when I put on the the Sony's and
these entries you know you guys can get
my real reactions you can ask me
questions we can talk about the
headphones we can talk about other stuff
coming up but um I think we're gonna go
ahead and cut it in this case before you
leave when can they expect a feel for
review full review is probably gonna pee
out in about two weeks I do want to get
to get the get to know these headphones
I don't want to just show them out and
tell you that they're amazing but the
most amazing thing you've ever seen in
your life that you should go out and buy
them right now I'm gonna get to know
them I want to get to get the good the
bad and let you guys know so and also I
want to make it look nice I don't want
to rush the video I want to make sure
the shots are good so I got if I'm going
outside shots I gotta have nice weather
so I'm not gonna be rushing that video
but about two weeks and then from there
we'll probably have the unto one year of
video after that and if we give boughs
and Sun Kaiser another two or three
weeks to give them time to release their
new headphones that'll be great
if not then we're probably gonna owe and
then also we gotta see if so if Apple
does announce new headphones so if they
do announce new and see headphones then
I'll review those and then we'll get the
big versus video where it's going to be
Sony's agency headphones vs. Bose versus
Sennheiser's I really really hope they
upgrade those pxc those PXE 550's and
who was the last one Bose only beats
Apple all right you guys it's gonna be
gonna be it's gonna be great all right
so we're gonna go ahead and cut it there
guys remember if you guys want to pick
the m2 is the m3 is to watch out some
tenderloins I know you there are some
guys out there are in a tight budget
that's perfectly fine
these guys are solid they go on sale a
lot so if you want to pick you have
