gnomic Roma and razor no more Pro nomic
Roma has been on sale for a few months
now but we're still waiting on the
number pro but a few months after see as
Logitech announced and launched their
first gaming oriented speakers the g5
sexy with RGB goodness for 50 bucks more
than the normal promo the g5 60 offers
everything normal pro does now this is a
full review on either of these speakers
I'm just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with your persons decision
if you want to learn more about each of
these speakers then watch their full
reviews the Noma chroma which has the
RGB base currently retails for $150 the
Logitech G 560 currently retails for
$200 and they yet to be released normal
Pro is slated to retail for $500 if
you're gonna pick either of these
speakers up I'll have a look at the
description below and if you use the
link it really helps out to channel both
the razor normal chroma and g56 II have
some form of RGB lighting that will
flash in correlation with what you're
playing but their setups and
capabilities are very different the
lighting on the Noma chroma is very
localized to you just it's space whereas
the g5 6c has two sets of LEDs that can
flash independently from one another
they're your front LEDs facing you and
then there are LEDs on the back that act
more like a floodlight and these rear
facing LEDs Armenta immerse you deeper
into your game but in order to get the
most out of the g5 60 you need to have a
gaming setup that's up against a not too
cluttered wall and you might have to
play around the placement of the
speaker's themselves for optimal results
but if you have the proper gaming setup
for the g5 60 the end results can be
truly amazing because in order to get a
similar lighting effect with the normal
chroma or Nomo Pro you would have to
invest in some Philips hue light strips
and bulbs and get them all set up in
synapse 3 sure the razor in Philips you
combo might be more impressive incapable
but it's also much more expensive in the
g5 60 is a much easier solution sure the
illuminated base on the Nomo crewman
looks great and all but I can't deny the
g5 60s look more epic the setup on these
speakers is also very different the g5
60 is a 2.1 speaker setup a consisting
of two satellite speakers with
2.5 inch diameter drivers and a
subwoofer with a 6.5 inch diameter
downward firing driver but no mock Roma
is just a 2.0 speaker setup with 3 inch
diameter drivers and we are firing base
ports if you want a subwoofer then
you're gonna have to sell out $500 for
the Nomo pro but both of these speaker
setups have their own pros and cons with
the g5 60 you're going to get
chest-thumping wall shaking bass either
when you're playing music or when
gunshots and explosions go off in your
game but you also have to have enough
space to accommodate the subwoofer and I
don't think you're going to be able to
get too much use out of it either way if
you live in a dorm or an apartment cuz
you might end up getting a call from
your landlord there no macomb on the
other hand is much more compact but
don't expect to get anywhere near the
same type of bass performance as the g5
16
well caught me off guard the first time
I heard the Noma chroma was just how
good it actually sounded the mids and
highs are surprisingly detailed there's
enough basic keep you satisfied but
nowhere near as much as the g5 60 for
obvious reasons the g5 60 also sounds
good but only after going into the Q
settings and lowering the bass and
bringing the mids out a bit but still I
couldn't help but notice the sound stage
and the highs were a little bit better
on the chroma than they were on 2g 560
and when it comes to loudness the g5 60
gets so loud that at max volume I don't
even think it's safe for your eardrums
so I never really need to go past 75%
volume on the g5 60 then Omicron though
the hand doesn't get nearly as loud as
the g5 60 but at its max volume it's
enough and both of these speakers do a
pretty good job of preventing sound
distortion as they get louder but the
Logitech G 560 has one major feature
d√©nouement chroma doesn't have and
that's Bluetooth you can connect them
stream your music from your phone on 2g
v 6e or as with Razer speakers you're
gonna have to get the memo Pro if you
want to bluetooth but the final thing
the g5 60 has over the razor noma chroma
is just their overall build quality the
normal chroma has are polarizing design
that's some well liked and others will
hate but their build quality is not that
great I managed to snap the neck off of
its base from a seemingly harmless drop
so you have to be gentle with them the
g5 60 on the other hand are built like a
tank both the satellite speakers and the
subwoofer and personally I really hope
the Razer normal Pro has improved build
quality especially in that neck if
you're trying to choose between either
of these speakers and you have the
proper gaming setup and space I say the
better buy here is the Logitech G 560
for the extra 50 bucks you're getting a
2.1 speaker setup with a rather
impressive light feature that does more
to immerse you into your game right out
of the box then the razor no macro
mccann Logitech came out swinging with
their g5 60 and I feel Razer is really
gonna have a lot to prove to justify
that $500 price tag under Nomo Pro the
only benefit I see right now are the
dedicated tweeters well believe it or
not I still prefer to
have my a Noma chroma on my desk just
because they are much more compact the
way my setup is right now I just don't
have the extra room for the subwoofer
and if you're somebody with a cramped
desk or if you're constantly moving your
gaming setup then the simplicity of the
Numa chroma might be more your style if
you made it this far I guess you enjoyed
the video so hit that like button and
get subscribed it helps out more than
you realize
