too much on a pair of headphones, but I also
know that there are some people out there
who just want to get a pair of really cheap
headphones they can throw around or use them
at the gym without having to worry or care
about them.
So thats why I wanted to checkout the Skullcandy
Riff.
Personally, skull candy has been very hit
or miss for me lately, So lets see how the
skullcandy Riff stack up.
The Skullcandy Riff retail for $50, but there’s
also a wired version that can be had for as
little as 20 Bucks.
Now given that these headphones are only $50
I’m not going to be going super hard on
these headphones because they pretty much
hit the basics pretty well.
So if you want to pick these headphones up
I’ll have them linked down below.
The Skullcandy Riff are pretty much all plastic,
but Skullcandy did take some extra steps to
make them feel a little more premium.
The ear cups them selves have a somewhat soft
touch feel to them similar to what you would
find on the $300 Crusher 360’s and the leatherette
used on the ear pads themselves doesn’t
feel half bad.
When you adjust the headband there’s a very
sturdy click to it and there’s minimal cracking
or squeaking when you flex them.
But I would take it easy and not flex them
too much cause you could snap them.
Now when it comes to fit, these headphones
are on ear headphones… but thanks to their
super soft ear cushions and the surprisingly
nice feeling leatherette that I mentioned
earlier, these headphones are fairly comfortable.
But it is important to note that these headphones
have a snug fit and order for me to actually
wear them I have to extend their headband
all the way out.
I feel that if a larger adult were to try
these on they wouldn’t fit them.
So for those reasons I have to say these headphones
are not big head approved.
But since these headphones have a snug fit
I think they would be good for working out.
Personally I feel that loose fitting headphones
like the Bose QC35’s aren’t ideal for
working out cause they’ll move around very
easily.
Thats why whenever I’m looking for work
out headphones I look for something with a
snug fit cause they’ll stay in place better.
But something to keep in mind about these
headphones is that they don’t have an audio
jack.
So you can only use them wirelessly.
Now these headphones are using bluetooth 4.1
and I found they’re perfectly fine for watching
movies or videos on your phone cause they
don’t have any latency.
The only time I noticed any latency was when
I was watching youtube videos with any of
my apple devices.
But if you have an android device you’ll
be fine.
So even though not having an audio jack on
these headphones shouldn’t be a big deal,
it should be something to keep in mind.
Now when it comes to battery life on these
headphones its not amazing, but it is fairly
decent considering their price and size.
They have an advertised battery life of 12
hours and if you charge them up for ten minutes
from a dead battery they’ll get you 2 hours
of playback time.
The fast charging on these headphones is actually
battery than the fast charging on the new
Sony XB700’s.
But again keep in mind… the Riff charge
via a micro USB port instead of a USB C Port.
Now when it comes to sound quality, the soundstage
and instrument separation on these headphones
isn’t all that great.
Everything does sound very close together
and its very easy for subtle details to get
lost in the mix.
But again these are $50 headphones.
They do how ever put an emphasis on the mids
so vocalists are very front and center and
they also have very punch bass.
For the most part the bass does a very good
job of staying put together and not muddling
out the mids, but there have been rare instances
where the bass did bottom out during bass
heavy songs.
But over all for working out I think these
headphones sound decent enough cause they
have those prominent mids, and then there’s
that deep punchy bass for when the bass drops.
And regarding the control buttons found on
the right ear cup…
I don’t have any problems with them.
They’re very easy to find, they’re very
easy to tell apart, you have full control
over your music, and they have very good tactile
feed back.
Again, skull candy did a very good job of
covering the basics with these headphones.
And when it comes to the microphone on the
skullcandy riff, I think it sounds a little
better than expected.
Even though there’s a little bit of static
going on, I think these are decent for brief
phone calls.
But this audio clip is being recorded by the
microphone found on the skull candy riff,
so you can be the judge of that.
But over all like I said at the beginning
of this video.
I think the Skullcandy Riff do a very good
job of covering the basics.
They fit well, but remember they do have a
snug fit… they have a decent battery life
of 12 hours with fairly useful fast charging.
Even though they don’t have an audio jack
I found them to be decent for videos cause
they don’t have any latency issues, and
they sound fairly decent.
Even though all the stuff I just mentioned
sounds obvious, there are plenty over headphones
on the market that don’t hit all of these
basic pillars.
Now I’m not saying that you should run out
and get the skull candy riff, but if you’re
considering getting them for what ever reason,
just know they’ll get the job done.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
