and for some that means it's
back-to-school season either if you're
currently going to high school or if you
commute to school or if you live on
campus here's a quick little guide of
pieces of tech that I think you should
pick up before going back to school that
won't break the bank
first ones list or the Sony whch 700 and
these are Sony's newest and cheapest anc
bluetooth headphones obviously these
headphones don't sound as good and
they're active noise cancellation isn't
as good as their older brother the 1000x
m2
but these definitely get the job done I
feel that having a good pair of anc
headphones is important for any high
school or college student because they
can help you block out loud and in
consider neighbors while you're trying
to study or you can sneak in a quick
power nap while you're on the bus on
your way to school or work the Sony 710
retail for $200 but they routinely go on
sale if you want to pick any of the
products featured on this list I'll have
links or description below and if you
use the links it really helps out to
channel and if you want to learn more
about either of these products then
watch they're full reviews next up on
this list is another Sony product the
Sony xp3 one Bluetooth speaker and this
is mainly for people who live on campus
obviously you're going to have a lot of
studying to do at school but you're also
going to need some time to relax and
hang out with friends the XP 31 sounds
good has a long battery life and you can
also use it as a battery bank to charge
your phone but there are a few reasons
why I'm recommending the XP 31 over all
the other mid-size speakers I've
reviewed since the XP 31 is much smaller
than the XP 41 it's much easier to
travel with and to throw into your
backpack and it's also much more durable
than the JBL charge three and pull three
because you don't have to worry about
damaging the exposed radiators if you
were to cram either of these speakers
into your backpack and besides the light
feature on the front is a huge added
benefit next up on this list is the JBL
clip 3 and I absolutely love this little
guy because it has quickly become my
dedicated podcast machine you can use it
to listen to TED Talks audio books
lectures or educational part
while you're in the shower or if you're
doing homework or if you're doing chores
around the house or you're doing since
the clip 3 has a very strong Bluetooth
connection you can have it on you while
your phone is charging in a different
room and I also really appreciate the
fact that the clip 3 has very little
latency so if you're going to use it to
watch the videos on your phone it's not
going to take away from the viewing
experience because the audio isn't in
sync with the image since the clip 3 has
a 12 hour battery life you can go 3 or 4
days without having to plug this guy in
and the last speaker on this list is
actually the Google home mininum Google
assistant can actually help you with
your homework if you're working on a
paper you can quickly ask the assistant
for synonyms so you're not constantly
using the same mortgage and you can ask
it to define or even spell words you're
having issues with but I personally
really like using the assistant when I'm
doing math or science homework you can
quickly ask it basic math questions unit
conversions or elemental properties and
you actually end up saving a good amount
of time because you're not constantly
having to plug numbers into a converter
or you don't have to look up certain
properties on your own de minute just
spits it out 18.085 to make mr. mole if
you're living on campus chances are you
have access to a free gym and that's
where the power beats 3 come in if
you're looking for a pair of sports
earphones to work out with I feel you
can't go wrong with the power beats 3
they sound decent they have a very long
battery life and thanks in aw1 chip they
have a very solid bluetooth connection
they usually retail for $200 but they
are forever on sale over at Amazon for
about $135 I'll have those specific
links down below as well and finally to
power everything on this list it is more
important than ever to have your own
battery bank there's nothing worse than
desperately needing to charge your phone
but then realizing there are no free
power outlets and using the public
charging station in the mess hall also
as an ideal because you're going to be
tied down to one spot for a while
and that's even if you're able to plug
in and that's where the Belkin pocket
power comes in it's small lightweight
and comes in various sizes and having
that 2500 all the connected equipment
warranty gives you a little peace of
mind and there you have it these are a
few pieces of technology that I feel you
should pick up before going back to
school that will hopefully make you a
little more productive and make your
time on campus a little more enjoyable
