sometimes you need to invest in the
right type of shoes and both Nike and
Reebok are working hard to get your
money with their MEK on three and nano 7
but whether because you just don't like
to make on three or the Nano seven or
just want to save some money both
companies still have to come to it
there's slightly more affordable options
Nike has their meklin rappers ESX and
Reebok has their crosses speak to our so
let's see which you should get so
tonight in Mecca rapper TSX retail for
100 bucks and come in four different
colorways the Reebok CrossFit speak to
your retail for $9.99 and now come in
six colorways it's a safe bet to say
that more colorways for each you will
continue to drop here and there as
always I'll have links in the
description below if you want to pick
either one of these done I've reviewed
both of these concepts shoes already but
here's a quick rundown of each both the
Nike makan rapper DSX and Reebok
CrossFit speak to your hazmat shoppers
the mission around the rapper DSX is a
little thicker and not as tight as the
mesh upper and Spiti are but overall the
upper arm the repre DSX is more durable
than the upper on the speeds you're
built into the mesh of the upper of the
Meccans rapper deus ex is nike flywire
system and as always the flower system
really helps with compression in
lockdown when you turn your laces you
get much better lock down in the nike
mecha repartee a sex den in the Reebok
roster speak to your one benefit to
CrossFit speak to your hands over the
rapper Deus Ex is it's padded tongue
although you can get a lot of
compression in lockdown from the fly
wire system on the rapper Deus Ex it
doesn't matter if there's a lot of
pressure and discomfort on the instep of
your foot
due to the represent on these shoes also
have very different soles on them for
started the sole in the Nike makan
repartee as sex is derived from the Nike
makan - they have been slightly
redesigned with flex grooves in the
forefoot area for flexibility traction
is okay but nowhere near as good as
attraction on the Reebok CrossFit speed
TR the outsole on the speed CR is
basically designed to give you the most
traction possible both of these out
soles are also designed to help you give
you traction when rope climbing as well
but the Rope row on the speeds your is
so small it doesn't really help at all
whereas the outer lamech on record Deus
Ex
gives you all the traction your heart
desires when rock climbing both of these
shoes also have let out heels for
stability when lifting and they both
feel identical one feature that
substitution shoes apart is the TPU heel
clip sound on the speed
and not on the repartee of sex which is
a little ironic because the MEK on 2 &amp;amp; 3
have few clips while the nanos 6.97 tone
and if you didn't know the TPU heel clip
allow your heels to glide on the wall
when you're doing handstand push-ups
concerning set the Meccan repre DSX are
true to size while Reebok CrossFit beats
your does tend to fit a little bit so
going down half the size is a good idea
working out in either of these shoes
feel very different the Reebok faster
speaks you are really good for watch
that call for Sprint's and run they give
you a lot of traction and padding so
might even say too much traction
the Nike mic on record has sex on the
other hand handles both sprint and
moderate weight lifting fairly well like
I said it might in this overview these
shoes really don't have a preference
when it comes to working out overall for
100 bucks both the Reebok transferred to
speak TR in the Nike MAG gum wrapper TSX
or both solid options as the name
implies the Reebok roster speed TR is
better suited for wads or circus
training that involve a lot of speed
drills one bonus the speed CR has over
the rapid Deus Ex is that heel clip so
if you do a lot of wall hand standing
push-ups these will come in handy the
nike metal record d sx on the other hand
are much more well rounded I even like
the metter than the MEK on three in the
Nano seven these shoes have no problems
going from Sprint's to weight lifting
and back if you do decide to pick these
up
you'll be fine going to the sides hey if
