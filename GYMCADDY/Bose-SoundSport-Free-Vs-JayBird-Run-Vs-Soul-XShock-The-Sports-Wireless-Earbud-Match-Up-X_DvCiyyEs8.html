again there are a lot of sports wireless
earbuds to choose from we've got both
big and small brands just flooding the
market almost every other week there's a
new parent that gets released and we're
at a point where I can't even name them
all but arguably the bose sound support
free and the jaybird one are among the
most popular and the soul x shock is the
underdog I didn't expect to like so much
usually a decent pair of truly wireless
sports your buds retails between 150 and
200 dollars below that you might get
questionable build quality or below
average battery life or connection
quality performance and if you're paying
more than $200 for a pair of wireless
earbuds I personally think you're
overpaying that's why I picked these
three wireless earbuds today the sole
extra car currently retailing for one
$49.99 the j-bird run currently retails
for 170 $9.99 and the bose sound support
free now has a price reduction from $250
to $200 if you want to pick either of
these earbuds up I'll have a link in
description below and if you use the
link it really helps out to channel all
three of these wireless earbuds have a
few things in common they all have a
slightly larger carrying case than the
air pods they all have onboard binds to
controller music playback and they all
have one earbud that's the master and
one earbud that's the slave but each of
these earbuds
also have a unique feature that sets
them apart from one another
first off let's go over the most
significant one and that's battery life
personally when I'm picking sports
wireless earbuds for working out I'm not
really concerned about amazing sound
quality I'm looking for something that
fits well and has a very long battery
life and battery life is what the
ex-jock has going for it for reference I
go to the gym four times a week for two
hours
the jaybird run have a total advertised
battery life of 12 hours and they
usually last me for full workouts by the
fifth workout I have to charge them back
up or I'll still die mid-session the
Bose sound sport free have a total
advertised battery life for 15 hours and
you'll usually last me six full workouts
but the sole ex-jock has a 3000 milliamp
hour battery built into its current case
on a full charge I managed to go a month
in one week without having to charge the
egg shock and I even use the extra
carrying case to keep my phone from
dying malware
out on the last day of testing the ex
shock has an advertised battery life of
60 hours so theoretically I could go
almost two months without having to
recharge the carrying case with my
workout frequency
now the action aren't the first and they
aren't the only wireless earbuds that
also allows you to use their carrying
case as a battery bank for your phone
but from what I can tell they have the
largest built-in battery and overall
battery life on the market sure the
ex-jocks carrying case is huge but if
you're like me who has a pair of
dedicated workout earbuds and just
stashes them in your gym bag then the
egg shock are a god-centered what are my
biggest pet peeves is getting ready for
a workout and then just realizing your
earbuds or out of juice so you have to
put them on the charger and wait for
like 10 minutes before you can actually
start working out and it's even worse if
they require a proprietary cable like
the j-bird x3 now when it comes to fit
the ex shock fit me just fine but you
only have two ear tip sizes to choose
from the bullet sounds for free come
with three silicone ear tips to choose
from but still they're not going to fit
everybody what the tapered one has going
for it is fit in customization the
j-bird run have round and oval silicone
ear tips to choose from and you can mix
and match the orphans any way you want
and once you find that perfect fit the
jabber run do the best job of staying
locked in place while working out here
the extra do just fine staying in place
but you are going to have to readjust
them from time to time the earbuds on
the Bose sound sport free are the
biggest and heaviest ear while weight
lifting the bow stay in place very well
but when I do my post workout cardio or
for a runner who is constantly moving up
and down the Bulls do have a tendency to
wiggle out although the j-bird run do a
very good job of staying locked in place
the ear hooks on the power piece three
or one of the reasons why I still like
them so much and the defining
characteristic the Bose sound sport free
has is their overall to build quality
their case and ear buds are the most
premium feeling ones here like I said in
the initial review the j-bird run have a
pretty cheap case I'm worried the lid is
just going to eventually snap off and I
hate how the earbuds don't magnetically
align themselves to the case which has
resulted me in frequently dropping to
jaybird ear buds
regarding build quality on the sole egg
shock a neutral it's not amazing but
it's also not bad all three of these ear
buds are water and sweat resistant but
the Bose sounds board free or built like
a tank now when it comes to cell quality
all three of these
but sound very different personally I
think the sole extra or the worst
sounding earbuds here but it doesn't
mean they sound that they have a good
amount of bass but they also have a good
amount of tuning the bose sound support
3 or the clearer sounding earbuds here
and the j-bird run are the best sounding
your metier and you can also make them
sound however you like to the table tab
but even though the jaybird run are the
best sounding earbuds here they don't
get as loud as the other two earbuds the
bose sound sports we do get a little
louder but they do let in a lot more
ambient sound personally i like to
listen to the X up while I'm working out
because they block out as much sound as
the deeper run but they also get much
louder and they have the bass I want
when I'm working out well like I said on
my Bose sound support free review when
deciding to use truly wireless earbuds
you do give up the convenience and
inline controller offers like the ones
on the power beats 3 or J Brand X 3 both
did include a full set of buttons on
their earbuds so you can play or pause
your music skip a track go back a track
and activate Siri but the buttons on the
Bose are so hard to press it's just
easier to use your phone the same thing
can be said about the run and extra
their controls are much more limited so
you're going to find yourself whipping
out your phone more frequently as well
having an inline controller is another
reason why I still gravitate towards the
power beats 3 I don't have to touch my
phone as much when I'm working out now
the last thing I want to touch on here
is connectivity first off none of these
earbuds are good for watching YouTube
videos they all have varying degrees of
latency but one of the biggest problems
I've had with the j-bird run is that
their connection isn't very stable but
depending on what phone you have your
results may vary
my Jaber run have a really hard time
that skipping a track when used with my
iPhone 6s plus and yes they do have to
lay this firmware but on the other hand
the both an ex-jock have no problem
keeping a clear and stable connection
with my phone and no matter how good any
pair of earbuds sound or how long their
battery life is all poor Bluetooth
connection is not acceptable now
remember this isn't a full review on
either of these ear but I'm just trying
to point out the most important
differences between them so I couldn't
open with a purchase decision if you
want to learn more about either of these
earbuds then watch their full reviews
personally I like the sole extract the
most here because of their incredibly
long battery life low profile design and
haven't the option to charge my phone
with their carrying case is great I
don't have to interrupt my work and I
can just plug it in and keep
going the boss sounds worth free are
also good but they are on the higher end
of the price spectrum and those earbuds
are just huge the table run are also
good but their connection stability is a
problem for me you might have the
results with a different phone but still
they don't get loud enough for me and
not to mention their battery life is the
shortest here so you're going to have to
remember to charge them more frequently
