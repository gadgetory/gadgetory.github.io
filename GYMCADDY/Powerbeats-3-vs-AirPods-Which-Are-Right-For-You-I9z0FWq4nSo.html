some people have asked sure to get air
Podge or powerbeats three too bad I say
well it depends on what you want to use
them for right now you can pick up the
powerbeats three on Amazon for 150 if
you get the black ones the Batman
approve so should you get the earpods
and get teased by the haters or just get
the powerbeats and call it a day
also I'm doing a giveaway in these air
pods go check out my ear pods review
video for the details after you're done
here first thing first let's get the
obvious out of the way and that's the
form factor as you can see the power
beats are much larger and have soft
touch ear hooks these your hooks ensure
the power beats stay in place at all
times no matter what the power beats are
also tethered together via a flat non
tangle cable the power beats are also in
your earphones that come with the total
of four ear tips these earphones also
charge via micro USB cable they also
last a full 12 hours on a single charge
which is my favorite feature personally
the power beats also feature fast fuel
which will get you an hour of playback
from just 5 minutes of charging these
are also water and dust resistant and
they can take a beating their pods on
the other hand are truly wireless
earphones that are super lightweight so
lightweight in fact you forget they're
in your ears after a while they're made
out of plastic and they only come in one
size unlike the power beats the air pods
are not water or dust resist it so take
it easy on them each ear pod has a five
hour battery life and can only be
charged when placed inside their
carrying case similarly to the power
beats the air pots can get three hours
of playback time from 15 minutes of
charger both earphones use apples eww
one chip the w1 chip allows for
extremely simple pairing across all of
your Apple devices it also creates a
very strong and clear wireless
connection not to mention the w1 chip
plays a big part in helping these your
phones have such long battery lives but
don't worry these earphones can still
connect to non Apple devices via
bluetooth and finally both earphones
have built-in microphones so you can
take calls or argue with Siri
aside from the form factor the power
beats also have one more crucial design
difference and that's the inline
controller with the controller you can
control your music playback accepted on
calls and activate Siri the air pods on
the other hand don't have an inline
controller in order to control your
music playback you have to tell Siri by
double tapping on either ear phone it's
rather annoying
to be honest but at least the earpods no
wonder in your ear and can pause music
playback whenever you remove either one
they'll also automatically start your
music or video backup when you put the
ear pods back in your ear at this point
you might be asking which sound better
well after listening to the same songs
with both earphones one after another I
can say the power beats 3 sound better
now I'm not a full-blown audiophile but
I do appreciate a pair of good sounding
earphones the power beats have a better
sound stage or stronger bass and the
mids and highs don't get muddled so if
sound quality is what you're interested
in then go for the power beat so if you
thought you were going to get a pair of
wireless earbuds that work great both in
the gym and in the office by buying a
pair of ear pods you're sadly mistaken
Apple is clearly targeting two different
consumers with their offerings their
pods are best suited for someone who
wants to listen to music when they're at
work you wouldn't necessarily wear a
pair of power beats while you're at the
office they simply look out of place and
like I said in my initial ear pods
review having truly while it's earbuds
gives you a sense of freedom when you
wear them you don't have to worry about
having a wire snagging on your clothing
or getting caught on the edge of a desk
while you're walking in the office for
example the power beats on the other
hand belong at the gym were meant to be
worn when you're working out unlike the
air pods they are water and dust
resistant and a little more rugged if
you tried working out with air pods
you're gonna have a bad time and the
power beats in your design provides
passive noise isolation as well so what
should you get well depends what you
need them for if you're looking for a
hybrid pair of wireless earphones so you
can use both indigent and while you're
out and about you might have to wait for
the beep techs if not choose either the
power beach or air pots of depending on
your needs personally the power of these
three are still my favorite and for 150
on Amazon it's a no-brainer
