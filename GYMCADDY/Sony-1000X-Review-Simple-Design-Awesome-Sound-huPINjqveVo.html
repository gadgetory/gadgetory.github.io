video for a while now and I think now
might be a good at times any sense rumor
has it both are going to be dropping and
upgraded to c35 soon so the Sony nd or
1000x any good well I hope so since door
more expensive than my current go to
have some the Sony xb9 50 and one don't
forget to Like comment and subscribe and
you can check out some of my other
videos here after you're done watching
this video the sony MDR 1000x is Sony's
higher end consumer noise cancelling
headphones they come in two colors black
or beige and honestly I wish Sony had
went more for a gold color instead of
beige I think it would have looked much
better the sony MDR 1000x usually retail
for $399.99 but now you can get them for
as low as three hundred twenty-eight
dollars on amazon if you want to pick
these headphones up I'll have a link in
the description below and I'll keep it
updated so you can get the best deals
possible first I just want to point out
that the unboxing experience from the
1000x is nothing like other Sony
products for the most part unboxing sony
products is just here's the box inside
the box is the speaker or headphone
surrounded by a whole bunch of styrofoam
here's your charging cable and manuals
have a nice name with the 1000x
you slide off the sturdy sleeve you then
open the black textured box you'll then
see the hardshell plastic carrying case
and to the left there's a compartment
that houses the manual and audio cable
of micro USB cable and a two pronged
claim adapter personally I think JBL has
a better unboxing experience but I like
this type of presentation because it
tells you you just bought something nice
but anyway the sony MDR 1000x is made
mostly out of plastic and has fallen
ear cuffs on the outside but by no means
do they feel or look cheap the padding
on the ear cuffs and headband is
comfortable but there are other
headphones that feature more padding
there comes themselves swivel and you
can either lay them flat or fold them up
depending on your storage needs these
headphones weigh in at nine point seven
ounces or 275 grams wearing them for an
extended period of time is no problem if
you're being stationary
personally I think if you're going to be
walking a lot with these headphones you
will suffer from overheating like
it and end up with sweaty ear cups on
the left ear cup you'll find your offset
power button noise cancel and control
button and ambient sound control button
and those are all over your physical
buttons but now you might be wondering
wait how do I control my music will you
do so by using the touch controls on the
right ear cuffs and at first I thought
it was going to be highly flawed or just
a gimmick what after using it I don't
ever want to go back it's easier to use
highly accurate and it's good at
preventing false positives all you got
to do is double tap the same spot twice
to play or pause your music you swipe
forward to skip a track you strike back
to go back a track and you swipe up or
down to adjust your volume and something
no one else has really mentioned the new
review is if you press and hold the
write your cup it's going to activate
Siri I just wish there was multi-touch
so you can raise or lower the volume a
little faster or maybe squirt through
your music because right now it'll work
with one bite at a time
but the best part is if you cover the
right ear cups the headphones will
automatically lower the volume and
pumping sounds from around you so if
somebody's trying to talk to you you
don't have to take off your headphones
to hear them you can just hear them like
this you don't have to do that awkward
thing where it's like oh wait what did
you just say these earphones also
feature a few different ambient sound
settings if you have them set to ambient
sound normal they will pump in a lot of
your surrounding sounds so you can be
aware of what's going on around you
while you're playing music this is good
to have if you're walking around the
city then there's ambient sound voice
you'll notice a lot less sound is being
pumped in but the headphones will try to
exclusively only let in people's voice
in a while you're playing music so you
can hear what people are saying and then
there's your normal voice canceling
setting where the headphones will block
out almost everything and I've got to
say the noise cancelling on the Sony and
the or 1000x is really good sure you'll
get a little rasping us here and there
if that noise cancelling mic to get hit
by a gust of air but other than that
you're in your own little world the best
part is they don't cause me any kind of
headaches like the bose qc25 do but
that's just me and I did notice these
headphones have a lot less cabin
then the bose qc25 as well when it comes
to battery life these headphones are
good for about 20 hours of playback time
with noise canceling on and you'll be
able to squeeze out 22 hours out of them
if you use them with noise cancelling
off but just be warned these headphones
don't have quick charging and they take
a whole four hours to fully charge these
headphones are also using bluetooth for
that one and they have a range of around
40 feet and I did notice there was very
little latency so watching videos with
the sony MV or 1000x is nice but even
though these headphones are using
bluetooth for that one
they can't be paired to multiple devices
at the same time so you can't just use
them with your phone and then switch to
your laptop you have to go through the
pairing process every single time I just
find it odd that even though these
headphones are using bluetooth 4.1 they
can only be paired to one device at a
time
but if you have an Android device parent
can be a little easier thanks to the NFC
touch point on the left ear cup when it
comes to sound quality I was very
satisfied with the sony MDR 1000x like I
said in past reviews the boast to see 35
does leave me one more and I was just
not happy with the JBL aerosol it ends
with the NC sound quality but the sony
MDR 1000x is an overall wave performer
and they have a good amount of bass to
them granted the bass under the 1000x
isn't going to satisfy a bass I'd like
to show me XP 950 anyone do but they
will leave you hanging like the bose
qc25 you the only complaint I might have
is the highs might get a little too
short here and there if there's a snare
drum but other than that we said I'm
ready like I mentioned earlier these
headphones can include it with a hard
shell carrying case there isn't much
going on it digs up there's a pocket on
the back and there's a loop so you can
attach it to your backpack just like the
headphones it's subtle but overall for
$328 I think the sony and dr 1000x is a
solid buy even though they were very
plain-looking they sound very good
I think the touch controls are a game
changer they have solid noise
cancellation the ambient noise setting
is a good feature and being able to
cover one ear cup to hear your
surroundings without having to take off
your headphones is genius
not to mention they have a battery life
of 20 hours which is great I just wish
they were able to connect to multiple
devices at the same time I wouldn't mind
if they punched up the design a little
added more breathable padding on the ear
cups and I really wish they had quick
charging hey if you enjoyed the video
