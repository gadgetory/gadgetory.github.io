Carrey's review on the jaybird freedom
wireless earbuds Jay but has a
reputation of having some of the best
sounding wireless earbuds on the market
they're competitively priced and very
well made so do they live up to the hype
we're about to find out packaging here
is exceptional inside the box you're
going to find that your budget front and
center under that there's a carrying
pouch and some documentation inside the
pouch you will find four sets of
wingtips three sets of comply your tips
three sets of silicone eartips some wire
management clips proprietary charging
cradle in a micro USB cable dear buds
themselves are super small and made out
of metal it has a soft touch around
cable and an inline controller that is
made out of plastic and metal that
houses most of the electronics and has
three buttons on the front overall they
have a super premium feel in our
extremely lightweight you can literally
spend hours customizing these earbuds to
fit and sound exactly how you want them
to jaybird gives you four sets of their
patented wingtips and honestly these are
what make jaybird stand out from all the
other ear buds on the market there are
meant to sit in the bowl of your ear and
help keep the earbuds in place you're
also given three pairs of comply your
tips these are made of hydrophobic
memory foam like material and expand
inside your ear to make a near perfect
seal that blocks out most surrounding
noise if complied tips on your style you
are also given three pairs of silicone
eartips to play with so like I said you
can spend hours customizing the way
these earbuds fit in your ear you can
mix and match your tips and a wink tips
or even wear them and the over ear or
under your style you can also adjust
away these earbuds sound I playing
around with the my sound app controlling
your music and answering calls with the
inline control is super easy by just
touch the front of the controller has to
read to think of buttons that make it
near impossible to press the wrong one
to turn on these earbuds you simply
press and hold the center button when
they turn on the lady that lives inside
will notify you the earbuds have
connected with your device and will
state the current battery percentage in
order to change tracks you press and
hold the up or down volume button for
two seconds instead of double clicking
like other ear buds unfortunately these
buttons have a very dissatisfied and
click to them although these earbuds
have a lot of great things going for
them they do suffer from a few design
flaws first let's start with the battery
life these earbuds are advertised as
having an eight hour battery life but an
actuality earbuds themselves can only
hold it
for our charge this is a charging cradle
you connect it to the micro USB cable
and then clip it onto the inline
controller to charge the cradle itself
also has a battery that can charge the
earbuds if the idea here is when you're
done using your earbuds simply connect
the charger cradle before you store them
in the carrying pouch so that the next
time you reach for your earbuds they'll
be fully charged again you can also
charge your earbuds and listen to music
at the same time but by carrying the
proprietary charger cradle around with
you you run the risk of losing the
cradle if you lose the cradle you won't
be able to charge your earbuds and
you'll have to buy a replacement from
jaybird site for 2495 the battery life
in charging cradle aren't the only
issues here since the inline controller
houses the battery and Bluetooth radios
it's rather heavy compared to the super
lightweight earbud after testing these
earphones we found the right earbud
tends to fall out frequently and that's
unacceptable although these earphones
can be customized to your heart's
content the glare and design issues make
it hard to recommend to anybody willing
to drive between 149 99 and 179 99 for
these earphones they're very well made
but the a-line controller will cause the
right ear but to follow frequently
hopefully jaber fix these problems with
their new X threes well if you made it
this far and leave us a like it really
helps if you like videos like this
