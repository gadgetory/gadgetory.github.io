you're the market for a large portable
speaker then these two are perhaps your
most popular and eye-catching options
both the sony xba-40 one and JBL extreme
2 were recently released have gotten
noticeable improvements and they both
cost about the same but they do have
some key differences between one another
so let's find out which one's right for
you just so we're clear this isn't a
full review on either of these speakers
I'm just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you a purchase decision if you
want to learn more about either of these
speakers then watch their full reviews
both of these speakers were announced at
CES 2018 and they were released shortly
after the sony xba-40 one retails for
$250 and the JBL extreme two retails for
$300 if you want to pick either of these
speakers up I'll have links to
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel
and just as we talked about because Sony
speakers routinely go on sale sure
Michael lucky first let's talk about
design the JBL extreme 2 didn't change
too much from the original extreme it
has the same basic shape and it has a
fabric mesh covered body but the sony
xba-40 one has a completely new design
from the previous XP 40 the XP 40 one's
new design has proven itself to be
polarizing but personally I love it
it looks much sleeker and the light
feature is way better the XP 41 is also
much lighter and narrower than the
extreme two but more importantly the XP
41 now also has a fabric mesh covered
body which lets to stand up to bumps and
scrapes when you take it on to go with
you as good as the extreme to the sony
xba-40 one is also ip67 rated so it's
both dust and waterproof basically sony
upgraded the XP 41 to make sure it was
as durable and portable as the extreme -
the JBL extreme - is ipx7 rated so water
isn't an issue but I think the reason it
doesn't have a dust certification is cuz
of the exposed radiators on each side
but as long as you don't get sand in
them or you push them in you'll be fine
even though Sony tried to make the XP 41
as portable as the extreme -
making it lightweight and durable the
extreme two has the upper hand when it
comes to portability thanks to the
carrying strap
sure you can throw the XP 41 into your
backpack or just hold it but with the
extreme two you can just swing it over
your shoulder and get moving
honestly do not underestimate how handy
the carrying strap is the new cang strap
on the extreme two also has a built in
bottle opener which is a very nice touch
on JBL sport okay now let's talk about
how you charge these speakers cuz it
matters both the JBL extreme 2 and sony
xba-40 one come with AC wall chargers
but the XP 41 also allows you to charge
it with a micro USB cable as long as you
have a wall adapter that supplies 5
volts and personally I love this I can
charge my camera drone and speaker all
with one cable being able to charge the
XP 41 via an AC or microUSB port is a
very nice touch on Sony's part when it
comes to battery life
JBL advertises a 15 hour battery life on
the extreme 2 and sony advertises a 24
hour battery life on the xB 41 but in my
testing with the volume set at 50% the
extreme to average 16 and a half hours
to play that time and the xB 41 average
20 hours to playback time with the life
feature turned on and with the volume
set at 80% the extreme to average is 10
hours to playback time and the xB 41
averaged 12 hours of playback time ok
now let's talk about speaker saddle
because things are very different the
sony xba-40 1 has dual 58 millimeter
diameter woofers and dual passive
radiators in the center that shoot out
the front and out the back of the
speaker but the extremes to setup is a
little more impressive it has slightly
larger 70 millimeter diameter woofers
duel 20 millimeter diameter tweeters
that are not present on the XP 41 and
significantly larger dual passive
radiators on each side of the speaker
now before we get into the sound test
even though you can manually adjust the
EQ on the XP 41 to whatever you like I
decided to use the XP 41 in is extra
bass mode and live sound modes because
those are kind of the main selling
points Sony is trying to push on the
speaker
alone I feel the reading crashing down
this empty town searching for the lost
but you don't
I hate how the sony xba-40 one sounds
when set to live sound mode I never use
it but Sony's extra based lineup is
geared towards people who listen to
music with lots of bass and since I
listen to a lot of rap hip-hop in a Dion
I like the XP 41 and I prefer to listen
to the XP 41 with extra bass turn them
on because it has more kick than the
extreme two but even though you can
easily and quickly turn off extra bass
or adjust the EQ on the XP 41 no matter
how much you play around with the EQ on
the XP 41 it's audio quality is not as
good as the extreme to the extreme two
sounds clearer and more defined now
don't get me wrong
both of these speakers sound good but if
you want the better audio quality go for
the extreme two now when it comes to
loudness both of these speakers get
pretty loud but the sony xba-40 one does
manage to get louder than the extreme
two but when the XB 41 is set to max
volume the extra bass feature is
automatically turned off and as a result
the XB 41 does start to sound a little
bright whereas the JBL extreme two might
not get as loud as the XB 41 but it does
sound better but using the JBL extreme
to add max volume is like using the sony
xba-40 one at ninety percent volume now
if you plan on pairing multiple speakers
together on a regular basis i highly
advise you invest in two GPIOs ecosystem
because of g/b i'll connect plus JB I'll
connect plus is the easiest way to pair
multiple speakers together you literally
just press one button on each speaker
and the speaker's will figure out the
rest by themselves you don't have to
mess wang with any bluetooth settings
and you don't have to mess around with
any other apps it just works
whereas pairing multiple sony speakers
together is like stacking dominoes you
have to do everything just right and if
you mess up you're gonna have to start
all over again and even sometimes if you
follow the instructions perfectly it
just doesn't work and even if it does
work there are times where an echo will
start to form and the only way to get
rid of it is to turn the speaker's off
and put them up again but when these
sony speakers do pair up the light
features also sync up what
immediately do look pretty good and
finally let's talk about the light
feature it's not as impressive as the
JBL pulls three but it does look pretty
good you have a few light modes to
choose from and you can also customize
your colors a little bit the light
feature on the XP 41 makes it more than
just a speaker in your room it also
makes it a decoration and when the XP 41
is turned off it's very inconspicuous so
here's my final verdict
both of these speakers are good rugged
and durable enough to take with you
almost anywhere but if we were to base
this off of purely looks then I would go
with the XP 41 because of its smaller
form factor and the light feature which
I personally really enjoy it also has a
better battery life but if you want
something with better audio fidelity
then I would go with the extreme - I
feel the sony xba-40 one is great if you
only want one speaker but if you plan on
routinely pairing multiple speakers
together then I highly advise you get
the extreme two because of JBL connect
plus if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
