first announced a new tapered x fours
which have a cult-like following and
then shortly after that they announced a
new entry-level Chamber Terra but that
shortly after those they announced a new
taper Terra Pro and given that I still
prefer wired Bluetooth earbuds over
truly wireless earbuds for working out
at the gym
I really think j-bird outdid themselves
with their new cheaper Terra pros the
j-bert arrow pro or Jaybirds most
expensive in premium wired Bluetooth
earbuds retailing for $160 that's just
10 dollars less than the truly Wireless
tapered run and for comparison's sake
the jaybird x4 we tell for $130 and the
entry-level j / Terra we tell us for
$100 if you want to pick other these
earbuds up I'll have links to the
description down below and I suggest you
check them out because you never know
when they'll go on sale everything about
the j-bert arrow pro is just more
premium compared to Jaybirds other wired
Bluetooth earbuds even the carob pouch
the J Patera pro comes included with a
carrying pouch very similar to the
x-force but I can't help but notice it's
a little thicker and a little more
rugged and just a heads up the
entry-level Terra doesn't even come with
a carrying pouch but what makes the
Terra pro really stand out is it's super
rugged build quality the Terra pro is
one of the few Bluetooth earbuds out
there that features a braided cable up
until now all of Jaybirds earbuds and
most other sports wireless earbuds out
there features a flat rubber cable in
the earbuds on the Tarot Pro
magnetically attached which is handy
when you're just gonna have that your
budget rustling around your neck and
it's a cheaper first as well now when it
comes to the fit the Tarot pro uses the
same ear gels as the entry-level Terra
as in bit your tip and fin is one solid
piece they're easy to swap out and
they're very soft but the terrorists
one-piece ear gel is a major
differentiating factor from the super
popular Japan X 3 and X 4 on the jaybird
X for the ear tip and your fin or two
separate pieces so theoretically you
have more customization options but what
really made the X 4 different from the
entry-level Terran was having the option
to wear
in its over ear position which offers a
much more secure fit compared to its
normal wearing position and due to the
terrors of one-piece ear gel you can't
wear the Terra in an over your position
but the Terra problem on the other hand
has a secret weapon
the Arizona terrible actually rotate so
if you want to wear the Telo Pro in its
normal position you can do that or if
you want that more secure over your fit
you can also do that with the Terra
problem and personally I think the over
ear fit on the Terra probe works much
better than on the X for is because of
that rounded cable regarding battery
life the JP Terra pros have an
advertised by the length of 14 hours
which is huge compared to the x-force
advertised battery life of 8 hours and
the entry-level terrors advertised
battery life of 6 hours and just keep in
mind the super popular power beats 3
have an advertised battery life of 12
hours but battery life aside the Terra
probes also feature some very impressive
fast charging a 5 minute charge from a
dead battery on the Terra Pro will get
you 2 hours of playback time whereas a
10 minute charge on both the X fours and
Tara will only get you one hour of
playback time and a 5 minute charge on
the power beats 3 will also only get you
one hour playback time so battery life
and fast charging or some of the key
features that our pros really has going
for it
but unfortunately the Terra Pro has yet
another proprietary charger from jaybird
now this charging cradle from Jay bird
does magnetically align and attach
itself to the Terra pros inline
controller
another first for jaybird but I do find
it very funny that all of day bers
earbuds have a different charging cradle
I consider it a miracle at this point at
today but run charges via a micro USB
port regarding wireless connectivity
both the Jaber Terra and Terra pros are
using Bluetooth 5.0 whereas the jaybird
X fours are using bluetooth 4.1
overall this isn't a big deal because
they all have stable connections that
don't cut out and are all decent for
watching videos on your iPhone because
they all have very little latency and
when it comes to the sound quality just
like all of Jaybirds other products the
Tarot pro has
and adjustable EQ so he can make them
sound however you like depending on the
type of music you listen to clarity is
good the bass is deep and punchy and the
highs and never get any cheaper has
always done a good job of making good
sounding earbuds it's what made them so
popular and all the Sabres products
sound and perform the same across the
board but this also means that some
people will find the J Patera Pro might
not get as loud as they like personally
I think that Jaybirds earbuds get loud
enough especially when used with a
property it's up creating a good seal
but some people feel Jaybirds robots
just don't get loud enough to block out
ambient noise and finally there's the
inline controller like I've said in the
past I prefer wired Bluetooth earbuds
over truly Wireless here but at the gym
because the endline controller gives you
full control over your music playback
without having to go through the extra
steps of having to talk to your voice
assistant to do simple things and you
don't have to touch your phone as much
now the Ellen controllers on both terror
models is slightly different from the
x-force inline controller and I
personally prefer the raise plus and
minus buttons on the Terra's because
they're easier to tell apart than the
x-force circular buttons just by touch
but overall I'm actually a very big fan
of the jb tera pro a lot of people were
underwhelmed when the J Brand X 4 came
out cuz they weren't all that different
from the X threes spec wise and that's
not a problem - J Brand X 3 and X 4 are
both very good products but I was a
little confused when j-bird announced
their entry-level tera
for just 30 bucks more I would just
upgrade to the X fours or I get the X
threes for the same price but I really
do like what j-bird has done with their
Terra pro build quality wise you're
getting the extra rugged braided cable I
really like the larger and easier to
tell apart buttons on the inline
controller and having the earbuds
magnetically attached is a great added
bonus and unlike the entry-level Terra
you don't have to sacrifice the over ear
fit option on the Terra Pro because of
those rotating earbuds but jaybird
outdid themselves spec wise on the Terra
Pro by cramming in an impressive 14 hour
battery
life in a very small package but more
importantly they also now have some of
the best fast charging in a pair of
wireless earbuds since they get two
hours from a five minute charge if you
have the je products three and we're
hesitant to upgrading to the x-force
then I do think the j-bert era pro is
worth the upgrade and if you're looking
into getting your first pair of jaybird
earbuds then the top row or currently
the best earbuds j-bert has to offer if
you made it this far
