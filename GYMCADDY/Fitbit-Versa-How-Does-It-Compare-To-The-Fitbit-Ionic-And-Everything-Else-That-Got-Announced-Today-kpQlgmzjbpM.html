got acquired by Fitbit last year, but today
Fitbit announced a very pebble like looking
smart watch and fitness tracker, the Fitbit
Versa.
Smart watches haven’t really caught on as
much as people thought they would.
These days the majority of people who do use
a smart watch are likely using an apple watch
and rumors are going around that Google is
going to be rebranding android wear to Wear
OS.
So are we going to see a reusegance in capable
smartwatches?
Cause the Fitbit Versa looks kind of promising.
Fitbit really needs a win here cause their
Fitbit ionic just isn’t selling as well
as they hoped.
So lets get to know the Fitbit versa, this
new smartwatch is going to be retailing for
$199.99 and they should start shipping in
April.
Design wise the Fitbit Versa is very similar
to the Apple Watch and I think the Versa looks
way better than the Fitbit Ionic.
The Fitbit versa has a light weight anodized
aluminum body and there are a few colors to
choose from, theres black, rose gold, and
silver.
Your typical colors.
For $200 the Versa will come with a color
matching silicon wrist band or for $230 you
can get a woven wristband instead.
And personally I’m really feeling that Graphite
Case and Woven Charcoal Band version.
And as always you can also remove the wrist
bands on the new Versa and swap them out for
leather wrist bands that start off at $50
or you can also get a steel wrist band which
cost $80 or $100 depending on the style.
And for comparison, the Fitbit Ionic starts
off at $300.
The Fitbit Versa is going to do everything
you’d expect a Fitbit Smart Watch to do.
It plays nice with iPhone, Android, or window
devices.
Its going to track your steps, track your
activity and sleep, its swim proof so you
can track real-time laps, exercise duration,
and calories burned on device while swimming,
its going to show you your notifications you
can store up to 300 songs on it and it has
a built in NFC chip so you can use it to pay
for stuff…
But only if you get the $230 version.
And also, quick reply will only work if you’re
using an android device.
The main difference between the Fitbit Versa
and Fitbit Ionic is that the Fitbit Versa
uses connected GPS unlike the Fitbit Iconic
which has built in LTE and GPS.
This means that if you’re a runner and if
you want to track your workout when using
the Versa you have to bring your phone along
where as with the Ionic you can leave your
phone behind because the Ionic has the necessary
hardware to track your position on its own.
Also, the Fitbit Versa has an advertised battery
life of 4 days while the Ionic has an advertised
battery life of 5 days.
Obviously depending on how you use it your
battery life will vary.
Also at their event, Fitbit announced that
they will be rolling out a new feature to
their app that will allow women to track their
cycle if they want, but this feature will
only be avilbel to Versa or Ionic users.
Fitbit also announced their new Fitbit Ace,
a wearable for kids with a 5 day battery life.
Basically its a smaller version of the Fitbit
Alta that should fit smaller writs for kids
8 years and older and the idea is is that
the Ace will be able to give parents a better
insight on their kids activity levels sleeping
patterns while motivating and creating healthy
lifestyle habits in children at a younger
age.
Personally I think thats a good idea.
But other than that, the Fitbit versa isn’t
all that different to the Fitbit ionic in
terms of features.
Its going to do basically the same things
but the versa lacks built in GPS and has a
slightly shorter battery.
But since the Fitbit Ionic wasn’t the mega
hit Fitbit expected they might have better
luck with the Versa, its much less expensive
and it looks much better.
But comment down below, what do you think
about the Versa?
Do you think it looks better or worse than
the Ionic.
Are you a pebble user?
What do you think about this new smart watch?
Would you strap a fitness tracker on your
kid?
Or do you think we’re about to see another
wave of new wearables when app Google rebrand
and reamps their smart watch OS?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
