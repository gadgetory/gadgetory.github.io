welcome to Altec Lansing you're looking
for small portable 100 all the while to
speak which is you get this JBL sony ue
al tech and aqua fun is just tuning with
you where there's so many companies
fighting for your dollar that has to be
one of the best right so that's where to
find out right now which speakers right
for you let's find out don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe so all of
these speakers will looking at today
usually retail for around $100 today
we're looking at the JBL for Sony XP 20
you II wonder boom and the Altech mini
life jacket too at the time this
recording the ue wonderful is actually
on sale for $79.99 so you might want to
check the link below before it's too
late
all of these speakers come in various
color ways so there's bound to be one
you might like if you want to pick
either of these speakers up I'll have
links in description below and I'll keep
them updated so you can get the best
view as possible size wise these
speakers are pretty similar the JBL 54
sony xba-1 in life jacket all have a
rectangular shape to them but the sony
xba-40 is the biggest of the bunch
the ue wonderful money other hand is
more of a pod like design concerning
weight the sony xba-1 600 grams a lot of
LeFort is right behind at 515 grams and
the l techne life jacket is the lightest
of the bunch
concerning construction the JBL 54 and
ue wonder boom both have nylon without
errs and they're pretty adorable
the nylon weave outers can take almost
everything you throw them they also have
soft touch rubber on the ends which give
them a premium feel and give them a good
amount of grip so they stay in place
when you place it on the table and the
base gets going the sony XP 20 also has
a soft touch rubber body but has a
painted middle grown the front which
makes it look more expensive than it
actually is that looks like mini life
jacket is the most radical looking of
the group it also has a grill on the
front like the Sony Xperia Play cick
there's also two layers of rubber and
casing the plastic body whenever I look
at the Altech I just think about a hung
be but like Altec says it's everything
proof all these speakers have a rubber
garment on the back that has a micro USB
for charging and an all check from the
elements well except the you II wonder
boom the wonder boom only has a microUSB
port no ox Jack all of these speakers
have binds on them some more than others
the Alltech only has three buttons but
you can adjust the volume player
positive music skip a track or go back
to track answer and end calls and if you
double press the power button you'll
read a your last phone call honestly I
really wish it could change what double
pressing the power button does do you
wonder boom has two big buttons on the
front for adjusting your volume and you
really have to give them a hard press to
get them to work there's also three more
buttons on the top the bottom one is
your power button the UE logo is also
button press or once it'll play or pause
your music and if you double press it
it'll skip a track unfortunately you
can't go back a track which kind of
sucks the sony xba-40 also has a few
buttons on the top and you can do
everything the Altec can do except you
can also activate Siri by pressing the
phone icon and the JBL safor also has a
few control blinds but also suffers the
same setback as they you eat wonderful
you can't go back a track but if you
press and hold the triangle button you
can activate Siri concerning
connectivity and battery life the JBL
set for Sony XP 20 and youi wonder boom
are all using bluetooth for a tattoo so
this means it can be paired to multiple
devices at one time so searching between
your phone and your laptop is super easy
but the range between these three
speakers is different the Sony XP 20 has
a shortest range at just 40 feet while
the 4 and the UE one boom both have a
range of around 100 feet and these three
speakers can be paired to other speakers
of the same make without like mini life
jacket to that I have here has a range
of around 30 feet but if you were to get
too out tagging in the a life jacket 3
you should get a range of around 100
feet when it comes to battery life on
the life jacket 2 with real values I get
around 7 or 8 hours if you were to get
the life jacket 3 then battery life
should be doubled though you may wonder
boom should be good for around 9 hours
of playback but if you listen to music
with the volume cranked all the way up
then battery life will be significantly
decreased down to around 6 hours
the Sony XP 20 with the light feature
turned on and the volume set at around
70% gets a battery life around 9 hours
and the JBL 54 is the overachiever in
the group
where the world will battery life of
around 14 hours even though
advertises 12 hours hands down the debut
54 has the best battery life period and
all these speakers choice via on
microUSB cable so you don't have to
worry about any proprietary cables also
checking your battery status on the foot
for is very easy thanks to the fuel
gauge on the back in order to check your
battery status on the sony xba-4 the
phone button and it will verbally tell
your percentage to check your battery
life on the ue wonder boom you have to
double press the plus and minus button
at the same time and it will play one of
three tones lab tones means full battery
medium tone means half battery and low
tone means low battery it's not the best
system and I'm still trying to figure
out how to check the battery status on
the El tech I guess the indicator light
flashes red when the battery is level
all of these speakers are also not
afraid a little water either these
speakers can be a little wet with that
any issue the Sony XP 20 is IP x5
certified while the JBL flip for and ue1
boom or both ipx7 certified and the El
tech minion lifejacket 2 is ip67
certified basically either the flip for
youi wonder boom or else it can be
submerged underwater while the Sony can
also it's worth noting the wonder
booming l tech float while the sub
doesn't so is either of these speakers
were to make their way to the deep end
of a pool or lake you're going to have
to go dive in for the first four also
the ip67 rating on the l tech means it's
not just want to prove it's also a dirt
and sand proof so the most important
thing about a speaker is the sound
quality and all these speakers sound
different so I'm going to go from work
to best the worst sound speaker in this
group is the AL tech mini life jacket to
the soundstages narrow the hyzer tinny
and it hurts and cons and the speaker
suffers from the worst sound distortion
in the group when the ball is at high
but it has a lot of bass so that's nice
the u12 boom is the only speaker here
with 360 degree sound the cell quality
is a little shallow and of this constant
raspy and entertain is whenever it's
playing music there's a good amount of
bass to this speaker but the mids and
highs get blown out constantly whenever
you listen to this speaker it just
believes you wanting more the JBL 4 for
street sound after the front and it
sounds really good
their passive radiators on either side
of the device
is really clean and strong bass
instrument separation is good the mids
and highs are clear there's very little
tenderness to the speaker and the highs
really cause any discomfort like I said
my JBL flip Dwarfs its own exp 20 video
the sony xba-1 to flip for even though
the sony xperia has an extra bass
feature it has a little less space than
the flat floor but the Sony Xperia T has
the depth to the sound that helps put
you in the center of the music the sony
xba-1 the least amount of sound
distortion when the volume is set all
the way up but the JBL foot 4 does
manage to get a little louder all of
these speakers have an X Factor that
make them special the sony xba-1 the
front that flashes to the beat of your
music but you do sec slice battery life
but you can also turn it off as
mentioned before the ue wonder boom has
360-degree sound and it's the smallest
of the group now let's like mean the
life jacket is perhaps the most rugged
of the group and there's a mount so you
can attach to your bike and have music
while you ride but don't be fooled the
JBL fit for any one of them can both
take a beating as well and the JBL 54
has the best battery life in the group
so which is the best speaker well unless
you're going to be running over your
speaker with a dump truck the Altech
mini life jacket 2 comes in dead last in
this comparison
unless you're looking for a speaker you
can mount on your bike though you we
wonder boom is good if you're looking
for a 360-degree speaker but the battery
life is so-so in sound quality isn't the
best it's a very close call for first
place yorkers overall v 4 is the best
performing speaker here but the sony
xba-40 but since battery life isn't as
good and since the XB 20 isn't as
durable the JBL v 4 is the best speaker
so the standing here is JBL 54 in first
place a very close second for the sony
xba-4 those of you wonder boom and the
elta gets a participation award
