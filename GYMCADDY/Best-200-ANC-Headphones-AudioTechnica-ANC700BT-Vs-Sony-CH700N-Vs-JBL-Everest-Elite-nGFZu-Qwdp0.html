because they have the best active noise
cancellation on the market right now but
I know dropping 350 dollars on a pair of
anc headphones is a lot for some people
so today we're going to be comparing
three ANC headphones in the children's
and all the budget range specifically
the audio technica ath ANC 700 BT quiet
points the sony w 8 c 8 700 ends and the
JBL Everest elite 750 and C codes are
usually on sale now just so we're clear
this isn't a full review on either these
headphones I'm just trying to point out
the most important differences between
them so I can help you with your
purchase decision if you want to learn
more about either of these headphones
then watch their full reviews the audio
technica ANC 700 BT which I'm going to
be referring to as the quiet points or
the newest headphones here and currently
retail for one $99.99 the Sony 700 ends
were released around the same time as
the quiet points and also retail for one
$99.99 the JBL Everest elite or a year
old now and used to retail for two
$99.99 but they're usually on sale now
for about $230 so that's why I'm
including them in this versus video if
you want to pick either of these ANC
headphones up I'll have links in the
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel
check them out cuz you never know when
these headphones might go on sale so you
might get lucky ok first let's go over
some small but crucial details all three
of these ANC headphones used on my
careers B port for charging and they all
have an audio jack for passive listening
but only the Sony 700 ends have a 3.5
millimeter audio jack whereas the quiet
points and Everest elites have 2.5
millimeter audio jacks also only the
avarice elite comes included with a hard
shell carrying case while the quiet
points come included with a carrying
pouch and Sony's don't come with a
carrying pouch at all now let's talk
about fit because I feel it's the most
important thing to take into
consideration when choosing headphones
all three of these ANC headphones or
over ear headphones and they all have a
stainless steel headband plastic body
panels a synthetic leather on the ear
cups but the sony is are the lightest
here weighing in at 234 grams - quiet
points weigh in at 247 grams and the
JBL's are the heaviest here weighing in
at 280
but hands down I feel the quiet points
are the most comfortable headphones here
because they have very roomy ear cups
and they have the least amount of
clamping force the Sony's are also
comfortable but they are a little snug
if you have a bigger head like me the
JBL has have the same amount of clamping
force as the Sony's but since your ear
cups don't pivot as much as the Sony's
or quiet points I feel they never fit
just right they always put some pressure
on the anterior portion of my ear
also since the JBL s have so much
padding overheating is definitely an
issue with these headphones whereas the
audio Technica's don't overheat too much
and the Sony's is somewhere between the
quiet points and JBL so comfort points
has got to go to the audio Technica's
and when it comes to build quality
I feel the quiet points and Sony's are
on par with one another whereas I feel
the build quality I'm the JBL isn't the
best they crack and squeak a lot
whatever I handle them but now let's
talk about another small but important
things a second to consideration and
that's how you control a music playback
with these headphones obviously you can
play pause skip a track go back a track
and activate your voice assistant
directly from these headphones but how
do you go about it is very different on
each of these headphones the Sony's have
the best controls here thanks to a
dedicated volume rocker and a separate
switch so he can skim through your music
very quickly and easily the Everest
elite has control buttons but they can
be pretty hard to find and to tell apart
and instead of double pressing or triple
pressing the center button to skip a
track you have to press and hold the
volume up or volume down button and I
hate this because it takes forever to
skip a track but more importantly
controlling your music playback on the Y
points is near impossible
the quiet points use touch controls that
are almost ever accurate when you're
trying to escape or go back a track and
since they're on the left ear cup
instead of the right ear Cup it feels
very unnatural for me since I'm a righty
and since controlling my music playback
is so hard with the quiet points touch
controls I just naturally find myself
defaulting back to my phone now let's
talk about battery life cuz they're all
very different across the board with ANC
and Bluetooth turned on and with the
volume set at 50% the ever Saline
managed to average 17 hours to play that
time under the same circumstances the
quiet points averaged 23 hours of
playback time and the Saudis have the
best battery life here
averaging 37 hours of playback time and
with AMC turned off these guys managed
to hit 45 hours to play at that time
regarding connectivity all three of
these headphones have a 30-foot range
but the Sony's and quiet points are
using Bluetooth 4.1 while the JBL's are
using bluetooth 4.0 wireless connection
on the JBL and sony is very stable
whereas if you get a single wall between
the quiet points and your phone then
your music will start to stutter but the
JBL and sony also have very little
latency which make them good for
watching videos whereas the latency on
the quiet points is much more noticeable
so these aren't the best for watching
videos and all three of these headphones
can only be connected to one device at a
time so that's something important to
take into consideration if you're a
power user now let's talk about the
active noise cancellation on these
headphones the JBL has managed to block
out the most sound here but they do have
a considerable amount of cabin pressure
whenever I put the JBL is on I
constantly find myself trying to pop my
ears but they don't cause me any
headaches like the boss to c35 do the
anc on the sony and quiet points is
really only worth using on a bus ride
commute or in an already quiet office
because they don't really do a good job
of blocking out chatter but the anc on
either the sony or quiet points have
very little to no cabin pressure which
is good because i can go out with them
on without feeling any discomfort
when it comes to sound quality the audio
technica quiet points have a neutral
sound signature they also have the best
soundstage n instrument separation here
but they get the least loudest and max
volume the Everest elite also has a
pretty good sound stage and they have
the most bass here but if the bass
really gets going
then it'll bottom out now and then it's
not as bad as it used to be but it still
happens the mids and instrument
separation on the Sony's is very similar
to the JBL's but the Sony's don't have
nearly as much space but the Sony's bass
doesn't bottom out and they also get the
loudest here all three of these
headphones sound good but I do find
myself reaching for the quiet points
because of that soundstage but both the
Sony and JBL have an app where you can
quickly and easily adjust the EQ on
either of these headphones so if you
want you can crank the bass up to a 10
or if you want to put an emphasis on
vocalist you can bring the mids out on
either of these two headphones
unfortunately the quiet points don't
have an app so you'll have to use a
third-party app instead and through JBL
is app you can also adjust how much
ambient sound you want to pump in into
each year individually and this feature
is good because you can be aware of your
surroundings if you're walking around in
the city if you have the JBL headphones
on this feature is also found on the
1000 X + 2 but the 700 ends don't have
this feature
so if ANC is very important to you and
you have a 200 dollar budget then go
with the JBL Everest elite because they
managed to block out the most sound here
but like I mentioned earlier they do
have a considerable amount of cabin
pressure some people are able to get
used to it but I'm not one of those
people and like I mentioned earlier I
don't think that's the most comfortable
headphones here and you're also going to
be getting the worst battery life I
think the sony CH 700 n is the safe buy
here cuz they should be comfortable to
wear it's for most people their ANC gets
the job done if you're on the bus and
since they have a stupid long battery
life they're great for traveling and or
commuting but if you're mostly
interested in sound and comfort and
occasionally plan on using a and C then
the audio technica quiet points might be
more your style I think that those
sleeker looking headphones here but
remember their touch controls are not
the best
if you made it this far I guess you
