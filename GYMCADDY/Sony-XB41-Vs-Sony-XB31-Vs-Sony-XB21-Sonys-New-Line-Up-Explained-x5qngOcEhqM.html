different from their previous lineup but
in order to better compete against JBL's
line of Sony refine and toughened up
their new XP 21 XP 31 and XP 41 here are
the main improvements on Sony's new
speaker lineup as a whole and I'm going
to break down the main differences
between these three speakers so you can
decide which one is right for you
the ultra portable Sony XP 21 is the
smallest and most affordable speaker
here we tell in for $99.99 the XP 31 is
the middle child of this lineup and
currently retails for one $49.99 and
both the XP 21 and xB 31 come in 4
colorways black blue red or white the
sony xba-40 one is the Big Daddy of the
group and currently retails for - $49.99
but only comes in three colors red blue
or black if you want to pick either of
these speakers up a have a link of
description below and if you use the
link it really helps out to channel
check them out cuz sony speakers
routinely go on sale so you may get
lucky first let's go for the general
improvements found on Sony's new speaker
line-up first up is the design which I
really like God is a soft touch rubber
body industrial exposed speaker design
of the previous lineup and now the new
lineup is much sleeker and is covered in
the fabric mesh very similar to JBL
speakers the fabric mesh body of these
speakers is much more durable than the
previous software upper bodies the XB 31
and XB 41 are also rocking much better
looking light features than the ones
found on the xB 30 and xB 48 without a
doubt I feel the XB 31 and XB 41 look
much better than their older
counterparts but I don't think the
smaller xB 21 looks better than the xB
20 the new design also brings with it a
new simplified button layout the buttons
are raised and have great tactile
feedback but they can feel a little
cramped at times but after a while you
get used to the new layout and then
stony fashion you get full music
playback controls straight from the
speakers you can adjust volume play or
pause your music skip a track and go
back track on the back all three of
these speakers have a compartment that
houses there a battery button which if
you press and hold you can turn off the
light feature the WPC button which
stands for wireless party chain and an
add button for left and right stereo
mode if you have two of the same
speakers and I'll go into that in a
minute
all three of these speakers also have an
aux track on micro USB ports for
charging and the XPS 31 and xB 41 both
have a USB out so you can charge your
own devices and when it comes to the
rubber grommet it's rather easy to
remove and I'm not too worried about it
ripping off but remember to close it
properly because you don't want these
ports to get wet another improvement
found on Sony's new speaker line-up is
how durable they are now Sony's previous
speaker line-up was only IP x5 rated so
a little splash of water here and there
isn't going to be a problem but I still
wouldn't submerge them and due to
they're exposed to co.design
dirt and sand can easily get trapped
behind a metal grill Sony's new lineup
is now ip67 Raiders so this means a few
things there now dirt and dust proof
thanks to the new fabric mesh that
protects the speakers and they are now
waterproof you can submerge them and all
three of these speakers also float JBL
speakers are also just adorable but they
don't have an official dirt and dust
rating because of their exposed passive
radiators but I feel that if you took
them to the beach sand isn't really
going to be a problem another
improvement that I really like in Sony's
new speaker line-up is the way you
charge the XP 31 and XP 41 on the
previous XP 30 + XP 40 you can only
charge them with a 5 volt or 9.5 volt DC
charger so if you were going to take the
XP 30 or XP 40 to our friends house you
would have to bring the charging cable
along but now with the XP 31 you can
charge it with some micro USB cable
unfortunately it doesn't come with a
wall adapter so you're gonna have to use
your own the sony xba-40 one comes
included with a 5 volt DC charger but
you can also charge it via the micro USB
port personally i exclusively charge the
XP 41 via the micro USB port with my DJI
sparks charging cable and I love the
convenience of not having to use a DC
charger it's one less thing cluttering
my power strip and the XP 21 just like
the older XP 20 also tortures via a
micro USB port when it comes to battery
life the SB 21 advertises the battery
life of 12 hours and both the XP 31 and
xB 41 advertise a better life of 24
hours but that's when they are used at
lower volumes and what the life feature
was turned off in my testing what the
light feature turned on and with the
volume set at 80% which I feel is closer
to real-world use the X B 21 average 6
hours
the xB 31 average 9 hours and the ends
before t1 lasted all the way up
twelve hours but this wasn't until their
batteries died it was until the speakers
hit 20 percent battery cuz at that point
the speakers will interrupt the music
say please charge and they'll do only
play at a max volume of 50 percent so
you have no other option than to put
them back on the charger charge
personally I hate this feature but I
guess it's there to help you prolong the
life of your battery now when it comes
to audio quality as the name implies
these speakers are going to put an
emphasis on the bass Sony's extra bass
speaker lineup is meant for people like
me who listen to a lot of rap hip-hop
R&amp;amp;B EDM and so on but if you're someone
who listens to rock or anything that
puts an emphasis on vocals and mids then
you're gonna think these speakers sound
muddy sony's new speaker line-up sounds
very similar to the previous lineup but
if you're trying to decide between the
XP 21 XP 31 and XP 41 obviously the
larger the speaker the louder and more
bass you're going to get but for
personal listening the HP 31 gets the
job done just fine but if you want
something a little bit more epic then
the XP 41 is a genuine step up believe
it or not I actually think the older xB
20 still sounds better than the xB 21
even though I like a lot of bass when I
listen to music it can get overwhelming
when listening to podcasts Sony's new
speaker lineup doesn't have a dedicated
extra bass button like their previous
lineup but you can turn off the extra
bass feature on either the new speakers
by pressing and holding the plate and
mine is by at the same time until the
indicator light turns green and to turn
the extra bass feature back on you just
press and hold the same buttons again
until the light turns white all three of
these speakers also connects to Sony's
music center app now let me be the first
to tell you that I love the hardware but
the app can be up and about sometimes
but when it does work you can turn on
live sound which sounds much better on
the XP 31 than it does on the XP 41 we
can also just adjust the EQ of either
these speakers to better suit the type
of music you're going to listen to but
if you use your own EQ then you're going
to get a bit of distortion at higher
volumes but since I just use these
speakers with the extra bass feature
turn on and with clear Audio plus
enabled I don't get to missus tortion
Sony's music center app also allows you
to select from a few different lighting
modes on these speakers there's rave
chill or rave mode without the unknown
strobe lights off to the sides on the XP
31 and XP 41
and strobe the new light features on the
XP 41 and XP 31 have been improved from
their previous generations but I feel
the light feature on the XP 21 doesn't
look nearly as good as the xB 20s the
light feature setups on the X P 41 and
XP 30 ones are also very similar but the
XP 41 has the additional BACnet speakers
in the center the XP 41 also connects
the Sony's Fiesta lab which is an
eyesore
but you do get some customization
options on the XP 41 while the XP 31
doesn't connect to the fusible app
finally let's talk about connectivity
all three of these speakers are good for
about 50 plus feed and in general I
haven't had any connection issues period
or I do want to talk about is pairing
and syncing these speakers first yes
these newer speakers can connect to the
older speakers but only in sync anything
from the xB 20 all the way up to the XP
90 and Sony allows you to connect up to
100 Sony speakers together just like JBL
does but if you want to get left and
right stereo Sam going you need to have
two of the same speakers unfortunately I
haven't been able to get the XP 40 + XP
41 to play in stereo mode and the same
goes for the XP 21 + XP 31 pairs also
Sony second process of these speakers
isn't as easy and the connection quality
isn't as good as JBL s if you want to
learn how to pair these speakers up then
just watch my tutorial pairing multiple
Sony speakers can sometimes be a
hair-pulling process because you have to
press certain buttons in a certain order
and you also have to use the mobile app
to establish the party chain with JBL
speakers you literally just press one
button on each speaker and they'll
figure out the rest by themselves JBL
audio is also much more in sync with the
Sony's you might get some echo going but
it'll go away after a while
personally I really do think these new
Sony speakers are great but if you plan
on constantly chaining multiple speakers
together I would look into JBL instead
now this isn't a full review on either
of these speakers I'm just trying to
give you a quick rundown of what's new
in Sony's new speaker lineup if you want
to learn more about either of these
speakers then watch their full reviews
personally if I were looking to Sony's
new speaker lineup I would skip the xB
21 and go for the xB 31 I just don't
think you can go wrong with the xB 31
but if you want something with a little
better battery life something that gets
louder with more wall shaking bass and
something that looks a little cooler
then I would pick up the xB 41 I feel
p41 is worth the upgrade this time
around partially going forward I would
like to see Sony improve their software
I would like to see them start using a
USB C port allow you to cycle through
the different light Moses directly from
the speakers and I would like to start
seeing quick charging make an appearance
on either Sony or JBL speakers like just
stop jamming voice assistance everywhere
and get me some quick charging
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
