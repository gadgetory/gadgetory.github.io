their Steve Jobs theater with a
monologue from the late Steve Jobs
himself
it was truly touching but Apple's
keynote just wrapped up and there's a
lot to go through so this video is going
to be a quick rundown of what can ounce
and I'll do individual videos on each
product later this week we've got the
iPhone 10 which is spelled with a Roman
numeral X we've got the iPhone 8 in the
iPhone 8 plus the Apple watch series
three the Apple TV 4k and we even got a
sneak peek at the air power don't forget
to Like comment and subscribe and you
can watch some of my other videos here
after you don't watch this video now
let's get into this first let's go over
the most important announcement and
that's the iPhone 10 you've probably
seen this phone by now but here are the
most important details the iPhone 10 is
going to come in only two colorways
Space Gray and silver is going to come
in two storage capacities 64 gigs and
256 gigs the 64 gig model is going to
retail for 999 dollars and the 256 gig
model is going to retail for 1,000 $149
something to cook did not mention on
stage pre-orders start on October 27th
and they will start shipping out on
November 3rd but what do you get on a
thousand dollar phone from Apple you get
an iPhone with almost no bezels new face
ID which admittedly does use a whole lot
of sensors and processing power to work
properly and keep your data safe
presumably slightly better cameras on
both the front and back and a battery
life that's two hours longer than the
iPhone 7 the iPhone 10 also has a 5.8
inch super Retina display which is
supposed to look better than the retina
HD display on the new iPhone 8 a
stainless steel body with curved glass
panels on both the front and back and
overall just faster internals for faster
performance than the iPhone 8 and
speaking of the iPhone 8 Apple has
announced the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8
plus the iPhone 8 will come in three
colorways silver Space Gray and a
different shade of gold and they will
also come in 64 or 256k capacities the
64 gig iPhone 8 will retail for $699.95
and the 256 gig model will retail for
nine
$9.00 pre-orders on the iPhone 8 models
start much sooner than the iPhone 10 on
September 15th or this Friday and they
will start shipping on September 22nd
the iPhone 8 shows the same design as
the iPhone 6 in the iPhone 7 it has the
same bezels and Homeline on the front
except the iPhone 8 now has glass panels
on both the front and back just like the
iPhone 10 the glass panel back on both
iPhones means they will have wireless
charging and they're using the Qi
standard which is a good move upgrades
to the iPhone 8 are pretty standard
better screen better cameras for picture
and 25% faster than the previous model
so for your average consumer what's the
main difference between the iPhone 8 and
the iPhone 10 basically the iPhone 10
has that brand new bezel as design
better cameras faster processing power
the home button and face ID the iPhone
10 also has a slightly larger screen
coming in at five point eight inches or
the iPhone eight plus has a screen
that's coming in at five point five
inches in a body with a larger footprint
but Apple isn't being direct about
battery life from the iPhone 10 so
real-world battery life on the iPhone 10
might not be as good as the iPhone 8 but
that's just me speculating so don't kill
me down in the comments down below but
both of these phones are water and dust
resistant and they both have wireless
charging and they're both using the Qi
standard which means they will work with
the same wireless charging pads like
most other Android devices and Apple
even gave us a sneak peek at their own
wireless charging pad which can charge
multiple Apple devices at the same time
they call it the air power there was no
mention of release day but it can't
charge your iPhone Apple watch and ear
pods at the same time and speaking of
the air pods Apple will be releasing an
updated air pods with the charging case
that has wireless charging capabilities
but there was no mention of release day
for that either but it's just a minor
update for the air pods anyway the
second biggest announcement at Apple's
event today was the Apple watch TV
stream it has the same body as the Apple
watch series too and there were whole
new wristbands to choose from basically
there's an Apple watch to suit
everyone's style but there is now a
cellular and non cellular model the
easiest way to spot an Apple watch
seriously with the cellular capabilities
is that it has a red digital crown the
cellular Apple watch Series 3 will allow
you to take calls straight from your
wrist
even if you leave your iPhone at home
and you'll be able to stream your own
music starting with the non cellular
model the Apple watch Series three
starts off at $329 with the 38
millimeter aluminum case in the sport
band and the 42 millimeter aluminum case
starts at three hundred fifty nine
dollars the Apple watch Series three
with cellular capabilities with the 38
millimeter aluminum case and a sport
band starts at $399 and the 42
millimeter case starts at $449 obviously
with more premium case materials and
lands the price of the Apple watch
Series 3 will go up and they're also
going to be Apple watch series three
Nike Plus Editions with new and
exclusive wristbands pre-orders for the
Apple watch series 3 start on September
15th and they will start shipping out on
September 22nd and I just wanted to
point out the Apple watch series 1 is
still on sale starting at $249 but it
looks like the Apple watch series 2 is
now going to be retired that's a low
blow
because the Apple watch series 1 isn't
waterproof and finally does the Apple TV
4k which is an updated Apple TV that can
stream in 4k as the name implies better
also has high dynamic range aka HDR
which means better color and picture
quality it's also using the a 10x fusion
chip which is the same found in the iPad
pro it delivers two times CPU and four
times better graphic performance at the
past Apple TV and if you bought a movie
from iTunes in HD it will automatically
be upgraded to 4k obviously in order to
enjoy the new Apple TV 4k to its fullest
you need to also have a 4k TV the Apple
TV 4k will come in two storage options
32 and 64 gigs and will retail for 179
and $1.99 respectively and just like the
Apple watch in the iPhone 8 pre-order
start on September 15th and they were
going to be shipping out on September
22nd but who are we kidding the Apple TV
4k isn't going to sell out and that's a
quick rundown of Apple's keynote today
the iPhone 10 will be shipping out in
November while everything else like the
iPhone 8 iPhone 8 plus Apple watch 2 is
3 and the Apple TV 4k will be shipping
out this September 22nd don't forget to
