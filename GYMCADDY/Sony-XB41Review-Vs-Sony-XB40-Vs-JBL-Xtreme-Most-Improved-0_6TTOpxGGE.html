different beast from last year's Sony XP
40 last year if you ask them to choose
between the XP 30 and the XP 40 I would
say just get the XP 30 but now the sony
xba-40 one is a genuine step up from the
XP 31 the XP 31 is great but the XP 41
kicks it up a notch here's what's new on
the nearly perfect sony xba-40 1 the
sony xba-40 1 is the largest model in
Sony's latest Bluetooth speaker line-up
it currently retails for to $49.99 and
it comes in three colors black blue or
red the outgoing XP 40 can currently be
found for 150 bucks if you want to pick
up either of these speakers I'll have a
link in description below and if you use
the link really helps out the channel
talking about consoling speakers
routinely go on sale or you Michael
lucky the differences between the XP 41
and XP 40 are much more apparent than
the differences between the XP 30 and xB
31 the new XP 41 shares the same new
sleek design found on the XP 31 bigger
the XP 41 has a new fabric mesh covered
body that's way more adorable than the
soft touch cover body on the XP 40 like
it's really easy to scratch up that X
before you both of these speakers
feature identical light feature setups
as well a color changing light strip
strobe lights on each side and light of
speakers but the light feature on the XP
41 is much better than the one on the XP
40 it's much more detailed much more
vibrant and way easier to see in
brighter environments and I personally
really like how the light strip now
wraps around the sides of the speaker
the new X before t1 is also a little
longer and a little taller than the
older xB 40 both of these speakers have
very similar speaker setups as well dual
transducers and dual passive radiators
that shoot at the front and out the back
but the larger XP 41 has slightly
smaller 2.28 inch diameter transducers
while the XP 40 has 2.4 inch diameter
transducers the size difference is
negligible but I thought I would mention
it one of the improvements on the XP 41
that I like the most is the way you
charge it before with the XP 40 you had
to use the 9.5 volt DC input to charge
it so if you plan on taking it on the go
with you then he had to bring along the
charging cable but now with the XP 41
you have two options you can use the
included 5 volt DC charging case
or you can use a micro USB cable and
this is great because if you take the X
before they went to a friend's house and
you run out of juice you can just ask to
borrow on mic USB cable and no powerful
enough wall adapter and just like before
the XP 41 has its own USB out so you can
charge up your own phone Sony's new
speaker line-up is all about durability
Sony's previous XP 20 X P 30 and XP 40
or all IP x5 raiders so a little splash
of water here and there wouldn't be a
problem
well you should have submerge them and
due to the exposed speaker design
Santander can get behind a metal grill
the new XP 41 is now shockproof in ip67
rated so this means it's dust and dirt
proof thanks to that new fabric mesh
it's waterproof and I found this
behemoth floats battery life on the XP
41 has also been improved the XP 41 X be
40 and XP 31 all advertise a bad relief
of 24 hours but I'm the real world used
with the light feature turned on and
with the volume set at 80% I found that
these two speakers average in nine hours
playback time under the same conditions
I found that the XP 41 average is 12
hours of playback time in my testing at
least I found that there is a battery
improvement between the XP 41 and XP
40,000 it's a sound test
[Laughter]
audio quality on the XP 40 and XP 41 is
still very similar but I did find the XP
41 gets slightly louder than the XP 40
and for those who aren't familiar with
Sony's extra bass line up as the name
implies these speakers are going to put
in emphasis on the bass at the beginning
of the song you might have noticed the
vocals on the XP 40 and XP 41 didn't
sound as clear as the JBL extreme
because that won't put some emphasis on
the mids and has a lot of trouble but
when the drop came the XP 41 and XP 40
sounded much better than the JBL extreme
the X before t1 is better suited for
people like me who listen to a lot of
rap hip-hop EDM and so on but if you
listen to a lot of rock or music that
puts an emphasis on the vocals then
you're going to think these speakers
sound muddy but my biggest problem with
the XP 41 is how Sony completely missed
the mark with their news live sound
setting on the smaller XP 31 if you turn
live sound on the basis tame the bed and
the mids and vocals are pushed forward
and I feel this is a good setting for
rock but on the XP 41 for some reason
there's just a bunch of echo thrown in
and in most cases it just of sources of
music here's an additional 30 second
clip of the XP 41 and XP 31 in live
sound and the JBL extreme again
I just feel this was Sony's chance to
appeal to everyone and they blew it by
adding a whole bunch of echo into the XP
40 ones live sound Larson on the XP 31
doesn't have all of this echo and if
live sound on the XP 41 sounded similar
to the XP 30 ones then you can have all
of the bass goodness on the XP 41 and
then at the press of a button have a JBL
speaker but if you open up Sony's music
center app you can go into the sound
settings and adjust the equalizer from
there so it's not in the world but when
you use your own EQ settings then you do
give up clear Audio plus so at higher
volumes you'll start to hear some
distortion but since I listen to a lot
of rap I just keep the extra bass
feature and clear Audio plus on so I
don't get to missus torsion but with the
extra bass feature turned on I do find
the XP 41 isn't the best for listening
to podcasts so in order to turn off the
extra bass feature all you have to do is
press it want to play in - button until
the indicator light turns green and then
press and hold the same buttons again
until the indicator turns white again to
turn extra bass back on Sony's music
Center app also allows you to choose
from a few different lighting modes
there's rave chill which is my personal
favorite or wave mode without the strobe
lights and strobe there are a few others
to choose from but these ortho main for
the XP 41 also connects to Sony's
festival app and oh my god it's awful
aside from being a complete eyesore all
you can really do is just change the
color of the light strip it's better
than nothing but I wish we had more
customization options and Sony needs to
completely redesign this app Fiesta Bowl
also allows you to jam in random sounds
while your speaker is playing music last
thing on a touch on here is connectivity
the XP 40 is good for a range of about
40 feet but the XP 41
easily doubled that with directly on the
site I never really had any connection
issues with the
before they went period unfortunately
the XP 41 has a little more latency than
the XP 31 when watching video but it's
still better than the XP 40 Sony also
allows you to pair up to a 100 Sony
speakers together and sync anything from
the XP 20 all the way up to the XP 90
and the new XP 41 has no problem pairing
up to the older XP 40 if you want to
learn how to pair these speakers up then
watch my tutorial but in order to get
left and right stereo sound going you
need to have two of the same speakers
unfortunately the XP 40 and XP 41 won't
play in stereo mode like I said at the
beginning of this video the sony xba-40
one is nearly perfect I think it sounds
great for the type of music I listen to
I love that you can charger with no mic
USB cable now that added durability is a
very big plus and I really like the new
sleek design but I would improve the XP
41 by switching to mic USB port to a USB
C port I would also get rid of all of
the unnecessary echo in live sound mode
I would also like to be able to cycle
between the four main lights and is
directly from the speaker like I can on
the JBL post 3 without having to open up
the app every single time Sony's app
also did improving cuz sometimes there
are connection issues or they will just
crash but even with this flaws I still
really like the new sony xba-40 one like
I said before you can't go wrong with
the XP 31 but if you upgrade to the XP
41 you're getting more wall shaking bass
a longer battery life it's still just
adorable and you can charge it up with a
micro USB cable which i think is a very
big deal we still have to wait with the
JBL extreme to has to offer but right
now I think the sony xba-40 one is a
strong contender for this year's most
improved award if you made it this far I
guess you enjoyed the video so hit that
