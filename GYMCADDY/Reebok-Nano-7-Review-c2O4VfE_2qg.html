Nike have all the attention after
releasing from a concrete Reebok has
dropped their new CrossFit shoes
the Reebok 907 is vastly different from
last two Nano 6.0 but those Reebok has
been working on their nanos shoes since
2011 I think they know what you're doing
so should you pick these up let's find
out Reebok has released the new nano 7
and 3 colorways white black and blue and
black and orange with a hint of lime you
can pick up the new nano 7 directly from
we thought for one $29.99 with free
shipping and if you want to save a
little money you can pick up the nano
6.0 for 109 99 links or both are in the
description below
unlike the Nike make on 3 which was
slightly designed from the MEC on to the
Reebok Nano 7 is a complete redesign
from last year's Reebok manual 6.0 the
outer limits alone nano 7 have been
completely redesigned the grip on the
shoes are out of this world and they
practically stick to the ground like
spider-man the top of the outsole is
designed to give you extra traction when
you're pushing off the ground pull up
when you're sprinting or pushing flat
the middle section of the outsole
features a vertical grip so that it can
help you when your rope climbing there's
also a little rubber on the lateral
portion of the shoe to help you while
you're climbing as well but it's very
subtle the midsole only shoes is a
little stiff and we did at first but
after some breaking in they do loosen up
these shoes perform ok for sprinting and
running but they really shine when it
comes to deadlift squats and power clean
these shoes also have a very stiff heel
which sell for a good amount of
stability when it comes to heavier
squats stability comparable to the
adidas Eddie Conway lifting shoe moving
up the shoe we've got the TPU heel wrap
this heel cup does an extraordinary job
of keeping your heel in place when you
wear these shoes you sure won't move at
a place when you're running and this
heel really helps with the support for
those asked to grant squats perhaps the
biggest surface between the Nano 6.0 and
the Nano 7 is the new upper the Nano 7th
upper is comprised of two layers first
is a mesh liner which helps with the
flexibility of breathability the second
layer is Reebok new nano weed the Nano
ease is extremely durable and helps keep
the whole shoe together so you can rub
the upper on these shoes on almost any
surface and not have to worry about them
getting worn out or torn the Nano 7 also
have a very comfortable tongue that's
both padded and flexible long periods of
wear doesn't cause any discomfort on the
instep of the foot these shoes also have
some great quality shoe laces that don't
come undone
working out like other shoes the Nano
seven still feature that extra patch of
grip tape on the medial portion of the
shoe to help you with rope clubbing but
I did notice though the grip tape on the
Nano 7 wasn't as sticky or rough as the
Nano 6.0 and as you'd expect the Nano 7
still feature that standard four
millimeter heel job so how do they say
you might be asking well they are pretty
narrow
they run true-to-size lengthwise but
they were very narrow in the toe box
I thought breaking them in would help
but they've remained just as nowt as
when I got them this could be due to the
new nano weave although breathable and
durable it really doesn't flex that much
so what's the verdict on the new Reebok
Nano 7 they're great classic suit AAP
has narrow feet the new also offers a
high man rip the trip pattern design is
very well thought out and the mixer also
gives you a lot of stability when doing
heavy lips the new nano we've also helps
with the breathability and durability of
the shoe the new TPU clip also keeps the
shoe in place at all times the Nano 7 do
fall short when it comes running and or
overall fit if you have a wider foot
then your best bet is to pick up the
Reebok manager to turn up my advice the
Reebok is to work on the flexibility of
the manual weave on the side of the shoe
and play with the little system stores
