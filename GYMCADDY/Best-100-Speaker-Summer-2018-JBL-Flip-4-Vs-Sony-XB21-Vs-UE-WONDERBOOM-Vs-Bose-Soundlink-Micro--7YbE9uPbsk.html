means cookouts hikes and get-togethers
with your friends and having a portable
speaker with you can really come in
handy so today we're gonna compare some
of the best and most rugged hundred
dollar speakers for summer 2018
specifically the JBL is the 4x speed 21
bose soundlink micro and the ue wonder
boom just so we're clear this isn't a
full review on the eve of these speakers
I'm just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with your purchase decision
if you want to learn more about either
these speakers then watch their full
reviews all of these Bluetooth speakers
retail for $99.99 but the newest speaker
here is the sony xba-1 which was
released a few weeks ago followed by the
bose sound like micro and both the JBL
flip 4 and ue wonder boom are now both a
little over a year old now if you want
to pick either of these speakers up I'll
have links of description below and if
you use the links it really helps out
the channel I suggest you check them out
cuz these speakers routinely go on sale
so you might get lucky first let's get
the simple stuff out of the way first
all for these speakers choice via on my
curious B port I know it sucks but only
the xB 21 and JBL flip 4 have an aux
jack for Wired listening while both the
Wonder boom and sound like micro can
only play music wirelessly but since
having an audio jack on the phone these
days is considered a feature now I don't
think it's a big deal for smaller
speakers like these all four of these
speakers are also super rugged so
they'll be able to keep up with you no
matter where you take them the bose
sound like micro you you wonder boom and
JBL for four or all ipx7 rated while the
sony xba-1 is ip67 rated which means
it's technically dust proof as well but
you should have no problem with either
of these speakers if you get them a
little wet or if you take them to the
beach just be mindful of the flip 4's
exposed radiators and you'll be fine now
let's talk about battery life if you're
out with your friends you're probably
gonna want to listen to your music a
little louder than you normally would by
yourself so with the volume set at 80%
the Bose Soundlink micro has the
shortest battery life here averaging
just we have it
that time the ue a wonderful average is
four and a half hours of playback time
and the sony xba-1 Everage is six hours
of playback time with the life feature
turned on but the JBL before has the
longest battery life here averaging
seven hours to play that time when it
comes to speaker setup things start to
get very interesting first let's start
off with the smaller speaker here which
is the bose sound like micro there's a
single upwards firing transducer and
dual passive radiators all has beneath
the perforated portion of the microsoft
touch rubber skin the JBL flip 4 has
dual 40 millimeter transducers that
shoot out the front and dual passive
radiators that shoot out the sides to so
many XP 21 has slightly larger 41
millimeter transducers that also shoot
out the front and dual passive radiators
that shoot out the front and back and
then there's the ue wonder boom which
also has 40 millimeter transducers into
a passive radiators but they're set up
in a way which makes the one boom the
only 360-degree speaker here the seasons
turnin changes thank you mine but the
sun gives it into the morning to night
time continues marching it slowly crawls
when it comes to sound quality's sexy
speakers have very similar transducer
sizes they sound very similar for the
most part so the main things we're going
to focus on here is punch anger base
distortion and loudness unfortunately I
found out the one the boom has the least
punt in space compared to these other
speakers and it does suffer from a
considerable amount of distortion and
max volume despite its size the micro
actually has a little more bass in the
one two boom and suffers from a little
less distortion and max volume v four
has the same amount of bass as the micro
and manages to keep sound distortion and
max volume to a minimum to so many XP 21
suffers from the same amount of
distortion and max volume as the flat 4
but has the most punch in his bass here
and it's not surprising because that's
what the XP stands for extra base but
the mids don't sound as clear as the
mids on the flat 4 but when it comes to
loudness the sound like micro is the
quite a speaker here at max volume the
Wonder boom is the loudest speaker here
at max volume followed closely by the
flat 4 and xB 21 but since the 1 the
boom suffers from a considerable amount
of distortion and max volume
I actually feel the flip four sounds the
best here at max volume but now let's
talk about pairing these speakers up
with other speakers the one of them can
only be paired up to one other wonder
boom whereas with the Bose or Sony you
can pair them up to a few other speakers
of the same and Meghan you can also mix
and match different sized speakers as
well now this also works with the JBL
flip four but JBL's connect plus is the
easiest to get set up here
you're literally pressed one button on
each speaker and the speaker's will
figure out the rest by themselves
whereas with the Bose or Sony you have
to open up an app and follow a few more
steps if you plan on regularly pairing
multiple speakers together and jvo is
the way to go but each of these speakers
also have their own special features to
take into consideration like I just
mentioned the flip 4 has the easiest and
best method for pairing other JBL
connect plus enable speakers whereas
pairing multiple Sony speakers together
is a lot harder and the connection isn't
as stable but the Sonia also has a
pretty useful
we can easily adjust czq and that's an
action there's a life feature on the fun
it's not the best life feature but it's
something since the one the boom is a
360-degree speaker it does a better job
of evenly dispersing music and the boss
sound like micro has this little strap
on the back so he can easily attach it
to your backpack a chair leg and
umbrella or whatever but if we take
everything into consideration I feel the
best hundred dollar speaker here is
still the JBL flip 4 because it has the
best battery life and overall sound
quality the XP 21 is a close second
because it also has a really good real
toll the battery life and you can also
very easily adjust this EQ but it's lack
of clarity does take a few points off
the one the boom for the most part is
pretty good but it's shorter wield world
battery life doesn't really make it the
best if you plan on taking it out a lot
cuz I highly doubt you're going to want
to have to charge it back up if you're
at the beach or if you're out with your
friends even though I really like the
bose sound like micro it's really worth
getting for personal listening cuz it
doesn't get super loud compared to these
other speakers and since it has the
shortest battery life here it's not
really the best to take on longer
outings
