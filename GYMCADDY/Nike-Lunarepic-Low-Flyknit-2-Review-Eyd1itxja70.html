epic low-flying in a few weeks ago and
today we've got the newer version that
dropped a few days ago the lunar epic
loaf line is - just like what adidas has
done with their ultra boost Nikes not
one of their most comfortable shoes
revised the upper little and made a new
shoe so how does it compare let's find
out
first up is the price the luma epic low
slightly to retail for one hundred and
sixty dollars which is twenty dollars
cheaper than the ultra boost 3.0 for
that price you're getting a very
comparable shoe and saving twin bucks
they also come in five colorways
personally I really like those green
ones but comment below and let me know
which color weight you like that you can
pick up these guys or west finish line
and get free shipping like for this is
in the description below the difference
between the original luna epic loaf line
it and the luna epic low flame is to try
saying that two times ten is the
construction of the upper this is now a
one solid piece bootie construction
which is very similar to the ultra the
one-piece bootie construction fixes the
biggest issue the original lunar epic
had which was a constantly shifting
tongue the bootie construction also
essentially needs to shoe a slip on and
you don't have to tie your laces if
you're wearing them casually
but when you do tighten these shoes
lockdown is amazing thanks to nike
flywire system if you don't know already
fly wire is specific to nike and
essentially wraps around the upper of
the shoe and helps give you a snug fit
the op√©ra of the shoe is also very
breathable in light because of the fly
net as the name implies climate is a
mint material very similar to adidas
it's prime it but since Nike Flyknit
isn't as stretchy as adidas is prime it
your feet feel more secure in the lunar
epic low climate - when you run enough
the heel counter on the lunar epic loaf
line is - has also been revised from the
original they now have a fuse overlay
which makes it a little stiffer and
keeps your heel in place better when you
wear them also on the back of the heel
character there's a little hit of 3m so
people at night continue if you like to
run at night inside the shoes is an
ortho light insole and honestly it's
pretty flimsy and cheap i think mike you
should have dropped in a bettering tool
when you get the nike lunar epic loaf
limit or the nike lunar loaf liner to
you still get the same midsole which
honestly is probably the main reason why
you would get these shoes first up
there's no proper Alex along issues
those traction is okay effect they
perform best when they're on paper the
missile is made up of two different
materials the outer or white
later if you're saying the foam and the
green portion of the shoe is the actual
Lunarlon Lunarlon isn't as soft as
adidas ultra boost material with my
ninjutsu if you're looking for something
a little stiffer to run it there are
some people like myself that absolutely
love boots but there are some other
people that don't like it as much
because they feel like it's too squishy
on the side of the shoe you will also
notice these grooves and that's there to
give the foam layer a little more
compressibility to keep up with the
lunar lock and on the bottom of the shoe
you will see my keys flex clock system
if there's one thing Nike is good at its
engineering the super stylized outsole
the Flex lock system is very unique and
you notice that the moment you put on
these shoes the Flex pods or placed
strategically on the shoe so that they
can absorb as much energy as you can
when you want wellfare rewarding I have
heard that gravel insult like to get wet
in between the grooves of the Flex spot
clubbing them to leave a trail of the
breeze when they eventually fall out the
Lunarlon
and flex pod system give the luma epic a
very unique feel when you put them on
and you can really feel the Morgan when
you go out for one Indy when it comes to
fit the luma epic you feel exactly the
same as yours in a luna epic if you do
decide to pick up a pair of these shoes
will be just fine going through the side
overall Nike did a great job of getting
a great shoe and revising it to make an
amazing shoe the only complaint I have
about the luna epic two is the salt and
gravel getting wet into the flexpod
group and the tree pencil but other than
that they have a very clean silhouette
that can be worn as a lifestyle shoe and
if you do want to wear these while
running the flower system really gives
you the lockdown you're looking for
something the ultra boost cage can't
really do as well they're lightweight
and reasonable things to fly mitt but in
short there are great alternatives to
the ultra booth hey if you made it this
