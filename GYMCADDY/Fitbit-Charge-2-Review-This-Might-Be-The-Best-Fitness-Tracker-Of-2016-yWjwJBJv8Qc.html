something right since these are all the
range as the name implies this is the
second version of Fitbit charge model
and man did they step up their game
after spending a few weeks with the
Fitbit charge - it's easy to say this is
the best fitness tracker on the market
and has certainly raised the bar for the
rest of the competition let's find out
what makes this fitness tracker so great
for one forty nine ninety five or one
seventy nine ninety five depending on
the color you get you're getting a
stylish activity and sleep tracker with
an integrated risk mounted heartrate
monitor
opening the box is easy and inside
you'll find a charge to itself some
documentation you'll probably never read
in a charging cradle that's rather
reminiscent to a predator without his or
her mask it's important to note that
when choosing your charts - you must
select the right size wristband unlike
the Fitbit flex - the charge - only
brings one wristband don't worry you can
still switch out the wristband you can
even get classy leather wristbands that
look great if you work in an office the
stop wristband that comes included with
your charge - is made out of silicone
with a soft touch filtering and a
textured design on it the casing itself
is made of aluminum a tunnel assuming
his glass the charge - overall is an
exceptionally well crafted product all
the panels are flush the wristband
itself doesn't wiggle where it
interlocks with the main case the
sidebar in the stationary and has a
satisfying click to it and the screen
itself is easy to read and it's right
enough to be seen in any condition just
keep in mind this is not a traditional
touch screen unlike modern touch screens
that rely on the connectivity of your
fingerprint to read inputs the screen
reacts when forced from the tap is
applied this method of touch screen is
useful because you'll still be able to
interact with the Fitbit charge - even
if it's covered in sweat during your
workout at a glance the charge - screen
will told you the time date distance
walked calories burned flights climbed
in active minutes by pressing the side
when you are sent to the heart rate
monitor screen if you press the side
button again you will then be sent over
to the workout screen here you can tap
the screen and select from a variety of
workouts and when you see the one you
are about to do you can press and hold
the side by and again and the charge
tool will start tracking set workout the
charge to can automatically detect and
start tracking your workouts but we
found that for better accuracy you
should initiate it yourself if you press
the side button again you will then be
sent to the stop which screen and if you
press the side button one last time you
will be sent to the breeze
in session screen we think sessions are
designed to help you slow down and relax
by focusing on your breathing you can
set the default sessions to be either 2
or 5 minutes long
the Fitbit itself will guide you through
your breathing and tell you when to
inhale and exhale after doing the
sessions a few times I did find them to
be useful and helped me calm down and
relax now keep in mind the Fitbit charge
2 is not waterproof so you can't take it
swimming like the Fitbit flex 2 it is
splash resistant though which means you
can get it a little wet like when you're
washing your hands or something but you
better not submerge this guy Fitbit also
advertises is a five day battery life
for the charge too but honestly it's
more like four days the relatively short
battery life is just to the heart rate
monitor being on 24/7 aside from being
able to track your calories burn steps
taken flights climb distance walked in
minutes active discharge to can also
track your sleep through the Fitbit app
you'll be able to see the quality of
your sleep times when you were Restless
the night before and how many times you
woke up having data like this can be
very useful when you're trying to
improve your sleep quality so you can be
more productive the next day you can
even set the Fitbit charge to to wake
you up at the best time when you're out
of REM sleep with its silent alarm
unfortunately I found the vibration from
the wristband wasn't enough to wake me
up so if you do decide to use a silent
alarm have a backup set just in case
speaking about the Fitbit app we've said
it before and we'll say it again Fitbit
has the best fitness tracking app on the
market when buying a fitness tracker
you're not just buying the hardware
you're also buying in to be included
mobile app Fitbit does a great job of
laying out all of the necessary
information right in front of you it's
easy to read and understand and if you
want more detailed information about
your stats Fitbit has you covered
the Fitbit mobile app also does a great
job of keeping users motivated through
challenges to beat and medals to earn
you can even see how you stack up
against your friends after testing the
heart rate monitor against an EKG
machine we found it to be very accurate
for heart rates between 60 ppm and 130
BPM it wasn't until we got into the
higher B PM's like in the 150 and 190
range that we saw the accuracy fall if
you're an athlete that constantly walks
out in the Haier BPM range then you
still need to wear a chest strap heart
rate monitor also if you're a runner
that's interested in the charge - it's
important to understand that this guy
doesn't have a built-in GPS like the
what series to so if you want to map out
your runs you'll still need to carry
your phone with you which will be okay
for some and a problem for others if
you're buying a Fitbit charge too it's
because you want an accurate fitness
tracker and that's so much a SmartWatch
that being said the Fitbit charge 2 can
also show you notifications when you
receive a text message or have an
incoming call it can even give you a
small preview thanks to the screen
unlike the flex 2 it's not much but it
certainly helped in conclusion the
Fitbit charge 2 is a favorite fitness
tracker here at gym caddy it's
exceptionally well made powerful and
stylish were just one 49.95 the Fitbit
charge 2 is great if you're into running
aerobic exercising yoga bike riding
CrossFit or moderate weight lifting the
Fitbit charge 2 is in so great if you're
really into bodybuilding or powerlifting
so as you can't wear it while you wear
wrist wraps or Restrepo so you can track
your workout but if you're looking for
something that can check your calories
burn steps taken track your sleep and
keep you motivated in a sleek package
then the charge 2 is for you well if you
made it this far and leave us a like it
