shiny new phone is considered a feature
versus five years ago where it was just
pretty standard and even though we're
obviously going towards a wireless
future some people still prefer to have
a wired connection and there are still
some advantages to using a wired
connection and whether you know it or
not your iPhone could be holding back
your shiny new headphones compared to an
Android device but is buying a hundred
and $1.00 headphone cable worth it it's
a little more complicated than that this
video is gonna be a little different
compared to my other videos I'm gonna be
showcasing the v-moda speakeasy DAC app
lightning cable because it does
everything that is supposed to do very
well I'm gonna be pointing out the
performance improvements I've noticed
when using my headphones with an Android
device versus an iPhone and I also want
to point out a few concerns I have about
headphones that are being released and
how I would like manufacturers to
address them when I first got to Sony
1000x and threes I was very excited
because almost everything about them was
improved even the carrying case and
charging cable but unfortunately the
audio cable that came included with the
1000x and threes was a significant
downgrade from the audio cable that came
included with the sony 1000 xm2 and sony
isn't the only company including crappy
audio cables with their headphones
almost every company is doing it even
when you sell out hundreds of dollars on
a pair of headphones and I think
companies are starting to skimp out on
their audio cables because less and less
phones are coming included with audio
jacks even the new iPhone 10s doesn't
even come included with a headphone
dongle anymore and right now the
majority of people who still insist on
using a wired connection or either audio
files or content creators but I still
think normal consumers would appreciate
a higher quality audio cable especially
those who fly a lot and will like to
watch an in-flight movie using their own
headphones so v-moda speakeasy lightning
cable is definitely a step up build
quality wise compared to the audio
cables that currently come included with
most headphones it's a fifty three inch
long braided cable with an inline
controller that has very tactile buttons
and then line mic and will work with any
pair of headphones that has eight people
in
are you jack just keep in mind if you
have something from Bose or Sennheiser
they're not gonna work because they have
2.5 min though are you Jax and the
speakeasy can only plug into an iPhone
or iPad through the Lightning port via
motors hunter all the cable also has a
built-in DAC and amp and to keep it
simple you the end-user are going to
notice your headphones are going to get
significantly louder and your music is
gonna sound a little better you'll
notice a little more detail in the mids
and the bass is going to get a little
punchy but don't expect your music to
start sounding amazing all of a sudden
just because you're using a wire with a
built-in deck and amp if you're
streaming your music like the majority
of people do these days
chances are you're listening to lesser
quality versions of your music and if
you have crappy headphones there's only
so much there's why I can do but after
reviewing multiple headphones I noticed
latency when watching videos on an
iPhone tends to vary from headphone to
headphone and from app to app some
headphones like the Sony 1000 X and
three's have very little latency where
some people can just ignore it whereas
some other headphones just have way too
much latency which I deem unacceptable
for watching videos and that's why I've
made it a habit to point out Lee and C
in my videos but obviously using a wired
connection with your iPhone means no
latency ever so this is where the
benefits of using your headphones with
an Android device come to blame I've
noticed that the latency found on an
iPhone when watching videos just isn't
present when watching videos on an
Android device and for me zero latency
is a big deal in watching videos because
even if there was a half second delay it
could be a little distracting using an
Android device with your headphones you
also means you get access to app decks
and now tech support but like an app
tech support doesn't matter if again
you're streaming your music from Spotify
Apple music or YouTube app tax or el
deck really only matters to you if
you're listening to high res music files
that you've stored locally on your
device which I bet the majority of
people watching this don't like I
mentioned in a previous video something
I want to see headphone manufacturers
improve on in 2019 there's the mic
quality on their headphones
even though the mic on the 1000x m3 is
better than the mic found on the 1000x
m2 it could still be better like I
mentioned earlier the speaking
he does have a built-in mic and if
you're somebody who likes to take phone
calls on a regular basis with their
headphones then it could be a good
solution but in general I still want to
see headphone manufacturers and prove
the microphone on their headphones in
2019 but overall is a hundred all the
cable for your headphones worth it well
it is a little weird because phone
manufacturers especially Apple or trying
to wean us off the audio jack and push
us towards a wireless future and for the
most part I don't miss the audio jack
when using my headphones with the pixel
three because of the very low latency
across the board but with Apple I do
find myself using that wired connection
depending on the content I'm going to
watch I just want Apple to do better and
I want manufacturers to do better when
it comes to their included audio cables
and built-in mics on their headphones
but if you're a normal consumer that
just streams their music then you're not
really going to get the most bang for
your buck from V Motors new cable but if
you're an audiophile with a full set up
at home then this cable could be a
convenient option for your daily
commutes to hold you over if you made it
this far
