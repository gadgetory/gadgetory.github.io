might be considering the repopulation
solicited or natural Millea briefs
although the issues are very different
from one another we don't share one
major thing in common and that's the
point
those shoes retails for two hundred
dollars so you definitely want to make
sure you get the right one for you three
bucks legacy list is coming to colorways
and you can pick them up from Reebok
site with free shipping liquid in the
description below if you start picking
up the Nike on the other hand come in
four different colorways and it seems
the red ones are the most popular ones
Cubs are hard to get holder when it
comes to weightlifting shoes you're
looking for a future component you'll
hike stability grip and flexibility in
the toolbox carry the micro Vario three
have a standard skill that is very
similar to someone sounder warmer - cool
a which is a very power Nike feel is a
honeycomb structure and it's very
lightweight and gets the job done the
heel on the Reebok legacy lift there is
a whole of your story it's one solid
piece weighs a lot and has a much
steeper Hill job done like if you left
it seemed to have a twenty two
millimeter heel drop but after a few
minutes of wearing the shoe you get used
to it
I didn't notice getting out of the hole
in my answer grand squad was a lot
easier in the legacy then in the world
Malaya's could it be a direct result of
the heel job maybe now when it comes to
grip the Reebok legacy listed are far
superior
they're out shoulder stickers on the
Roma Leo's the way by legacies also have
a larger footprint and inoculum allows
which results in feeling much more
planet to the ground when I built my
lips the Roma Lael is however are much
more flexible in the toe box area and
lightweight than the legacy lifters
which make them better if you do a more
Olympic list than powerlifting
construction of materials are also they
factor for both of these shoes overall
the Nike Roma leaders are better
constructed compared to the legacy
lifted the Reebok legacy lift there have
a lot of glue marks in the heel area of
the shoe which is just unacceptable for
the price point but overall the Reebok
legacy utilizes higher quality materials
on the upper of the shoe compared to the
Roma lados reebok uses a good quality
leather with texture patterns metal
clasp and a much more plush and
breathable mesh while nike opted in for
synthetic leathers dinner mesh a seat by
looking the torso straps plastic glass
stiffer padding in the heel counter and
the flimsy tongue if you're looking for
build quality than the legacy are few
the nike familiar 3 should be priced at
150 with the materials they used in my
opinion another big factor to consider
is fit both the Roma Leo's and legacy
run true-to-size
lengthwise but when it comes to with the
rebound legacy are much
overall while the rural areas are very
narrow especially in the Medford area
but thanks to repot double metatarsal
strap system and lacing you can
literally customize exactly how they fit
on your feet which is great because when
I squat I like a tighter shoe but when I
do jerks and cleans I prefer to have a
looser fit on the other hand nike only
has one middle toe strap on the shoe but
since their shoe is so narrow there's
really no need for it honestly when it
comes between the Reebok legacy and the
Nike Vermilya bridge I have to say the
legacy left there is the bed of the to
the Nike row Millea just have too many
quirks that prevent me from recommending
them no matter how much you adjust them
the Romeo's allow you heel to slip the
tongue of the Roma leo is also just
flimsy and offer no padding so when you
tie them all that pressure goes to your
step making Pro Longwear intolerable
instead of having metal clasps for the
strap they switch them out for cheap
plastic instead of using leather like
they did with the world melon or - they
went with a synthetic leather and mesh
which bring prolong durability into
question and they also got rid of the
two metal torso straps from the world
Molino - which means you can't adjust
the fit the nike Romo little three or
more of a step back instead of a step
forward from the Roman layers here so
yes I recommend the result like this
deal if they're over the maximum limit
they said sever they feel more stable
here built with better products cereals
and to customize the fit but I know for
some people getting into the 22
millimeter new job can be hard so if you
need a more conventional feeling
weightlifting shoes and get the idea -
the added power or even the 102 but if
you want to try something new then
that's when we give the Roboto like a
future hey if you made it this far I
