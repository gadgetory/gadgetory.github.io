the corner which means a lot of people
are going to start going out on vacation
and for the most part that means you're
going to be traveling for an extended
period of time
from personal experience having the
right pair of earphones can make a long
plane or train ride much more bearable
and today we've got the bose qc25 for
review for the most part the bose qc25
is a wireless version of the bose qc25
with the rechargeable battery the bose
QC 35 currently retail for 349 and comes
in two colors if you want to save 50
dollars and you don't really care for
wireless earphones then you can pick up
the qc25 for $300 link to pick both of
these up from Amazon is in the
description below as always let's jump
into the unboxing unboxing these
headphones is very simple when you lift
the lid you'll see a QuickStart guide on
the back under that you'll find the
included carrying case more on the case
itself in a few inside the cases where
you'll find the actual headphones and
under the headphones you'll find a mess
of documents and warranty information
included inside the case is also a
headphone cable and a micro USB cable
first impressions when actually grabbing
the headphones is just wow wow they are
so incredibly lightweight the body
itself is made mostly out of metal all
of the articulation points twist and
Bend so smoothly the headband is very
well padded and bends without any issues
the padding on the leather cuffs is so
soft and keeps cool even after extended
listening periods I also like how the
inside of the ear cups have a large L
and R on them so that you put on these
earphones the right way every time these
earphones are over the ear earphones and
are extremely comfortable to wear since
they're so lightweight the headband is
so flexible that ear cups are so soft
and keep cool and they don't crush your
ears there's no irritation or
overheating after all while there are
also blinds on the right ear cups we can
adjust your volume control music
playback pause and play your music
except and then calls and even activate
Siri they're also very tactile and very
easy to tell apart by just touch by far
these are the most comfortable ear
phones I have ever worn spec wise these
Wiley's your phone's pair of ear your
standard bluetooth so both Apple and
Android devices won't have any issues
connected they have a pretty good range
to them and signal can go through
multiple walls they also have an NFC
chip so if you have an end
device you can pair these earphones by
just tapping them there's also an app
you can download but it really doesn't
do much the Bose QuietComfort 35 are
also noise cancelling earphones that
block out ambient noise and the haters
honestly when you put these guys on
you're in your own little bubble noise
cancellation is perhaps the best thing
Bose does and it's something you want to
have when you're on a plane battery life
from the QC 35 is 20 hours and
unfortunately there's no quick charging
feature I can make do with the 20 hour
battery life but these days quick
charging is a must these your phone's
choice via the micro USB cable that came
included in the box if you want to use
the bose qc25 with a wide connection
because you want to save battery life on
your earphones or phone or you just want
a slightly better sound quality then you
can just use the included headphone
cable just keep in mind that when using
the QC 35 with a wide connection means
there won't be any noise cancellation
sound quality on the bose qc25 is okay
they aren't overly bass heavy like Beats
products but they do leave something to
be desired the mids and highs is really
where these headphones perform best the
soundstage can be a little narrower at
times if you want to get the most out of
these earphones then you'll really want
to use an equalizer the carrying case
you get with these headphones is also
just as nice as the headphones
themselves they also have a pocket on
the inside where you can store your
cables and even your headphone jack to
lightning adapter if you have an iPhone
7 both also throws in an extra adapter
so you can use these headphones with
those weird two prong jacks you find on
airplanes the case itself is extremely
sturdy and you don't have to worry about
your headphones we got a crush if you
leave them in your backpack or in your
carry-on luggage
also there's a little tab on the inside
of the case itself that shows you
exactly how the headphones are supposed
to fit which i think is a little funny
because I know there are some people out
there that won't be able to figure it
out overall the bose qc25 is a pretty
solid product sure they're little pricey
at $350 but you're getting a very high
quality product that's made out of
mostly metal is super lightweight and
comfortable to wear also don't forget
these are perhaps the best noise
cancelling headphones on the market just
remember they orange sweat or water
resistant so you want to take it easy on
these guys but overall these are my
favorite earphones for when I'm
traveling or commuting into the city hey
