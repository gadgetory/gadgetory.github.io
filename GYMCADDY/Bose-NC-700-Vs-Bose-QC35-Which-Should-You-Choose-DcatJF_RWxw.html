the new Bose NC 700’s but the Bose QC35
series 2 aren’t going anywhere.
Actually the Bose QC35’s got a secret hardware
refresh last fall so that they can support
Bose AR just like the NC 700’s.
Now personally I think Bose AR is still very
much in its infancy as of summer 2019 and
it's one of those features you play around
with for 20 minutes and then forget about.
But if you’re thinking about picking up
a pair of Bose Headphones you maybe very well
trying to decided picking between the alien
looking NC 700’s or the tried and tested
QC35’s.
So here are the main differences between these
two headphones.
For starters, yes we gotta talk about the
price cause the NC 700’s retail for $400
where as the QC35’s retail for $350.
So you’re probably wondering if its worth
spending the extra 50 bucks.
If you want to pick up either of these headphones
they’ll be linked down below, and if you
want to learn more about either of these headphones
please watch their full reviews.
Now the NC 700’s have a radically different
design from the Bose QC35’s.
Personally I don’t mind how the NC 700’s
look but I do prefer the QC35’s body for
a few objective reasons.
First off the headband on the Bose QC35’s
have less of a rounding effect than the headband
on the NC 700’s… and the Bose QC35’s
can be collapsed smaller than the NC 700’s
meaning that their carrying case is slightly
smaller as well.
And personally I think that if you plan on
flying or commuting a lot with your headphones
having the smallest possible carrying case
just makes life a little easier.
But also I do find the QC35’s body is more
rugged and durable than the NC 700’s which
again is something you’ll might want to
consider if you plan on traveling a lot with
these headphones.
And when it comes to fit, personally I also
prefer the QC35’s.
Now both of these headphones have Bose’s
trademark super spacious ear cups meaning
that they’re both going to be able to accommodate
most ear types.
But the Bose QC35’s are more comfortable
to wear than the NC 700’s because of how
they rest on your head and because of their
reduced clamping force.
The NC 700’s are fairly comfortable in their
own right, but they do have considerably more
clamping force.
I can wear these headphones for long periods
of time but I constantly have to adjust them
and never forget they’re there like the
QC35’s.
So to be on the safe side I don’t think
the NC 700’s are big head approved.
Plainly said if you’re looking for maximum
comfort the Bose QC35’s are still the most
comfortable headphones on the market.
Now when it comes to tech specs the NC 700’s
charge via a USB C port where as the QC35’s
charge via a Micro USB port.
Now if you’re an android user the NC 700’s
charging via a Usb C port is great cause this
way you can charge your phone and headphones
with the same cable.
But if you’re an iPhone user then I doesn’t
really matter then it doesn’t really matter
what port either of these headphones use cause
you’re still going to have to use different
cables to charge your phone and headphones.
But the advantage of having a USB C port on
the NC 700’s means you’re going to get
slightly better fast charging than on the
QC35’s.
If you plug the NC 700’s in for fifteen
minutes they’re going to get you 3 and half
hours of play back time where as the QC35’s
are only going to get you two and half hours
of playback time from that same 15 minute
charge.
And when it comes to overall battery life
performance thats really the only difference
cause both of these headphones only have a
20 hour battery life which is a little below
average for premium ANC headphones in 2019.
But thankfully both of these headphones can
be connected to 2 devices at the same time
which means you can easily hot swap from one
device to another.
And this is still a big deal in 2019 cause
simultaneous multi device connectivity still
isn’t a standard feature on all headphones.
But when it comes to audio codecs both of
these headphones only support AAC and SBC,
there’s no APTX support on either of these.
But now lets talk about the active noise cancelation
on these headphones.
Like I’ve said in the past I’ve never
really like the ANC on the QC35’s cause
to me they have a lot of cabin pressure which
make them very uncomfortable for me and sometimes
lead to headaches.
Now this may not be the case for everyone
but it is the case for me and a good chunk
of other people.
But the active noise cancelation on the NC
700’s have significantly less cabin pressure
than the QC35’s and I can actually use it
this time around.
And over all the active noise cancelation
on the NC 700’s does perform slightly better
than the QC35’s.
But so that you can see for yourself we’re
going to jump into an ANC test.
Like you may have just seen… in general
both of these headphones block out roughly
the same amount of noise across the board
but the NC 700’s do manage to block out
a little more.
Its not a noticeably huge difference, but
for all intents and purposes the main difference
between the ANC on these headphones is the
reduction of cabin pressure found on the NC
700’s.
But a feature the NC 700’s have that the
QC35’s don’t is an ambient mode.
Through Bose’s app you can go in and select
how much noise you want your headphones to
pump in.
And having an ambient mode is great cause
this way you can still be aware of your surroundings
when you’re walking around the city or you
can do what I do and have ambient mode turned
on when watching movies with your headphones
so that if someone calls your name you can
still hear them.
Now the NC 700’s ambient mode is different
from just being able to choose between having
the QC35’s ANC level set to High, Low or
Off cause the NC 700’s are actually picking
up ambient sound with their microphones and
playing that through the headphones.
So having the ambient mode on the NC 700’s
set to its highest level is kind of like having
open back headphones in the sense that you
can clearly hear everything around you.
But the NC 700’s also have a conversation
mode where if you press and hold on their
ANC button they’ll automatically pause your
music and pump in all of the ambient sound
so this way you can quickly talk to someone
without having to take your headphones off.
Personally I think that this is a very neat
feature to have that is sorely missing on
the QC35’s, and I also think the way you
activate Conversation mode on these headphones
is better than Sony’s quick attention cause
once its activated you’re hand free.
Unlike the Sony’s where you have to keep
pressing on the touch pad.
But now lets talk about how these headphones
actually sound cause they’re not going to
please everybody but they are going to make
some people very happy.
For the most part the NC 700’s and QC35’s
sound identical and neither one of them allow
you to directly change their EQ.
Both of these headphones shoot for a neutral
sound signature but they do put an emphasis
on the mids and vocals.
Now the bass on both of these headphones does
resonate nicely but you don’t really feel
it.
So if you’re someone that likes to have
their headphones rattle their head when you’re
listening to music then neither one of these
are really going to do it for you.
Again these headphones are shooting for a
neutral sound signature for easy listening
so that you can appreciate the subtle differences
between instruments.
But the last major difference between these
two headphones that I feel could be a major
differentiating factor for some people is
that the NC 700’s now use a touch pad to
control your music playback where as the QC35’s
have physical buttons.
Now after you get used to using the NC 700’s
rather small touch pad over all it is very
accurate and easy to use.
Double tap to play or pause, swipe up or down
to adjust the volume and ship front or back
to skip through your music.
Very rarely does this touch pad not register
any of my inputs.
Its a good touch period, cause there are some
other touch pads out there that are just awful.
But at the end of the day, I know some people
just don’t want to deal with touch pads
and they’ll just gravitate toward the QC35’s
buttons.
Which for all intents and purposes is even
easier to use than the NC 700’s touch pad.
But finally lets talk about the microphones
on these headphones.
For starters both of these headphones have
decent microphones.
But the microphone on the NC 700’s is slightly
better.
Its not as good as AirPods, but it is one
of the best microphones on ANC headphones.
But over all, if I had to choose between the
NC 700’s and QC35’s I would go with the
NC 700’s purely because of the reduced cabin
pressure in their Active Noise Cancellation
and their ambient mode features… but I would
do so reluctantly because I would be giving
up the superior comfort and durability found
on the QC35’s.
Personally all I want from bose right now
is the QC35’s body with the NC 700’s tech
specs.
Sprinkle in a 30 hour battery life and Bose
has a recipe for domination.
Personally I think that if you already have
the QC35’s you don’t have to rush out
and upgrade.
And in the back of my mind im still hoping
that we’ll eventually see the Bose QC45.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
