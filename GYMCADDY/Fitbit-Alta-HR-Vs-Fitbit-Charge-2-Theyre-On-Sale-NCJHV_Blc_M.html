upgrade that included a new heart rate
monitor but with the new upgrade the
Fitbit also also got a price increase to
one 49.95
in my initial review I said that
although the Fitbit Alta HR is a good
fitness tracker I still think the Fitbit
charge 2 is better something both
conferencing and naturally a lot of
people were asking why I think the
Fitbit charge 2 is better than to fit
all to HR so let's compare the two and
hopefully help you with the purchase
decision first let's talk about the
pricing for those who don't know the
previous Zipit alter the one without the
heart rate monitor retails for one 29.95
while the new Fitbit Alta HR currently
retails for one 4995 so older but
slightly more robust step in charge - we
chose for the same 149 95 if you're
interested in picking up either one of
these I'll have links below with the
best deal Amazon routinely puts the
Fitbit charge 2 on sale
for the most part both no skipping all
thr and charged to do pretty much the
same thing they both connect to the same
sip in mobile app they both track your
steps distance walked calories burned
minutes active floors climb will
automatically log your exercise track
your sleep quality and measure your
heart rate and for the most part they
are both fairly accurate and calculate
the same reading they also share the
same design they both have the same
texture silicone wristbands that are
also interchangeable so you can swap out
for other bands if you like and the main
units are made of the same material
stainless steel in a hard plastic the
biggest difference between the alta HR
in the charge - is the screen although
they both have all LED screens with
similar tap interfaces the screen size
quality and user interface is slightly
different
obviously the screen of the Fitbit
charge 2 is slightly larger but it is
also much brighter
making it much easier to see in the
sunlight the Fitbit charge 2 also has a
button on its side allowing you to do
more from your wrist and you can do with
the oth are you also HR can only show
you your stats whereas the charge 2
allows you to manually start tracking
the workout use a stopwatch and start
guided reading sessions or the guided
breathing function is a must I mean it
works but it's really just against but
in general the larger screen on the
church - allows you to do a little more
than on the Alta HR the torch - also has
connected you
which allows the charge to to connect to
the GPS on your phone to see real-time
stats like pace and distance on the
display and record a map of your room
being able to control your Fitbit having
a bigger and brighter screen and
connected GPS make me think the charge 2
is a better value than the Fitbit Alta a
chart but the smaller form factor of the
Ultra HR might be beneficial for certain
people first the small screen on the
Fitbit Alta HR does mean the Alta HR has
a longer battery life standard charge to
look at that Alta HR might also be
better for people with smaller wrist
although since that has the best fitness
tracking app on the market and arguably
the best Hardware on the market as well
it's if it wants to stay competitive
they need to make their higher end
products waterproof so people can swim
with them as of today the Fitbit Alta HR
and charge 2 are only sweat and slash
through but if you were to swim with
either one of these fitness trackers
they will probably get damaged but if
you're not swimming types then either
Fitbit will shoot you just fine like I
said I still prefer the 5th church true
always they all say HR because it's a
little more capable since they both
retail for the same price you do want to
get the most bang for your buck but for
some people deciding between the Fitbit
Alta HR and charge 2 will ultimately
come down to design and form factor hey
