announced we saw a game-changing
features that would married upgrading to
the latest and greatest iPhone
besides marginally better camera and
performance improvements like today when
the iPhone 4 came out it was all about
that new Retina display and the new
glass and metal premium body when the
iPhone 4s came out it was all about
Syria when the iPhone 5s came out it was
all about touch ID when the new iPhone 6
came out it was all about the new larger
displays and when the iPhone 7 plus came
out it was all about the new dual camera
setup but now that we have the iPhone 8
and 8 plus the iPhone 10 the iPhone 10s
and 10's Macs and the iPhone 10 are more
and more people are still holding on to
their older iPhone 6 6 s &amp;amp; 7 just
because they don't see a real need to
upgrade and until recently I was in the
same boat now this video isn't going to
focus on benchmarks and tell you how the
iPhone tennis max is only marginally
faster than last year's iPhone 10 this
video is going to be about my experience
and gripes upgrading for my iPhone 6s
plus to my iPhone 10s max and hopefully
answer the question that is should I
drop over $1000 to get that new iPhone
now I'm not going to deny that the
iPhone 10 was a pretty big leap forward
from all of the other iPhones that came
before it it finally got rid of the
terribly dated forehead and chin design
and gave us a nearly basileus design
with an 83 percent screen to body ratio
but hey total love it the iPhone 10 also
introduced the masses to the Nash
display which unfortunately is here to
stay for the foreseeable future
the iPhone 10 also featured Apple's a
new face idea for the first time and
also had other notable features like
having both of its rear camera sensors
optically stabilized and a wireless
charger and even though I was impressed
by the iPhone 10 when I first saw it my
first thought was where's the iPhone 10
plus as someone who's gotten so used to
using a plus device you never want to go
back and that seems to be the general
consensus among other plus device users
and it could help explain why the iPhone
tennis max is dramatically outselling
the iPhone 10s now even though the
iPhone tennis max has the same footprint
as the iPhone 6s plus due to
the home button and bezel is design
there is an adjustment period for the
first week and a half I naturally reach
for the non-existent home button and I
did consider swapping my tennis max for
a standard tennis but now that I've
adjusted I found it the new gesture
based navigation on the iPhone 10 and so
on is much more fluid than using the
home button you just flick apps way and
you swipe through them sort of like Tom
Cruise in Minority Report
but the remove of the home button does
bring a major handicap for Plus device
users before if you touch the home
button twice
iOS will bring down the top half of your
screen so single-handed the use of your
iPhone whatever plus was much more
manageable now the iPhone tennis max
still has this reachability feature
buried in its accessibility settings but
it's not as foolproof as it used to be
since you have to swipe down on the
bottom edge of the screen it feels very
unnatural and you do risk dropping your
phone because of how you have to hold it
and since you navigate through this
phone by swiping up and down it means
sometimes the screen doesn't drop down
on the first try or you accidentally end
up closing an app or pulling down the
series suggestion tab and overall the
iPhone Tennis Max is a much more
two-handed device than previous plus
devices because if they were move the
home button and gesture based navigation
the new bezel is designed that most
flagship devices are aiming for these
days also brings its own sets of
handicaps on the new iPhone 10s max what
the screen turned off it's very hard to
tell which ways up or down on the tennis
max Android devices combat this by
having an optional always-on display
and with older Plus devices you can
easily tell which way is up or down
because of that home button but the
first two weeks I tried using the iPhone
10 s max without a case I was picking
those phone up upside down on a regular
basis and in general the iPhone tennis
max just isn't designed to be used
without a case period due to its all
glass back this iPhone is going to slide
around any table or surface that isn't
perfectly leveled and is going to slide
over your pocket on a regular basis when
you're sitting in the car but the
biggest thing that irks me about these
new iPhones is the camera hump I
remember when the iPhone 6 debuted the
camera hump and everyone said that this
design choice was very own Apple like
and that Steve Jobs would and had
allowed this if he was still alive but
fast forward and now and the camera
humpin the tennis max is three times as
tall as this success now
don't mind how does camera hump looks
but I do mind how if you place this
phone on the table it's constantly going
to rock back and forth and I just feel
Apple should reel the camera hum back a
bit because Google proves that he can
take some great quality pictures with
just not a single lens but also a lens
that doesn't stick out so much so
putting the case on your iPhone these
days isn't just about protection anymore
you need a case where you have some
asymmetry on the front so you know which
way is up or down you need something
that's going to offer more friction than
glass whenever you place this down
somewhere so it's not constantly flying
all over the place and you need it to
compensate for the camera hump on the
back or else you risk scratching your
telephoto lens honestly I think a skin
on the iPhone tennis max just isn't
going to cut it I tried
now besides a more premium finish phones
these days have a glass back so that
they can have wireless charging now
personally I don't really care for
wireless charging because you can't use
your phone and charge your phone at the
same time but while it's charging in
general can be pretty useful if you have
a newer car that has a wireless charging
pad built-in directly into the center
console but still if you want to use
apple carplay or if you want to listen
to your music in higher quality that
isn't bluetooth you're still gonna have
to connect the tennis Mac's through the
lightning connector anyways and just
like before the iPhone tennis max comes
included with the same five watt power
adapter and charging cable that's been
standard since the iPhone 5 now this
phone has had no problem asking me
through a full day of heavy usage of
scrolling through the internet and
watching youtube videos but even after
you spend overall thousand dollars on
your new phone Apple still expects you
to fork over at least another 70 dollars
for a 30 watt power adapter and USB C
cable if you want fast charging
something that mind you come standard
with a lot of other flagship devices now
I just think this is ridiculous I also
think it's ridiculous how the iPhone 10s
max does a very poor job of clearly and
directly telling you its current battery
percentage perhaps the most important
stat you need to know about your phone
at any given time unless you pull the
control center tab down the tenant's max
won't tell you it's exact battery
percentage like other iPhones that don't
have a notch
I just feel Apple needs to shuffle or
get rid of some of these icons so we can
get actual numbers but I also
how much harder it is to open control
sensor on the tennis max compared to all
the iPhones cuz again it's forcing you
to use both hands for something that
used to be much easier before now when
it comes to face ID and the knot I don't
hate it
but I don't love him we're guarding the
notch you learn to live with it and
since the majority of the time you're
looking at the center of the screen
because that's where your content
usually is you forget it's there and
since face ID is slightly faster on the
iPhone 10s and 10's max compared to the
iPhone 10 it's almost instantaneous but
I will admit face ID is kind of like
Wi-Fi when it works great it works and
you don't think about it but when it
starts acting up that's when you start
thinking there has to be a better way
and yes touch ID is still slightly
faster than face ID and I sometimes
missed touch ID cuz it's a more passive
way to unlock your phone but touch ID
you just press the home button and
you're in whereas with face ID you have
to take that extra second to at least be
facing the screen and finally when it
comes to the remove of the headphone
jack it's really only going to affect
people who are coming from an iPhone 6s
and older and since I use ear pods power
beats and other wireless headphones on
or gherla basis I honestly can't
remember the last time I actually needed
to use a headphone jack on my phone and
I feel that the majority of people these
days aren't really going to miss a
headphone jack at all and even though
the tennis maxis doesn't come included
with a dongle again I think the majority
of people aren't going to miss him
honestly if I didn't need to hook up a
mic to my tennis max when I livestream
with it then I would have no need for a
headphone jack or dongle at all so those
are some of the major graphs that I've
had and wanted to point out about
upgrading from my iPhone 6s plus to the
iPhone tennis max but still there are
some benefits to upgrade into the iPhone
tennis max even over the iPhone 8 plus
mainly that OLED screen the colors are
much more vibrant the screen is much
brighter and the color contrast is on a
whole other level the LCD panel on the
iPhone 8 plus and iphone 10 are just
can't come close to and if you consume
the majority of your content on your
phone then you're really going to enjoy
that screen upgrading to the iPhone 10s
Mac so also means you're going to have
much more processing power built-in and
RAM so you're going to be able to
navigate through your phone
what pages and switch between apps much
smoother but you're really only going to
notice this performance upgrade if
you're coming from an iPhone 7 or later
now I did see a huge performance
improvement in my iPhone 6s plus when I
got a new battery and updated to I was
12 so good in fact I briefly considered
canceled my iPhone 10s Maxx pre-order
but since the iPhone 6s plus just
doesn't have as much processing power
and RAM built in the phone does still
occasionally stutter and ads don't stay
active in the background so when you
switch back to them you have to wait a
few seconds for them to pick up where
you left off so having that amazing OLED
panel with deep blacks and sheer
processing power at least for me
has justified upgrading to the iPhone
10s max and personally I can make do
without an all glass and stainless steel
body and wireless charging if there was
a cheaper iPhone with the same screen
guts in cameras as the iPhone 10s max
but in a metal body I'd be all over that
and finally let's talk about the cameras
on the iPhone 10's max just as you'd
expect this is the best camera on an
iPhone ever and when the next iPhone
comes out that iPhones gonna have the
best camera on an iPhone ever but in
general the camera on the iPhone 10's
mags does take some amazing pictures in
video so good in fact that I started
using the Tenace max for b-roll in some
of my other videos and having that
telephoto lens means being able to get
very crispy up-close shots without
having to use digital zoom and having
portrait mode on both the rear and front
facing cameras is very nice as well
but even though portrait mode on the
iPhone has gotten progressively better
there's so little room for improvement
sometimes the edge detection does have a
little trouble when it comes to hair on
both people and pets but this is
something that can be fixed through
software but overall I'm pretty
indifferent with my iPhone tennis max
now that I finally caved and put a case
on it a case isn't just about protecting
your phone anymore you needed to
compensate for this quote-unquote
premium design you need it for the
asymmetry on the front you need
something that's going to offer more
friction and grip than glass and you
need it to protect the protruding camera
hump on the back flagship phones these
days just aren't designed to be used
with a decades you just take them out of
the box and marry them for a few minutes
and then shove them into a case never to
be taken back out again
but since I'm upgrading from the iPhone
6
pleasure all the way to the iPhone
tennis max the OLED screen performance
improvement and longer battery life or
would have justified this major purchase
for me but it doesn't justify a total of
$1200 for me if you're still rockin in
iphone 7 or iphone 8 there's absolutely
no need to upgrade and if you do have an
older iPhone like I did then I feel
upgrading to the iPhone 8 plus is still
a very serious option to consider right
now the iPhone 10 x max just doesn't
bring anything too revolutionary anymore
compared to previous iPhones and other
phones on the market right now and in
general phone refresh cycles are
becoming more and more incremental and
phone manufacturers know this so that's
why companies like Apple Google and
Samsung are focusing on making the best
eco system out there so that if you
already have their phone the likelihood
of you getting their latest phone is
very high when it comes to upgrading
just because you don't want to leave
their ecosystem that you're already
heavily invested in and I think
upgrading to the iPhone 8 plus is still
a very good option for people out there
who just don't want to spend all whole
bunch of money on a phone that's only
slightly better and since Apple has done
a very good job of keeping their phones
updated and running very smoothly I feel
it's still a good idea to stick with
Apple cause of longevity like I
mentioned earlier when I upgraded my 6s
plus 2 I was 12 and got a new battery it
was working pretty well and the lack of
longevity is one of the major reasons
why I'm so against getting a Samsung
device they just do a very poor job of
providing timely software updates for
their devices and it looks like Google
is also starting to take longevity in
their devices very seriously because
they've committed to supporting the new
pixel phones for at least three years so
what I'm saying is you don't have to
drop over $1200 on the new base model
iPhone 10's max because after taxes and
the case that's about how much you're
gonna be spending on glowin but if you
do you can rest assured that it's still
a somewhat sound investment because
Apple will continue to support and
maximize your phone for years to come
but for my plus device users that wants
to save some money and don't want to
settle for a smaller device like the
iPhone 10 are because honestly that's
one of the reasons why I didn't get the
iPhone 10 last year then the iPhone 8
plus is still a good option two serious
