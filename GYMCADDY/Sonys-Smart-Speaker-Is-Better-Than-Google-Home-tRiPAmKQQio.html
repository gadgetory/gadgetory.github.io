I'm also a really big fan of the Google
home max but I'm not really the biggest
fan of the original Google home it just
doesn't sound good for listening to
music and I really think Google needs to
release our redesigned Google home
within emphasis on sound quality because
I really just use my Google home for
voice commands and at which point I
should really just replace it with
another Google home many but if you're
looking for a midsize smart speaker I
really think the Sony l-live s 50 G is a
great alternative to the original Google
home
the sony l FS 50 G is Sony's first
Google assistant integrated smart
speaker when it was first released it
was retailing for 199 99 but now you can
find it for 140 $9.99 at most places and
even during the holiday season I saw
them for as low as $100 but still if you
get it for one $49.99 it's just $20 more
than the original Google home and it
comes in two colors black or white if
you want to pick up either of the
speaker's featured in this video I have
links to description below and if you
use the link it really helps up the
channel okay let's go to over the
obvious yes the Sony looks almost
exactly like an Apple home pod and
personally I don't mind it it's smaller
a little slimmer and much lighter than
on the pod and it also has a fabric
outer shell but the Sony smart speaker
is slightly bigger than the Google home
just like the Google home the Sony has
360 degrees sound but it also has an LED
clock display which is something I
always thought the Google home was
missing and instead of touch controls
the Sony uses gesture controls
controlling music playback and active in
Google systems the only buttons this
smart speaker has is a Bluetooth button
a mute button and a dimple and to lower
the brightness of the clock display on
the front unfortunately the Sony LFS 50
G doesn't have an ox jack the only way
to listen to music on the speaker is
either through voice commands if you
cast it or over Bluetooth and there's
also an NSC touch point on the back so
if you have an Android device pairing is
just a little easier now let's talk
about the gesture controls cuz those can
be very hit or miss if they're now
properly built into the product if you
swipe up you'll play or pause your music
if you swipe down you'll activate your
Google assistant if you swipe right
you'll skip a track and if you swipe
left you'll go back a track and to
adjust the volume you
make clockwise or counterclockwise
circles with your finger in order for
the swipes to work your palm has to be
flat and in order to adjust the volume
the circles have to be directly over the
sony logo and once you get the hang for
the gestures they work 9 out of 10 times
it's pretty good how's the weather like
for New York City currently in New York
City it's 42 in personally one of my
biggest gripes with the Google home Oh
Minnie and ho max is that you can't
physically control your music playback
Google forces you to use voice commands
and only the Google home allows you to
touch and hold to activate Google
assistant whereas the Minnie and Max
you're forced to use the Howard voice
controls are cool and all but sometimes
using manual controls is just a simpler
solution and that's why I like this
zoning speaker so much I can simply use
the voice commands but if I want to I
also have full control with the gestures
and when it comes to voice recognition
the Sony smart speaker picks up my voice
just as well as my Google home and how
many if you're playing music and a
higher volume then either of these
speakers are going to have a problem
hearing you hey boss a studio license to
blue sure changing the studio light to
blue hey talk to Krypto prices all right
getting crypto prices high which
cryptocurrency would you like the price
for Bitcoin the current price of Bitcoin
is 7580 $9.19 usually when using
third-party Google assistance smart
speakers it means not having all of the
features found on the Google home Oh
Minnie and Mac's most noticeably
broadcasting and making phone calls
broadcast
thing works just fine on this Sony
speaker but you can't make phone calls
like you can with either of the
first-party speakers this feature could
possibly come in a future software
update okay now let's talk about tech
specs and speaker setup the sony LFS 50
g is rocking bluetooth 4.2 and has a
stable connection up to 40 feet it's
pretty standard it's IP x3 rated so a
little splash of water won't hurt it and
it's fabric shell is removable inside
there's a single upward facing 1.8 9
inch diameter speaker and a downward
facing 2.0 9 inch diameter subwoofer
made it to a bass reflex duct and
between the two there's a diffuser that
helps evenly spread out all the sound
for comparison Luco go home has a single
front one facing 2 inch diameter
transducer and dual 2 inch diameter
passive radiators
even though the Google home is a 360
degree speaker after living with it for
a few months
it's still pretty directional for the
best sound quality you want that
transducer firing towards you
obviously the JBL post 3 is the best
sounding speaker here it has a far
superior speaker setup my problem with
the Google home is that it just has way
too much bass it ends up pushing back
all the mids and vocals
I feel the Google home Bay is really
only worth using if you're strictly
going to be listening to EDM the Sony on
the other hand has a much more even
sound signature there's still a good
amount of bass but the means and vocals
are still very well defined but the Sony
still isn't perfect there is a good
amount of sound distortion if you get
about the 85% volume mark and when I
first got this speaker there was a good
amount of reverb in the bass but after a
few days of playing music on this guy it
just went away but even though I really
do like Sony's first smart speaker there
is room for improvement first up I hate
the included power cable the cable
itself is too short and cheap and the
plug itself is almost twice as big as
the Google Homes something I've noticed
lately with smart speakers is that their
power cables or just as premium as the
speaker themselves all the Google's
cables are all covered in softest rubber
minis and Max's plugs are very small and
the home path cable is covered in fabric
this is the same issue I have with the
JBL link 10 and link 20 also I feel so
nice sort of included and ambient light
sensors so the LED display on the front
will automatically adjust itself I also
think Sony should get more use out of
the LED display in general right now it
only displays time and volume I would
really like to see it being used for
timers notifications and maybe even
display the current outside temperature
but still I really do prefer the Sony LF
s 50 G over the original Google home
personally I think the smart speaker is
best suited for the kitchen it looks
good and it has a very small footprint I
just wish I could use that front display
for my kitchen timers when I'm cooking
since it sounds way better than the
Google home I do find myself listening
to music again while I'm cooking if
Google is working on a next-gen Google
home just take this concept and improve
on it with better sound the addition of
a USB C port so I have the option to
charge my own device and maybe a more
useful display hey if you enjoyed the
