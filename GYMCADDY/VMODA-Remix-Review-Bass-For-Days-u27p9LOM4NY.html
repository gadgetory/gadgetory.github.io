Bluetooth speaker and just like the
v-moda crossfade to wireless I feel it's
a very specific type of product for a
very specific type of consumer if you
didn't know by now I'm actually doing a
giveaway for the V motocross fig.2
Wireless so go watch that video so you
know how to enter after you're done
watching this video
the v-moda remix comes in two very
different finishes you can either get
the aluminum version like I have here or
you can also get one that's wrapped in
black vegan leather and if you really
wanted to you can also customize the
remix with gold 3d printed sides and
seashells that will easily raise the
price of the remix into the thousands
but for your base model it'll cost you
$300 or like one and a quarter like
coins I'll have links on the description
below if you want to pick either the
speaker's showed off in this video with
the best prices and if you use either of
the links it really helps out to channel
the v-moda remix comes included with 2
sets of what they're calling remix rings
they're essentially high density rubber
bands that prevent the remix from
shaking your table when the bass really
gets going and they help keep the
speaker in place the remix also comes
included with the USB type a two USB
type-c cable which measures in at 79
inches long and it also comes included
with a 55 inch braided audio cable
personally I like the design of the
aluminum remix it has a sophisticated
look that will look very much in place
in an office setting and I think it
looks great next to my iMac but I prefer
to use the red remix ring so that it has
a little pop of color on the top of the
speaker you have your control button so
you can play your positive music raise
or lower the volume skip a track or go
back a track and if you press and hold
you'll activate your voice assistant
although the buttons have very good
tactile feedback I just wish the buttons
were a little raised or has some texture
to them so you can know what buying
you're pressing without looking and on
the back of the speaker you have your
USB type-c port for charging and aux in
and aux out and I'll go into detail what
vamp is there in a minute
concerning technical specifications the
remix is rocking a 3400 milliamp hour
battery that has average
eleven-and-a-half average so playback
time for me well set at a medium volume
wireless range is pretty average with
most other speakers on the market with a
range of 30 feet and it can be connected
to two devices at the same time and
under the hood the v-model remix has
dual transducers and a dual passive
radiators
very similar to what you were fine on
the JBL for the poor or Sony XP 20
first up I just want to put it out there
that the v-moda remix does not get all
that loud max volume the remix is as
loud as a JBL for four and 80% volume
and that max volume the remix does
suffer a considerable amount of
distortion plainly said if you want a
speaker that gets really loud than the
remix isn't for you
the v-moda remix sounds its best when
used at a low to moderate listening
volume and the amount of bass the remix
has for Excise is what impressed me the
most but even with the amount of bass
the speaker has it still has
surprisingly very well to find mates at
vocals which is a very pleasant surprise
because most of the bass heavy speakers
just end up pushing back the midget
vocals most notably is a Google home and
the Google home max and especially do
you eat blast and mega blast those those
who don't have mates at all now what's
really special about the v-moda remix is
the built-in headphones that and this is
the main reason why the remix now has a
permanent spot on my desk and it's very
simple to use you plug your audio
stories in the aux-in on the remix you
then plug your headphones into the vamp
jack and press a multi-purpose button
and you're done instantly the sound
quality of your headphones dramatically
improves everything sounds crisper you
hear details that just aren't audible
when used with a Bluetooth connection
with your headphones or even with a wild
connection directly to your device
without the use of the remix and the
headphones also gets significantly
louder and the built-in headphone zap
doesn't just work with v motors
headphones it will work with any pair of
headphones and here's the microphone
test and unfortunately it's not the best
but I do feel the microphone on the
v-moda remix does sound better than the
microphone under the motocross rachey
Wireless but this audio clip is being
recorded by the microphone on the V moto
remix so you could either do that so to
wrap things up the v-moda remix is a
hard sell but it does have some really
good things going for it
I feel the remix is just meant to live
on your desk it looks really good in an
office but I personally wouldn't take it
anywhere else it's now waterproof and I
would hate to damage the aluminum finish
it sounds really good when played at
lower volumes but it's max volume does
leave something to be desired the
built-in headphones app is a very neat
feature that I have been using a lot but
the $300 price
Saxe still makes the remakes hard to
justify if you have the money and you
like higher quality materials you won't
be disappointed but if you're a college
kid on a tighter budget I suggest you
look elsewhere hey if you enjoyed the
