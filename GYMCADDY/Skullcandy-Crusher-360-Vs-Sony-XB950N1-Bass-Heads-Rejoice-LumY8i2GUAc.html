theres closed back headphones, open back headphones,
audiophile grade headphones, and active noise
canceling headphones.
But theres a special type of headphones for
a special type of person that absolute loves
bass.
And thats bass head headphones.
And today we’re comparing the Skullcandy
Crusher 360’s against the ever so popular
Sony MDR-XB950N1, which arguably has been
the best Basshead headphones on the market
for awhile now.
The Sony XB950N1 came out in January of 2017
and they retail for $250.
Where as the Skullcandy Crusher 360’s were
released in September of 2018 and retail for
$300.
Now I’m fully aware that for this type of
money you can also go ahead and pick up more
premium ANC headphones like the Sony 1000XM3
or the Bose QC35 Series Two.
But in short, Bass Head headphones are kind
of like sports cars, they might not be as
practical… but they’re a lot of fun.
So if you want to pick either of these headphones
up I’ll have links in the description below
and if you use the links it really helps out
the channel.
I highly suggest you check them out cause
Sony headphones routinely go on sale you so
you’ll might get lucky.
And if you want to learn more about either
of these headphones then please watch their
full reviews.
And also check out the new merch shelf down
below.
First lets get the simple stuff out of the
way, and thats the included accessories and
ports.
The Skullcandy Crusher 360’s come included
with a hard shell carrying case which is a
big step up from the carrying pouch that comes
included with the Sony XB950N1’s.
And I find it kind of ironic cause since the
crusher’s are built like a tank they don’t
really need a case, where as since the Sony’s
are a little more delicate I usually worry
about them any time I have them in my back
pack.
The crusher’s also come included with a
much better quality audio cable with an inline
controller and a high quality micro usb cable
for charging.
Now both of these headphones have a very easy
to reach 3.5 millimeter audio jack which is
good and they both charge via a micro USB
port.
But like I said in the full review, I feel
that since the Skullcandy Crusher 360 were
released in late 2018 they should have of
had came with a USB C port instead.
Now lets talk about these headphone’s design
and build quality, cause they’re very different
from one another.
Like I mentioned earlier, the crushers are
built like a tank.
The headband and ear cups have a soft touch
feel to them, they have a metal frame, and
the faux leather on the earcups and headband
feels much more premium compared to the faux
leather used on the Sony’s.
The Sony’s are mostly made out of plastic
and really the only metal you’ll find on
them is going to be the headband.
But even though these headphones are mostly
made out of plastic, they don’t feel cheap…
I just wouldn’t travel with them unless
they were in a hardshell carrying case.
But since the Sony’s are mostly made out
of plastic it does mean they are considerably
lighter than the Crushers cause they weigh
in at 293 grams.
Where as the Skullcandy Crusher 360’s weigh
in at a scale tipping 322 grams.
For the most part most headphones weigh in
somewhere between 230 grams and 290 grams.
Now you’ll might think that a 30 gram difference
between the Crusher’s and N1’s isn’t
a lot, but with the crusher’s I’ve noticed
I always know they’re there where as with
the Sony’s sometimes I forget I have them
on.
And when it comes to wearing either of these
headphones, I can confidently say they are
both big head approved.
The crusher 360’s do have a bit of a firmer
fit compared to the Sony’s, but they’re
not uncomfortable like the OG Crusher’s
and they don’t squeeze your head like the
Bowers and Wilkins PX.
But if you’re someone who prefers a loser
fit on their headphones then you’re still
better off going with the Sony’s.
But the bad thing about the Sony’s is that
their ear cups are a little more cramped compared
to the ear cups on the Crusher’s.
Im fine with either, but the ear cups on the
Sony’s do rest on my ear lobes.
Which you don’t even noticed after awhile.
But something that you will notice everytime
you wear the Sony XB950N1 is people staring
at you in public.
Theres no nice way to say it, but the Sony’s
aren’t the best looking headphones out there.
Since their ear cups stick out a lot you do
look a little goofy with them on and since
they stick out so much you can actually see
them in your peripheral vision.
Where as the SkullCandy Crusher 360’s have
a timeless design that I genuinely really
like.
They’re just a good looking pair of headphones
period.
When it comes to battery life… the Crusher’s
and Sony’s are pretty evenly matched.
The Skullcandy Crusher 360’s have an advertised
battery life of 29 hours, but with the bass
effect turned on to 60% these are averaging
22 hours of playback time.
The Sony XB950N1 have an advertised battery
life of 22 hours but thats with their bass
effect and Active Noise Cancellation turned
on.
But with ANC turned off these can get around
24 hours of playback time.
So both of these headphones last me about
a week and half between charges.
But something the Skullcandy have that the
Sonys don’t is fast charging.
If you plug these headphones in for 10 minutes
from a dead battery they’ll get you 3 hours
of playback time.
And like I just mentioned, the Sony’s have
active noise cancellation which is something
the Crusher’s don’t.
The ANC on the XB950N1 obviously isn’t as
good as the 1000XM3, but it does help reduce
road noise.
But even though the Skullcandy Crusher 360’s
don’t have Active Noise Cancelation, due
to their more premium build quality they do
offer a good amount of passive noise cancellation…
more than what the plastic Sony’s do with
ANC turned off.
So yeah, like I said the ANC on the XB950N1
is nowhere near as good as the 1000XM3 and
honestly its not a feature I would be concerned
about when choosing bass head headphones.
But since ANC is a feature the Sony’s have
that the crusher’s don’t have, I couldn’t
just not address it.
But now lets talk about the bass and sound
quality of these headphones.
For the most part both of these headphones
sound good period with their bass effect turned
off.
Their sound stages and instrument separation
could be better, but theres no tinning in
the highs and the bass never bottoms out.
But even with their bass effects turned off
both of these headphones are still going to
have an emphasis on the bass.
But the Sony’s by default do have a little
more emphasis on the mids than the Crusher’s
so vocalists are a little more pronounced
on the Sony’s.
Now with the bass effect turned on, thats
when these headphones really come alive.
The bass on both of these headphones is its
own separate entity and they both do a very
good job of rattling your head when the bass
really gets going.
But… the crusher 360’s have considerably
more bass than the XB950N1.
With the bass effect set to 100% on the Sony’s
its like the Crusher’s are set to 60%.
And coincidentally, I like keeping the Crusher’s
at 60% cause if you go any higher than that
I find it pretty hard to actually hear the
rest of the song.
So yeah if you want the headphones with the
most bass here then the Skullcandy Crusher
360 is a no briner.
But Bass isn’t everything… like I said
in the full review I do wish the Mids on the
Crusher’s were a little more pronounced
so you can hear them when the bass is going
on for an extended period of time.
Another thing to take into consideration about
the Crusher’s is that they don’t get too
loud.
A lot of the times I have the volume on the
crusher’s maxed out I still cant help but
want them to be 1 or 2 steps louder.
Where as the Sony’s get more than loud enough
so I never have to max them out.
And since the Mids on the Sony’s are more
forward, they’re always present even when
the bass goes all out.
But still, theres just something about the
Skullcandy Crusher 360’s that just make
them more fun and more enjoyable than the
Sony XB950N1.
And the last thing I want to talk about regarding
these headphones is their button layouts and
bluetooth connectivity.
Like I mentioned in the full review, I like
the button layout on the Crusher 360’s,
they’re easy to find and easy to use.
But I hate that you have to press and hold
the plus and mins button to skip through your
music.
Where as the Sony’s have a rocker that I’ve
always really been a big fan of.
It makes skipping through your music almost
instant.
And just like the crusher’s, the buttons
are easy to find and easy to use.
But one thing that I really like about the
crusher’s over the Sony’s is that you
can adjust your bass level on the fly directly
from the headphones using the touch pad on
the left ear cup.
Where as with the Sony’s if you want to
adjust the bass level you have to open up
the app every time.
And finally I want to address the bluetooth
connectivity on both of these headphones.
Both of these headphones can only be connected
to one device at a time which does suck.
But the Crusher’s have less latency than
the Sony’s making them better than the Sony’s
for watching YouTube videos on your phone.
But over all, I feel that this versus video
is pretty neck and neck.
The Skullcandy Crusher 360’s have the better
build quality, the better design, and more
bass than the Sony’s.
But the Sony’s do manage to get a little
louder, the mids sound better, and the active
noise cancellation is nice to have.
But when it comes to just having fun, I think
the win has to go to the Skullcandy Crusher
360’s.
The Crusher 360’s are quickly becoming one
of my favorite headphones.
Now, if you watched my Sony h.ear on 2 versus
Sony 1000XM3 video you’ll know that I personally
think that we are going to see an updated
version of the Sony XB950N1 and H.ear On 2
at CES 2019.
So unless you get a very good deal on the
XB950N1, I wouldn’t pay full price for either
of those headphones right now.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
