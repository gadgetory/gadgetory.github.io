the most talked-about 200 all our ANC
headphones we have the JBL 65 bt NCS the
Sennheiser's 4.5 l bt NCS and the Sony
which 780 this lineup is particularly
interesting because I feel there's no
obvious winner here and since both the
Sennheiser's and Sony's went on sale on
prime day for less than $100 I'm willing
to bet these two headphones aren't going
to go on sale again on Black Friday and
if that's the case
drop some turkeys down below and let's
get this video started the Sennheiser
headphones are actually the least
expensive headphones here are we telling
for $180 whereas both the Sony and JBL
headphones retail for one $99.99 if you
want to pick either these headphones up
I'll have links on description below and
if you use the links it really helps out
the channel I just trust you check them
out cuz these headphones routinely go on
sale and if you want to learn more about
either of these headphones then watch
their full reviews and check out the
numerous shelf down below first let's
get the small stuff out of the way all
three of these headphones charge via a
micro USB port and both the Sennheiser's
and JBL's have a 2.5 mm audio jack
whereas the Sony's have a 3.5 mm audio
jack which I personally prefer the
Sunrisers come included with the soft
shell carrying case that zips up and has
an Inside Story considering of cables
and a JBL was come included with a
carrying pouch but unfortunately the
Sony's don't bring a carrying pouch
whatsoever but if you do plan on
traveling on a regular basis with either
of these headphones I highly advise you
invest on a hard shell carrying case the
most important thing we're gonna have to
compare between these three headphones
it is going to be their design and fit
all three of these headphones are all
mostly made out of plastic and have full
other ear cups but their build quality
your cup design and use of other
materials highly differentiate these
headphones from one another even though
the Sennheiser is always the cheapest
headphones here I feel they have the
best build quality and they're also the
best-looking headphones here the plastic
body panels on these headphones have
very tight tolerances and I really like
the pedestal lock on underneath the
headband it helps keep these headphones
in place the JBL has have the
second-best build quality here and
their headband is completely covered in
a fabric mesh and finally the Sony's
have the least impressive build quality
here body panels aren't as perfectly
aligned as the Sennheiser's and the faux
leather on the ear cups and headband
feels much cheaper than the faux leather
used on the other headphones but don't
think for a second that the Sony's are
going to fall apart on you I'm just
saying that the Sunrisers have the best
built quality here but now let's take a
closer look at these ear cups the Sony's
have the biggest and most spacious ear
cups here the ear cups on the JBL are
slightly smaller but they also do a
pretty good job of encasing your ears
but they aren't as spacious as disowning
air cups and finally there's the
Sennheiser ear cups which are the most
cramped ear cups here and they have the
most padding depending on the
Sennheiser's doesn't cause overheating
if you're just sitting and listening to
music but overheating is an issue if you
walk around with these headphones on
since the Sony's have the least amount
of padding and contact with your skin
these headphones actually have the least
amount of overheating and personally I
really like the padding on the Sony's
cuz the padding is pretty firm whereas
depending on the JBL is is just too soft
so you constantly have to fluff them
back up again when it comes to fit the
Sony's are the most comfortable
headphones here to wear all three of
these headphones fit a little snug if
you have a bigger head like me but since
the ear cups and the Sony's are the most
spacious they should fit most people
just fine so for those reasons the Sony
700 ends are big head approved the
sacrificer headphones are also big head
approved but they do fit a little more
snug than the Sony headphones but they
are nowhere near as tight as the JBL
headphones but just remember since the
Sennheiser headphones have so much
padding they do feel more cramped and
old my restaurant ear lobes
but unfortunately the JBL headphones are
the least comfortable headphones here
they have way too much clamping force
and they just never seem to rest
comfortably on my head even though the
ear cups on the JBL headphones swivel a
good deal they don't pivot enough and as
a result they don't evenly press against
your head when you put them on and
instead they place a lot of pressure on
the anterior portion in your ear and
this can get pretty annoying and
personally I hate headphones that use
this type of hinge for the
earcups because the b studio threes are
also guilty of this cuz in comparison to
Sonia and son Heiser headphones have
this fourth design that holds the ear
cups and this allows the ear cups on
both headphones to pivot and swivel more
than enough to comparably accommodate
most head types and more importantly
they press even amounts of pressure
around the ears when you put them on now
let's talk about bad reliance cuz it's
all over the place with these headphones
the JBL has have the worst battery life
here with a claimed battery life of 24
hours but with an C turned on these
headphones barely managed to hit 14
hours playback time the Sunrisers have a
claiming battery life of 25 hours and
with agency turned on these headphones
have no problem getting a little more
than 20 hours to playback time but then
there's the Sony 700 ends that have a
claim battery life of 35 hours which is
way above average for headphones and
with an C turned on these headphones
have had no problem averaging a little
over 30 up to playback time on a full
charge and these headphones are the only
headphones here with quad charging even
though it's not amazing a 10 minute
charge from a dead battery will get you
one hour of juice regarding Bluetooth
connections all three of these
headphones have stable connections that
don't escape and have no problems going
through multiple walls but the Sony's
have the least amount of latency so
these headphones are the best headphones
here for watching videos or as the
Sony's have a lot more latency so I
wouldn't recommend these headphones for
watching videos now when it comes to
active noise cancellation out of all of
these headphones the JBL are able to
block out the most noise here but they
have a considerable amount of cabin
pressure so much in fact that I can only
go a few minutes with these headphones
on before I needing to either pop my
ears
we're just needing to take a break where
as the ANC on both the Saudis and
Sennheiser's are able to block out the
same amount of noise but the noise
cancellation on the Sony's is more
impressive because it has very little to
no cabin pressure whereas the Sony's do
you have a little bit of cabin pressure
but it is much more manageable than
JPL's
the ANC on the JBL's does a decent job
of blocking out both constant
low-frequency sounds like road noise and
higher frequency sounds like chatter
well like I said they're cabin pressure
just makes these headphones very
uncomfortable to wear for long periods
of time the anc on the other two
headphones does a decent job of blocking
out road noise but does struggle a bit
when it comes to blocking out voices
both the ANC on the Stoney's and
Sunrisers will work just fine on a bus
ride commute but don't expect them to be
amazing if you're in a cafe or something
but since the ANC I know Sony's are able
to block out as much noise as the
Sennheiser's with much less cabin
pressure then the wind has to go to
Sonia and finally let's talk about sound
quality I actually think that JBL's are
the worst sounding headphones here their
sound stage is very narrow
you don't sound as clear and they have
very little bass their sound signature
also has too much of an emphasis on
trouble so these headphones do sound a
little bright and unfortunately these
JBL headphones don't connect a JBL
headphones app so you can't change the
EQ settings the Sennheiser's have a
neutral sound signature and for the most
part they sound very good they sound
very clear and they have enough bass
that should make most people happy and
unlike JBL's headphones they don't start
to sound bright if there are a lot of
vocals or if the highs really start
going but for the best listening
experience I highly advise you listen to
these headphones with their ase turned
off which you can deactivate by pressing
the volume up and volume down line
together for a few seconds and finally
there's the Sony headphones which sound
equally as good with noise cancellation
turned on or off since these headphones
connect to Sony's headphones app you can
CIM sound however you want by either
selecting from a few pre-made EQ
settings or you can now make your own
which was a feature I was asking for
when I first reviewed these headphones a
few months ago and if you crank the bass
all the way up these headphones are
going to have considerably more bass
than the other two headphones here now
as a disclaimer the 4.5 OS do connect a
Sennheiser's cap to nap but this app
only changes the EQ settings on any
music yes stored locally on your phone
if you string your music like the
majority of people do these days this
app isn't going to be very helpful and
the last thing I want to touch on here
is controlling your music playback I
also feel the Sony's have the best
control buttons here they have a very
easy to use rocker knob in volume rocker
combo that's easy to find and it allows
you to skip through your music very
quickly the Sunrisers have a similar
setup but since these buttons are so
small they're a little harder to find
and to tell apart but they also get the
job done and personally I just don't
like the control buttons on the jb ellis
even though the control buttons are
already easy to find answer teleport I
hate that in order to skip or go back a
track you have to press and hold the
volume up or volume down button this
just takes considerably longer than the
other two headphones instead I would
like if we could just double tap or
triple tap the center button so plainly
said I think that out of these three
headphones the JBL a 65 B TNCs or hard
pass mostly because they just don't fit
well when choosing between headphones
fit is the most important thing to take
into consideration but also added with
the fact that these headphones have way
too much cabin pressure and their audio
quality is lackluster I just can't
recommend them but choose it between the
Sennheiser's 4.50 etn seas and the
sony's whch 700 n is a little harder
they both fit well but the Sony's are a
little more comfortable
but the Sennheiser's have the better
build quality and design the anc on both
of these headphones block out the same
amount of sound but the Sony's do it
with less cabin pressure and even though
both of these headphones sound pretty
good having the ability to adjust EQ on
the Sony's is a huge plus I feel that
Sony's are the safe buy here but if you
want something that's built a little
better and something that looks cool
then you can't go wrong with the
Sennheiser's either if you made it this
far I guess you enjoyed the video so hit
that like button and get subscribed it
