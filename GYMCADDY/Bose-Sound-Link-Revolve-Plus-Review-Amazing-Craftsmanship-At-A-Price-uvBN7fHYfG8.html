design and haptic feedback from products
but both consistently releases
well-designed headphones in wireless
speakers but when I saw that Bose was
retelling their new sound more evolved
+4 299 95 I was a little skeptical the
both sellers were volt plus retails for
large speaker prices but it's tiny
compared to the competition so can the
Bose Soundlink revolt plus compared to
the larger speakers in its parks bracket
or is it overpriced
let's find out bose recently released
their new sound like revolve and
soundless revolves + although they look
very similar some key differences
between the revolve in the revolve + is
the overall size loudness battery life
and of sound like revolt + has a
carrying handle they both have a metal
outer casing and B both coming either
triple black or less grey like I
mentioned earlier the Bose Soundlink
revolt plus retails for 299 over at
Amazon and the smaller sound like
revolve retails for 199 I'll have links
in description below if you want to pick
either one of these done and I'll keep
them updated the best I can so you can
get the best deals possible you never
know when Amazon will put these guys on
sale and comment below telling me which
color way you like best and should I do
a versus video for the speaker
concerning what comes inside the box you
get the speaker on micro USB cable and
AC adapter in a whole bunch of
documentation like I said earlier the
speaker itself is very compact so other
speakers in this price bracket but it's
also very well built in design the outer
casing is made out of metal with no
holes in it the top is soft touch rubber
with concave lenss that all have great
tactile feedback but the bottom has a
very grippy rubber which helps keep the
speaker in place the back of the device
also has a microUSB port for charging
and you can play music through it as
well there's also an object to the
bottom of the device has a thread of
universal mount if you want to attach it
to a tripod and there's a contact port
for both this optional charging cradle
overall the Bose Soundlink revolved plus
is a piece of beautiful craftsmanship
that will look great in any room in your
house design aside let's get into the
tech let's start off with a button on
the top of the device you'll find the
power button a Bluetooth button a source
button so you can choose where your
music is playing from if the Bluetooth
or aux or volume up button in along down
life there's also a multi
function buying back into a few 31 press
pauses your music two presses get
subtract and three presses goes back
attract a long press will also activate
Siri or Google now I'm not sure about
Bigsby dome but honestly who really uses
exceed so many stocks here's how the
markets are doing there's also a
built-in microphone so you can take
calls from your cell it's involved plus
and range and clarity is pretty good as
well when you power on the device it
will first tell you the current battery
percentage and it will tell you which
devices currently pair to battery 70% in
essence you iPhone but if you're not a
fan of the voice prompts you can easily
turn them off from bodas app or by
pressing the plus and minus button
together and before I forget the Bose
logo also serves as an NFC contact point
the boss dialogue remove all plus also
has a built-in rechargeable battery with
an advertised battery life of 16 hours
but sadly I haven't been able to get
that long battery life even at Mile
revolves realistically we're looking at
a battery life of 8 to 10 hours at
mother volume with bluetooth streaming
on the sellers revolt plus is also IP
act for certified which means it's blast
resistant but just to be safe I keep it
away from water whenever you can and
don't submerge it the Bose Soundlink
Verve all plus is also using bluetooth
for that too and can connect up to two
devices right it's advertised that 30
feet and to be honest it's a little
short compared to other devices on the
market and it'll sort of losing
connection if there's a few walls
between you concerning sound qualities
Bose is known for having a balanced
sound signature on all of its devices
and the Bose Soundlink swirl valve plus
is no different as with most speakers
you're going to get the best sound
quality at moderate volume the speaker
has a decent soundstage a clear base
great vocals in the highs are clean but
I feel the instrument separation could
be better and the overall base is
lacking but I was caught off guard at
how loud his actual speaker can get but
at those louder volumes the highs do
tend to crash into vocal separation does
suffer but if the name applies to sound
like revolt plus does shoot sound in all
360 degrees and it has no problem
filling a room if it's placed in the
center of said room but when you think
the cell involved plus with an off
connection I do want to point out the
sound quality dead
prove but the speaker wouldn't play
music gets louder the speaker also takes
advantage of both disconnected my
favorite feature is being able to turn
onto speaker from the phone if you're in
range so you don't have to actually
power on the speaker and then connect
your phone and unlike other apps out
there here's one I use Sony both this
app actually works you can do things
like MEMS connected devices set the auto
off timer turn voice prompts on or off
and see the speaker's current battery
percentage and you can also connect
other sounding speakers together so you
can have the play music simultaneously
or in stereo mode but if you want to
pair other sounding speakers together
without the need of an app you can do so
by pressing and holding the Bluetooth
button and the plus button at the same
time on your speaker and then on your
other sound like speaker press and hold
the Bluetooth button and the - blend
together and after some voice prompts
the speakers should be paired but sadly
the app doesn't allow you to adjust the
EQ but in general the Bose Soundlink
Revolt plus is a piece of beautiful
hardware that will look great in any
room in your house it also it's a very
balanced sound signature and it will
have no problem filling the room but
this isn't a speaker I would pick up if
you're looking for something to take
with you on the go to cookouts camping
as an outdoor speaker or if you want to
get a party really going and it being
only ipx4 certified and having a weird
ones battery life of around 10 hours
makes it a little hard to do so instead
the Bose cellular groove all plus is
best if you're going to leave it in your
house or apartment and occasionally take
it out and I think both of that
intentionally concerning that 300 on the
price tag the craftsmanship and quality
does justify it what I would like to see
the Bose Soundlink evolved plus priced
at around 250 or $220 and I wouldn't be
surprised if Amazon put it on sale at
that price from time to time hey if you
