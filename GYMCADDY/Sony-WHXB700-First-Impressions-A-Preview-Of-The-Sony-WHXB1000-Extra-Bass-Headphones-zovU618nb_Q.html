live unboxing now I know we haven't done
one of these videos in a very long time
but we are switching things up I'm
actually going to pre record this live
unboxing and cut it up and edit it so
that when we get the fun parts and
you're not just seeing me standing and
staring into space and just going um all
the time now today's I've been boxing is
pretty exciting because we're gonna be
unboxing what I hope is the sony wh XB
702 wh XB 700 I haven't even opened this
thing up who knows it could possibly not
even be in there I think Jeffy beep
probably sent this out by accident but
we're gonna find out together all right
so let's get into this hold on up
they're in there they're in there I was
kind of worried that they probably
weren't alright here we go
I did pre-order these guys a few weeks
ago and I didn't expect to get them so
soon but they're here and we also have
the outgoing Sony W note the sony MDR XP
650 now the reason I'm pretty excited
about these headphones is because they
could be giving us a preview of what's
to come with the Sony WH xB 1000 now
ever since these Sony whatcha 700 ends
came out I like to think this is when
Sony started to push out their redesign
headphones before the Sony Watcher 700 n
so nice headphones had a much more
industrial designed to them this see
these are the sodium 1000 X and twos and
you know honestly if their build quality
has never been the best I've never been
a fan of the fake leather ear cups here
and their previous design had this
industrial design language going for it
that every single one of their
headphones in this lineup had the
stainless steel headband going across
because if we look at here the sony
50s you'll see that they also have a
very similar industrial design and again
they have that stainless steel headband
now when Sony released their watch 700
ends if their design got much sleeker
and another thing that you really notice
is that their headband is no longer
completely stainless steel if you had
like this little bit of leather bit up
here and this same exact design language
got carry it over to the Sony 1000 XM
threes
remember I absolutely love these
headphones I think they've been with me
for like six months now and I haven't
been able to find a pair of agency
headphones that I recommend over these
so a lot of these new design elements
have been pushed over to the Sony WH xB
700 and like I said I think this is a
preview of what we can expect for Sony's
replacement for their sony MDR xb9 50
and once is like a lot of numbers going
in the head right now so without further
ado let's get into these things all
right here we go alright now just so
that we get like where we're coming from
regarding price these headphones are
going for 130 bucks that's the same
price that these used to go for I like
to think that they're probably gonna be
going on sale now for less than a
hundred bucks and the Sony WH one x wh
xB 1000s I expect them to go for maybe
two maybe three hundred I think the
price might go up on those if they
really want to compete against something
like the skull candy crush or 360s
because right now the Sony xb9 50 n ones
those go for 250 but they're usually on
sale now so you can find them for much
less alright so now we're gonna get into
the star of today's show the WH xb7
hundreds actually we're gonna go to
camera
you hear I hope you're getting this it's
kind of hard being a one-man show your
desk you this here this lady oh man ah
ha ha these looks
oh alright these look sick these look
much much better than hold on here they
are these look much better than these
other backwards hold on left to right
these look much better I'm super excited
for the xb1 thousands if and when they
come out now I'm personally expecting
them to come out this year as well as
the Sony Hero on Three's right now we
have the Sony here on twos and those
headphones even though they're good they
usually retail for $300 they're very
very bulky they make the 1000x and twos
looks super sleek so definitely looking
forward to Sony improving the build
quality and design or their headphones
because for the longest Sony's
headphones would perform well but their
build quality was what suffer compared
to let's say bows or Sennheiser Sony's
headphones were it had better build
quality than um
the majority of school candies but
Skullcandy is more like a budget brand
all right so that's everything you get
in the box there is no carrying pouch
it's unfortunate but it's they're a pair
of $130 headphones so not the biggest
problem in the world now one of the
biggest things that I am super happy to
see on these headphones is that they do
in fact have you as be see if headphone
companies are starting to put out new
product we want to see us be seen
because if you have an Android device
like let's say a pixel 3 or Galaxy S 10
you want to be able to charge your
headphones and phone with the same cable
if you're still using a wired connection
to like plug in your phone which I
personally still prefer
but yet I wonder if camera two can get
this you got in this buddy USB see right
here nice to see because for comparison
I actually just finished making this
video today is gonna be posting in a few
days these are the sony sr 30 BTS and
there are a pair of really good
headphones they're just 100 bucks and
they're over ear but one of the biggest
things about them is that they don't
have an audio jack and that was
obviously for a cost savings measure so
it's definitely something you want to
take in consideration before actually
picking these headphones up but these
are good they're good hundred dollar
over your headphones and you know these
are actually on ear headphones so just
on again keep that in mind now again we
got that new sleek and we got that new
sleek low-profile design we got the
leather wrapped headband we're gonna go
ahead and snap this open not bad not bad
at all
hold on from the looks of it yeah yeah
from the looks of it
these have better build quality than the
sony what's your 700 and now i've said
this multiple times the sony watcher 700
and these are $200 headphones these are
sony's entry-level active
noise-cancelling headphones they have a
lot of features like I said they have
active noise cancellation it's not
amazing but it's there they have an
adjustable EQ you can adjust your eq
through their app they have a monstrous
35 hour battery life if i'm remembering
remembering that correctly they fit well
they have very very spacious ear cups
too good but their build quality listen
to this their build quality is just not
it's just not up there they're if their
build quality these audio technica
hundred dollar headphones put the watch
702 shame when it comes to build quality
and i also mentioned that in this vid
which you can watch by clicking on the
eye icon up there hopefully I remember
to actually link it cuz doesn't it that
video isn't going to be going out for a
few days but but ya know these they're
silent if they're silent alright and
we're actually gonna go ahead and try
them on we're gonna fit them I'm gonna
definitely app without a doubt if
they're big had approved and word back I
just took a minute to pair of ewh xb7
hundreds over to my phone and I just
opened at the Sony headphones app which
thankfully they did connect and they
connect it on the first try which um
before Sony that's a good thing actually
no just to be honest Sony's headphone
connect app is very good is their
speaker's app that that that sucks but
Sony's headphones app is pretty good so
just like before the Sony WH xB 700 s do
have a few settings to play with through
the app you can do this whole surround
thing which honestly it's it's not even
worth using I always just have it off
but here you can adjust the clear base
okay usually I like to keep mine on
seven with the xB 950 n ones but maybe
that will change I mean honestly we got
to see if the xB 700 s have more base
than the xB 650 s alright and let's see
what else we got we got the sound
position control which again that's
something that I never use I'm not
playing any music right now we got dsee
change flustering custom ones oh okay
cool these also have Google assistance
and Amazon but unfortunately it looks
like they don't have a dedicated button
I know a lot of people hate how I say
button but it's a Venegas it's a New
York thing but here at this button it
doesn't say any it doesn't say like base
control or usually would say like NC
fractus noise cancellation now obviously
these headphones don't have active noise
cancellation but instead there's button
here it says customs so it looks like
you can either have it to do voice or
system function so like oh maybe call
Siri on your iPhone or if you or if you
want to have for long Google assistant
or ELISA integration you can do that I'm
gonna keep it on voice assistant
function right now just because you on
the same I know you guys and me we're
mostly interested in how do these
headphones sound so we're gonna go ahead
and do a few and test oh okay there we
go there's the bass but I had to raise
the bass up to ten to actually like feel
the huge difference
not that at all hold on let me just so I
can hear you guys
okay so case on these is pretty good and
it's and it sounds natural
unlike let's say the crusher 360s which
actually have a motor in it that
actually shakes now one of the problems
with the commercial 360s is that even
though these headphones have a lot of
bass and they can be a lot of fun to
listen to their meds are very very
clouded whenever you get whenever you
got the bass feature turned on on these
headphones so like I've said in the past
these headphones they're mids you you
can barely hear a vocalist and again
when the bass we like it's going even
though it's fun it easily overpower the
rest of the song but in general these
headphones are a lot of fun but the bass
on these sony has always done a very
good job of having hence the name clear
bass in their headphones so definitely
these are not bad at all now just so
work clear this isn't a full review on
these headphones it wouldn't be fair to
the product and it wouldn't be fair to
you guys this is just the very
rudimentary first impressions on these
headphones like I said I wanted to check
these headphones out and get my first
impressions because I really do think
these headphones are giving you giving
us a preview of what to expect with the
replacements for
Sonne XP 950 anyone's because again if
we look at the outgoing XP 650s
okay cuz these okay because the seven
hundreds are replacing the 650s okay 700
replacing the 650s you know this design
on v6 50s
I get what Sony is going for they want
that industrial look that tough looking
headphone look but I'm not the biggest
fan of how these headphones look and I'm
also not a fan of how the XP 950
anyone's look I remember when I first
saw I saw the first time I saw the xB
950 n ones when they learned of them
your average consumer did a video on
them and he said you know it sends those
headphones stick out so much you're
probably gonna feel a little silly
walking around with them and you know I
agree those headphones when you look
through your peripheral vision you could
see them out to here and you know
there's no reason for those headphones
to be if that big cuz for example the
crusher of three sixties these or
extremely bass-heavy headphones but they
still look good there's still low
profile if they have a classic design to
them and they still look good so if Sony
can get us the XP 1000s looking like
this then I would be a happy camper now
again I just want to make you know I
just want if the xB 1000s to have this
same type of design language the same
type of build quality because this build
quality does in in fact put the watch
700 ends to shame and again remember
these are 200 all the headphones and you
know if they typically go on sale for
like 150 sometimes 130 on prime day and
during the holidays they were going for
two or no $99 you know definitely for 99
bucks
I would pick these
but for $200 and phones their build
quality is does pale in comparison to
these new guys and again I do want to
see the XP 1000s be more like this this
design language not been and we got like
this these whole cutouts on up here hold
on let's see if we can get these cutouts
going
I wonder if camera 2 can get this you
know that's pretty that's pretty cool
but most importantly I want the 1000 the
xB 1000 to be much more low-profile and
the same thing goes for is a hero on
three so here on threes they if they
stick out a lot so we want headphones
that look good low profile but these
these are not that at all alright so I
guess you guys can expect a full review
on these maybe in a week or so I do want
to take my time get to know them before
I actually make a video on them but xB
wh what 700s not bad at all makes me
very excited for the sony wh XP 1000s
and now all we need is for sony to
actually release them if you made it
this far
I guess you enjoyed the video so hit
that like button and get subscribed a
house someone didn't you realize if you
want to pick another part except mention
in this video those will be linked in
description down below any girls will
