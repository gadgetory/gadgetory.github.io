then the Sony gtk xb7 is for you for
less than some larger portable speakers
you can get this behemoth with a
built-in light feature but even though
the sony xba-1 has its pros it also has
some quirks but is the sony XP 7 right
for you
or about to find out don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe and if you
want to hear a sound comparison of the
sony xba-1 check out my is bigger always
better video here after you're done
watching this video the sony gtk xb7 has
been on the market for a while now and
when it first came out it was retailing
for 349 99 but now most of Sony's lineup
is on sale and you can get those Sony XP
7 for 246 92 on Amazon and just like
most of Sony's other speakers they come
in multiple color ways the XP 7 comes in
black blue or red if you want to pick
the speaker up I'll have links in
description below and I'll keep it
updated so you can get the best deal
possible alright so let's go over the
form factor first the sony XPS 25 point
6 inches tall 12 point 8 inches wide and
thirteen point four inches thick or for
my overseas viewers is 65 centimeters by
33 centimeters by 34 centimeters
basically it's the size of a toddler or
a large dog and it weighs in at 26 and a
half pounds or 12 kilos the majority of
the body is made out of plastic there's
some more paneling on the back and the
front is a painted metal grille while
transporting the sony xba-1 to different
locations
I noticed it got scratched very easily
but the majority of the scratches easily
wiped off but transporting the xp7 was a
little easier thanks to the handles on
either side on the top of the device you
will notice it's a power button volume
control buttons and an extra base button
and a function button to switch between
audio sources for all of your other
playback needs there's an included
remote controller it's simple and very
lightweight you can even cycle through
some of the light features or even turn
them off right from the remote and on
the top of the xp7 there's also a slot
so you can rest your phone or tablet and
there's an NFC touch point for easy
pairing if you have an Android device on
the back of the device you will find RCA
inputs and outputs so you can hook up
your TV if you like or chain other
speaker
together there's also a USB port so you
can charge your devices or play audio
files off of a USB stick and you'll also
find the party team button so you can
pair a multiple xb7 together and the
speaker add by and so you can pair two
xb7 together and have them play left or
right audio unfortunately I wasn't able
to pair the xp7 with my smaller XP 40 or
XP 30 which was a huge letdown and
finally you've got your ACN to power the
speaker controlling technical
specifications the Sony XP 7 has 2 6 and
3/8 inch woofers and 3-2 inch tweeters
on the front and you will also notice an
opening in the middle of the speaker to
let out all the air the woofers displace
while playing music the light feature on
the XP 7 is also the most capable in
Sony's extra bass line up there are two
light strips on either side that can
flash independently and in different
colors of one another
there are also LEDs that illuminate the
woofers and unlike the XP 40 which can
only flash white the woofers on the XP 7
can also flash in different colors and
finally there are strobe lights on
either side of the device the sony xba-1
is using bluetooth 3.0 and i've managed
to get a range over around 50 feet with
their rec line-of-sight with my phone
but even though the XP 7 is using
bluetooth 3.0 there is minimal lag when
watts and videos the audio is a little
behind when people are talking on-screen
but it's bearable but for those of you
wondering the sony xba-1 does not have a
built-in battery and it is not
waterproof nor splash resistant so if
you're going to be using this speaker by
a pool make sure Jason doesn't splash it
with this cannonball and if it starts
raining you better rush it inside now
before we start talking about sound
quality I just wanted to play now even
though this speaker has two built-in
woofers and three tweeters at any given
time you're only using two of those
three tweeters if you stand this speaker
up you're effectively using both woofers
and the top two tweeters but if you lay
the speaker flat you're still using both
woofers and the top tweeters relative to
its position I just wanted to point that
out for people wondering where the xp7
has three tweeters instead of a
symmetrical four tweeters in each corner
even though changing the orientation of
the speaker does technically
mr. speaker layout it doesn't really
affect the overall sound quality if you
listen to the speaker in the different
layouts back-to-back and know what to
listen for
you'll notice the soundstage gets a
little wider and the vocals get pushed
back a bit if the speakers are like flat
but if you're casually listening you're
not gonna notice that their face like I
mention in my is bigger always better
video the Sony XP 7 has a lot of bass
it's gonna shake your walls and it's
gonna shake your insides and the bass is
its own entity the xp7 also has really
good estimate separation but the vocals
can get a little too ford at times
obviously the xb7 can get very loud but
at those hard volumes there's a lot of
distortion going on and the bass starts
to come out of the sound for the best
listening experience I would keep this
speaker below 75% volume but in most
cases you're Naturals going to buy the
sony xba-40 for strictly personal
listening you might be looking into the
speaker to host parties and if that's
the case then the sony xba-1
will get the job done with no problem
for large get-togethers both indoors and
outdoors
now when it comes to the light feature
you can cycle through on/off chill or
rave straight from the controller or you
can use music center available on both
Android and Apple to cycle through more
light settings and even though I've
stated in the past Sony's mobile apps
aren't the best music Center has
improved and gotten more stable but it
is still a pain to use at times in music
Center you can cycle through rave chill
or rave mode without the strobe lights
on each side with stay cold and the
flash off and strobe you've also got hot
which will only display warm colors and
cool which will only display cool colors
like blues greens and teals and if you
want to speak it to stay illuminated in
one solid color you can pick either of
the study settings but even though the
lighting feature on the sony xba-1 is
the most capable in sony's lineup sony
really dropped the ball when it comes to
customization with the XP 40 you can use
the Fiesta Bowl app to customize life
feature but the XP 7 can't pair with
Fiesta Bowl you're stuck with the
presets in Music Center I find it
annoying that the XP 7 doesn't have any
customization options there's so much
potential there another annoying I have
about the sony xba-1 is even though it
has
USB port and RCA inputs there's no
oxygen so you can't use a wired
connection with your phone you can only
use bluetooth and if you're using this
speaker at a party or get-together with
friends you can't just pass the aux cord
you have to go through the Bluetooth
setup process every single time if you
want to use a different device and I
don't know about you but there's always
that one person in a group of friends
that doesn't know how to set up a
Bluetooth device on their phone and
since the speaker is using bluetooth 3.0
it can't be paired to multiple devices
at the same time and I also don't like
how you can't turn off or control the
light feature directly from the speaker
you have to use a controller and it's a
problem because when you turn off the
speaker for the first time it's been
plugged in by default the light will
stay on in cycle 3 different colors
unless you turn them off from the
controller and since I'm constantly
plugging and unplugging the speaker it
gets annoying after a while and I also
don't like how there aren't any music
control buttons on the speaker either
you have to control the music playback
either with the speaker's controller or
from whatever device you're streaming
from and sometimes you don't know where
either one of those are and you just
want to pause or skip a track but with
those minor grievances aside the Sony XP
7 is still a solid pickup for 250
dollars the sheer amount of bass the
speaker has to offer will please anyone
who routinely listens to rap hip-hop EDM
or any other type of music with lots of
bass the lighting feature is cool but
remember this speaker is not water
resistant so you have to keep an eye on
it when using it outside or by the pool
I want to get this for personal
listening but the xp7
is great for parties if Sony is working
on an updated version of the XP 7 I
would like to see them make it lighter
add control buttons on the top of the
device and throw in some Bluetooth 5.0
ok so here's a sound test both of these
speakers are playing in the same room at
the same distance away from the same
microphone streaming from the same
source and playing at the same decibel
level so hopefully the only independent
variable is sound quality comment down
