if we go to headphones for both normal
consumers and professionals just looking
for well-built and good sounding
headphones but now we have the audio
technica ath m50x bt they have the same
styling as before except now they're
wireless they have a touchpad and they
have onboard media controls and I think
these headphones are so good they've
actually joined the Sony watch 700 and
in my most recommended 200 headphones
club but I like these for a whole other
set of reasons and will recommend them
to a very different type of person than
I would recommend if these two and we'll
find out which of these two headphones
alright for you have to work from one of
our partners Nord VPN is a simple and
affordable way to keep your data safe
and secure whether you're browsing at
home or on public Wi-Fi every other day
you hear about some massive data breach
on the news so you should take some
steps to keep yourself safe while you
browse the internet with Nord VPN you
can keep your browsing habits hidden
from your isp governments and other
third parties like hackers you can
bypass content restrictions and
censorships if you're overseas and your
ISP will no longer be able to throttle
your internet speed know what VPN can do
a lot more but these are the main
reasons that I use them see how you can
enjoy three years of online security for
only $2.99 a month by clicking on the
link in description down below the audio
technica ath m50x bt currently retails
for $200 which isn't that bad because
the non Wireless version typically
retails for $150 meaning that going
Wireless is just a $50 premium unlike
the HyperX cloud mix which carries a
hundred ala premium over its non
Wireless version and for comparison the
Sony Watcher 700 n also retails for $200
but routinely goes on sale if you want
to pick either these headphones up I'll
have links in description below and if
you use the links layups off the channel
I suggest you check them out coz so nice
headphones routinely go on sale so you
might get lucky so first let's go over
what comes in the box then 50 X's come
included with a plug there carrying
pouch which admittedly is a pretty snug
fit for these headphones even though
these headphones are built like a tank I
still suggest to invest on a hard shell
carrying case if you plan on traveling
or working with these headphones if
you're a content creator now 50 X's also
come included with a micro USB cable for
charge
now yeah it does suck that these
headphones have microUSB in late 2018
but I think Audio Technica did that as a
cost-saving measure these headphones
also come included with a 3.5 to 3.5 mm
audio cable with an inline mic and play
pause button but I also wish these
headphones came included with a coiled
audio cable or a three meter audio cable
like the bass m50x is do for those who
actually plan on working with these
headphones now like I just mentioned
these headphones are built like a tank
even though the majority of the
construction is plastic the ear cups
pivot swivel 90 degrees very smoothly
and every direction when you adjust the
sizing of the headband there's a very
satisfying and starting click to it and
when you actually flex the headband
there isn't any excessive cracking
because for comparison even though I
really like the Sony watch the 700 ends
because they pack a lot of features for
their price their build quality isn't
amazing and it's definitely not on par
of that of the m50 X's now when it comes
to fit then 50 X's have a looser snug
fit as then they hold on pretty well
onto your head but they aren't as snug
as a watch a 700 on but they aren't as
loose as premium E&amp;amp;C headphones which
tend to have very little clamping force
for maximum comfort
but obviously the ath m50x be teased or
bighead approved I mean these headphones
are basically gonna fit anybody but even
though I am a fan of how these
headphones fit I do have some complaints
about the padding on these ear cups
these headphones are pretty large
compared to a lot of other headphones
out there and I would have liked to see
in the pattern on these ear cups be a
little more spacious relative to their
size
whenever I'm editing a video or
listening to music with the m50x
beetee's I can opal feel my medium
flushed ears are a little cramped and I
want to point this out because even
though the watch a 700 ends are smaller
and more low-profile than the N 50 X's
their ear cups are significantly more
spacious so even though the 88m 50 X's
are great I do think Audio Technica
should we designed your ear cups to be a
little more spacious especially for
professionals that have to wear these
headphones for hours on end but given
how easy it is to remove the ear pads on
these headphones you can easily get
upgraded ear pads online we're going
Tech Specs 1050 X's all rocking
Bluetooth 5.0 they have app
support and if you're an iPhone user but
good for watching videos on your phone
because they have a very little latency
whereas the Sony watch a 700 I'm only
good for watching videos on your phone
if you're using an Android device
because they do have a little bit of
latency when used with an iPhone because
Apple insists on solely using the AAC
codec but bad news for both of these
headphones they can both only be
connected to one device at a time which
does suck if you're a power user but
when it comes to battery life both of
these headphones are masters audio
technica advertises a 40 hour battery
life on their 88 m50x b-team and sony
advertises a 35 hour battery life on
their watch a 700 ends and that's with a
and C turned on if you use them with ANC
turned off you should be able to get a
longer battery life but either way both
of these headphones should easily last
you two weeks in between charges if not
more but now let's talk about sound
quality
just like before the ath m50x BTS have
on which of sound signature which is
great for professionals who actually
plan on working with these headphones
and this was good for people who just
prefer to sound signature whenever they
listen to music
the highs never peak the mids have good
detail and separation and the bass gets
deep but it doesn't kick you like some
other headphones specifically the watch
700 n for some people whenever they
listen to music with their headphones
they're just want to hear the music they
also want to feel it that's why some
people gravitate towards bass heavy
headphones and that's why other
headphones like the Skullcandy question
360s are so popular the watch has 700
ends give you that kick you're looking
for them but their audio fidelity isn't
as good as the 88 and 50x BTS even if
you were to go into the watch 700 ends
app and give them a new show sound
signature similar to the m50 ex's
their clarity and instrument separation
just isn't as good as the audio
Technica's but they still sound decent
so that's why I feel the Sony watch has
700 islands or better suited for normal
consumers that want to have a good time
with their headphones and the audio
technica or better suited for people and
pros who want or need a more accurate
reproduction of their audio but still
want headphones that they can take on
the go with them but just so that there
isn't any confusion because this
question has popped up a lot lately
these headphones don't have an active
noise cancellation
[Laughter]
but still you aren't missing much when
it comes to a and C unsub 200 all the
headphones compared to more premium ones
ANC on super headphones is really only
worth using to block out a small amount
of constant road noise and you're still
going to get a lot of ambient sound when
wearing either of these headphones
outdoors but expanding on this whole I
like both of these headphones but would
recommend them to very different types
of people theme the ath m50x bt or gifts
for people who want to work with them in
the studio in the editing Bay or on a
set but then wear them under commute
back home one of the most important
things I want to point out about the 88
m50x BTS is that if you try to use them
with a wired connection they can only be
used passively as in they automatically
power off but when they're you as
passively they still produce a very
clear and accurate sound because we're
comparison most ANC headphones can be
used passively but they don't sound good
the basin highs are Avera but the mids
aren't so they sound very shallow so if
you want to use a pair of anc headphones
to monitor the audio in your project you
have to use them while powered on so if
you're on a set with a lot of moving
parts that's one more thing to remember
to keep charged so that's why lots of
people still prefer to use wired
headphones or Bluetooth headphones
without a and C so that's one of those
small details as to why I would
recommend the audio Technica's to
professionals and then when you're done
with work you can leave the war behind
and enjoy the great sound quality of the
ath m50x BTS have to offer wirelessly
now one of the things I'm glad I Audio
Technica didn't include these headphones
what the touch control is found on their
ath anc 700 bt quite point headphones
the touch pad was so bad on those
headphones it actually ruined them from
him instead the m50x BTS have your
standard volume up volume down and play
pause by and set up on the left ear cup
besides being on the left ear cup and
having to press and hold the volume up
and volume down buttons to skip through
your music I like them and they get the
job done but the m50x BTS still have a
touch pad on the left here a cup that he
can press and hold to summon your voice
assistant
I don't get why you can't just press and
hold the play/pause button to do this
like on most other older headphones and
I would have personally preferred to not
have a touchpad if it meant that that
money could have gone towards upgrading
these headphones to USBC and if audio
technica is using the touchpad feature
on the m50x BTS
to make them look more impressive or
high-tech then I wish they also had
direct voices as an integration which is
increasingly becoming more popular on
headphones these days one bt c equals
3334 United States dollars and 99 cents
you got it turning two lights on but
just going off of their software and
just how unimpressive their audio
technica connect that base I don't have
any high hopes of seeing Google
assistant integration making its way
onto these headphones in the future like
you did on the Sony watch 700 N and
finally here's the microphone test and
just like most of the headphones out
there the audio quality still isn't that
great for phone calls and it's not just
audio talking to come every company out
there should be doing better with the
microphones on their headphones if they
want me to be more popular but overall
like I said at the beginning of this
video I like and recommend the new
eighty-eight m50x bt over the Sony watch
700 N for a very different set of
reasons just like before the ath m50x
BTS have very good build quality fit
very well and sound very good they're a
great option for people who want or need
only to sound signature and the great
option for professionals who want a pair
of headphones they can work with and
continue to use throughout the rest of
the day
although the a th and 50x BTS aren't as
featured pack like newer headphones that
have an adjustable eq active noise
cancellation and voices system
integration they do exactly what they
need to do and that sound good if you
made it this far I guess you enjoyed the
video so hit that like button and get
subscribed it helps out more than you
realize support the channel by clicking
on the links down below and I'll catch
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
