all the rays these days
besides ear pods I still prefer to use
wired earbuds at the gym because they
usually have a longer battery life their
Bluetooth connectivity is much more
stable they cost less and more
importantly you still have full media
controls cuz of their inline controller
and since they came out two years ago
I've always really liked the chamber in
X threes and I've never had a problem
recommending them but now we have the
new j-bert X 4 and the more affordable
cheaper Terra they're not entirely new
but there are some upgrades worth
talking about the new j-bert x4 is
currently retail for one $29.99 which is
what the x3 is used to retail for
whereas the new j-bert era is a little
more affordable with the retail price of
$99.99 if you want to pick use of these
earphones up I'll have long description
below and if you use the links really
helps out to channel I highly suggest
you to check them out because you never
know what these earphones might go on
sale and also checking my shelf down
below at first glance it's kind of hard
to tell the difference between the
jaybird x3 x4 Xanterra because they look
in perform very similarly to the DX
threes and that's not a bad thing the X
stories are just that good but first
let's talk about the included
accessories cause there is a noticeable
difference just like the X 3s the x 4's
come included with the carrying pouch
and thankfully the new carrying pouch is
slightly bigger than the X threes
whereas the Jaber Terra don't come with
a carrying pouch at all unlike the X 3s
which come included with three sets of
earphones three sets of round silicon
ear tips three sets of comply ear tips
any few cable management clips things
have been a little streamlined with the
X fours you still get three sets of your
friends but now you only get two sets of
oval silicon ear tips two sets of
compliant your tips and instead of cable
management clips the X fours now have a
built-in fastener which I personally
find much easier to use but there are
still a clip so you can attach the
access cable to your shirt and finally
the Terra come included with the least
amount of hardware and we're gonna dive
into their new ear tips in a few you may
have noticed by now that all three of
these earphones also come included with
proprietary charging cables which is a
double
sword on one hand it allows neighbor to
keep their inline controller and earbuds
very low-profile cuz they don't need to
add a USB C port for charging but it is
one more cable to keep track of even
though the x3 and x4 still use the same
cradle to charge the x4 is updated cable
is a little more refined
but unfortunately Terra doesn't use the
same charging cradle as the x3 and x4
which I personally find a little odd
Terra's inline controller is also very
different from the inline controllers
found on the x3 and x4 even though it's
slightly thinner it's also slightly
taller and wider you have the same basic
three control buttons with the same read
tactile feedback but I actually prefer
Terra's raised extra buttons because
they're easier to tell apart just by
feel but all three of these your phones
still have the same soft touch flat
tangle free cable and even the earbuds
on the x3 and x4 are identical to the
same shape and they're the same size but
the earbuds on the Terra are a little
different from the earbuds on the x4
terrorist earbuds are basically the same
size as the x4 0 buds but since they're
a little angled they do stick out a
little more but it's barely even
noticeable but perhaps the biggest and
most noticeable difference between the
new j-bert Tara and j-bird x4 is going
to be your customization options when it
comes to fit and how you wear these
earphones the j / tera have a similar
system to what you would find on the
bose sound sport free the ear tip and
ear fin are all one piece and they're
easy to take off and put on but you can
only wear these earphones one way
personally the me don't you trips fit me
just fine and I haven't had any issues
with them but the x4 is give you way
more options when it comes to fit and
how you wear these earphones and that's
kind of why the X threes were so popular
since that your tips and your fins are
two different pieces you can mix and
match until you get your perfect fit
since the x 4's also come included will
comply ear tips you can use them if you
want to get a more snug fit and more
passive noise isolation than what the
silicone ear tips can offer but since I
do find them to get a little itchy after
a while I just like the SEL cone and if
you want you don't even have to wear the
ear fins at all and if you want you can
also wear them in there over ear style
for an even more secure fit what I'm
getting at is the x4 is
you more than enough options but I do
want to point out that the new year fins
on the x-force and Terra's are slightly
different from the ear fins from the
previous X 3 the new ear fins are
slightly rounder and softer than the
older your fins and I will admit that
the new air fins are less noticeable
when you have them in you don't feel
them as much but I do miss the pattern
found on the older fins cuz to me it
just looked like cooler ok
now design a fit out of the way let's
talk about touch bags perhaps the
biggest to expect difference between the
older x3 and the new x4 and Terra is
that jabbers new earphones are now ipx7
rated which means the waterproof down to
one meter of water but you can't use
them for swimming because your Bluetooth
connection is going to cut out I tried
it now this new ipx7 reading is nice to
have but personally I've never really
had a problem with my X threes even
after they were drenched in sweat on a
regular basis battery life from the x3
and x4 is also the same they both
advertise an eight hour battery life I
can go for three full workout sessions
in between charges with the X fours but
the terrorists do take a hit when it
comes to battery life because these only
have a six hour battery life so these
can only go for two workout sessions and
then don't die midway through my third
but jabbers new your phone's also now
feature quick charging so if you charge
either these earphones on for 10 minutes
from a dead battery I'm gonna get you
one hour of playback time it's not huge
but it is a step up from the x-rays but
just like all of Jaybirds other earbuds
both the x4 and tera connect to Jaybirds
music app out of the box these earphones
have a flat sound semester but through
the app you can go in and adjust EQ to
make them sound however you want and
since the new EQ setting is getting
uploaded directly to your buds your EQ
setting will following you from device
to device so if you want you can make
these earbuds have just as much or even
more based on power beats or you can
make them have an emphasis on vocals the
choice is yours
and in general tapers are one of the
better sounding earphones out there they
have good clarity deep punchy bass and
there's really anything in the highs but
obviously you're not going to get
audiophile of sound quality out of these
earbuds but for working out they're
perfectly fine and to control your music
playback you have it in my controller on
both of these earbuds
like I said earlier the reason I like
using white earbuds like these over
truly Wireless here but at the gym is
because you have full control over your
music playback with most truly wireless
earbuds you only have partial control
and you have to rely on your voice
assistant for the rest and I find that
having to use your voice assistant isn't
as accurate as fast or as easy as having
a dedicated bind sometimes the only
thing I don't like about jabbers
controller is that you have to press and
hold the plus or minus button to skip a
track or go back a track I would prefer
it if we could double press and triple
press the start button but instead if
you don't press the center button on the
X fours you will redouble your last
phone call and honestly since the
microphone on both the X 4 is karol make
you sound pretty far away I just want to
take phone calls with either the except
phone partially I would actually really
like if we could remap them or double
pressing the center button on the X for
does cuz double pressing the center
button on the Jay bird Terrell will
instead summon your voices system and
personally I prefer this over redialing
my last phone call so if you need to
talk to Siri or Google assistant there
are just two taps away on the Jay bird
Tara
but overall besides some cosmetic
changes and marginally better tech specs
there really isn't a big difference
between the J Brand X 3 and the new
j-bert X 4 that's not a bad thing the X
threes are just that good if you're
ain't broken don't fix it if you have
the X threes and if you're working just
fine then there's no need to upgrade but
the X fours do bring with them a
slightly more comfortable fit and ipx7
reading and fast charging now if you're
trying to choose between the x4 and the
Tarot then yeah you're still better off
going with the X fours because they have
a slightly better battery life they give
you more fit options and they bring that
all-important carrying case but the
Terra are still fine for
budget-conscious people you're getting
the same sound quality and the same
build quality but personally I would
actually like to see Jaber to
incorporate the raised tactile buttons
from the Tara on the X for service
buttons are just much easier to tell
apart and I really want to be able to
remap what the settle button does on the
x4
