that yes I do have a bias towards over
your headphones which makes it all that
more surprising to me and how much I
actually like the new Marshall made ANC
on your headphones now these aren't for
me and they definitely have their quirks
but these are still a pair of very solid
headphones and now I really want to see
an on-ear version of these headphones
for Marshall no Marshall did not send
these headphones out for review and the
new Marshall made a and C on your
headphones are currently the most
expensive headphones in Marshalls line
up retelling for $269 if you want to
pick these headphones up I'll have links
in description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel I
feel that paying two hundred seventy
dollars for a pair of on IRRI ANC
headphones is a lot given that for the
same amount of money you can get to Sony
here on to or for just two hundred
dollars you can get the Sony CH 700 N or
the Audio Technica quiet points which
are all over ear ANC headphones but the
Marshall mid ANC justified that two
hundred seventy dollar price tag with
their overall to build quality and
included accessories the minion C come
included with a very good-looking
carrying case which is made of the same
textured leather found on the headband
on these headphones now this carrying
case is nice but I found that it can get
a little cramped if you try to stuff the
charging and audio cables with the
headphones inside the case but without a
doubt this is one of the best looking
carrying cases that come included with a
pair of headphones in this price range
they included charging cable and audio
cable are also weighing nicer than what
most other ANC headphones come included
with unfortunately the minion C are
still using a micro USB port for
charging and I strongly feel Marshall
should have used a USB C port instead
but above the micro USB port there's an
easy-to-reach 3.5 mm audio jack for
while listening and if you wanted to you
can also daisy chain another pair of
headphones to the mid ANC
so you can both hear what's playing when
listening to music wirelessly
the overall build quality of the
Marshall made ANC is just top-notch
you've got very textured leather on the
headband in ear cups there's soft
microfiber cloth underneath the headband
the frame is a black anodized metal and
roll the headphones weigh in at just 208
grams and when the headphones collapse
with storage they take up very little
space but personally I don't think the
men ANC are great for commuting because
when they're placed inside their
carrying case they do take up a good
amount of room but Marshalls choice in
materials and design make the male ANC a
pair of very good-looking and well-built
headphones I actually think these are
overall way better than the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen h8i on your headphones which
retail for $400
but when it comes to comfort I just
can't wear these headphones for long
periods of time because they constantly
press against my ears but the clamping
force on these headphones isn't too bad
they do have a snug fit so they do stay
in place very well and they're very
low-profile design might make them
better suited for women with smaller
heads the ear cups pivot a lot and sense
the flexible headband give the ear cups
a good amount of swivel these headphones
have no problem conforming to most head
types regarding tech specs Marshall
advertises a battery life of 20 hours
with ANC and Bluetooth turned on and in
my testing with ANC and Bluetooth turned
on and with the volume set at 50 percent
the million see average 16 hours of
playback time and with ANC turned off
the mini NC managed to hit 25 hours
playback time so better life on these
headphones isn't amazing compared to
other headphones in this price segment
but for their small size it's still
passable but unfortunately these
headphones have no form of quick
charging when it comes to wireless
connectivity these headphones have about
a forty four range and I never really
suffered from any connection issues even
with a wall or two between the
headphones and my phone but the mid ANC
have a lot of latency so I would not
recommend these headphones if you watch
a lot of videos on your phone like I do
and these headphones can only be
connected to one device at a time so
that's something to take into
consideration if you're a power user but
I do have to give credit where credit is
due
the active noise cancellation on the mid
ANC performed much better than I
expected it to given that they are on
your headphones they offer a lot of
passive noise isolation with ANC turned
off but when the active noise
cancellation is turned on they do an
effective job of blocking
a lot of noise pollution in the lower
end mid frequency range and the ANC all
these headphones have very little cabin
pressure which most people should be
able to get used to after a while and
there's also no hissing when the ANC is
turned on but you're not playing music
in the background
when it comes to sound quality the
midian see have for the most part on
neutral sound signature with just the
right amount of based in trouble these
headphones have very good clarity the
basin never bottoms out and there's no
tinting in the highs but I can't help
but want a wider soundstage on these
headphones for the most part I haven't
had to adjust the EQ on the medallion
see since I got them but it would have
been nice to have an ad where I could
easily play around the EQ these
headphones do get unnecessarily loud but
I feel these are best for easy listening
cuz the bass on these headphones isn't
going to rattle your head like other
headphones out there but what's really
amazing is the amount of sound leakage
these headphones have there's barely any
which I feel is a testament for how well
these headphones are actually built now
let's talk about how you go about
controlling your music playback on the
MIDI and see I don't hate the nub but I
also don't love it first it's on the
left ear cup and personally I would have
preferred if it was on the right ear cup
if you press the knob once it'll play or
pause your music push up to raise the
volume push down to lower the volume
push right to skip a track and push left
to go back a track and if you double
press you'll activate your voice
assistant and the knob has very good
tactile feedback any time you press or
push it in any direction and it's also
very easy to find but when you first use
the controls there is a bit of a
learning curve and even after I've
gotten used to using the knob I still
find myself using the wrong inputs to
control my music sometimes I'll
accidentally skip a track right I need
to raise the volume or instead of
skipping the track I'll restart the same
track a few times before I realize I'm
pushing the knob in the wrong direction
I feel the knob would be much easier to
use if it only moved up or down - it's
just a volume double press to skip a
track triple press to go back a track
and press and roll to activate your
voice assistant ok and here is the
microphone test now there is a lot of
amplification
and my voice might sound a little raspy
now and then but overall I think the
microphone on these headphones is good
enough if you're going to be taking a
lot of phone calls but this audio clip
has been recorded by the microphone on
the Marshall made agency on ear
headphones so you can so like I said at
the beginning of this video the Marshall
met ANC aren't for me because they're on
your headphones but I can't deny they
are still very good for what they are
and I think the premium accessories
build quality and materials used on
these headphones justify the $270 price
tag they sound pretty good and the ANC
actually does a very good job of
blocking out a fair amount of ambient
sound I think these are a great option
for a woman looking for headphones but
don't want something as big as the bose
qc25 series 2 or sony 1000 XM 2 if
you're considering getting the be solo 3
just get these instead but now I want to
see Marshall put out on monitor and see
over your headphone
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
