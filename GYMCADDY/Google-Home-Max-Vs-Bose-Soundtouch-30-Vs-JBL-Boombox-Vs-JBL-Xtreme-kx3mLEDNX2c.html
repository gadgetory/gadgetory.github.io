they said that they set out to make the
best sounding speaker they possibly
could so I wanted to see how the Google
home max stacked up compared to some
popular options out there like the Bose
soundTouch 30 JBL boombox and
everybody's favorite JBL Xtreme let's
see how good the Google home actually is
if you want to pick either these
speakers up I'll have learn so
description below and if you use either
of the links it really helps out the
channel before we get into the sound
test let's go over what's under the hood
of each of these speakers cuz it matters
you may know by now that the Google home
max has dual 4.5 inch woofers and dual
point seven inch tweeters and it also
has the advantage of Google's smart
sound which uses machine learning to
automatically adjust this EQ depending
on its environment the JBL boombox is
the most rugged speaker in this group
and it also has a built in battery it's
also rocking dual four inch woofers dual
point eight inch tweeters and dual
passive radiators on each side both
sound so sturdy is the most expensive
biggest and heaviest speaker in this
lineup winged in at 18 and a half pounds
whereas both the Max and boom box weigh
just a little under 12 pounds but even
though the Bose soundTouch sturdy is the
biggest and heaviest speaker in this
lineup it has the least amount of
hardware generating its sound the Bose
has dual two-inch tweeters and 14.5 inch
woofer and I'm also going to include the
JBL extreme in this comparison cuz a lot
of people love this speaker and it's one
of the best speakers you can get right
now especially since it's on sale the
Xtreme has a similar setup to the
boombox except smaller it has dual two
and a half inch woofers dual one point
four inch tweeters and dual passive
radiators on each side now you know what
each of these speakers is packing we can
get into the sound test in order to make
this as fair as possible all of these
speakers are playing at the same
loudness in the same room playing off of
the same device and at the same distance
away from the same microphone so
hopefully the only difference here is
sound quality but if you want you can
also skip to this timecode
and get my thoughts on each of these
speakers performance and final verdict
copied into this place
okay so first let's answer a very common
question that a lot of people are going
to ask and that's which speaker gets the
loudest the Bose soundTouch story gets
the loudest in this group living in the
lone 90 decibel range but at that volume
you're going to get a lot of sound
Distortion
whereas the max is the second loudest
and sounds the best in this group and
max volume it doesn't much better job of
preserving the integrity of its sound
quality like I said on my initial review
the amount of bass to Google home max
has is what amazes me the most this
speaker has the deepest lows and
punchy's bass in this room and it also
has good instrument separation but the
mids and vocals are little push back and
as a result the max can get overpowered
by its own bass even the bass really
gets going the Bose soundTouch 30 is all
about vocals vocalists are front and
center on the speaker but instruments
and everything else in the mids or as
well to find and the highest can get
pretty bright the low wins are okay but
definitely not as deep as the others and
the bass packs the least amount of punch
in this group and when it comes to the
table boombox this speaker is a pretty
good middle ground between the max and
the sound touch low-end performance is
very similar to the Google home max but
the bass is not as punchy and the vocals
aren't as pushed back as the max but
they aren't as forward as the sound
touch vocals are exactly where they need
to be and everything else in the mids
is still present but in JBL fashion this
speaker does have a lot of trouble and
when it comes to comparing the JBL
extreme to the google home max the low
ends and bass of the extreme are not
even comparable to the max
although the vocals are more pronounced
instrument separation on the extreme is
nowhere near as good as the max and the
highs are much brighter as well the
google home max obviously
classes too JBL extreme and quite
honestly I would be shocked if it didn't
although I really think the vocals on
the Google home max need to be about
forward a bit this is my speaker of
choice right now the Google home max is
a great speaker for bass lovers and as a
result you can really feel the music
when using the max at almost any volume
and that's really impressive given that
it's smaller than the boombox in
soundTouch 30 now those smart sound play
a huge part in the max of sound quality
I honestly don't know I really don't
notice the difference in performance
when I move the max from one room to
another but like I said on my initial
review maybe Google might improve the
sound quality of the max through a
software update but for sure Google did
knock it out of the park on their first
try with their Google home max now I
just want them to give me more touch
controls on the max and fix their
original Google home because the
original Google home is just not good
