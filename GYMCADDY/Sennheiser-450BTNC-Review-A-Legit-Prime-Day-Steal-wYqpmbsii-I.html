4.5 opt NC headphones and I know these
headphones are a little over a year old
now but these headphones went on sale on
Friday for just 98 dollars which was a
legit steal and I'm willing to bet these
headphones are going to go on sale again
on Black Friday 2018 and if that's the
case your Thanksgiving and put some
turkeys down in the comment box below so
whether you're planning on getting these
headphones at their full retail price or
on sale let's see what the sanitizers
4.500 BT NC headphones are all about and
the tab that's recording these
headphones are a little over a year old
now these headphones were released
around April of 2017 and they retail for
$180 you can get them in any color you
want as long as it's black and if you
want to make these headphones up I'll
have links in description below and if
you use the links only helps out the
channel I suggest you talked about coz
these headphones routinely go on sale so
you might get lucky and also check out
the demurrer shelf down below regarding
what comes in the box these headphones
are all pretty standard issue you get a
2.5 to 3.5 Munna audio cable micro USB
cable for charging and this soft shell
carrying case plainly put this soft
shell carrying case isn't going to do
much protecting so if you plan on
traveling with these headphones on a
regular basis I highly advise to invest
in a hard shell carrying case the
majority of these headphones is made out
of plastic but their build quality is
actually very good body panels are very
well aligned and overall there are very
tight tolerances the underside of the
headband is minimally patter silicone so
it helps keep these headphones in place
regarding the ear pads they are covered
in very smooth faux leather and the
padding itself is not too firm but not
too soft and inside the ear pads there
are some felt material covering the
transducers and yes these ear pads are
removable the right ear cup houses all
of your buttons and ports which I
personally wish were better labeled
there's your power button and meter
controls which I will touch on in a
minute a 2.5 mm Berta audio jack and a
mic USB port for charging one of my
first issues with these headphones is
that since this audio jack is so hard to
reach it does limit your cable options
if you plan on getting
better audio cable in the future when it
comes to design and fit I'm gonna be
honest when I first saw the product
pictures I thought they were pretty ugly
but actually seeing these headphones on
me I think they're pretty dope I think
their shape and the silver contrasting
against the black makes these headphones
look very classy you may have noticed by
now that these headphones do fold up but
they do not lay down flat but that your
pads on these headphones do pivot and
swivel more than enough to accommodate
most head types and these headphones sit
very comfortably on the head even though
these headphones do fit a little snug
these are big head approved but we do
need to look at these cushions these
cushions are thick and the opening for
your ear is pretty narrow so if you have
larger ears then they'll might rest on
your earlobes or they might feel a
little cramped for me they don't feel
too cramped and they don't rest on my
earlobes overheating also isn't an issue
if you're just sitting watching a video
or listening to music on the bus but if
you're going to be walking around with
them on then spray your cups are a
persistent problem now remember these
headphones do not lay down flat ear cups
are pretty big if you rest them around
your neck they're going to severely
limit your head your range of motion and
this can get pretty annoying if you're
at the airport or at the bus terminal
you have to talk to somebody at the off
front desk we're going to talk Spanish
these headphones have a pretty strong
Bluetooth connection that doesn't really
cut out and since they have very little
latency I do recommend these headphones
for watching videos their latency isn't
as little as say the air pods but it's
barely even noticeable sennheiser
advertises a 25 hour battery life on
these headphones which is average for
headphones these days and in my testing
which has consisted of a combination of
listening to music and watching videos
with anc turned on these I suppose have
gotten more than 20 how much playback
time which is good my only gripe with
these headphones is that they don't have
quick charging but if you are call it a
dead battery you can always just use a
passively now let's talk about these
headphones active noise cancellation it
does a pretty decent job of blocking
constant low frequency sounds like road
noise or the constant rumbling of an AC
unit and it does a fairly good job of
blocking out chatter if
you're in a cafe there's a little bit of
cabin pressure which is manageable and
you do get used to it after a few
minutes of where we're gonna jump into
an ANC test with a few other $200 ANC
headphones and if you want to watch that
versus video I'll have that video linked
in the I icon above
the ANC on these headphones performs
pretty similarly to other $200 ANSI
headphones on the market it blocks out a
good amount of sound with a lot less
cabin pressure than the JBL 65 B TMC and
cabin pressure feels like there's a
little bit of pressure on your eardrums
when you're underwater or that pressure
you feel when you're in an airplane for
those who may not know what I'm talking
about when it comes to sound quality
these headphones have a nutri sound
signature with clean base that doesn't
bottom out and the highs don't crash
these headphones are suitable for people
who want a balanced listening experience
but if you're a bass head then you're
gonna have to look elsewhere these
headphones do get loud enough for a safe
listening experience but there have been
times where I wish these headphones got
a little louder but in the long run it's
good that these headphones don't get
excessively loud but these headphones
sound their best when they're active
noise cancellation is turned off which
you can turn off by pressing the volume
up and volume down button for a few
seconds the sound stage considerably
opens up they sound clearer and the bass
does manage to get a little deeper Sun
highs are also suggest that you use dark
a to nap with their headphones but
honestly since the majority of people
these days just stream their music this
app isn't really helpful all it does is
change the EQ settings for any music you
may have stored locally on your phone or
if you have a title account which I bet
you don't or you did but you can so that
after you were done listening to
lemonade or everything is love but now
let's talk about those control buttons I
appreciate their minimalist design and
then like them for the most part but
there are a few things I would change I
really like the main rocker you simply
rock the knob left or right to skip or
go back a track and you press the knob
down to play or pause your music lets
you skip through your music for me
quickly and accurately but I just wish
the knob was a little
and textures cuz it is very easy to
confuse the power button for the rocker
knob and the same thing goes for the
volume rocker I wish it was a little
bigger but the biggest change I would
like to see on these headphones is the
indicator light when the headphones are
on the indicator light rarely blinks
there have been multiple times where
I've placed his hands phone on my desk
and forgot that were on and just walked
away and if I played a video on my phone
in another room the audio would start
playing on the headphones or sometimes
I'll put the headphones on thinking they
were off and end up turning them off by
accident and most of the headphones the
indicator light is either constantly
blinking or just on it's a very useful
subtle reminder I would also like to see
the indicator lights change color when
the ANC on these headphones is turned on
or off because right now every time I
put these headphones on I'm not sure if
the ANC is turned on or off so I usually
have to do a quick little check first
alright and here's the microphone test
and it actually sounds pretty good it
might be a little bit of static but
overall I would take phone calls with
these headphones but this audio clip has
been recorded by the microphone on the
Sennheiser 450 BT NC headphones so you'd
be the judge of that
but I think we can all agree that some
Heiser needs to get better names for
these homes but overall I like the
Sennheiser 4.500 BT NC headphones I
think they look very classy now that
I've seen them in person they sit very
well when I had their ANC gets the job
done very well for $200 anc headphones
with a minimal cabin pressure and their
neutral sound signature allows for a
very balanced listening experience but
keep in mind these headphones have a lot
of padding so I don't think these
headphones will be the best for people
with bigger ears and I don't think these
headphones would be the best option if
you're looking for headphones to use at
the gym because those ear pads are going
to get very hot now at the time those
recording we are just a few weeks away
from IFA 2018 which is Europe's CES
Sennheiser is supposed to be attending
this convention and I personally think
it's unlikely we're going to see a
follow up to these headphones just yet I
personally think we're going to see
Santa's new version of their PXC 550 ANC
headphones which go up against the likes
of the Sony 1000 xm2 and the bose qc25
series too with
I also think I do for an update if you
