Lansing mini life jacket 3 and I came
away very unimpressed but I still get a
participation award but I still decided
to give the Altec Lansing verso smart
speaker a try although they were aiming
for something great I feel that
execution was pretty sloppy there are
some things that I like about the Versa
but there are some other things that
just fall flat a lot of manufacturers
are starting to incorporate voice
assistance into their speakers whether
you need it or not
and the Altec Lansing versa is a rugged
Alexa enable smart speaker which will
better suit people who are heavily
invested into the Amazon Alexa ecosystem
and if you use one of the three
supported streaming services Spotify
Deezer or Napster and if you want to
pick the speaker up or any of the other
speakers showed off in this video I'll
have links or description below check
them out because you never know when
they're on sale as Altec Lansing puts it
the Versa is everything proof its ip67
rated so it's both water and dust
resistant and it also floats the outer
board of the speaker is made up of two
rubber layers that also make the speaker
shockproof but unfortunately the metal
faces on the speaker gets scratched very
easily so if you take the speaker out
with you on hikes on a regular basis
it's eventually going to show a lot of
wear and tear and so it's one of the
topic of taking the speaker out with you
on a regular basis although the
triangular design of the speaker looks
good at home and I like how the
faceplates play with lighting this
speaker isn't the easiest to travel with
it's big it's an odd shape and there's
no built-in carrying handle or somewhere
to attach a clip okay now let's talk
about buttons and ports like a lot of
other smart speakers on the market the
Altec Lansing versa doesn't have an ox
jack which to me is a little silly but
it does charge via a micro USB port on
the side of the speaker there's your
power by an a bluetooth button and a
star button that is actually used as a
mic mute button when the speaker is
there Wi-Fi mode and you can cycle
through LED lighting modes if you're
using the speaker in Bluetooth mode and
on top of the speaker you also have your
volume buttons and a mic button so you
can manually activate your voice
assistant obviously if you press the
plus or minus bi annual adjust your
volume but if you want to skip a track
you have to press and hold the plus
button and if you want to go back a
track you have to press and hold the
minus button and in order to play or
pause your music you have to press
which is a little odd now one of the
things that I do like about the Versa is
how easy it is to switch between
bluetooth and Wi-Fi mode which oddly
enough was a problem for the UE mega
blast and blast which are also Alexa
enabled smart speakers that cost way
more than the Versa but actually
connecting the Versa to your Alexa
account requires downloading three apps
and is a hair-pulling process it took me
multiple times to get a write which
wasn't the case with the UE blast or
mega blast or any of the other Google
assistant enabled smart speakers I've
had and the Versa can only connect to
2.4 gigahertz networks and unfortunately
the microphones are on the Versa don't
do a good job of picking up your voice I
find myself having to speak up and
enunciate a lot more so that reversible
hear me compared to other smart speakers
but if your voice assistant decides to
cooperate you can ask a questions
control your smart home and if you're
signed into one of the supported
streaming services Spotify Deezer or
Napster you'll be able to control your
music playback just by asking allah to
turn on the studio lights ok change the
studio lights to blue ok what's the
current price of Bitcoin one Bitcoin is
worth eleven thousand three dollars
what's the current price of ethereum one
aetherium is worth one thousand forty
three dollars now let's talk about tech
specs while in Bluetooth mode the verse
that can only be connected to a one
device at a time and it has a wireless
range of 30 feet with direct
line-of-sight but unfortunately placed
in one wall between the Versa and your
phone will cause the signal to stutter
I'll take lansing claims of battery life
over eight hours but it's really more
like five hours and a five hour battery
life is way below average for speakers
in this price range now when it comes to
speaker setup the Versa is rocking a
single two inch diameter woofer and an
85 by 45 millimeter passive radiator
honestly I feel the Altec Lansing vs.
sounds pretty bad for its speaker in its
price range my biggest problem with it
is that vocalist sound very amazingly
the sound stage is very narrow and
instrument separation is pretty weak so
everything just sounds like it's on the
same plane the passive radiator on this
speaker does give it a good amount of
bass but it will very easily overpower
the rest of the song or you just get a
lot of reverb in the background the
verso does get loud but sound quality
takes a huge hit at those higher volumes
and I'm making a big deal about this cuz
just because the Altec Lansing versa is
a rugged speaker it doesn't mean it
can't sound good take for example the
bose sound like micro this is another
rugged speaker that can take everything
the Versa can take and it sounds
surprisingly good for its size and it
also does this while using smaller
hardware now you can adjust the EQ on
the Versa and it does help a bit but
there's only so much eq sentence can do
on so so hardware but in order for the
EQ sentence to be active on the Versa
you need to have the verse and advocated
a p-- open and streaming your music
through that but if you don't have the
app open then your EQ settings go back
to default the EQ settings aren't stored
into the speaker's firmware at the end
of the day I wouldn't recommend picking
up the Altec Lansing versa it doesn't
sound as good as other speakers at the
same or below its price range and using
the voice assistant on the speaker isn't
as easy as other smart speakers the
microphones don't do as good of a job of
picking up your voice and you're going
to find yourself repeating your commands
on a regular basis battery life on this
speaker is also below average given the
speaker's price range and its sheer size
and then there's the triangular shape of
the speaker for a record speaker that I
assume a lot of people would like to
take on the go it's kind of hard to take
the speaker on the go if you're looking
for a small rugged speaker I highly
recommend the bose sound like micro or
the JBL flip 4 hey if you enjoyed the
