is Nikes third iteration of the Meccan
shoe so as a third time the charm has
Nike learned and approved upon the make
on to instant like he may come to be a
better shoe than the Reebok nano 7.0
should you even upgrade to the neck in
my country at the time of this recording
we can pick up the Nike make on three
from Amazon for one thirty nine ninety
five and for my bargain hunters you can
pick up the neck and make on twos for
finish line for seventy six ninety nine
if mango and hyper jitter colors they
also have other colors blood prices will
vary links to buy either one or in the
description first off if you're new to
fitness you might be wondering why do
you need a specialized shoe in the first
place great question millions if you
decided to take a CrossFit functional
fitness powerlifting weightlifting or
even just circuit training you're going
to be doing some very dynamic movements
some examples of these dynamic new
movements include the deadlift clean
squats box trims pull-ups rose sled
pushes and the list just goes on and in
order to do these movements safely and
properly you're going to need a solid
platform but unlike specialized
weightlifting shoes like the adidas
added power which have an extremely
Steph heel for stability and cup your
heel for dear life which is ideal for
super heavy squats the met country are
able to provide your comparable
stability will still be inflexible and
supportive enough for when you do sprint
if you try to run or spread in the
adidas adiPure you're going to get
nowhere really fast but yet the met
country's soul is still rigid enough to
help you prevent rolling your feet
inwards when you deadlift or squat
unlike running shoes like the ultra
boost which have an extremely soft sole
if you tried that lifting or squatting
in these you're eventually going to hurt
your back and get a one-way ticket at
snap city hatch twin fans where you at
and of talking let's get to the shoe
first let's start with the outsole gone
is to start a look up the last outsole
and in this place is new triangles a
weave nonetheless it still provides a
very good amount of traction and it's
rather sticky as well just like other
trading shoes on the market the outsole
comes all the way up to the sides of the
shoe so that it can give you a good
amount of grip when you're rock climbing
on the back of the shoe we've got the
familiar TPU heel clip this little piece
of plastic serves two purposes
first it helps you when you're doing
hand standing push-ups against the wall
but heel clips allows your heels to
glide on the wall the heel clip also
helps keep your heel in place when
you're using
the row machine above the heel clip
we've got the TPU heel cup instead of
being one solid piece it's broken up
into two pieces
I'll admit stylistically it looks good
but functionally it hurts the shoe this
is just me but when I walk in these
shoes my heel goes all over the place
and I know this was a big issue for
other people in a my conscience now
let's talk about the insole this insult
also functions as the shoes Mitchell as
you can see the bottom of the insole has
some cuts in it to help with the overall
flexibility of the shoe the Mitchell
mimetic on three is tough enough to give
you that stable platform you need when
you're dead lifting or squatting but is
still flexible and bouncy enough to
perform when you're running or sprinting
one of the main differences between the
Meccan 3 and Omega 2 is the upper the
Meccan three upper is mostly comprised
of thermal wrap with a little mesh
blended in the new upper helps skip the
Meccan three a much more natural feel
and helps to be super flexible it's no
primary flying it but assurance comfy
under the thermal wrap you will also see
that the Meccan 3 also features Nikes
Flywire lockdown mechanism
sadly no matter how much I play with the
laces I still wasn't able to get rid of
all that heel motion I mentioned earlier
but that's just me the laces on these
shoes do feel really cheap in my opinion
but they don't come undone like other
laces and the tongue on these shoes is
really thin but it offers some padding
overall the silhouette of the Meccan 3
has been slightly changed from the
Meccan to the Meccan 3 are much lower
than I expected and it did catch me by
surprise there isn't a lot of ankle
support but in return you get a lot of
ankle mobility now flexibility of the
outsole midsole and thermal wrap all
make for a very flexible shoe overall so
flexible in fact that when I took my
first few steps I couldn't believe I was
still wearing shoes the Meccan 3 also
still have that four millimeter heel
drop that was present in the MEC on two
and mackan one it is also worth noting
that these shoes just like their mic on
to counterpart L or narrow I would still
go true to size but keep in mind they
are narrow nonetheless so which is you
get spring more upgrade to the all-new
make on 3 or just get or keep your mic
on - if you already have the mic on -
you don't really need to up
you'll be fine but if you're just
getting into fitness and you just want
to save some cash then just get the make
on - you're not missing out on it but if
you're looking for a training shoe
that's slightly more durable and
flexible then go for the make on three
just remember both of these shoes are a
little narrow if you have a wider foot
then you should look into either the
Reebok Nano 6.0 or 7.0 link to the
