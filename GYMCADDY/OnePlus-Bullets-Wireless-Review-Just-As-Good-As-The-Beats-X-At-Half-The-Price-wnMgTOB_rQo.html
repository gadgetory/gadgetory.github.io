gained his reputation of being this
company that listens to his customers
and puts out great products which are
very reasonably priced and oneplus just
made all really good person pressure on
me with their new boy wireless earbuds
there are obviously a much cheaper
alternative to the beats X and even
though the bullets Wireless do sacrifice
build quality here and there over all
the bullets Wireless are a great pair of
wireless earbuds that give the beats X
all run for their money
oneplus is Wireless bullets currently
retail for $69 which is half of what the
beat X retail for $150 and for the most
part when I've tested sell hundred all
the wireless earbuds the results were
pretty bad but not with the bullets if
you wanna pick use of these earphones up
I'll have a link to description below
and if you use the links it really helps
out the channel I suggest you check them
out because the beats X routinely go on
sale first up I want to talk about the
unboxing experience of the bullets
Wireless it lets you know right off the
bat that you just bought something nice
and you don't see this level of
attention to detail unsub hunted all of
your phones or even some two or three
hundred other headphones for that matter
inside the box you'll find your
earphones a silicon carrying case which
is pretty similar to what comes included
with the beats X and you get your USB a
two USBC cable for charging and you also
get a total of three pairs of ear fins
and ear tips so you can customize your
fit overall everything that comes
included with the beats X come included
with the bullets Wireless design and
build quality wise the bullish wireless
are very similar to the beat X they're
both designed to rest on your neck the
earbuds both magnetically attached to
one another when you're not using them
and the majority of their bodies are
covered in a soft touch rubber material
but there are some design choices where
oneplus obviously there to save a bit of
money and that's what the wire that
connects the net bang with the ear buds
and the inline controller the inline
controller on the beats X feels much
more premium than the inline controller
on the bullets it has much more tactile
feedback and since the controller is
slightly larger it's also slightly
easier to use but the flat wire used on
the beat X also feels much sturdier than
the thinner round wire used on the
bullets I'm
a little worried that the wires on the
bullets will wear out faster or could
possibly snap if the earbuds were to
snag on a coat while you took it off
even though these two earphones share
very similar designs there are some key
technical differences between these two
year phones first up the bullets
wireless is using bluetooth 4.1 and for
the most part their wireless connection
is very sturdy and there's very little
latency so I would recommend these
earphones for watching videos
the bullets Wireless also have an eight
hour battery life and charged via a USB
C port and the bullets Wireless also
feature slightly improved fast charging
over the beats X if you plug them in for
10 minutes from a dead battery it'll get
you 5 hours of playback time whereas
with the beats X if you plug them in for
five minutes from a dead battery they'll
get you 2 hours of playback time and
instead of a USB C port the beach
actually uses Apple's lightning cable
but the biggest difference between the
beats X and the bullets Wireless is that
the beats X is using Apple's w1 chip yes
the beats X placed nice with Android
devices but any devices that have
Apple's w1 chip works best with other
Apple devices aside from being able to
easily and seamlessly pair up to either
of your Apple devices associated to your
iCloud account I found out one of the
best things about to w1 chip is just how
little latency there actually is when
watching videos for someone like me who
watches a lot of videos on my phone and
uses a lot of headphones and speakers
low latency is very important to me or
else it just takes away from the viewing
experience sound quality wise the
bullets Wireless just sound good the
bass doesn't bottom out and there's no
tuning in the highs they get more than
loud enough even to lapse sometimes and
there's very little distortion now the
soundstage on these earphones could be
better but remember these are 70 bucks
so they're good enough for casual
listening now since the bullets wireless
do have a flat sound signature they
don't overpower the rest of the song
like the bass on the beats X tends to do
well perhaps the coolest thing about the
bullets Wireless is this now the beats X
can't do that when you magnetically
attached a earbuds to one another the
bullets Wireless are going to
automatically pause your music and go
into standby mode and they're also going
to disconnect from your phone and
you disconnected earbuds the bullets
wireless are going to power back up and
we connect with your phone and
personally I really like this feature
cuz it saves on battery life and if
you're not using them the bullet
Wireless aren't going to show up on your
Bluetooth list okay and here's the
microphone test and personally the
microphone on the bullet wireless sounds
okay but there is a good amount of
static and for comparison here's a
microphone test with the beats X and
it's not all that different but these
two audio clips were recorded using the
microphones on the bullet arms and beats
X so you can be the judge of that but
overall like you said at the beginning
of this video
oneplus has made a very good first
impression on me their new bullet
wireless earphones exceeded all of my
expectations for sub-100 all the
wireless earbuds their build quality is
good except I would be careful with the
loose wires they have a solid wireless
connection and very little latency which
is one of the biggest things cheaper
wireless earphones tend to mess up on
and they sound is good enough but
personally I really like how they
automatically go into standby mode when
the buds magnetically connect it's such
an apple like feature that I'm amazed
the beats X doesn't do them themselves
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
