wireless sports arrow buds gets released
by some random large or small company
and even though I know there are a lot
of sports wireless earbuds out there I
feel the most notable ones are the Bose
sound sport free
j-bird run and the new kettle black Sony
WF SP 700 n let's see which of these are
the best sports wireless earbuds and
let's see if during even worth the money
just to be clear this isn't a full
review on either these earphones so I'm
just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you purchase decision if you
want to learn more about either these
earphones than watch their full reviews
decided to go truly Wireless at the gym
does cost a premium the Bose sound sport
free which are the oldest your phones
here currently retail for $200 and both
the j-bird run and Sony SP 700 n retail
for $180 if you want to pick either of
these earphones up I'll have links or
description below and if you use the
links you really helps out the channel I
suggest you check them out cuz to
Jaybirds and Sony's routinely go on sale
and also check out the numerous shelf
down below first let's just build
quality there are two main pieces two
wireless earphones like these the
earphones themselves and their carrying
cases without a doubt bose has the best
build quality here both the earphones
and case feels dirty and premium that
your buds magnetically align themselves
when you drop them in and the case
itself has a battery gauge which quickly
tells you how much the juice you have
left
the only drawback here is that the case
and earphones are pretty big and opening
the case can be a little hard I filled a
bird's overall build quality is decent
but my only issue is with the case since
it your buds don't magnetically align
themselves it's pretty common to
accidentally drop your ear buds on the
dirty gym floor when you're taking them
out or putting them back into the case I
just want the ear buds to magnetically
align to their case it's a small detail
that I feel will make a big difference
and finally there's Sony I feel that
your buzz themselves are fine but the
case does feel very cheap especially the
lid
I'm afraid it's either going to wear out
or snap off but the way you actually
take the earbuds in or out of the case
is pretty clunky you don't drop them in
you wedge them in this just isn't an
elegant solution what I actually think
the Sony's have the best fit here first
off they go in
really deep into your ear canal like
they should about me dinner first but
they also form a really good seal that
offer a lot of passive noise isolation
and since they're so lightweight and
low-profile they stay in place the best
ear the j-bird run also free pretty well
and they stay in place go to but they
don't go in as deep so they don't offer
as much passive noise isolation but the
Bose fit a little differently
they don't go into your ear canal they
rest right outside of it so they
actually let in a lot of ambient sound
in but since the both of your phones are
so big and stick out a lot they do tend
to wiggle out of you you're more easily
so you constantly have to readjust them
but the larger size of the Bose has for
free means that the buzz themselves have
the longest battery life to hear the
buds themselves can hold a five hour
charge or as the runs buds can hold a
four hour charge and Sony's buds can
only hold three have a charge and all of
the respective cases can hold two
additional charges the larger size of
the Bose sound sport free means you also
actually get a full set of media
controls on the right ear but you can
play or pause your music skip a track
just a volume and activate your voice
system but the major drawback here is
that it's very hard to press these
buttons so hard in fact I don't even use
them the control buttons are on the
jaybird and Sonia are much easier to use
in comparison but you don't have as much
control over your music playback like
you do on the Bose without having to
talk to your voice assistant and to me
that's a big deal I would much rather
use an inline controller instead of
having to stop to talk to your voice
assistant and hope that they get my
command right I'm talking to you Syrian
sound quality wise I feel jaybird run or
the best sounding earbuds here you can
also go and fully customize their EQ
through their abs or you can make them
sound however you want but unfortunately
they don't give very loud
so even when they're on max volume they
do leave something to be desired
Sony's on the other hand do get pretty
loud but unfortunately I feel that the
worst sounding earbuds here they just
have way too much bass for their own
good you can also go into Sony's
headphones app and select from a few EQ
presets but you don't have the same
customization options like you do with
the Jaybirds overall I feel the Bose
sound just right they get loud enough
and since they have a neutral sound
signature they sound pretty decent but
my problem is
Sports wireless earbuds like these is
that none of them are perfect even after
you pay a good amount of money for them
you always end up having to compromise
for the most part while Sierra buzzed
like these usually suffer from varying
degrees of connection issues either
there's a lot of latency limited range
of or random connection drops and on top
of that some other earbuds might also
have poor battery life or if they just
don't fit well or they just don't sound
good
I honestly think that for the time being
you're probably better off getting
something wired like the cheaper Dex
threes Sony's own SP 600 n which are a
little expensive right now or my
personal favorites the power of these
stories I honestly think you can't go
wrong with these and I feel very
strongly about this because you can get
the X threes or the power B's threes for
about a hundred dollars over an Amazon
links for those down below and overall
you just get a better user experience
every time I test sports wireless
earbuds like these I usually end up
thinking the same thing and that's these
are okay but they're not as good as my
power beats the X rays and power beats
cost much less and they just work they
have good battery life as they sound
good and more importantly your Bluetooth
connections are solid and this is
especially true for earphones that are
using Apple's w1 chip having connection
issues is pretty common for truly
wireless earbuds that aren't using the
w1 chip and at CES 2018 call come
announced that they were working on some
new chipsets that would offer a more
stable Bluetooth connection for wireless
earbuds that would also reduce latency
and improve battery life but to my
knowledge I don't know of any wireless
earbuds that are currently using this
new chipset so what I'm getting at here
is that I don't think truly wireless
earbuds for the GEMA are currently worth
the money or the hassle why aren't your
busts like a Power Beats or x-ray aren't
all that different but instead they cost
less and they give you an overall better
user experience with truely wireless
earbuds you end up paying all this money
and you also end up compromising a lot
and to me that doesn't sound like a good
deal now with the next Apple event a few
months away I wouldn't be surprised if
Apple announced a truly wireless version
of their power piece 3 and I wouldn't be
surprised if they initially retail for
$300 but for right now since the power
beats 3 are forever on sale over at
Amazon
I don't think can go wrong with them if
you made it this far I guess you enjoyed
