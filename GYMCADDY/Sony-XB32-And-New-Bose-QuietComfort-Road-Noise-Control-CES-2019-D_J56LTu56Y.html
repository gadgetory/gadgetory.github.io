portable bluetooth speakers at CES 2019
there's the tiny new Sony xB
the JBL flip 5 it's a future competitor
the sony xba-40 competitor the sony
xba-40 and the xb-70 2 but oddly enough
no sony xba-40 2 has been announced at
this time but i do expect it to be
announced sometime in the near future
now it does look like this is going to
be strictly a design we fresh cycle for
Sony's new portable Bluetooth speakers
the Sony XP 2 and xB 30 to keep the same
speaker setups and advertise battery
lives as the previous Sony XP 31 and xB
21 but the biggest defense here is that
Sony's new portable speakers are still
charging via a micro USB port in 2019 I
just think it's a little weird that
Sony's new portable speakers don't
charge via USB C because their new xB
501 G does have a USB C port and so do
the 1000 X and threes I just assume that
all of Sony's new portable products
would be featuring USB seemed after it
for 2018 and personally I think the Sony
XP 22 and XP 32 are a step backwards
design wise compared to the sony xba-40
1 and xB 21 now I don't mind how Sony's
new speakers look actually think they
look pretty good but Sony's new speakers
are going to be reverting back to a
metal grille and soft touch body
construction now even though they still
look pretty good and they're going to be
keeping their ip67 dust and water
resistant certification I prefer Sony's
xB thirty one's fabric body because it
does a much better job of standing up to
bumps and scrapes and Sony's xB 31
line-up of speakers are one of the
best-looking super rugged speakers out
there so I'm just a little concerned
that if you plan on taking Sony's new
portable speakers on to go with you on a
regular basis then they're gonna be
scratch magnets just like how the older
stone exp 20 xB 30 and xB 40 were banana
switched over to the sony xba-4 Chinle
this is not a Sony
60 or Sony Xperia Play sment the Sony XP
somebody - does not have a built-in
battery but I did want to shout out
Sony's new htx
8500 TV sound bar one of the first Dolby
Atmos TV sound bars with dual built-in
subwoofers the X 8500 delivers a
three-dimensional 7.1.2 channel surround
sound listening experience that could
rival Sennheiser's new AM Bo sound bar
that we spoke about a few days ago
unfortunately there still aren't any
pricing or release date details but it'd
be great if Sony 71 but unfortunately
Sony has yet to announce any new
headphones which is a shame
given how good the 1000 X and threes are
I was personally expecting them to
announce a new pair of extra bass
headphones and a new pair of hear on
three headphones I just think that the
Sony xb9 fifty n-1 and here on choose K
from a redesign to make them more
low-profile and better looking just like
how we went from the bulky 1,000 XM to
to the more streamlined 1000 x m3 but
overall I'm a little disappointed to see
that Sony's new portable bluetooth
speakers don't feature USB C charging
and it doesn't look like Sony has taken
any steps to improve their Wireless
party chain feature I've been very
critical of Sony's wireless party chain
feature in the past because it's not as
easy to pair multiple speakers together
and it's not as stable compared to JPL's
JBL connect plus or even Ultimate Ears
pairing method ultimately chosen between
the xB 31 and xB 32 could all boil down
to cosmetics but we're gonna have to
reserve final judgement until we
actually get Sony's new portable
speakers in house cuz who knows maybe
they sound better now switching over to
Bose unfortunately they haven't
announced any new QuietComfort
headphones they did however announced a
new Bose QuietComfort
road noise control system you're
basically going to be getting active
noise cancellation in your next car due
out in 2021 Bose will be working with
car manufacturers to implement those new
technology in their future models and I
do see if a benefit of this technology
you're going to be able to reduce road
noise in future models without having to
use heavy
materials which currently we down cars
thus improving fuel economy and gas cars
and increasing range in EVs
I just hope Beau's was able to fix our
excessive cabin pressure issues found in
their agencies and even though this is
cool and all bows or the headphones a
because these guys have just been
releasing some very weird stuff lately
