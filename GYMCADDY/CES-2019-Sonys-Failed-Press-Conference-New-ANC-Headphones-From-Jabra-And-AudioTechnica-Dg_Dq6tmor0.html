away very unimpressed from Sony's press
conference last night
besides announcing some new 8k in OLED
TV screens which still don't have any
pricing or overly states a lot of people
were left confused after Sony abruptly
ended their press conference without
announcing any new cameras speakers or
headphones however Sony did hype up I
bought the robotic dog Alexa will be
coming to the Sony 1000x in threes and
Sony also announced a new karaoke
machine with built-in cupholders I'll
keep you updated sony announces anything
worth mentioning but now let's move on
to HyperX cuz they didn't have some
pretty impressive stuff HyperX announced
a new USB mic for streamers the hyper
eye squad cast stand-alone microphone a
$140 this USB mic ain't cheap but you do
get for polar panels to choose from just
like on the blue Yeti but on a smaller
package HyperX also announced a new
HyperX cloud orbit and hyper x cloud
orbit as gaming headphones these three
hundred and $320 gaming headsets are
based off of the odyssey mobius gaming
headphones
although these will be HyperX as most
expensive gaming headsets they do
feature a diseased planar magnetic
drivers basically audio files like
planar magnetic drivers because they
offer zero distortion at higher volumes
and crystal-clear highs just be advised
these headphones will not be wireless
and if you use them with an analogue
connection they're rated for 10 hours of
battery life but if you use them with
their USB cable then you'll have
unlimited power the HyperX cloud orbit s
however will feature wave and x-head
tracking capabilities which gives a user
a 360-degree sound stage which adjusts
to the users head movement head tracking
capabilities is the only difference
between hyper axis knew headsets and
given that it's only a $20 difference I
would just spring for the HyperX cloud
or bird s keeping on the topic of
headphones I didn't want to shout our
job as entry into the ANC headphone
market the Jabra elite 85h noise
cancelling headphones will be available
in April and will retail for three
hundred dollars they feature a 32 hour
battery life a USB C port for charging
and they have an IP v to dust and water
resistance rating and not a lot of other
headphones have this they're also going
to have voice assistant integration and
you're going to be
able to summon your voice assistance
with a hot word very similar to the
surface headphones although I am pretty
iffy on these headphones design I'm
pretty excited try them out Audio
Technica also announced a new a tha NC
900 BT quiet point headphones among
other things they're gonna be retelling
for $300 and given how much I'm
currently enjoying there s are 50 BTS
I'm pretty excited to try out the new
quiet point headphones besides an
awesome neutral sound signature the new
quiet point headphones are going to be
featuring a 35 hour battery life and
Bluetooth 5.0 but unfortunately they're
gonna be second with a micro USB port
for charging in 2019 DJI also announced
a new DJI smart controllers compatible
with only Jones that support occu sync
2.0 like the maverick 2 pro and zoom
brothers DJ eyes new smart controller
features a super-bright 1000 it tonight
EP 5.5 inch built-in screen
besides featuring a built-in screen
that's much easier to see and direct
sunlight compared to a smartphone DJ
eyes new smart controller is also
tougher you can use it in temperatures
ranging from negative 4 degrees
Fahrenheit
all the way up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit
this controller is running off of
Android has a two and a half hour
battery life with fast charging and it's
gonna be retelling for $650 today is the
first official day of CES 2019 and these
are some of the products that I found
interesting as more products get
announced I'll keep you guys updated but
for those wondering no Bose hasn't
announced any new ANC headphones so far
if you made it this far

that like button and get subscribed to
