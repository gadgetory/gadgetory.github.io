on right now and it looks like Huawei already
managed to steal the limelight from Samsung’s
Galaxy fold with their new Mate X Foldable
phone.
Huawei’s radically different approach to
foldable phones does a much better job of
dealing with that awkward U shape other foldable
phones like the Galaxy Fold has to deal with
when they’re actually folded.
But at around a retail price of $2600 the
Huawei Mate X carries a $600 premium over
the Galaxy Fold.
So I don’t know about you, but im going
to be sticking to non foldable phones for
a while.
But if you don’t feel like shelling out
$2600 on the Huawei Mate X, then Oppo might
have you covered.
They also showed off a foldable phone similar
to Huawei’s, but unfortunately this one
is still a prototype and Oppo will only actually
sell the thing if they see theres enough demand
for it.
And LG is also sort of hopping on to the foldable
phone hype train with their new LG V50 ThinQ.
Under the hood the V50 is going to support
5G, its going to have a slightly larger 4,000
milliamp battery, and a snapdragon 855 processor.
But LG is also going to be offering a new
Dual Screen accessory for the V50.
Its a 6.2 inch OLED display that attaches
to your phone with a case but its also powered
by the phones internal battery.
So guess not having a separate battery means
they can keep costs down but its also going
to drain your phone’s battery faster.
But sadly this accessory wont be going on
sale in the states, but hey you can get almost
anything on Ebay.
But the LG V50 isn’t LG’s flagship phone…
that honor belongs to the LG G8 which is making
headlines cause of its new HandID technology
that identifies its users by looking at the
pattern of your veins in your palm.
The LG G8 also has AirMotion gestures that
allow you to open apps and adjust the volume
sort of like Tom Cruise in Minority report.
But early impressions is that the G8’s new
features feel gimmicky and finicky.
But Sony also had a pretty big showing at
MWC with their new Xperia 10 and Xperia One
phones.
The Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus are sony’s
mid range phones that both feature a 21 by
9 aspect ratio and have pretty modest specs.
But I feel that due to their forehead and
thick bessels, these phones look pretty dated
right out of the gate.
But the Xperia One is where things start to
get a little interesting.
This phone is rocking a 6.5 inch 21 by 9 4K
OLED HDR screen and a Snapdragon 855 processor
paired with 6 gigs of ram.
It also packs a triple-lens camera and is
the first smartphone with eye autofocus tracking
borrowed from Sony’s own A7 3 mirrorless
camera.
But unfortunately this phone only has a 3,300
milliamp hour battery which could struggle
to keep up with its presumably power hungry
4K screen.
And rounding out this video is Lenovo which
is also in Barcelona showing off some of their
new mid tier smart phones and laptops.
But what did catch my eye were their new ANC
headphones.
Now these are on ear headphones with a retail
price of $170 and there due out in the summer…
but they are currently one of the few non
premium ANC headphones with both bluetooth
5.0 and USB C Charging.
So at least Lenovo is getting off on the right
foot with their new headphones.
Still no word if theres going to be an Over
ear version, but personally I would like to
see them cute the on ear version look pretty
promising.
Mobile World conference 2019 in Barcelona
is just kicking off and these are some of
the things I found interesting.
As more information comes out and more products
get released I’ll try to keep you guys posted.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
