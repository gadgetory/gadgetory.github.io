almost six months the peat acts are
finally hitting store shelves
when Apple conjured up the courage to
remove the headphone jack from the
iPhone they double down by showcasing
their new w1 chip and all the wireless
earphones that would take advantage of
the new technology unlike the power b3
orbital debris which were simply given
new internals and slight design refresh
the beats X are the first wireless
earphones to be designed by Apple
engineers after Apple acquired beats by
dre the beats X currently come in black
or white blood blue and gray versions
will be released by the end of February
unless they get delayed again which
wouldn't surprise me they currently sell
for one 49.95
link is in the description if you want
to buy a pair I'll keep it updated so
you can get the best deal possible all
right let's get into the unboxing
packaging here is very similar to the
power of these three front and center
are the actual beats acts themselves
under that you'll find three additional
pairs of silicon ear tips and two pairs
of wasteth one of these in just a second
you also get a silicone carrying case
and a shortened lightning cable you also
get some documentation of the sticker
and a code for three months of Apple
music matter of fact go ahead and use
this code because you know I love you
comment below and let me know if you got
it the VTech themselves are pretty long
they're supposed to rest on your neck
the whole surface of the beats X has a
softer feel to them which is great
because they don't cause any discomfort
while wear them you're also extremely
lightweight and flexible and you forget
you've been wearing the thing after a
while the middle portion or the portion
that actually rests on your neck is a
little thicker and stiffer compared to
the wires that attach to the earbud the
v-tex also have these bulges on either
side which are made of hard plastic it's
safe to assume this is where the battery
and electronics slip the left bulge
you know what I'm going to call these
positive spin the left pot have the
Lightning port for charging in the white
pot has just one button for turning the
beats X on and off and for pairing with
non Apple devices I am however very
dissatisfied with the power button the
power button has a very good satisfying
click to it and I can never really tell
if I turn them on or not
the v-tex also has an inline controller
that has the built-in microphones the
illite controller on the beats x is the
same one as the power beats 3 unlike the
power button the controller has a very
satisfying click to them and it's super
easy to control human attack playback
the earbuds themselves are very small in
our angle debates
but to do a great job of getting in your
ear canal and creating a very decent
passive noise isolation near buzzing
cells attached to each other
magnetically for cable management when
do not use one detail I did notice is
that the contact points have that soft
touch material which means they won't
get scratched or banged up after the
fiddling smacking into one another it's
a nice touch the irbaz feel pretty
secure when they're in your ear but if
you want a more secure fit you can use
include a wingtip you only get two pairs
and Apple made them idiot-proof the
casing is made of your hard plastic and
the films themselves are made out of
silicone in order to put them on you
first need to remove the earbud and then
slide the casing off putting them on is
the easy part
taking them off it is a little harder
but overall the wings that make the beat
that's a great option
if you want to wear them while working
out just remember they are water or
sweat resistant over all these year but
sounds pretty good they aren't based
have a look out of each product and they
don't sound tinny overall they have a
very well bound sound signature and a
good sound state the battery life on the
beach tax is pretty good as well you get
eight hours of playback time from a full
charge and the also features bascule
which means you can get two hours of
playback time from just five minutes of
charging and you get those eight hours
of playback time from just 45 minutes of
charging the v-tex also has a brand new
w1 chip which has completely changed the
way I care and listen to music
so w1 chip allows for easy pairing with
all of your Apple devices once your
beats actors paired with the iPhone
they'll automatically pair with all of
your other Apple devices associated with
the iCloud account so you can go from
listening to music on your iPhone to
watching a YouTube video on your
computer by just changing your Shores
and without having to go through the
hassle of pairing every single time if
you want to use the beat sex with non
Apple devices you can pair it to normal
bluetooth by pressing and holding the
power button until they are in pairing
mode overall I'm very pleased with the
beats X they're more affordable than the
power of these three and the Apple here
they have a very balanced sound
signature which will please your average
listener the eight hour battery life and
fast fuel capability means they'll be
able to keep up with almost anyone their
overall design is great for wearing
almost anywhere whether you ask Jim
averages out or at the office
thanks for the race tips helps keep them
in place if you want to wear as a while
working out I personally think to be
such a more versatile than the ear pods
and powers to go in check out my heat
sensors and Harvey Street video and
might be sex with the Deer Park video
and keep an eye out for my
Gabriel next three videos wrong hey if
you made it this far I hope you enjoyed
the video if you could please high-five
