releasing innovative but weird products
like their new sleep buds which are
supposed to help you sleep better and
their Bose sound where a companion
speaker which is a $300 speaker you wear
around your neck I mean yeah it sounds
good but it's a tough sell because it's
a $300 speaker you wear around your neck
but today we're gonna break down Bose
this portable speaker lineup which I
feel is also a little weird we have the
Bose Soundlink micro the Soundlink color
to the Soundlink revolve and the sound
like revolve Plus first off I just wanna
start off by saying that the bose sound
like many too isn't here because it
looks like bose is phasing it out if you
go over to their site the mini two isn't
a part of any other promotional
materials and if you try to buy one says
that it's unavailable and the sound of
Mini 2 is nowhere to be found on other
big-box retailer site but let's talk
money the Bose Soundlink micro currently
retails for $99 the Soundlink color 2
retails for $129 the Soundlink revolve
retails for $199 and the sunlit revolve
plus retails for a whopping $299 if you
want to pick either of these speakers up
I'll have links to description below and
if you use the Ling's you really helps
out to channel I suggest you check them
out because the micro sometimes goes on
sale so you may get lucky and also check
out the new more shelf down below unlike
Sony's or JBL's portable speaker lineup
which all share a distinct design
language across the board both the
speaker lineup is split right down the
middle the sound like micro and color 2
both have silicone cover bodies which
make them very rugged if you plan on
taking them on the go with you
whereas the sound like revolve and
revolve plus both have exposed aluminum
bodies which were very elegant but they
can easily get scratched or dented if
you were to travel with them on a
regular basis but both the revolver
evolved plus carrying that ipx4
certification so a little splash of
water shouldn't be a problem whereas the
sound like micro carries an ipx7
certification so combined with the
silicone body the sound like micro is
definitely the most rugged speaker in
boses lineups so far but now let's talk
about ports the Soundlink color 2
revolver rolfe plus all charged via
my curious be part and they all have in
our Shack for wired listening but
interestingly enough the sounding micro
doesn't have an ox jack but like I've
said in past videos I feel a speaker's
dismal not having an ox Jack is in a big
deal but the revolver Roth plus both
have a universal screw mount on the
bottom so you're gonna test them to a
tripod if you needed to and you'll also
notice four dots here which are the
contact points for the optional charging
cradle now when it comes to battery
lives I feel all these speakers have
respectable battery lights for their
small size the caller to revolve and
revolve Plus should have no problem
asking you at least one hole straight
day of listening on a single charge
except for the sound like micro I've
always really liked the micro because it
sounds very impressive for its small
size but unfortunately its battery life
he isn't the best Bose advertises six
hours of playback time but with
real-world listening I usually end up
averaging just three hours of playback
time and I feel both drastically needs
to improve the micros battery life the
carrying strap on the back of the micro
makes it an amazing little speaker to
take with you on the go cuz you can
easily attach it to your backpack or
bike frame but ensure a battery life
renders it to a useless hardly plug a
few hours later ok now talking about
speaker setup is cursed or also pretty
different the sound like micro has a
single transducer and dual passive
radiator all housed underneath the poor
fretted portion of the speaker and like
I just said the micro sounds very
impressive for its size the color too is
kind of like a bigger version of the
micro you have slightly larger dual
transducers and a dual passive radiator
up top and both the micro and the color
2 are very directional speakers whereas
the revolve and revolve plus or 360
degree speakers both of these speakers
share the same setups except the plus is
slightly larger there's a single
downward firing transducer which shoots
sound into an acoustic deflector which
evenly spreads out your music and
towards the top of the speaker
there's also dual passive radiators and
personally one of my favorite things
about the Raval speakers is that if you
look at them at the right angle when
they're playing music you can see the
internals at work
Oh
overall both of speaker line up put an
emphasis on vocals over everything else
but there is still a good amount of bass
like I've met some multiple times
already I like to sound like micro
because it sounds very impressive for
its size it has way more bass and I
would expect from a speaker of its size
and it does a really good job of
preventing distortion at higher volumes
but I feel the selling color to doesn't
sound all that impressive for its size
keep in mind that it is the oldest
speaker here but if you listen to it at
lower volumes the bass does fall short
and if you listen to it at higher
volumes then there is a considerable
amount of distortion but if we look at
the revolver evolved plus these speakers
also have way more bass than I would
expect for their small size the revolver
evolved plus both sound the same but the
plus modal manages to get louder and
there is overall more bass and the music
does sound fuller on the plus but even
though both of these revolve speakers do
get pretty loud they also suffer from a
considerable amount of distortion and
how our volumes I feel these speakers
sound decent all the way up to the 85%
volume mark and after that they just
start to sound way too bright when it
comes to Bluetooth connectivity all
these speakers have solid connections
that go through multiple walls and I
haven't really had any connection issues
whatsoever but all of these speakers do
have a little bit of latency when
watching videos it's not huge but it is
noticeable if you're someone like me who
watches a lot of videos on your phone
and it can get a little annoying after
all I mean this is this is the type of
latency we're talking about it's not
huge but it's there but now let's talk
about boses Connect app because it is
very well built and it's pretty useful
my favorite thing about Bose is connect
up is that you can remotely turn on
either of your speakers if you're in
range not a lot of other speakers do
this granted it does drain your
speaker's battery life but I feel it's
worth it and straight from the app
itself you can pair up another speaker
and some
thing that bose allows you to do that
other manufacturers don't and so you can
get left and right stereo mode going
with two different model speakers with
Sony or JBL in order to get left and
right stereo mode to work you need to
have two of the same speakers you can
mix and match but the major drawback
with bose is that you can only connect
up to two speakers together sony and JBL
brag about being able to pair up to 100
speakers together and obviously nobody
really needs that but i would like to be
able to pair up to at least five bose
speakers together so overall one half of
boses portable speaker line-up is
durable and rugged whereas the other
half is elegant and sophisticated even
though I do like the sound like micro
because of its impressive sound we're
only concerned of getting it if it was
on sale because it is expensive for what
it is at $99 and personally I'm not the
biggest fan of the Soundlink color - I
think you'd be much better off with
either two JBL charge 3 pulse 3 or the
sony xba-1 but then there's the Bose
sound with revolve and revolve plus I
actually do feel these speakers are
worth the premium because they're more
than just a speaker's they're machined
aluminum bodies make these speakers look
like they're pieces of art that he can
proudly display in your living room
dining room or kitchen without having
them clash with any of your other decor
it's obvious Bose is going for a more
mature demographic with these speakers
and that's perfectly OK not everybody
wants a brightly colored fabric speaker
in the middle of the room and not
everybody who wants pulsating lights
with their music but given the revolve
and revolve plus performance these
aren't speakers you should pick up if
you want wall shaking ways or if you
really want to jam out with them these
are speakers you should get if you want
to have constant background music around
the house that you're going to play at
lower to moderate listening levels I
actually think both should split their
current portable speaker lineup and have
two distinct portable speaker lineups
have a regular lineup made up of the
micro and updated Soundlink color 3 and
a larger rugged $250.00 speaker that
competes up against
extreme tool and XP 41 and I would have
the fancy revolve lineup made up of the
revolve + revolve and $100 revolve
minion who knows since I have a is a few
weeks away
it could happen if you made it this far
