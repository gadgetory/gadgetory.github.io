and I fell in love with it but you eat
aka Ultimate Ears the makers of the boom
tube also dropped in on contact speaker
not too long ago and although the ue
wonder boom is tiny compared to the JBL
so forth it's still a solid contender
but before we put the ue u on the broom
up against the JBL so forth let's review
it first for starters the ue wonder boom
has some pretty playful color when it
comes in cashmere pink fireball red
lilac phantom black stone gray and
sub-zero blue personally I really like
the storm great color way over the one
that I got comment below let me know
which color you like that the UE wasn't
boom also currently retails for $99.99
but I'm sorry Amazon will put them on
sale from time to time if you want to
pick this up I'll leave a look at the
description below and I'll keep it
updated so you can get the best deal
although UE is a smaller company they
did a great job of creating a memorable
unboxing experience first you start off
the outer sleeve and then you must
relate it and you're greeted by your new
wonderful underneath on the boom you'll
find a micro USB cable for charging and
in one of the side compartment you'll
find the warranty information and that's
pretty much it the UE one boom itself is
a small bluetooth speaker that's built
like a tank it has a nylon weave out of
with very double plastic end caps to
help it protects against impact and that
give it grip so it stays in place while
it's on a table playing music
interaction with the UE when the boom is
also very minimal you'll see volume
buttons on the front a power button or
play pause button
an√≠bal to swing by if you double press
the UE button you'll also skip a track
unfortunately you can't go back a track
or active experience and the textile
feedback from these buttons is also
non-existent but pairing this speaker
with your phone or computer is super
simple there's no need for a smart phone
if you have another one to boom with you
you can also pair them by pressing and
holding the UE logo for few SEC's the
pair one of booms will only play music
simultaneously and they don't create a
stereo effect like other wireless
speakers - concerning Spector UE when
the boom uses bluetooth for that - and
compare the two devices at the same time
it also has a hundred-foot range and has
no problem going through a few walls in
the house there was the occasional
cutoff from time to time but only with
my laptop which is like five years old
unfortunately the wonder loom doesn't
have an audio jack built-in which means
you can only listen to music wirelessly
the ue wonder whom also has around a
10-hour battery life but i did find that
playing music alphabet at heart volume
this significantly reduced the battery
life down to like four hours what makes
a wonder boom a little special is that
it is an omnidirectional speaker and
then it shoots music all around and it's
ipx7 certified which means it can be
submerged in water and it actually
floats as well which means if it falls
into a pool it'll be easier to get out
one thing I did notice and it happens to
most speakers the connection will cut
off if the speaker is submerged in the
water now when it comes to sound quality
I've heard better like I mentioned
earlier it's omnidirectional so you're
going to get sound playing 360 degrees
and it has no problem some of the room
or a bathroom and there's a lot of bass
to it as well and that bass itself is
very clean but everything else just
sounds shallow it's like listening to
music with your ears clods and it leaves
you wanting more
and when you raise the volume the mids
and highs start to sound very raspy and
so there's no auxiliary Jack you can't
get a wired connection going sure if you
pick this up don't expect the best sound
quality or value e is known for making
very easy to use speakers they did drop
the ball when it comes to gauging
battery life on a lot of other products
you can gauge the battery life thanks to
a few LEDs on the front or it'll just
slide I'll tell you what batteries
percentage is that when you first turn
it on apparently you we didn't get the
memo in order to get a battery
percentage estimate on the one boom you
have to press the plus and minus buttons
at the same time then the wonder boom
will play a tone and the loudness of the
tongue will signify if the battery is
full medium or low this is not optimal I
understand wanting to cut costs by not
putting LEDs in but not having to speak
or read out the battery percentage is
just pure oversight with all that being
said you're not going to pick up the
Wonder boom because you're looking for
something with great sound quality the
you we want to might appeal to you if
you're looking for something small and
is rugged enough to stay in the total
senses since there are no moving parts
exposed you don't have to worry about it
being damaged if it's packed in a
cramped agria something the wonder boom
is that dedicated speaker you take with
you to the beach the lake camping or on
a boat but I wouldn't pick this up if
this is going to be your bedroom speaker
especially since there are better
sounding alternatives on the market at
the same price point but what
boom is a good second speaker that you
beat us check out my JBL for reviews
