complete package it has dual passive
radiators dual transducers and dual
tweeters with built in Meridiana audio
technology it even has a built-in light
feature and it's somehow won a red dot
design award the LG pk7 is basically a
mash-up between the JBL extreme 2 and
the sony xba-40 1 but I feel this
speaker performs as good as it looks the
LG pk7
retails for 250 dollars which is what
the sony xba-40 one retails for and $50
less than what the JBL extreme 2 retails
for but the PK 7 is currently on sale
for $180 for good reason if you're on
the market for a large portable speaker
I suggest you consider the XP 41 or
extreme 2 instead of the PK 7 if you
want to pick either of these speakers up
I'll have links to description below and
if you use the links it really helps out
the channel I suggest you check them out
because Sony speakers routinely go on
sale so you might get lucky and also
check out the numerous shelves down
below first let's talk about design
I know design is subjective but this is
one ugly looking speaker but I will
admit that I kind of do like the white
color transducers on the front it
reminds me of the boughs and welcomes
audio system you would find in the
McLaren 7 20s or even some Volvo's the
build quality of the main body is decent
but I feel the action grip which is what
LG likes to call it is too flimsy for
its own speaker you can feel it flexing
while you're carrying this 6.3 pound
speaker around on the top of the speaker
there's a full set of media control
buttons that have a good amount of
tactile feedback but the ink on these
buttons is so cheap it's already started
to fade on my pk7
and now let's talk about ports the PK 7
charges via a DC input and there's an
audio jack for Wired listening but
unfortunately the speaker doesn't have a
USB out so you can't charge your own
devices regarding tech specs the PK 7
has a ten thousand four hundred million
power battery and LG advertises a twenty
two hour battery life on the PK seven
but with the light feature turned on the
music set at 80 percent volume and with
enhanced bass turned on
this speaker managed to last for eight
hours playback time but the light
feature on the front is only worth using
indoors or at night so you can always
squeeze a little more battery life out
of the speaker if you just turn off the
light feature the PK 7 is also rocking
an IP x5 certification so a little bit
of water won't be a problem but you
shouldn't submerge it but now let's talk
about Bluetooth connectivity the PK 7
does support aptX HD audio which is good
but unfortunately range on the speaker
is a little weak
compared to its competition I did notice
more frequent job connections than what
I'm used to with this speaker the PK 7
also has a bit of latency to it so it's
not the best for watching videos just
like most other portable speakers you
can pair the PK 7 to another LG PK
speaker but you can only pair this
beaker up to one other LG speaker which
is laughable compared to Sony and JBL
because those speakers allow you to pair
up to 100 speakers together now like
I've said in the past you don't need
that but I do think these speakers
should be able to pair up to at least 5
speakers but now let's talk about
speaker setups the PK 7 has a similar
speaker set up to the JBL extreme 2
there are dual forward-firing
transducers dual tweeters which is
something the xB 41 lacks and dual
passive radiators on each side the PK 7
essentially has three listening modes in
hand space clear vocals already can have
both EQ settings turned on we're gonna
jump into a sound test where you're
going to hear all three modes compared
to the extreme dos
deep into your eyes is it all forgiven
partially I think the pk7 sense is best
with its clear vocals EQ setting turned
on but when it comes to overall sound
quality but when he easily goes to the
JBL extreme - my problem with the LG pk7
is that it lacks clarity innocent
separation the soundstage is also pretty
narrow and even after a good break-in
period the bass still likes to distort
whereas the bass on the extreme - is
deeper and stays well put together even
when lessons - bass heavy music but my
biggest issue with the LG pk7 is that it
doesn't get all that loud a max volume
the extreme - and XP 41 easily stay
above the 100 DB mark but when the PK 7
is playing the same song at max volume
it has a hard time just getting above
the hundred DB mark and for comparison
the XP 31 which is considerably smaller
than the PK 7 is just as loud and if not
a little louder than the PK 7 and
finally let's talk about this speaker's
app there is one but it's only available
in Android it works fine but it is
pretty limited if you go into the sound
effects tab you can pick from one of the
two EQ settings which you can also just
talk from the speaker itself or if you
go into the lighting effects tab you can
pick from a few different color options
you can really only select the speed at
which you want the lights to blink and
what colors you want to show up but you
don't have actual different lighting
modes like you will find on the XP 41
where you can choose from rave chill
strobe and a few others but if you're
strictly looking for a speaker with RGB
lighting for your dorm room or something
then you'll be better off with the JBL
pull 3 and here's the microphone test
there's a lot of amplification going on
so there's a lot of echoing and Tenant
so I'm not a fan with this microphone
but this on your clip is being recorded
by the microphone on the LG PK 7 so
overall I can't recommend the LG pk7
even though it's build quality is OK its
overall design and belt and light
feature just doesn't look that great
compared to other speakers out there but
look society it just doesn't perform
well its sound quality lacks clarity so
Sam
is very narrow and in sermon separation
is very weak but perhaps my biggest
gripe with the speaker is that it
doesn't get all that loud for its size
there are midsize portable speakers that
get louder than this if you made it this
far I guess you enjoyed the video so hit
that like button and get subscribed it
helps out more than you realize support
