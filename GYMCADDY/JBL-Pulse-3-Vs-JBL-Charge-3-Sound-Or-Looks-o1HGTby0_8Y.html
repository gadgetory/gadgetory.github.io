post story is finally here the post
story is perhaps one of the most
anticipated JBL products in recent
memory but a lot of people want to know
which is better the brand new JBL plus 3
or 2 now when you're old charge 3 so
we're about to find out don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe
and you can watch my JBL posteriori
video here after you're done watching
this video the debut upholstery retails
for $200 and currently only comes in
black the white version should be
released in September but I personally
prefer the black version because it
makes the light feature look like it's
floating in mid-air the charge 3
currently retails for one hundred and
fifty dollars and comes in five colors
black blue gray red or teal but I have
seen to charge three on sale for $130
from time to time if you want to pick
either of these speakers up I'll have
links in the description below and I'll
keep them updated so you can get the
best you as possible the JBL pulls three
in the charge three both shared the same
cylindrical design they both have
passive radiators on either side of the
device that pump out bass and they're
both ipx7 certified which means they're
waterproof they both even float in water
but the JBL charge 3 is really just a
larger foot forward with that nylon mesh
outer wrapping around the whole body the
mesh outer does a great job of standing
up to bumps and scrapes and it really
doesn't stain the JBL post 3 also has
the same nylon mesh on the bottom
portion of the speaker but the majority
of the body is made out of really hard
plastic it's very doable but it will
eventually get scratched if you're too
Horning it on the back of the device
you'll find the micro USB port for
charging and an arm shack if you want to
have a wide connection for your music
the charge 3 also has a micro USB port
so you can charge your phone as well
I'll feature upholstery doesn't have
what I wish it did and for those who
carry the torch 3 gives you the option
to rest it flat or you can stand it on
its side the pulse 3 on the other hand
can only stand up right I just I you
should know
also the post 3 is slightly larger than
the charge 3 as well both of these
speakers also have the same controls on
them you can play or pause your music
you can skip a track you can press and
hold the play button to activate Siri
and you can answer or any calls but the
buttons themselves are very different
the charge 3 has texture blinds which
makes finding the buttons very easy you
can control your music without looking
which is great if you
multitask a lot like I do the post
freeze lines are flat so sometimes you
don't know what you're pressing well
thanks for the new button later on the
post three it's much easier to know
which button you're pressing then on the
JBL pulse - okay let's talk about stacks
they do charge three is using bluetooth
for that one what the JBL plus three is
using the church for that too there
isn't too much of a difference between
the two you can still connect to
multiple devices with either speaker but
the range is slightly better on the post
three and there's less latency less
latency means when you're watching
youtube videos the audio and video are
better in sync because I'm gonna charge
three the audio and video are in sync so
let's don't line up like right now
because it just added some leniency to
my video you understand we lay into you
them migration a lot when it comes to
the Buried the charge three does
outperform the post three by almost five
hours
the debut charge three should get you
twenty hours of playback walter JBL
poultry should get you 12 hours to
playback time with the life feature
turned on but in my testing you should
be able to squeeze out thirteen hours
out of the poultry with the life feature
turned on and I found that playing music
on the poultry with the live feature
turned off should get your battery life
of around fifteen hours although these
are both very impressive battery lights
the charge three might be the way to go
if your main concern is battery life but
keep in mind the charge three is an
advantage because it doesn't have a
light show obviously and like I said
earlier you can use the charge three as
a power bank to charge your phone thanks
to its charge output on the back both of
these speakers can also be paired to
other JBL speakers thanks to GPL Connect
and their app and it's very easy you
just press one binding to device what
the charge three is using the older JBL
connect while the poles three is using
JBL connect plus this means if you get
the JBL charge three you can only pair
older JBL speakers that are using jbo
connect so you can't pair to charge
three what the pulls three or the four
or any other future JBL speakers the
debut pull three is using the newer JBL
connect plus platform allowing you to
chain up to 100 speakers together you
can pair the JBL post three to another
JBL pulse 3 and get stereo sound going
and even get the light shows to play in
sync or you can pair a JBL flip for to
the post three and get them to play in
party mode which is great if you want to
fill a larger area with music
and it gets a little louder to the sound
quality on these speakers is also very
different for starters the charge 3 only
plays music out the front and since the
charge 3 is an older speaker it's a just
started to show it doesn't have that
much space
and the sound can get muddled at times
when the volume is set high not to
mention there's a lot of amplification
going on here sure you get to a little
louder and it has a little bit more bass
but ironically the foot force sounds
better than the charge 3 in my opinion
and the foot 4 has a sound distortion at
higher volumes and the foot for sound
stage isn't as narrow as a charge three
but the JBL pulls 300 the hand sounds
much better than the charge 3 first of
all it's not at 360 degrees speaker but
that's not why this speaker sounds
better than the charge 3 the post 3 has
much more based in the charge 3 as of
much wider soundstage with a good amount
of death and it sounds very crisp and
there's hardly any sound distortion or
rasping it at higher volumes in general
the JBL post 3 is a good sounding
speaker period both of these speakers
also connect to the same JBL phone app
in the case of the charge 3 all you can
really do is update the firmware check
your battery status and manage your
Gmail connect settings but for the JBL
post 3 the app does a whole lot more
JBL's connect app allows you to play
with the light feature of your post 3
for starters you can adjust the
brightness and obviously the brightness
of the light feature will play a role in
the speaker's battery life you can also
cycle through different light settings
they all flash to the beat of your music
but they each do so a little differently
there's ways jet explosion equalizer
rave rainbow fire and you can even make
your own
that's rainbow and fire separator not
not a rainbow fire you can change the
color of each setting either through
color matching with your camera or you
can use the color wheel if you're trying
to design between the charge 3 and
upholstery the light feature isn't the
deciding factor here the pulse 3
genuinely sounds way better than the
charge 3 like I said it has more bass
why the sound stage and just less sound
distortion if you have the extra $50 for
the pulse 3 then just get it the only
reason I would pick the charge 3 over
the post 3 is because I'm looking for a
longer Baddeley's
or something more durable in a which
case I would say
get the flip for and save yourself $50
but the JBL pole story is easily
