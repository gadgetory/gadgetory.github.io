with the new XP 21 XP 31 and XP 41
portable Bluetooth speaker but
specifically the Sony XP 31 is a refined
version of the sony xba-40 it's much
sleeker it's way more adorable and still
sounds great but the real question is
how does the sony xba-40 one compared to
the JBL charge 3 and my personal
favorite the JBL pull 3 let's find out
keep in mind this isn't a full review on
either of these speakers I'm just trying
to point out the most important
differences between them so I can help
you with your purchase decision if you
want to learn more about either of these
speakers then watch their full reviews
the sony xba-40 one is the newest
speaker here and it currently retails
for one $49.99 the JBL post three was
released in the summer of 2017 and
retails for $200 but can usually be
found on sale in the JBL charge three is
the oldest speaker here and also retails
for one 49.99 but can usually be found
on sale for about 120 bucks if you want
to pick either of these speakers up I'll
have a link of description below and if
you use the link really helps out to
channel check them out because you never
know when these speakers might go on
sale first up let's talk about a status
cuz these speakers look very different
from one another the JBL charge 3 is the
most tame looking speaker here with this
pill shape fabric mesh covered body
what does give us some style points are
the exposed passive radiators on the
sides the sony xba-1 also now has a
fabric mesh covered body and a new and
improved life feature the light feature
on the XB 31 looks much better than the
one in the xB 30 and it's also much
easier to see in private environments
and you also have a few lighting most of
two's from there's rave chill or rave
mode without the strobe lights and
strobe although the light feature on the
xB 41 looks cool customization options
are still pretty limited the JBL post 3
under the hand has 7 different lighting
modes to choose from and you can even
make your own personally I like jet and
fireworks the most but no matter which
light mode you choose the poultry is
going to get a lot of attention any time
someone sees it the JBL post 3 also lets
you customize the color of any of the
light feature either with your phone's
camera or you can just use a color wheel
all three of these speakers are also
waterproof but technically the XP 31 is
more durable than the charge 3 and post
3 because it's eye t67 rated
and shockproof while the JBL speakers
are both only ipx7 rated this means all
three of these speakers can be submerged
underwater but only the XP 31 is rated
to be dust and dirt proof I don't see
dirt being too much of a problem for the
charge 3 but you do have to be careful
when traveling with the pulsar II
because it's acrylic Todd can get
scratched up or if you drop it you could
crack when it comes to battery life
things start to get very different the
JBL post 3 has the worst battery life
here it advertises a battery life of 12
hours and I've managed to get more than
that with a less intensive life feature
like jet sent out of low brightness and
with the volume set at 50% but if you're
using a more intensive life feature like
equalizer set and max brightness with
the volume set at 85% then you'll be
lucky to get 4 hours with this guy the
XP 31 advertises about a life of 24
hours and I can get that with the light
feature turned off and what the volume
set at 50% but with the light feature
turned on and with the volume set at
about 80% I can get anywhere between 8
to 10 hours of playback time
JBL charge 3 advertises about a life of
20 hours but on the road will use this
speaker has the best battery life here
because it doesn't have a freaking life
feature the power with the volume set at
80% I can usually get about 12 hours of
playback time out of this guy okay now
about sound both the sony xba-1 and JBL
charge 3 are directional speakers they
both took the majority of their sound
out the front they both have dual
passive radiators and they both have a
pair of very similarly sized transducers
the transducers on the XP 31 have a
diameter of 48 millimeters and the
transducers on the charge 3 have a
diameter of 50 millimeters basically the
same but the post 3 is a 360-degree
speaker just like the charge 3 it has
dual passive radiators but the post 3
has 3 40 millimeter diameter transducers
hidden underneath the fabric portion of
its body
Oh
please
all three of these speakers sound very
different the charge story puts an
emphasis on the maids and has a lot of
trouble but it doesn't have too much
kick in the space the XP 31 is a very
warm speaker that pushes them vocals
back and puts an emphasis on the bass
and then there's the upholstery which I
feel is right in the middle between
these two speakers for the most part
it's pretty neutral vocalists don't get
muddled out but there's still a
surprising amount of bass it's not as
much as the XP 31 but it's enough to
keep you satisfied and when it comes to
the charge 3 I've always felt it was
lacking in base but the base I'm the XP
for anyone can get a little overwhelming
at times and muddled out the vocals and
some songs or especially in podcasts but
if you go into Sony's musics in rap you
will find a sound setting called a live
sound and when this is turned on the XP
31 starts to sound very similar to the
pulse 3 minton vocals were pushed
forward and the bass gets tamed a bit I
just wish you could turn the setting on
directly from the speaker instead of
having to go through the app every
single time but if you want to you can
also just adjust the EQ directly from
the app as well something that jbls app
doesn't let you do now when it comes to
loudness and Max volume the ranking is
as follows X P 31 pulse 3 and the last
place is the charge 3 last year if you
ask me to choose between the XP 30 and
charge 3 I would say pick the XP 34
sound and pick up the charge 3 for
adorability
but now with the sony xba-40 1 I feel as
the obvious choice when picking between
the XP 31 in charge 3 the XP 31 is more
durable than the torch 3 still sounds
great and I really like the new sleek
design and life feature but when
choosing between the XP 31 and pull 3
things get a little different the JBL
pulls 3 is great if you just plan on
living it at home and you want that wow
factor associated with the live feature
it still sounds good but due to his
variable battery life it's not the best
for taking it on the go personally I
don't think you can go wrong when
choosing the Sony NEX
31 if you want lots of bass you can just
turn on the extra bass feature if you
don't want the vocals to get muddy you
can just turn on live sound or adjust
the EQ battery life is also very good
and you have the added benefit of a
good-looking life feature if you made it
