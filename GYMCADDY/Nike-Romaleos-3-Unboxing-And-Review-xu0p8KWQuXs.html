training shoes these last couple of days
first we released the all-new make on
threes and now they've dropped their all
new roman' Leo grills just like the Mike
on three systolic saleroom alejo three
has been reworked and some features have
been retooled so how do they perform
should you throw your money at Nike and
hopes of increasing the squat let's find
out okay a lot about myself first
I've been squatted with my adidas a
decal for past three or four years I
personally like doing a high bar
beltless ask to grass squat whittany
sleeves and when it comes to Della's I
prefer to do it in barefoot or in touch
with that out of the way let's get
started with the review
first up the nike aroma leo is way
almost exactly the same as the adidas
attica both at one pound of one ounce
each most of the weight of the shoe is
distributed to the back of the shoe due
to the heel the Roma layers have a
honeycomb heel with the 20 millimeter
off set aside from looking like a
miniature piece of modern architecture
it also helps with the weight savings
unlike the heavy solid heel on the
Reebok Legacy's the huge open normal
arrows field is natural and is almost
identical to the adi power I did however
notice there was much more arch support
than usual no amount of arch support you
get from these shoes can also be easily
changed by swapping out there in soldier
you get one soft pair and a firm pair
the firm pair are slightly thicker and
could be great for people with high
arches I myself prefer the softer insole
just as you'd expect the Roma Leo's have
a rubber outsole it's not as sticky and
doesn't offer the same amount of grip
like the anti power or legacy but it
still gets the job done but the good
thing is the Roma leaders are very
flexible in the toe box area making them
great for Olympic lifts they're not as
flexible as the met cons but they're not
supposed to be the operand issue is
being mostly at a synthetic leather and
mesh for breathability
under the synthetic leather you will
also find Nikes fly wire system it does
its best with locking down your feet the
construction of the shoe is amazing with
little to no glue marks and no thread
sticking out the Roma Leo's also have a
single metatarsal strap but since the
shoes are so narrow in the Midford area
I family didn't need to use it and to be
honest a metatarsal strap on the room in
Leo's look like they're made out of
recycled seat belts nike did however
hide a little easter egg on the clasp of
the strap and printed go forth and
dominate which is pretty cool and when
it comes to fit the Roma layers are
narrow in the Midford area but then
widen open the toe box since they're so
narrow in the mid foot area I really had
no need for the strap and when it comes
to fit we need to talk about the heel
counter on the Roma Leo's just like with
the MEC
three I have the same heel slipping
problem Nike does provide an extra
eyelid for you to make a lace lock but
the laces are too short to actually
execute it and if you do manage to do it
you he'll still slips I tried going a
half-size down to a nine and a half but
if I do then the mid foot area is too
narrow and your heel slipping in the row
Malaya's isn't the only problem there's
also the tongue the tongue of the room
layers is the same as a mic on and every
time I go to tie my shoe and I pull on
the tongue I feel like I'm gonna rip it
also it doesn't offer any padding for
the instep of the foot so if you try to
tie in your shoe all that pressure goes
your instep but the good thing about the
tongue is that it doesn't slip inward as
you work out like the Reebok legacy do
cuz there is some grip on the bottom of
the tongue but the problems don't just
stop there I also have an issue with the
design of the shoe there are logos
plastered on every panel of this shoe
there's one of the toe Boxster's one of
the heel counter there's one on the
strap there's one on the tongue and
there's one on the outsole I feel like
I'm a walking billboard for Nike and I
bring this up because when Reebok
released their nano 5 point nose people
didn't like all the branding the Reebok
legacy and adidas adiPure on the other
hand have much more team branding and II
look much better because of it so what I
recommend the Roma layer-3 sadly but no
they're fit is uncomfortable the
metatarsal strap is useless your heel
constantly slip when you walk and the
lack of padding on the tongue make
prolonged wear intolerable if you're
looking for weightlifting shoes then I
recommend you go but they gave is at
accounting step the heel drop is almost
to say
and they are much more talkable to wear
and they have a better bail on them too
