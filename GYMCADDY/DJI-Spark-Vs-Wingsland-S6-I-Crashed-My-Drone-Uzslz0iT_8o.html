thought oh great a small compact road I
can use to make a proper breakfast video
against the DJI spark because already
did a DJI phantom 3 versus the details
for the video which you can watch right
here but then I try flying the wings I'm
at six
and this thing is a disaster there was
no way I was going to make a proper
versus video but I'm still going to make
a video but when Sun s6 gave me the
sense of appreciation for my DJI sport
and I just want to show you how awesome
this spark really is don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe and there's a
link down below if you want to pick up
the DJI spark at first glance the winds
nn6 looks awesome it's a small drone
that actually folds up and you can
actually put it in your pocket you don't
want a design award it has a 13
megapixel camera and it could shoot in
4k it has a removable battery and just
like the DJI spark you can control it
with your smartphone in a retail store
enjoy dollars but actually using this
thing is near impossible if you thought
that 18 minutes flight time of the DJ
spark sucked just waiting to hear with
the flight time on the wings ns6 is the
box advertises the s6 as having a
10-minute flight time but really it's
more like 7 or 8 minutes you might be
able to get 10 minutes of flight time if
all you do is hover one of the things
that makes the DJI spark so convenient
is that you can't order with the
microUSB cable you don't even have to
take out the battery out of the spark
and even if you did want to take the
battery out of the spark it's super easy
with the wings ns6 you have to take out
the battery and put in a charging cradle
to charge it but taking the battery out
of the winds ns6
is hard if you don't have nails I mean
just watch me try to take this out just
just watch a lot oh there we go there we
go it's out and then you gotta put into
the sort of clear the spark you just
plug in on micro USB cable you done and
the charge turn on these batteries is
also very different in order to get a
full charge on the DJI spark it'll take
about 80 minutes but to get a full
charge on the wings land at six it takes
around two hours for half the flight
time the spark gets have the fun of
owning the drone is actually flying it
and every time the wings then as six
takes off you don't know if it's coming
back or not controlling the wings and s6
is like coaching your drunk friend to
walk you time to take two steps to the
left but the trip and fall every single
time when the winds and s6 is hovering
you constantly have to manually adjust
it and keeping it steady after it gets
hit by Gus to win in their party
and if you do too many quick micro
adjustments on the wings and x6 it'll
eventually spiral out of control I've
already lost control of this drum three
times and had to crash-land it once into
a tree the second to the ground and the
third into a fence
I guess the software in the s6 doesn't
know how to counteract the extra
momentum when you adjust the aircraft or
maybe the poor control is a result of
the small propellers on the s6 and even
if you do manage to safely land the s6
don't go and grab it right away
the s6 gets really hot especially the
motors the DJI spark also gets a little
warm after flying but nothing like the
s6 actually flying the spark is very
easy and precise I've never lost control
of my DJ spark and it even helps you
from crashing it thanks to its 3d
sensing system on the front it can even
handle gusts of winds like a champ the
spark is so great it can even fly itself
I have no problems in the spark way up
high above water or even out of sight
and getting pictures or video with the
spark is much easier and you look better
the DJ Xbox camera is on a 2 axis gimbal
and you can even adjust the pitch of the
camera from your phone if the gimbal and
digital image stabilization gives you a
very level shot so you can get the
perfect picture every time the wings ns6
camera is on an o axis gimbal all it has
is digital image stabilization and
getting pictures and videos with the s6
is a challenge since you can adjust the
pitch of the camera you have to play
with the altitude of the aircraft and
actually watching the footage from the
ones ns6 on your computer or even on
your phone when you're flying it gives
you motion sickness you can control both
of these drones from your phone and the
software is very reminiscent of one
another what DJ software in UI is much
more refined and it's easier to use
DJI does a great job of giving you a
good amount of range and the feeders
usually consistent the wings and app on
the other hand struggles to give you a
consistent live feed of what the drone
sees and the controls can laugh from
time to time which make controlling the
s6 even harder and like I said earlier
since the s6 doesn't have a gimbal the
live feed you see from the drone on your
phone can give you motion sickness
and the worst part about the wings and
app is that sometimes the video files
will be corrupted or it'll say it's
recording but it's actually not I
actually had to go back out to location
to get the same shots with that six I
got the day before because I suffered
these problems I can go on and on about
how bad the Essex is but I think you've
got the message I thought this foldable
John had a lot of potential but it's
been nothing but a nightmare
all the Wayne's ns6 did was make me
appreciate my PGI spark even more if for
some reason you were thinking about
getting the wins and s6 over the DJI
spark don't do it just spend the extra
hundred dollars and spring for the spark
you'll think me later
