portable speaker lineup but when it
comes to my headphones that's a
different story you could have the best
sounding headphones with the best
battery life and the best active noise
cancellation
they don't fit well none of that matters
and that's pretty much my biggest issue
with the jbo II 65 BTN sees in poor fit
isn't just an issue that's exclusive to
the e 65 BTN sees even JBL is more
expensive headphones like the Everest
elite 750 NCS
suffer from poor fit as well but not as
bad as the e 65 the e 65 BTN sees retail
for $200 but I'm gonna have some better
fitting options link down below namely
the Sony whatcha Senate engine and the
Sennheiser is 5.50 BT and C's if you use
those links it really helps out the
channel and also check out the numerous
shelf down below the JBL each 65s come
included with a 2.5 to 3.5 mm audio
cable a micro USB cable for charging and
a pretty rugged carrying pouch and
overall the build quality of these
headphones is pretty decent you've got a
cool textured design on the plastic body
panels the headband is covered in a
fabric mesh which I personally liked cuz
it doesn't get jealous things like other
headphones that have leather underneath
their headband and the faux leather use
and the ear cups feels pretty good the
padding is too soft for my liking but
it's still pretty good the headphones
can be laid down flat or folded up and
the hinge that allows this is pretty
well made like I said build qualities
headphones is pretty decent but when it
comes to fit that's a different story I
know I'm biased here because I do have a
big head but these headphones have a
considerable amount of clamping force
and the ear cups don't apply even
amounts of pressure around the ear
instead they place the majority of the
pressure on the anterior portion of your
ear and this is both uncomfortable and
annoying and the reason these headphones
do that is because of their hinge the
ear cups on these headphones swivel more
than enough but they don't have as much
range of motion when it comes to
pivoting and other headphones that use a
similar hinge design like the Beats
Studio 3 or the Sennheiser HD ones might
not set as comfortably as headphones
that have a fork design like the
settings 5.50 BTN sees or the
700 ends headphones that have a fork
design like this almost always fit very
comfortably on your head as long as they
don't have too much clamping force when
it comes to battery life the JBL is 65
BTN sees or below average compared to
other $200 agency headphones these
headphones have a clean battery life of
24 hours but that's one thing insi
turned off with a and C turned on these
headphones barely manage to at 14 hours
of playback time but the Bluetooth
connection is pretty stable and since
they have very low latency these
headphones are decent for watching video
the active noise cancellation on the e65
also does a pretty decent job will
blocking out a good amount of
low-frequency sounds like road noise and
a good amount of chatter objectively
these headphones block out more noise
than the Sennheiser's and Sony's and so
you can see firsthand we're gonna jump
in 20 and seeta's if you have earbuds
put them in
but even though the e60 5's are all able
to block out the most
ambient noise here they have a
considerable amount of cabin pressure so
I was in fact that I couldn't only wear
these headphones for 30-minute intervals
and sometimes these does give me
headaches but I know that might not be
the case for some people when it comes
to sound quality my biggest issue with
these headphones is lack of clarity I
can't help but feeling these headphones
sound a little fuzzy and when you create
the volume up higher everything still
sounds a little distorted the sound
stage is also a little narrow instrument
separation is a little weak and these
headphones do tend to sound a little
shallow the base of these headphones is
also a little weak and since these
headphones don't connect the JBL
headphones app you can't directly change
their EQ settings now let's talk about
those control buttons their layout is
perfectly fine they're easy to find and
or easy to tell apart from one or
another but what I don't like about them
is that you have to press and hold the
volume up volume down buttons for a few
seconds to skip or go back a track this
just takes too long compared to most
other headphones out there instead I
would like if we could just double press
or triple press the center button to
skip or go back at Jack but in some of
these headphones if you double press the
center button you activate your voice
assistant and this is pretty annoying
Custance I'm so used to like double
pressing the center button to skip a
track I end up activating a siri by
accident and as always Siri is never
really useful alright and here's the
microphone test and long story short I
just want to take phone calls with these
headphones because there is a
considerable amount of static but this
audio clip has been recorded by the
microphone on the JDL East 65 BT and C's
so overall I have to give the JBL a 65
BTN C's credit where credit is due
quality is decent and they're active
noise cancellation blocks a considerable
amount of ambient noise but since these
headphones just don't sit well in your
head and combined with the fact that the
and Sandy's headphones have a lot of
cabin pressure these headphones are just
very uncomfortable to wear and when
choosing headphones comfort is the most
important thing to take into
consideration but since the battery life
on these headphones is below average
compared to other headphones on the
market and since their audio quality
lacks clarity
I just can't recommend these headphones
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
