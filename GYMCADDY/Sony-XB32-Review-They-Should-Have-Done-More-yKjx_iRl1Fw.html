headphones.
They currently have what are arguably the
best premium ANC headphones on the market
right now, and their redesigned Extra bass
headphones are looking very promising.
But their speakers on the other hand… that’s
a different story.
Technically, the new Sony XB32 does have some
improvements over the Sony XB31… but I feel
they should have done more.
The Sony XB32 is Sony’s newest mid sized
speaker that currently retails for $150…
which is the same that the Sony XB31 used
to retail for… but now it's typically on
sale for $100.
If you want to pick either of these speakers
up I’ll have them linked down below.
tech spec wise, under the hood the Sony XB32
is identical to the Sony XB31.
They both have the same IP67 rating which
means they’re both water and dust proof.
They both have an advertised battery life
of 24 hours.
But realistically with extra bass mode and
the light featured turned on and with the
volume on these speakers set to 80% we’re
lookin at a real world battery life of 8 hours.
They both charge via a micro USB port, which
sucks cause I know a lot of people wanted
to see USB C on the XB32 and they both have
a USB A out so you can charge your own devices.
They both even still have the same speaker
set ups under neath.
Both the XB32 and XB31 are rocking dual 48
millimeter frontward firing transducers and
dual passive radiators that shoot out the
front and back.
Both of these speakers are also still using
Bluetooth 4.2.
Now in general that isn’t a problem cause
they have stable connections that have no
problems going through multiple walls…
But they do have very different ranges.
In my testing, I found the XB32 was able to
match its advertised range of 30 feet, but
I also found that the XB31 has a wireless
range that’s twice as much as the XB32.
Now I know wireless range isn’t a huge deal
for some people, but I just feel that if you’re
looking into getting a portable speaker that
you wanna use in your back yard or at the
park you’ll might wanna know which of these
two speakers can go farther.
And in this case the range on the XB32 has
been down graded from the XB31.
But also if you use an android device with
either of these speakers you’re going to
get extra benefits like NFC pairing and LDAC
support.
But more importantly both of these speakers
have Zero Latency across board when watching
videos.
Where as when you use these speakers with
an apple device these speakers have a lot
of latency when watching youtube videos and
theres a very slight latency when watching
Netflix but its easy enough to ignore.
But what isn’t easy to ignore is the new
redesign found on the XB32 from the XB31.
Now design is subjective and personally I
like how the XB32 looks… three quarters
of this speaker is covered in soft touch material
that feels great in the hand, the front grill
of this speaker is covered in a fabric mesh
similar to the XB31 and we’ve got the same
wrap around RGB light strip that looks great
in dimly lit rooms or at night.
But personally I think going back to a soft
touch rubber body on the XB32 wasn’t the
greatest idea, cause this speaker isn’t
as rugged as the all fabric covered XB31.
My XB31 looks as good as the day I got it.
And this is a speaker that is constantly taken
to cook outs, taken to the beach, its been
dropped, and constantly submerged in water.
But still, thanks to its all fabric body it
still looks like new.
But now, since the XB32 has gone back to a
soft touch body like the XB30 its going to
show wear and tear over time.
If you get this speaker wet there are going
to be some water marks just don’t come out
and whether you like it or not this speaker
is going to be a scratch magnet.
So like I said, I like how this speaker looks
but I think going back to a soft touch rubber
body is a step in the wrong direction.
But something Sony did improve on the XB32
from the XB31 is how this speaker sounds with
extra bass mode turned on… which is Sony’s
default EQ setting for their speakers and
its their sell that their speakers have lots
and lots of bass.
And just so you can see for yourself we’re
about to jump into a sound test.
All of these speakers are playing with Extra
Bass Mode turned on and they’re all playing
at the same loudness.
So definitely, Sony has improved their Extra
Bass settings on their new XB32.
The Sony XB32 keeps that rich punchy bass
but since the mids are much more pronounced
the vocals on the XB32 doesn’t sound muddled
out like on the XB31 or XB41.
And personally I think the XB32 sounds better
than the XB41 and XB31 when they all have
Extra Bass mode turned on.
But through Sony’s music center app you
can easily go in and adjust the EQ on any
of these speakers.
And if you were to go in and raise the Mids
and High’s on the XB31 its going to preform
just as well as the XB32.
And when it comes to max volume, again the
XB31 gets just as loud as the XB32.
Now here in this demo it may seem like the
XB32 gets slightly louder than the XB31, but
keep in mind since Extra Bass mode on the
XB32 has more pronounced mids than the XB31…
that’s what making this speaker seem a little
louder.
But if you were to raise the mids in the XB31
its going to get just as loud.
But in general both of these speakers are
good sounding speakers.
They get decently loud making them great for
indoor and out door use, they have very rich
bass, and distortion at higher volumes isn’t
a problem.
But through sony’s app you can also go in
and select from a few different lighting modes
for either of these speaker’s light strips.
The main light modes here are Rave, chill,
strobe, and a rave mode without the annoying
strobes lights.
And like I mentioned earlier the light strips
on both the XB32 and XB31 look great in dimly
lit rooms or at night.
But besides a minor redesign the light strips
on both of these speakers perform exactly
the same.
They both get just as bright and they both
hit the same colors.
However, the XB32 can connect to Sony’s
fiestable app.
Now besides being an eyesore, the fiestable
app gives you some control over the XB32’s
light feature.
Basically you can set your own color.
Personally I don’t care that the XB31 can’t
connect to the fiestable app, but I’m doing
my best here to show case the minor differences
between the XB32 and XB31.
But now lets talk about pairing multiple sony
speakers together.
Sony’s wireless party chain allows you to
pair up to 100 sony speakers together.
And you do this by first pressing the WPC
button on all of your Sony speakers, you then
go into the music center app on your phone
and press on the wireless party chain tab
and say a little prayer.
Now Sony’s WPC feature is fairly stable
but sometimes speakers will get out of sync
or sometimes you have to go through the pairing
process multiple times to establish a connection
between all of the speakers you’re trying
to connect cause sometimes it just fails…
and sometimes when you do manage to establish
a connection not all of the speakers you wanted
to pair actually connect.
Personally, Sony’s WPC protocol falls a
little low on my list compared to other companies
pairing method cause its not as stable or
as easy to initiate.
So for that reason I would only recommend
looking into getting a sony speaker if you
only want one speaker.
And for those wondering… yes the XB32 can
connect to older speakers like the XB31 or
XB30 but no even though the XB31 and XB32
are basically the same speaker they can’t
be paired up to play in left and right stereo
mode.
If you want to do left and right stereo mode
you need to have two XB32’s.
So, with all things considered… personally
I can’t recommend the new Sony XB32 when
the Sony XB31 is still on sale and for $50
less.
And in some cases I feel the XB31 is superior
than the XB32 cause of its longer Bluetooth
range and much more durable body.
Even though yeah, the XB32 sounds better than
the XB31 with Extra Bass Mode turned on…
you can easily get the same sound out of the
XB31 by manually adjust its EQ.
And depending on when you’re watching this
you can also get the Sony XB41 for the same
$150 cause it routinely goes on sale.
But personally, even though I really like
Sony’s current line up of headphones…
the Sony XB32 is a hard pass for me given
that the XB31 is still readily available.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
