Skullcandy venues 480 dollar ANC
headphones that I feel they
under-deliver cuz their build quality
isn't the best their ANC isn't that good
and their base bottoms out way too much
but when it comes to the new-school
candy crusher of 360s that's a whole
other story these things are sensory
overload and I love it
they're definitely not for everybody and
I would have done a few things
differently but overall these are just a
lot of fun when the Skullcandy questions
360s were first announced I was shocked
when I heard they were going to retail
for $300 that's twice as much as what
the original school candy crushers are
currently retailing for but I think the
question 360s aren't going to be
replacing the og crushers cuz they're on
a whole other level and I think the $300
price tag is justified so if you want to
pick either these headphones up I'll
have links to description below and if
you use the links it really helps out to
Channel I highly suggest you check them
out because you never know when these
headphones might go on sale she might
get lucky and also check out the
numerous shelf down below the Skullcandy
questions 360s come included with a hard
shell carrying case that's on par with
what you would get with the most QC 35
or the Beats Studio 3 and it's
definitely an upgrade from the carrying
pouch that comes included with the og
crushers the crush of 360s also come
included with a very good quality 3.5
millimeter audio cable with an inline
controller now I'll go into detail about
the inline controller later in the video
but I really do like to see this higher
quality audio cable here because most
other $300 plus headphones really skimp
out on this these days the crusher 360's
also come included with a good quality
micro USB cable for charging bots given
that it's late 2018 and these are
premium headphones without a doubt they
should have come included with the USB C
port instead but when it comes to the
design and build quality with these
headphones I can see why the $300 never
and ear-cups have a softer feel to them
very similar to the sony 1000 XM 3 they
have exposed metal on the frame of these
headphones and the leather on the ear
cups and headband feels much more
premium than anything you will find on
school candies other headphones but this
means the course for 360s are pretty
heavy because they weigh in at 322 grams
whereas most other headphones weigh in
somewhere between 230
in 290 grams but even though the
question 360s are pretty heavy they're
still very comfortable to wear for
extended periods of time I've had no
problem wearing these headphones for
three-plus hours with no wearing fatigue
or overheated ear cups they don't have
anywhere as much clamping force as the
OG crushers but they're not as loose as
the Sony's or Bo's for me those call
candy questions 360s fit me like a glove
and they are big head approved which is
something I can't say about the og
crushers one of my biggest issues with
the og crushers is that since their ear
cups don't pivot too much and in the
putting a lot of pressure on the
anterior portion of your ear and it
looks like skull candy really took this
into consideration because the question
360s pivot a lot more and they do so
much easier but even though the skull
candy crush's 360s fit me very well
their ear cups might be a little cramped
for people with larger ears or ears that
stick out a lot even though that your
cups on the cross or 360s are
significantly larger than the ear cups
found on the og crushers and venues my
medium-sized ears just barely manage to
fit but overall I'm a really big fan of
how the question 360s fit and look they
have a timeless low-profile design that
doesn't scream I have basehead
headphones on like a certain other pair
of Bayside headphones and I personally
didn't expect to like the limited
edition colorways so much when it comes
to tech specs the Skullcandy question
360s is also no slouch they have an
advertised by relief of 29 hours but
keep in mind your battery life will vary
depending on how high you have your bass
turned up for me since I keep my bass
has 60% I've been getting 22 hours
playback time out of these headphones
not bad and they also have some pretty
decent fast charging if you plug them in
for 10 minutes from a dead battery
they're gonna get you three hours
playback time which is actually a little
better than the bose qc25 series too but
not as good as the Skullcandy venue but
when it comes to their bluetooth
connection there's some good news and
some bad news
these are phones were rockin bluetooth
4.1 and the good news is is that they
have a very stable connection and
there's actually very little latency so
they're actually pretty good for
watching videos on your phone but the
bad news is is that you can only be
connected to one device at a time which
does suck and I do find it a little odd
because the new venues can be connected
to two
Isis at a time now when it comes to
sound quality keep in mind these
headphones are meant for people who
absolutely love bass and the bass on
these headphones over delivers in the
best way possible well that's something
some music with these headphones is just
pure fun the based on these headphones
just adds this extra element where you
can literally fill your music or feel
like your front row at a concert like I
mentioned earlier I keep the bass on
these headphones at 60% I feel it's the
right amount where you can feel your
music but still hear your music even
though the bass is its own entity if the
bass is too high it does overpower the
rest of the song but even though these
are our bass head headphones these are
still good sounding headphones period
with the bass effect turned off they
have a neutral sound signature with a
good amount of bass in trouble
the clarity and soundstage is also very
good but I do think instrument
separation could be better but with the
bass effect turned on the quality of
instrument separation doesn't matter the
only thing I wish I could do with the
question 3 surfaces is bring out the
mids a little so you can still hear them
when the bass really gets going for a
long period of time now overall the
sound quality of the crusher 360's is
obviously better than the sound quality
of the ogee crushers the bass on the OG
crushers doesn't sound like bass
compared to the 360s it just sounds like
someone's flicking metal Springs next to
your ears it doesn't sound good and it
just makes the bass feature on the OG
crushers look like a gimmick whereas the
bass on the question 360 is clean it
sounds good and the Mac space on the og
crusher feels like when the bass on the
oh gee crusher 360's is set to 40% but I
can't help but notice the crusher 3
Sexy's don't get as loud as the og
crushers which in the long run is good
because it saves your hearing but when
wearing these out in public I can't help
but want the crusher 360s to be one or
two steps louder now when it comes to
actually adjusting the bass effect on
the Skullcandy question 360s there's
actually a touchpad on the left ear cup
which is an upgrade from the slider
found on the og crushers and it's very
accurate but I personally feel this is
nothing but a gimmick since there's
really only six bass levels including
off I feel the touchpad is unnecessary I
think school candy should have just used
a 2 button rocker to adjust your bass
level if it meant reducing the price of
the crusher 360s to maybe two
fifty dollars instead but since we're
stuck with the touchpad I would have
liked if the headphones gave you some
haptic feedback as you raised or lowered
the base effect and maybe gave you a
double rumble when you set the base
effect to 100% cuz right now since you
don't feel anything as you adjust a base
on these headphones you either have to
wait for the base that come in whenever
your music is playing or just take the
headphones off and look at the gauge now
on the right ear cup dad's where you'll
find your meter controls and I like this
button layout easy to find easy to tell
apart and they have a good tactile
feedback the only thing I like about
them is that you have to press and hold
the plus or minus button to skip a track
or go back a track and I know I've been
very vocal about this cuz I hate when
headphones do this because it takes much
longer to skip a track compared to
double or triple pressing the center
button like on other headphones but
oddly enough you can't activate your
voice assistant with these headphones
double pressing or pressing and holding
the center button doesn't do anything if
you want to argue with Siri you're gonna
have to activate it first from your
phone and then talk to your headphones
concerning the audio cable I mentioned
earlier I like it because there's a
play/pause button on the back that if
you double press or triple press it's
going to skip through your music which
is the right way to do it there's also a
volume rocker that's going to adjust the
volume locally on the headphones but not
on your phone so just keep that in mind
the first time you plug them in and when
they're plugged in you can still adjust
your bass effect using the touchpad but
I do have to point out that those called
candy crush or 360s do sound a little
better when used with a wired connection
versus a wireless connection which is
important to take note of because you
were premium headphones these days like
to Sony 1000 xm3 can give you lossless
audio even with a wireless connection
now even though I really do like the
new-school candy crush for 360s
I don't like how they're missing key
features from the new Skull Candy venue
given that there were announced
alongside one another and it's clear the
cross for 360s
or Skull candies flagship product now I
really wish the crush to 360s had tile
integration like the venue's cos correct
me if I'm wrong I feel you want to be
able to find your 300 other headphones
if you misplace them or someone at
school stole them from me who knows you
might wanna have her still conversation
with that I also wish the crusher 3 says
he's had a modeling mode like didn't
venues do
I guess the skirt when I want that one
but she got but I think that in order to
get that feature working properly you
need one or two more microphones built
into the crusher 360s because right now
the school can do 360s only has one
microphone built in them and it sounds
pretty mad but this audio clip has been
recorded by the microphone found on the
Skullcandy question 360s so you would
adjust to that but overall like you said
the beginning of this video
I love the Skullcandy questions 360s
there's just a lot of fun sure they're
missing some features I would like to
have from the school candy venue and I
think they should have had a USB C port
but I can't help but crack a smile every
time I wear these headphones it's not
even fair to compare the crush to 360s
to the og crushers because the crusher
360s are in a whole other League they
were built better they fit better they
look better in the sound better I don't
know what happened with the venues but
Skullcandy knocked it out the park with
the crush of 360s but I know that $300
for a pair of bass head headphones is
pretty steep because for around the same
money you can pick up the bose qc25 or
the Sonia 1000 x + 3 and sure these
headphones in the long run could be more
useful cuz of their a and C they fit
better and they have more technology
packed inside them but I like so look at
these headphones like cars
the Sony's and Bo's are like your
Mercedes s550 or BMW 7-series they're
meant to get you to where you're going
in comfort and style whereas the
Skullcandy question 360 is your Porsche
911 or outie r8 sure they cost about the
same as the luxury sedans but these are
all about driving dynamics and just
having fun and I feel that's what does
call candy crush or 360s are all about
just having fun if you made it this far
