is the trifecta of the most popular
consumer noise cancelling headphones on
the market right now and since they all
cost the same you want to know which has
the best noise cancellation the best
battery life and the best sound quality
so we're about to find out don't forget
to Like comment and subscribe and you
can watch either these headphones
individual reviews here after you don't
want in this video all three of these
headphones retail for three hundred and
fifty dollars and they all come included
with the hard shell carrying case and
audio cable for Wired listening a new
micro USB cable for charging only to
Sony 1000 XM 2 comes included with an
airplane adapter both the Sony 1000 xn 2
and the boss QC 35 to only come in two
color ways but the Beats Studio 3
currently come in six colorways if you
want to pick either of these headphones
up I'll have links in description below
and I'll keep them updated so you can
get the best deal possible beats and
Sony headphones typically go on sale so
you might get lucky
first let's go over build quality the
Bose QC 35 2 panels are made out of
glass filled nylon inner screwed into
place the headband flexes without any
squeaking and they have the best feeling
synthetic leather on the ear pads they
without a doubt have the best build
quality in this group and they're also
the lightest weighing in at 231 grams
whereas the Sony and beats
weigh in at 274 grams in two hundred
fifty nine grams respectively now the
build quality on the sony 1000 accent 2
is good and even after a month of heavy
use I have yet to suffer from any kind
of cracking on the headband which the
previous generation Sony and the are
1000 X was infamous for and although the
Beats Studio threes does have the second
best feeling synthetic leather on the
ear pads I'm worried about the overall
build quality the majority of the body
is made out of thin plastic and I'm more
if the locking hinges will wear out
after a while
when it comes to comfort the Bose QC 35
- you also take this category if they
have the biggest ear cups in this group
and they do the best job of encasing
your whole ear the headband on the Bose
also have the least amount of clamping
force and when placed on your head the
ear pads have the least amount of
surface area in contact against your
skin this means a much more comfortable
fit in ear pads desta cooler for long
the Sony 1000x and to is still
comfortable to wear but the ear pads are
slightly smaller so they might press
against your earlobe they do have a
little bit more clamping force and they
do heat up a little faster and then
there's the Beats Studio threes that
have the smallest ear cups that your
pads heat up the fastest and they have
the most clamping force but like I said
I - review the Beats Studio 3 stay in
place is very well even when you're
exercising thanks to the extra clamping
force and the rubber on the bottom of
the headband so they would be my top
pick for working out but although the
beats are the coolest looking headphones
in this group I really wish that your
pens themselves had more range of motion
they don't pivot or swirl as much as the
other two headphones and as a result
they do play some unnecessary pressure
on the anterior portion of your ear but
like I've said in past videos the both
UC 35 - hands down have the best build
quality and comfort and they will not
disappoint in that regard now let's talk
about battery life when noise
cancellation turned on the sodium 1000x
nto is the winner I typically average
about 32 hours of playback time whereas
the most UC 35 - and the Beats Studio 3
typically average about 25 hours and
they all have quick charging if you plug
the Sony's in for 10 minutes you get
about 70 minutes of play that time if
you plug the Bose in for 15 minutes you
get two and a half hours to play that
time but if you plug the beats in for 10
minutes you get three hours playback
time and to be fair with noise
cancellation turn off the beats to do
three wins with this monstrous wilt
world battery life of 47 hours the Bose
and Sony don't even come close we're
going noise cancellation let's start off
with the beats because I think they're
the weakest right now you can only
either have it on or off and you can
toggle it by either double pressing the
power button or from the Bluetooth
settings Apple calls their system
adaptive pure noise cancellation and it
automatically adjusts depending on your
surroundings when you're in a quiet area
the noise cancellation is set low and
you feel no cabin pressure but when
you're in an area with much more ambient
sound the noise cancellation will
automatically get stronger but when that
happens you do start to feel some
pressure on your eardrum even while
playing music and unfortunately you have
no control over your noise cancellation
but I am hoping Apple will add the
functionality and a software update like
Bose they with their previous boast you
see
fives now the noise cancellation on the
bose qc25 - is significantly better than
on the Beats Studio three but there is
slightly more cabin pressure some people
are able to get used to it after a while
and for some other people like myself
all they do is cause headaches but
through boses Connect app you can also
adjust the noise cancellation from high
low and off but the biggest problem with
the noise cancellation on the bus keeps
835 - is that it picks up a lot of wind
noise the bee studio threes also pick up
a good amount of wind noise but not as
much as the Bose and then there's the
Sony 1000 accent - which picks up the
least amount of wind noise in this group
and I feel they have the best noise
cancellation in this group as well they
managed to block out more sound and
there's almost no cabin pressure at all
which is just very impressive
and through Sony's headphones app you
get a lot more control over the noise
cancellation you can have the noise
cancellation automatically adjusts
depending on your surroundings just like
the beats or if you want you can even
specify how much ambient sound you would
like to live in which is good for safety
reasons you can even make it so the
headphones will only blackout ambient
sounds but let people's voices in when
it comes to sound quality I feel the
ball screw c35 2 is the most tamed in
this group the biggest problem I have
with them is their lack of bass it's
never enough and there's a good amount
of sound distortion at higher volumes
and the highs do tend to crash more
frequently and then there's your Beats
Studio 3s that have a good amount of
bass to keep you happy but the low ends
and mids are almost non-existent well
like I said on my initial review I
prefer to be studio threes over the Bose
QC 35 twos I gotta have my bass and then
there's the Sony 1000 XM 2 which I feel
are the best sounding in this group the
highs almost never crash and they suffer
from the least amount of sound
distortion at higher volumes and unlike
the beats they perform very well in the
lowest admit and they have more than
enough base and through Sony's
headphones that you can adjust the EQ
and make them sound however you like
something you can't do with the Bose or
beats without using a third-party app
but each of these headphones also have
their own special features to take into
consideration for starters the bose qc25
2 has a dedicated button to activate
google assistant and it works on both
apple and android but it does work
better in android and what it does is
that it streamlines your interaction
with your voice assistant there's no
awkward waiting period if you press and
hold the button down your instantly
talking to Google assistant and if you
press it once it'll instantly tell you
the time and any notifications you
I have obviously you can activate your
voice assistant on either the Beats or
Sony by just pressing and holding the
beast logo or on the touchpad but is not
as efficient as the dedicated button on
the bows and with the beats you can also
just say hey Siri what do you think
about Syria well respect being an
assistant is hard work it's 343 p.m. you
don't have any recent updates
what's alphabets current stock price the
current price for alphabet Inc class a
stock is 1012 dollars and 61 cents up
0.16 percent from yesterday what do you
think about Google I think therefore I
am
but let's not put the cart before the
horse Rema notifications you have
notifications from assistant clock and
doogle you have one notification from
assistant bose qc25 i i connected now
set up your google assistant ah nice
headphones shall I read the rest no okay
hey Siri what's Apple's current stock
price checking on that stock Apple is
down a bit 67 cents or 0.42% to $159 and
80 cents and then there's the beach
which are using Apple's w1 chip aside
from instinct pairing you can easily
switch from either Apple devices without
having to fiddle around with the
Bluetooth settings every time but keep
in mind the bose qc25 2 can be paired to
two devices at the same time and for
some people that's plenty but regardless
it is still much easier on the beats and
it's also worth mentioning the Sony can
only be paired to one device at a time
so you can't just hot swap unfortunately
you have to go through the pairing
process every single time but aside from
giving you extra control over your noise
cancellation and overall sound quality
the Sony 1000x and 2 also have one extra
killer feature the Sony 1000 X and to
have quick attention and basically
if you're listening to music and someone
is talking to you you don't have to take
your headphones off or positive music
all you have to do is cover the right
ear cup and the headphones will
automatically lower your music and allow
all of the ambient sound in so you can
talk to someone with your headphones
still on so overall my top pick for the
best headphones in this group or the
Sony 1000 accent - they sound the best
have the better noise cancellation the
best battery left with an C on and they
give you so much control over your sound
and a and C but they aren't the most
stylish that award goes to the bass to
do three but for the best build quality
and comfort then you've got to go with
the Bulls QC 35 - not to mention if
you're an Android user that uses Google
assistant a lot having that dedicated
button is a huge plus personally I
really think Apple should have included
a similar feature on the Beast Studio 3
and like I mentioned earlier I would
only consider get him to be studio 3 if
I was looking for headphones to work out
in and if they were on sale but remember
this isn't a full review on either of
these headphones I'm just trying to
point out the most important differences
between them so I can help you with your
