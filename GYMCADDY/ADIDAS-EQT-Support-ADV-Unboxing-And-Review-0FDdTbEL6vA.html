these drops I can't keep up that being
said if you just drop the hope into
silhouettes under tqt line up some have
boots punished though some are high top
and some are low time well today we've
got the adidas eqt supports a BB for
review there's no boost in these and or
more of a lifestyle shoe if you want to
pick these up finish line has them in
two colorways right the black and silver
red color way is we're really set these
shoes apart but a few of f√°tima just
look silhouette and not so much the
color combination you can get them in
triple black as always my link is in the
description below if you want to get up
here satisfied has them for one time
with free shipping well the eqt support
adv is a shoe that's more about style
and not so much performance you get a
pretty bare-bones rubber outsole it's
different in that spring is Boost
obviously but it is extremely stylized
and gives the shoe a lot of character
the one thing I do wish they did better
was painting the adidas crease type logo
on either side of the shoe up close it
looks a little messy but you will notice
the imperfection at all from afar it's
just a pet peeve of mine the upper of
the shoe is where all the fun is the
majority of the shoe is made of adidas
digi camel climate it's a flexible
breathable and very comfortable but it's
different from what you would find on
the ultra boost or nmd it's completely
smooth compared to the raised and
textured pattern on the ultra boost and
it's not a spin or is elastic add the
primate on the end of the the knit on
the 8 QT is that sweet spot right
between the ultra boost and lmv but
since the eqt upper is made of knit
material your feet will get cold when
it's windy or cold outside I learned
that the hard way will walk around Times
Square in 29 degree weather also there
are certain static new buck toe overlays
on the shoe which help with the
construction of the shoe and keep your
feet in place while you walk alright
let's talk about the back of the shoe as
you can see obviously it's big or as a
penis causes a trouble right whether you
call it pink turbo red or salmon one
thing is true it looks really good in
person the really cool thing about the
turbo red panel is that it's reflective
which means two things
a you'll be visible at night while
you're walking so you won't get run over
by a car unless he was aiming for you or
B these shoes are going to look really
fresh in social media pictures there's
also a really large soft TPU support
piece that wraps all around heel it's a
little transparent as well so you can
still make up the colors underneath
there are also plastic lace loops which
are attached to nylon straps on the shoe
which act as the cage unlike the old
shoe boots with Chavez
CPU cage and doesn't really do much when
you tighten the laces the aqt really
allows your users to customize defense
much more than the ultra boost energy or
even pure boost one thing I do want to
point out about these shoes is that they
have some really long laces the one
gripe I have with these shoes is the
fabric they use that connects the tongue
and the heel the fabric doesn't stress
that much and makes putting your feet in
a little hard it's also just as hard to
take off your shoes because of it I have
noticed it started to break in after a
few wears but a little bit of gears in
that area would really be appreciated
when it comes to fit these shoes are a
little big
usually with most other shoes my true
size is the time but when I tried to EQ
to support a TV the tens were way too
big lengthwise so I decided to go with
the size nine and a half so if you
decide to pick these shoes up online go
a half-size down overall the adidas EQC
support adv is a really unique looking
shoe you have a really clean silhouette
a style Iseman so super comfortable
flatten an upper and a total rebel
spectrum panel sejin stands for
attention although the lack of blue
seams are not as comfortable the EQ
teeth before do have ortho light
performance insoles that do help for 110
dollars you are getting a really cool
looking shoes that look like they could
be worth more hey if you made it this
