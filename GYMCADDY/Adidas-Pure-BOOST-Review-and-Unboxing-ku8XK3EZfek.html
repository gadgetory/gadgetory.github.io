finally got a chance to pick up the 2017
adidas pure blue if you've been
following the channel then you know I do
love so much in fact I think everyone
should have at least one pair of boots
something so these are went ahead and
dropped our updated pure boost model
which is a slightly more affordable
performance running shoe than the ultra
boost you can pick up a pair of pur
boots over at finish line con for 140
with free shipping they actually come in
five colorways right now and I'm really
diggin that Burgundy slash mystery my
colorway and as always my link of them
to the description below if you want to
cop a pair comment below and tell me
which colorway is your favorite just
like the ultra booster pur boost have a
webbed outsole but there are some slight
differences
unlike the ultra boost this is not
continental rubber which means is not a
sticky and I'd assume not as durable but
only time will tell
I did however notice the contact patches
on the pure boost are much larger than
on the ultra boost and the outsole is
slightly thicker if you really study it
the web outsole also wraps itself up the
arch of the shoe and is supposed to help
with arch support but I didn't really
feel a difference maybe they
incorporated it because the pure boost
doesn't have a torsion system like the
og boost next up is the reason why I
love adidas right now and it's that
boost midsole just as you'd expect of
pure boost are very comfortable to wear
but there are slightly less comfortable
than the ultra boost missile design of
the pure boost is very definite on the
ultra boost it really bulges out
everywhere on the shoe it's very thick
with the queue but it gets thin on the
forefoot area which is great for power
delivery if you decide to run in these
shoes the forefoot of the shoe is also
much wider than the forefoot of the
ultra booth another thing to notice is
that you don't get an insole with the
pure boos like you do with the ultra
boots instead you get that felt lining
like you do with nmd I don't really mind
it on to see if you do decide to pick up
a pair you should go to the size next up
is the upper instead of primeknit
Adina's use circle name the sort of late
is much sturdier than primeknit it's
also not as soft or flexible what it is
just as breathable the primeknit and the
electrical sternum D is much more
comfortable than the circle knit on the
pure boost what is that a deal-breaker
whatsoever the heel counter on the pubis
is also much stiffer and has less
padding but there's absolutely no heel
slippage which is good the tongue of the
pure boost is different
adidas calls this a burrito wrapped
upper and it's supposed to give the user
a customizable fit but I don't really
see how once the shoes on it's on and
final we've got the laces actually
adidas was cool enough to give you two
sets of laces instead of just one
they're both the same pattern but you
got one round pair and flat pattern I
guess adidas knows if runners are going
to wear these are going to want flat
laces while people who are just wearing
these shoes casually wouldn't mind round
laces
unlike the laces on the NMD r2 which is
just weaved through the primeknit the
pubis actually uses eye loops instead
there's actually an extra eye loop if
you want a more secure fit and better
lock down for running overall the adidas
pure boots is a slightly more affordable
and performance focused shoe compared to
any home to be dollar for dollar price
tag doesn't endure slight trade-offs
when it comes to the outsole and
slightly less comfortable upper the
circle made offer on the pubis does a
better job of keeping your feet warm
when it's from the outside compared to
villager boots and the wider for food is
wafer power delivery overall the pubis
is a great training and everyday wear
shoe I'm probably gonna end up getting a
pair of the runner - hey if you made it
