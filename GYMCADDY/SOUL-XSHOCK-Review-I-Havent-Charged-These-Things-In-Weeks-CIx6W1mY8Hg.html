wireless earbuds and there's a whole
bunch of subcategories in the wireless
earbuds market those who are everyday
wireless earbuds like the air pods and
pixel buds and then there's your premium
wireless earbuds like the sony WF 1000x
which feature active noise cancellation
and Sony's even going to be releasing a
pair of open back wireless earbuds later
this year but the biggest subcategory is
the sports wireless earbuds and soul is
taking a bit of a different approach
especially when it comes to their
carrying case so let's check them out so
they send these out for review but it
doesn't mean I'm gonna take it easy on
them the extract retails for one sixty
nine ninety nine but you can get them
for one forty nine ninety nine depending
on where you look regarding what you get
with the XJ it's pretty simple you get a
micro USB cable for charging a carrying
pouch a carabiner so you can clip the
charging case to your workout bag if you
want and a small set of silicon new tips
if you want to pick these your buds up
I'll have links for description below
and if you use the links it really helps
out to channel first let's go over the
case because this is the main thing I
like about the ex-jock first off it's
huge its footprint is basically double
of what the air pod cases and it's
slightly thicker but cases for a
wireless sports earbuds are typically on
the larger side case in point the
jaybird run and bose sound sport free
wireless their cases are huge - what
seoul decided to shove in a 3000
milliamp hour battery in there the
earbuds themselves typically last me
three hours of continuous use which I
feel is more than enough for an average
workout session at the gym but the case
is able to fully charge these earbuds a
total of sixteen times I've been testing
these earbuds for the last three weeks
and I go to the gym four times a week
and I still haven't had to charge the
carrying case since I fully charge them
the first day I got them so cleanse the
X shark are good for a total of 54 hours
of use whereas the jaybird and bose are
only good for a total of 12 and 15 hours
respectively when you open that magnetic
lid on the case you'll see four ladies
that show you the cases battery status
on microUSB port for charging the case
and the USB out so you can charge your
own phone obviously you're going to be
sacrificing some of your earbuds battery
life but I feel this is a great feature
to have
since the carrying case
so big might as well make it a portable
charger personally I just wish sole use
a USBC instead of a microUSB port since
USBC is starting to catch on okay now
let's talk about the earbuds themselves
they're mostly made out of plastic they
have a little bit of rubber on them and
the build quality is just fine they
weight in at five grams each and they do
a very good job of staying in place when
you put them in at least for me
everyone's ears are different they
create a good seal and they block out a
lot of noise they have a very low
profile so they don't stick out a lot
like the Bose and they don't wiggle out
of place when you're moving around they
come with an extra pair of small
silicone ear tips but I feel so should
have included a medium set as well the
earbuds themselves are IPX v rated so
they're sweat resistant but you
shouldn't get the carrying case with and
you should dry off the earbuds before
dropping them into their case as well
regarding connectivity by default the
left ear but as the master and the right
earbud is a slave when you take the
earbuds out they'll automatically pair
to your phone and don't verbally let you
know when they're good to go they
typically take about four seconds if you
just want to use one earbud then you
have to use the left channel but if you
really just want to use the right you're
but then you can connect that to your
phone separately so you're going to have
two extra devices listed on your
Bluetooth list now I'm not entirely sure
which Bluetooth version these earbuds
are using their manual says for that too
and sole site says 5.0 but regardless
its solid this your but sync up very
well sure you don't get an echoing
effect between the left and right
channel and they have a decent range of
about thirty feet when it comes to sound
quality they're not that bad these are
very base heavy headphones which
personally I don't mind while I'm
working out their cell profile is pretty
similar to the powerbase three lots of
bass sharp highs and vocalist or front
and center but the extra do gets
slightly louder and do create a slightly
better seal than the power of these
three but these earbuds are not my top
choice for watching videos because they
do have a bit of latency both of the
ssome the earbuds are multi-purpose
buttons if you press either one ones no
player positive music and if you double
press either one the Skip attract but
unfortunately triple pressing doesn't go
back a track instead if you trouble
press on the Left earbud they'll read
all your last phone call and this is odd
to me because when I'm using my sports
wireless earbuds I'm not interested in
talking on the phone I just want to
quickly control my
music so I can get on with my work out
but since pressing either of the buttons
on these earbuds means jamming them into
your ear canal I just naturally default
to using my phone to control my music
playback but now let's talk about what I
don't like about the ex shock I
absolutely hate that these earbuds have
those blinking LEDs when you put them in
your ear
these earbuds are very low-profile which
I like but the effect completely goes
away due to the constant blinking I
guess the blinking is there for
visibility if you're running at night or
if you lose them but if you're running
at night then you should be wearing
something way more visible than just
easier buts I just wish there was a way
to turn this cos in blinking off and
here's the microphone test for the SOL
ex-jock wireless earbuds and plainly
said you don't wanna take phone calls
with these but this audio clip is been
recorded by the microphones on these
earbuds shaking each other so if you're
someone like me that has dedicated
workout earbuds that just stashes them
in your bag then I think you'll really
like these earbuds the battery life the
X lock offers is amazing my biggest pet
peeve with wireless earbuds like my
powerbeats 3 is realizing they don't
have any battery in them just as you're
about to start working out so you have
to go and stand by a charger for 10
minutes or so the case is huge but given
that it's also a portable charger for
your phone it's a pretty fair trade-off
in my opinion the extracts sound just
fine for working out but I wouldn't use
them for phone calls if you can get them
on sale for 150 or below a field or a
decent deal
