new for Summer 2019… but this isn’t just
a slight hardware refresh from the original
Stockwell.
The Stockwell 2 is now a multi directional
speaker that shoots out your music out the
front and out the back of the speaker.
Making this speaker a great option if you’re
someone who likes to entertain a lot of guests
on a regular.
And since the $250 Marshall Stockwell 2 shoots
music out the front and back, this 360 degree
sound is the major differentiating factor
from the larger Marshall Kilburn 2 which retails
for $300.
And also, the Stockwell 2 is considerably
smaller than the Kilburn 2.
But if you want to pick any of the speakers
up mentioned in this video, those will be
linked down below.
Now design and build quality wise, even though
this speaker has that classic Marshall design
which I personally really like, this speaker
is also built like a tank.
The entire body is covered in a tough rubber
and both the grills on the front and back
are metal.
But still you have your classic Marshall leather
carrying strap with red velvet underneath.
The Stockwell 2 is also rocking an IPX4 rating
which means if it gets wet from a splash of
water or if it starts raining its not going
to have any problems, but I definitely wouldn’t
get carried away and let it get super wet.
But I will say the Stockwell 2 is a great
speaker if you’re looking for something
to take on the go with you cause it fairly
small, its light weight, and there’s that
built in carrying strap.
The Stockwell 2 also has an advertised battery
life of 20 hours… but in my testing with
the volume set at 80% and with the bass knob
set at 8 I got a real world battery life of
8 hours.
But keep in mind, if you were to use this
speaker with the bass knob set at a lower
number you’ll probably get a slightly longer
battery life.
What I’m trying to say is that the battery
life on this speaker is super dependent on
how you use it.
But one of the things that I really like about
the Stockewell 2 is that it charges via a
USB C port which I think it great especially
if you’re an android user.
But the USB C port on the Stockwell 2 isn’t
just used for charging the speaker, you can
also use it as a USB Out port and charge your
own devices.
So here I’m actually charging my Pixel 3a
through the speaker.
But I do want to point out that this USB C
port can only be used for power, you can’t
use it as a wired connection, for that there’s
a still a 3.5 millimeter audio jack.
But when it comes to bluetooth connectivity,
the Stockwell 2 is rocking bluetooth 5.0,
it can be connected to 2 devices at the same
and its great for watching videos on your
phone cause there’s zero latency across
the board on both android and apple devices.
And even though Marshall advertises a 30 foot
wireless range on their Stockwell 2 I was
actually able to go as far as 90 feet before
the connection dropped.
But that’s with direct line of sight, if
there’s any stuff in between then you’re
going to get some stuttering.
But over all, the wireless connectivity on
the Stockwell 2 is great on both android and
apple devices.
Now when it comes to speaker set ups the Stockwell
2 has a woofer and dual tweeter set up that
again shoots music out the front and out the
back of the speaker.
And I do want to stress that the Stockwell
2 is a multi directional speaker, which means
these are more geared towards evenly blanketing
a larger area with music.
Cause pound per pound if we were to compare
the Stockwell 2 to a more traditional speaker
like the Charge 4 or Sony XB32 some people
might be better off with these other 2 speakers,
but still the Stockwell 2 does manage to hold
its own against these other 2 more popular
speakers when it comes to sound quality.
Personally, I think what stands out most on
the Stockwell 2 compared to these other 2
speakers is that the highs on the Stockwell
2 are much more pronounced, much crisper.
And that’s probably cause the Stockwell
2 is the only speaker here that has dedicated
tweeters.
But even though the Stockwell 2 does have
an impressive amount of bass, its still relatively
the same amount of bass that you would find
on the smaller JBL Charge 4 and Sony XB32.
But definitely, if you’re looking for a
speaker that gets super loud then the Stockwell
2 isn’t for you.
Even though the Stockwell 2 gets decently
loud and has no problem filling a room, at
max volume is does pale in comparison when
put up against the other 2 speakers.
But like I mentioned earlier, since the Stockwell
2 is a multidirectional speaker… its main
focus is to evenly blanket a larger area with
music without having to crank the volume up
super high.
Thats why I would recommend this type of speaker
to someone who like to entertain guests on
a regular basis.
You’ll be able to play some music, but your
guests won’t have to talk over the music.
But now lets talk about the control knobs
found on the Stockwell 2.
Now I think it great that you’re able to
adjust the sound of your music directly from
the speaker it self.
But I do think its important to point out
that the volume knob only adjusts the volume
locally on the speaker… you still gotta
go into your phone and raise the volume there.
I also really hate that there’s no play
pause button on the speaker it self, just
a bluetooth button.
So this means that if you want to play, pause,
or skip through your music you’re going
to have to do so directly from your phone.
Ultimately this isn’t a huge deal, but I
just don’t understand why Marshall didn’t
include something as simple as a multipurpose
button.
And unlike a lot of other speaker brands out
there, you can’t chain the Marshall Stockwell
2 to any other Marshall speakers so that you
can get multiple speakers to play in sync.
And personally I really do think not being
able to pair multiple speakers together is
holding Marshall back…
So for that reason, I would only recommend
getting the Marshall Stockwell 2 if you only
want one speaker.
Now don’t get me wrong, I like the Stockwell
2 cause its a very well built, good looking
and good sounding speaker with great bluetooth
performance and a very competitive battery
life.
And I really like being able to adjust the
sound of my music directly from the speaker
and it being essentially a 360 degree speaker
makes it great for entertaining.
But if you do decide to go with this speaker
just know that I do think not having a multipurpose
button to control your music playback and
not being able to chain other Marshall speakers
together is a huge over sight.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
