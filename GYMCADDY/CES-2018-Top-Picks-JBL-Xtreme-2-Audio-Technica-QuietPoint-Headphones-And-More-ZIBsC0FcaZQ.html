of new things got announced almost
everything has RGB lighting now and
there was a huge push for voice
assistance from almost everyone and
keeping up with everything that got
announced at CES this year can get a
little overwhelming so here are my top
picks for CES 2018 first up I've been
calling it now for a few months but JBL
finally announced a JBL extreme - and
personally I'm very excited for the JBL
extreme - because the original JBL
extreme is just a great workhorse of a
portable speaker design wise there's
really no change the rubber end caps a
little more stylized looks like the legs
are a little beef tough and apparently
the carrying strap now has a built in
bottle opener which is just icing on the
cake concerning tech specs - JBL extreme
- now has JBL connect plus so we can
connect to newer speakers like the JBL
pulse 3 charge 3 flip 4 and the JBL
boombox battery life is still at 15
hours but the JBL extreme 2 is now ipx7
rated which is an improvement over the
original extreme could it's only water
resistant but we'll have to see if the
JBL extreme 2 floats and obviously the
JBL extreme 2 is supposed to sound
better things to upgraded drivers and
brand new 3d based radiators honestly
we'll have to see how the JBL extreme 2
compares to the extreme once I get it
in-house and it should be going on sale
to spring for 299 95 JBL also announced
urge a bill clip 3 with improved battery
life ipx7 certification and a slightly
reworked design the clip 3 will also go
on sale in spring for 59.99 staying on
the topic of speakers sony also
announced their sony XP 21 XB 31 and XP
41 and it's obvious Sony is coming after
JBL with these new speakers they all
feature a brand new design which I'm a
really big fan of and they all have LED
light strips built in there hasn't been
a major battery life improvement over
the current XP 20 XP 30 and XP 40 but
these new speakers are more durable they
all feature in IP 67 ratings so aside of
just being waterproof like most of JBL's
current speakers Sony speakers are both
water and
proof to some extent so on paper Stoney
speakers are supposed to be more durable
than JP Ellis and you can now connect up
to 100 Sony XP 21s XP 31 and XP 41
speakers together but there was no
mention if this feature will be coming
to older XP speakers as well the sony
xba-1 will be selling for $9.99 the XP
31 will be selling for 1 $49.99 and the
XP 41 will be selling for to $49.99 this
spring sony also announced their
wireless earbuds made specifically for
working out there called the wif SP 700
n and there in your earbuds that feature
and ipx4 rating active noise
cancellation a total of 9 hours of
battery life withheld from the charging
case and google assistant integration
they'll be selling for 170 $9.99 and
they should be available in the spring
as well and speaking of voice assistance
Sony will also be releasing a firmware
update for Korean headphones which will
add Google assistant integration just
like the boss QC 35 series 2 this just
means to Sony 1000 X and 2 and the Sony
here on 2 will be that much better now
it's no secret I really like the Sony
1000x m2 and the Sony here on - but
Audio Technica also announced their a th
a and C 700 BT quiet point headphones
and for the record I'm going to be
referring to them as the Audio Technica
quite points because there's no way I'm
gonna remember that name if you're
somebody that's on a tighter budget then
you might be interested in the quiet
points cuz you'll be selling for $1.99
they're supposed to have a 25 hour
battery life come in black or gray and
I'm interested to see how their ANC
technology compares to the a and C on
the 1000x time to come this March next
up or DJ eyes new gimbal systems and I'm
personally very impressed by the DJI
Osmo 2 because it clearly shows DJI is
listening to their customers first up
they slashed the price down from $200 to
$130
which puts them into our competition
with the GU smooth cue they made it
lighter it's not supposed to overheat
anymore and they improve the battery
life from four and a half hours to a
whopping 15 hours and you can charge
your phone as well I'm really interested
to see how the DJI Osmo 2 compares to
the Zune now I'm personally really
looking forward to to the Ronin as
because it's the largest
Eliezer that will hold my mirrorless
camera the Ronin s is supposed to go on
sale in the spring but pricing hasn't
been announced but they have stated it
should be below $1,000 whereas the DJI
Osmo too should be going on sale on
Apple site on January 23rd and
everywhere else in February and finally
there's the Razer Nomo speaker lineup
now admittedly I currently don't have
time to play computer games right now
but I can appreciate their design and/or
color changing base there are three
models to choose from the base razor on
most speakers which are just stereo
speakers for $100 then there's no razor
no more chroma which have the RGB base
for one $49.99 and then there's a
top-of-the-line Razer Nomo pro 4 for
$49.99 although the first two are
currently available for sale the Razer
normal Pro still is enough for sale and
what makes an impression is improved
drivers the addition of tweeters and a
downward firing subwoofer so yeah these
are just some of the things that I'm
currently really excited for from CES
2018 and I'm also going to try to do my
best and get a hold of all of these
products so I can review and compare
them but comment down below what are you
most excited for from CES 2018 razor
