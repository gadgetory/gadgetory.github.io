eventually become the only place where
you can buy most of your day-to-day good
and they're doing so by streamlining the
buying process with the amazon echo you
can yell an Alexa to order you almost
anything and now Amazon heavily the echo
show a walkie looking smart speaker with
the touchscreen on the front so is it
worth the money let's find out don't
forget to Like comment and subscribe
when it comes to smart speakers and
smart home control solutions Amazon is
going all-in the echo show joins a
diverse family of smart speakers made by
Amazon to keep their users using Amazon
it comes in two colorways white or black
and retails for 229 ninety-nine having
an Amazon echo with the touch screen on
the front carries a $50 premium the
normal Amazon echo can be had for 170
9.99 there's also the smaller and
portable Amazon echo tap for one $29.99
and there's the Amazon echo dot for
$49.99 if you want to pick either one of
these sports because up I'll have links
in the description below and I'll have a
separate link so you can try Amazon
Prime for free for 30 days unlimited
free 2-day shipping for everyone
concerning what comes inside the box you
really only get the Amazon echo show and
a power quarter that's it first
impressions is it's heavy and it's very
well put together there's a huge over
pound bottom so it's not going to be
moving around if you're playing music
with a lot of bass design-wise I would
have preferred if they just made it a
rectangle but I'll give them the benefit
of doubt because it looks like they use
all that extra space on the bottom to
cram in some good static speakers one
those in a minute
apparently Amazon didn't get the memo
that this was the year of no bezels
because this thing has some huge vessels
especially the top one it gives it a big
forehead but it does house a five
megapixel camera the three blinds on the
top of a Lima buying a volume down by an
and and on osborne that also serves as a
Do Not Disturb button it's just off the
mic in the camera the touchscreen on the
front is 7 inches and it's very
responsive and it does a great job of
repelling fingerprints there's an a
microphone or a built-in which honestly
blew me away there are dual to install B
speakers behind the grill and on the
back there are no ports besides the AC
in and running everything on the hood is
an Intel Atom x5z 835 o processor ok
Amazon ago show it
smart speaker with a touchscreen on the
front that looks like a TV from the
early 2000s what can it do we're going
to get all the basic stuff that all the
other reviews have covered yes you can
ask a goofy questions you can ask for
the weather as for your commute time and
set timers and does that new drop in
feature that everyone is worried about
but what to like actually living with
this thing in order to get the most out
of your Amazon echo show I think it
should live in your kitchen
I think the Amazon echo show will put an
end to the atrocity that our smart
refrigerators that just have touch
screens on the front you can ask that
those shows to give you flash precincts
from sources and on certain topics you
you're so thick so you can walk into the
kitchen in the morning for breakfast and
your echo show can get your must be in a
few minutes you can also tell it to show
you rest month essence there's a screen
on the front following the instructions
it's just that much easier you can even
tell Alexa to scan a barcode for you and
you can do your grocery shopping write
them in they're running low on ketchup
syrup and creatine just hold it up to
the Aqua shell and it will order for you
sure you can tell the normal echo
verbally what you want to order but
being able to see what you're buying
beforehand just gives you peace of mind
knowing you ordered the right thing you
can even scroll through different
options but smart speakers are only
worth using if they can hear you and
understand your accurately thanks to the
a microphone array built into the echo
show Alexa had no issue hearing and
understanding me even when I was 50 feet
away talking in the voice very rarely
that I have to speak up for it I see it
Alexa could also hear is just fine even
when I had the echo show playing music a
small volume a feature that Apple spoke
very highly of when they announced their
home pod I also found the echo show is
good for listening to music you compare
to your phone using bluetooth
the bass is deep the highs are clear and
there's a good amount of depth to the
music as well and sitting on that thick
of a pet it doesn't move around when the
bass really gets going like some of my
other wireless speakers and you can
watch youtube videos on this as well but
the echos show isn't just for shopping
and for listening to music thanks to all
the skills the echo show has it's also a
great solution for controlling your
smartphone the echo show can show you
what your nice camera or ring doorbell
sees and you can set the lighting if you
have smart light bulbs as the echo
ecosystem ages developers will be able
to improve the echo show
actually with that touchscreen but there
are some gripes I do want to point out
about the echo shown for starters it's
the OS there are so little instances
where you can actually use the
touchscreen it baffles my mind there's
no App Store so you can't choose add
more skills by using the echo show you
have to do that on your phone there's
also the sense that the echo shell is
always trying to upsell you to use more
and more Amazon products and download
more Amazon apps on your phone I also
don't like how you can actually log into
your YouTube account and play videos
from your subscription for you I would
really like to be able to place her in
videos on the echo show while I do the
dishes or cook so where does this leave
the echo shell I would put the echo
shell in the same category as the Apple
watch it's not a must-have product but
it is nice to have and wants to get used
to it it's hard to go without it it
settles good for $230 wireless speaker
and there's a touch screen on the front
it's great for consuming news and
keeping you up to date on everything
that matters to you you can also do most
of your grocery shopping which honestly
is my favorite feature if you're
building out a smart home the echo show
can really come in handy especially with
that touch screen although I feel the OS
is a little premature I know that once
developers start releasing new skills
specifically made for the echo shell
it's going to transform it into a whole
other beast just give it some time
