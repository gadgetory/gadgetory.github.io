xba-1 XB 41 and xv-21 review but i
actually want to make a separate video
on how to get these newer Sony speakers
to play in sync with the older Sony
xb-70 xB 20 and the sony xba-40 because
even though it is possible to get these
speakers to play in sync it's a lot
harder than I would actually like and
unfortunately Sony's customer support
and documentation were no help so I've
actually just been mashing buttons on
these speakers for the last hour or so
but I actually got to figure it out so
hopefully here's a quick little tutorial
on how you can do it and hopefully I can
prevent any frustration on your end
because I know I was this close to
punching a hole in the wall now if you
want to pick up either of these
Bluetooth speakers I'll have a look at
description below if you use the link it
really helps out the channel obviously
when you first get your Bluetooth
speaker you're going to pair it up to
your phone over bluetooth after you've
done that you're going to go into your
phone's app store and you're going to
download Sony's Music Center app now in
this first demonstration you're going to
pair up the sony xba-40 one to the sony
xba-1 which is much easier this time
around the first thing you're going to
do is you're going to open up the
compartment on the back and you're going
to see three buttons there's a battery
button a WPC button and an ADD button WP
c stands for wireless party chain and
basically that means you'll be able to
pair up to 100 Sony speakers together it
doesn't matter what size they are or if
they're older or newer if they pair up
they pair up the add button is to pair
up two of the same speakers together so
if I have to so many XP 30 ones I would
be able to pair them up in stereo mode
to get left and right stereo and if I
had to Sony XP 40s I can get them to
play in stereo mode as well but
unfortunately I haven't been able to get
the sony xba-40 one to play in stereo
mode with the sony xba-40 and personally
I think that's pretty ridiculous because
they both sound pretty identical so for
a first demonstration we're going to
pair up the sony xba-40 one to the sony
xba-1 first things first we're going to
click on WPC wherever we click WPC first
that speaker automatically becomes the
master so in this demonstration the HP
31 is the master and
sony XB 21 is the slave now that their
WPC lights are on we're going to go over
to our phone and we're going to open up
Music Center and we're going to give a
minute and we're going to click on SRS
xB 31 party chain until we hear that
tone that means these two speakers are
now playing together and here's a quick
little demo on music now I can lower the
volume from my phone on both speakers
and if I click on the volume controls on
the master I can control the volume on
both the speakers as well but
unfortunately clicking the volume
controls on another speaker that isn't
the master in this case 21 it's not
going to adjust the volume on all of the
speakers
the XP 31 stays just as loud
okay now here's the fun part we're going
to get the sony xba-40 one to play in
sync with the older sony xba-40 the
first thing you're going to do is you're
going to click on WPC on the XB 31
because I found this much easier having
this speaker as the master after you've
collectable you PC here you're going to
over to the sony xba-40 and you're going
to press and hold the add and plus
button at the same time now that these
two are looking for speakers to pair
with you're going to go over to your
phone and open up music Center and we're
going to click on SRS XP 31 party chain
and once you hear the tone and you see
the Bluetooth light on the sony xba-40
one is solid these two guys are paired
up so let's get a little Santa's going
okay again this guy is the master so I
can control the volumes from both
speakers here
but unfortunately these buttons don't
control all the speakers just this okay
and now here is going to be the really
cool part we're going to get all these
speakers to play in sync again we're
gonna start off with the sony xba-1 and
make this guy the master we're going to
collect on the WPC here and now we're
just gonna click on WPC on the 21 and
just like we did on the x speed for
anyone before we're going to click and
hold the add and plus button and we're
going to do that on these two guys as
well so and now we're going to jump into
the Music Center app and we're gonna
open that guy up and we're going to
click on SRS xB 31 party chain and there
we go now we got the tone and the
lightness I lay on the sony xba-1 and
here's the sound test all of these guys
are playing again I can control all of
the voltage from this guy here cuz this
is our master
but unfortunately the volume controls on
these slaves isn't really going to do
much alright guys and that's how you get
these newer sony xba-1 xv-21
to play in sync with the older sony XB
20x b 30 and XB for you obviously if you
only have the smaller xv-21 or the
larger sony xba-40 one this method will
work as well hopefully this quick little
tutorial helped you guys out and keep in
mind the full review on the sony xba-1
XB 31 and XB 41 will be out in the next
few days so click or tap up here it's
probably out by now hey if you enjoyed
