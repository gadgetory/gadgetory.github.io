Fitbit hope it would be well personally
I think Fitbit is onto something with
their new pebble like Fitbit Versa it
has a new minimalist design that's very
reminiscent to the Apple watch but at a
much more reasonable price it's still a
fitness tracker first and a small one
seconds but here's what I like what I
don't like and what I would change a new
Fitbit versa depending on which Fitbit
versed you get they'll either cost to
you 199 95 or 2 29.95 the 200 all the
models come with either black rose gold
or silver aluminum casings and they all
come with their classic silicone
wristbands the $230 models like the one
I have here comes with either graphite
or rose gold aluminum casings and in
addition to your classic silicone
wristbands they also bring a fabric
wristband if you want to pick the Fitbit
Versa up I'll have a link of description
below and if you use the link it really
helps out the channel I suggest you
check them out coz Fitbit trackers
routinely go on sale so you might get
lucky aside from the extra fabric
wristband the special edition Fitbit
Versa comes bundled with the special of
this inversor also has an NFC chip for
contactless payments personally I don't
really care for the NFC chip in the
Versa because I just prefer to use my
phone for tap to pay so I suggest you
just pick up the special edition versa
because you want more than one wristband
to choose from and personally I think
fibbies sort of just included and if see
on both versa models now actually
removing the wrist bands from the Versa
isn't as easy as the Apple watch but
after you get the hang of it it should
be painless and Fitbit also gives you
the option to choose from leather or
stainless steel bands as well which are
sold separately of course aside from the
extra fabric wristband and the built-in
NFC chip on the special edition Fitbit
Versa
both Versa models are identical the
verse or itself is surprisingly thin and
light weight is to watch you actually
forget you're wearing after a while
especially with that fabric wrist band
there are three lines on the sides of
the watch which are all very easy to
find and they all have great tactile
feedback the Versa also comes equipped
with a touchscreen LCD display protected
by quarter and Gorilla Glass 3 and even
in direct sunlight in the clear sunny
day I have no issues actually seeing the
display the touch screen controls and
responsiveness of the verse
when navigating through the menus and
opening apps is good but there might be
some hiccups here and there either the
watch might need a second to catch up or
your swipe might not just register the
versa is also water-resistant down to 50
meters so this means you can wear it in
the pool in the rain and you don't have
to worry about it if you sweat on it
while you're working out if you're
someone who regularly works out and you
want to maximize your results then a
fitness tracker like the Versa can help
you quantify your daily activities so
you can better program your training
and/or your diet with the Versa you can
monitor your heart rate 24/7 track your
steps track your distance walked flights
of stairs climb track how many calories
you've burned track your sleep and you
can even get a better breakdown of your
performance during your workouts the
heart rate monitor on the fitbit Versa
is fairly accurate but don't expect this
to be as precise as a dedicated test
strap heart rate monitor the Versa is
using Bluetooth 4.0 and you can pair
your wireless headphones to it so you
can play your store the music off of it
but you can't connect a chest strap
heart rate monitor for the runners who
might be interested in the Versa just
know it comes equipped with a 3-axis
accelerometer and gyroscope and an
altimeter unfortunately there is no
built-in GPS instead the Versa uses
connected GPS which means the Versa
relies on the GPS from your phone
this means the fitbit Versa will only be
able to map out your runs if you bring
your phone along if you decide to leave
your phone behind the Versa will still
be able to track your performance during
your run but your speed and distance ran
won't be as accurate if you brought your
phone along not having GPS in the Versa
is one of those sacrifices you make for
is very low profile design as a
SmartWatch the Fitbit Versa plays nice
with both Apple and Android devices you
can see your notifications like text
messages emails and incoming calls but
you can only do quick replies with
Android devices you can also control
your music playback but I find myself
either using the control buttons on the
headphones themselves or just using the
actual phone is much easier than trying
to meddle around with the tiny touch
screen as a SmartWatch the Versa does
enough to show you quick notifications
at a glance so you can decide to whip
out your phone or not if something
important comes through but you can't
take phone calls like you can on the
Apple watch and you can't talk to your
voice assistant through the virus
like you can on either the Apple watch
or Android smart watches but if you're
looking into Fitbit you're probably more
interested in the fitness tracking
aspect anyways and Fitbit still has the
best fitness tracking mobile app out
there and what I like most about the
Fitbit app is that at a glance it is
very simple and easy to read
the home page does a very good job of
giving you a quick rundown of your
baseline stats for the day but as you
dig deeper into each category you can
get a more detailed breakdown of your
day or of your workout and having a
record of your daily activity and
workouts lets you see just how much
you've managed to progress if you
actually stick to working out and for
the ladies out there the Versa can also
help you track your cycle and give you
an idea of what to expect the Fitbit
mobile app also lets you track your
sleep cycles so you can see when you're
in light deep or REM sleep but
unfortunately this is one of those
features that I don't really care for
but now we need to talk about badly from
the Fitbit Versa fitbit advertises about
a life of four plus days but
unfortunately in our testing we haven't
been able to hit that when at a full
charge and with a Monday through
Saturday workout routine of one hour of
interval training and 30 minutes of
cycling and all day and night wear the
Versa only managed to average two days
and 16 hours of on time without ever
being placed back on the charger and
keep in mind this is without streaming
music off of the Versa and without using
connected GPS so you're badly fooled
definitely vary depending on your
workout frequency and what features you
actually use but we found that a futures
drop the Versa in turns charging cradle
every time you shower for 15 or 20
minutes then the Versa will have no
problem keeping up with you unlike some
other smartwatches that you have to drop
in the charger every night and you still
risk dying on you mid-afternoon but
overall I really do like the Fitbit
Versa and I do think the Versa is going
to sell better than the pharaonic but I
would have liked to see a bigger battery
in the Versa since the verse is so thin
I think Fitbit could get away with
adding a millimeter or so without many
people carrying as long as it means a
longer real-world battery life I also
think Fitbit so double down on the Versa
and have 2k sizes for it I'm a guy with
not so big risk but the vs. still looks
a little small on me I think a larger
Versa would be great
for guys who aren't really interested in
the ionics design or built-in GPS I do
think there is a lot of potential for
the fit versa and I feel the Versa is a
solid fitness tracker for your casual
gym goer it's going to help you track
your progress help you understand your
daily activity and hopefully help you
stay consistent the new design doesn't
scream fitness tracker and you also get
some of the benefits of having a
SmartWatch on your wrist
but the Versa isn't the fitness tracker
for your serious athlete trying to shave
a few seconds off of their mile and it's
not the SmartWatch for a hardcore power
user if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
