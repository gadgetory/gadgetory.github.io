a small 500 all the drunk but they did
take the Apple approach and release
perhaps the best compact drone of market
right now the DJI spark is basically the
size of my iPhone 6s plus and within
minutes of taking out of the box
I was already flying so whether you're
looking for your first drone or join you
can take almost anywhere the DDI spark
might be what you're looking for so
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe
and let's get into the review the DJI
spark currently comes in five color ways
white red green blue and yellow
the base model retails for $499 over at
Amazon and includes the drone one
battery pack a carrying case and AC
adapter and USB cable for charging and
some replacement rotors the fly more
combo retails for $699.95 a bag and a
separate controller if you're planning
on flying a lot the fly more combo is a
good idea if you want to pick up the DJI
spark I'll have links in the description
below and I'll keep them updated so you
can get the best deals possible and if
you're looking for deals on other drones
you can check out my friends over at red
nose calm for deal alerts on almost
anything so we're going to do a quick
walk round of the job for starters the
DDI spark is heavier than I expected 99%
of the body is made up of hard plastic
there are some rubber footers on the
belly of the spark which absorb the
shock when you land it and it gives it a
good amount of grip there's a power
button on the back and four LEDs that
act as a fuel gauge under the spark tab
you'll find a micro USB charging port
and a micro SD card slot which goes up
to 64 gigs on the front of the devices
our 3d imaging sensor which help it
avoid obstacles and it's already saved
in my but multiple times
there's also a second sensor on the
belly of the spark that help it know
what's underneath it there are four
rotors on this drone and no they don't
hold up the processor is do four of them
the cannon the spark is a 12 megapixel
sensor and you can take pictures and
record video at 1080p 30 frames per
second it's housed in a two axis gimbal
and it can compensate for pitch and roll
but it can't turn like an O Matic pro
instead you have to turn the whole
device if you want to get a pan going
it's kind of like Christian Bale and
Batman Begins I like tourneys whole body
with low end conditions the camera
quality is very smooth but when the
spark is hit by a gust of wind you'll
notice them jerkiness in the video
but the spark there's a very valiant
effort of trying to keep the camera
steady concerning battery life remember
when I said to fly more package was a
good idea on a single charge the DJI
spark is good for 16 minutes of flight
time in order to charge the battery from
zero using the micro USB cable it's
going to take around an hour to an hour
and a half so just keep that in mind at
this point you might be wondering how do
you fly this thing well you have three
options first is with gesture control
you basically turn it on hold it and in
all these legs away from you with the
camera pointing at your pretty little
face and press the power button twice
and it'll start hovering in front of you
you can tell it to take a picture of you
by making a rectangle with your fingers
if you hold your hands out you can move
the spark left to right or up and down
little to adjust a shot this is usually
when I start pretending I'm a Jedi and I
do my best Ben Kenobi impression use the
Force Luke for our thousand generations
Jedi Knights with the guardians of peace
and justice in the Old Republic before
the dark times before the Empire
everything up to here works flawlessly
if you wave your hand from side to side
the spark will fly back and up so I can
get a bird's-eye view of you this is
where stuff gets a little finicky I've
noticed that when the spark is farther
away from me it has issues tracking me
or understanding my desk just to take a
picture or not reading micro factors
you can also control the DDI spark from
your flow you'll get a live feed of what
the spark sees with very little lag the
spark connects to your phone via Wi-Fi
and it has a range of around 300 feet
put it to check out your drones SSID and
password take out the battery pack and
check the underside and finally you can
use the separate controller that gives
you physical buttons since there's so
much going on the touchscreen I really
wish I had that controller but if your
drone were to lose connection with your
phone it'll either hub in place until
it's established as a connection or
it'll fly back to where it really took
off the video quality on the DJI spark
is good enough for any enthusiast that
wants to get aerial shots epic selfies
or just want to jump in the drone game
but obviously the video quality on the
DDI spark is not great for professional
use I've never had this much fun or
anxiety renewable product the DJI spark
is so easy to fly and the obstacle
avoidance is much more accurate than I
expected it was even able to detect
individual branches but keep in mind
there are no lateral or rear sensors and
my drone has experienced some severe
crashes but it really only suffered
minor scrapes and it was immediately
ready for takeoff again the spark is
tougher than it looks but just keep in
mind it's not waterproof so don't fly it
in the rain or crash it on water
due to its small size the DDI spark is a
little harder to control when it's windy
outside but it does try very hard to
spreading it shot the DJI go for app is
really well made and intuitive I haven't
had any issues using it whatsoever
obviously you can control the DJI spark
with it we can also view and edit your
captured videos I'm going to be honest
manually editing your videos in the DJI
app is a little annoying so I prefer
using the auto edit feature instead
there's even a simulator so you can
practice flying your drone when flying
your drone with your phone you have a
few options you can manually control it
you can use tap to fly you can use
active track which will automatically
follow any objects you highlight or you
can even just use the spark as a tripod
overall I love the DJI spark it's so fun
to use and it's so easy to fly but if
you are going to be flying lot it's a
good idea to invest in at least a second
battery
you can't go wrong with the DJI spark
but keep in mind for the same money you
can also get the phantom 3 which has a 3
axis gimbal and you'll fly some of 25
minutes but it's much bigger so you got
to ask yourself how important is size to
you well for $500 the DDI spark is well
worth the money
whatever you decide to record with you
sports just know that you can share or
post your videos anywhere just seconds
