live unboxing today we're gonna be
unboxing the new Jabra elite 85 h's now
the reason why I think these new Jabra
elite 85 H's is a big deal is because
they were announced at CES 2019 back in
January
now if I remember correctly these are
jabbers first ANC headphones or they're
at least or most premium ones that were
going to be competing up against the
likes of the Sony 1000x and threes and
the surface headphones and also the most
QC 35 but instead of retailing for $350
if they're gonna be retailing for $300
which isn't a huge difference between
these are the two headphones but 50
bucks is 50 bucks so with all of that
being said we're gonna jump in to
actually unboxing this thing how do we
do it okay here it is alright so hold on
go ahead and unbox these here we go now
just remember as always with these live
unboxing videos this is just something
as if this is just a first impressions
video so you know don't take it as a
full review because you know in boxing a
product and talking about what you see
in the first 10 15 minutes isn't a
review it's not fair to the product it's
not and it's not fair to you when I
first saw these headphones on the
computer I thought they looked a little
ugly but we're gonna find out right now
so actually gonna go ahead and take this
thing out of the box let's see what we
got here dr. Mattei oh that was not
smooth alright so let's see we got um
get started we got a download the Jabra
sound app and okay oh you know what this
carrying case isn't that bad this
carrying case is actually better than
the carrying case on the well okay is it
better it's definitely up there is
definitely giving the m3s a run for
their money these these are you know
fabric type of
and this one it has a really nice
feeling synthetic leather to it one of
the things that I mentioned in my last
video would be m3s
is that I don't like the listen thetic
leather on these headphones this it
feels very plastic you right now right
off the bat this synthetic leather feels
better than the letter than the leather
on these headphones so let's see what
the headphones themselves are actually
all about there's goes the headphones
themselves and an airplane adapter just
fell out but there they are it hold on
let's let's get these things out huh
these feels these feel nice oh and she's
already talking but these actually feel
pretty nice this okay so yeah there's a
whole bunch of fabric going on so
there's there's fabric on the earcup
here
there's fabric here on the headband it
doesn't it doesn't feel bad at all I
know looks are subjective and for me not
the biggest fan of actually having this
fabric here but it feels nice it feels
good and the leather the synthetic
leather on these headphones these feel
these people these feel better now the
ones on the m3s and let's see yeah
surface headphones I think I think the
synthetic leather on these headphones
feels just as nice as a synthetic
leather on the surface headphones build
quality wise first impressions not bad
okay hold on wait so okay so they they
fold up can DB lay down flat yes okay
great great because that's something the
surface headphones can't do surface
headphones can't fold up like this and
this to me I prefer when headphones can
do both ways instead of just one like
the surface headphones um let's see so
now this hinge feels a little loose
the biggest fan that I like when my you
know the headphone that mmm the earcup
should definitely just lock into place
and instead yeah that's a little that's
a little flimsy but let's actually go
ahead and expand it extend his headband
come on oh it doesn't click it just
slides oh okay cool
buttons are there and they click do
these have a touchpad oh no it's not a
touchpad it's not a touchpad but it has
buttons here on the ear cups similar to
the buttons on the Beats Studio threes
but these are actually a lot easier to
find and they're a lot easier to tell
apart now I'm actually pretty glad that
Jabra didn't go ahead and just smack on
the touchpad on these headphones if they
knew they couldn't get them right on the
first try cuz I guess I'm the past
I love the audio technica SOR 50b T's
but the touchpad on these headphones no
good I mean you've gotta you got first
officer on the left side and as a righty
there's a learning curve but then also
the accuracy isn't all that great and
you know it kind of like ruins the
headphones for me I think these
headphones would be a lot better if they
had dedicated dedicated buttons on them
instead of a touchpad and I think that's
a smart move on Jabra and I think it's
smart that's some-some headphone
manufacturers like I'll say the bose
qc25 s stick with physical buttons
because some people just don't like
touch pads on their headphones and you
know having to choose a pair of
headphones it could all boil down to go
from a touchpad or physical button so
maybe some people might think oh I want
to get the Sony 1000 X and threes but I
don't know I think their touch pads is a
deal-breaker for me so I might want to
go with something like the Jabra lead 85
HS or the bose qc25 so I'm glad to see
Jabra stuck with physical buttons
instead of going with a touchpad if they
decided they couldn't get the touchpad
right or maybe they saved a little bit
of money so that they can put it in
the build quality cuz you know these
design wise I think they look a little
chunky but but they feel very well put
together aside for these very flimsy ear
cuffs maybe not it's the same thing here
maybe because mine is an earlier
production unit just so we're clear job
Levin sent these out I got these myself
today so maybe like I said maybe because
these are an early production version
this is happening I'm not the biggest
fan of
this but build quality wise feels good
alright enough talking let's see if
these are big head approved because I'm
actually a little FB on DS these feel
like they have huh okay we're disregard
that these are big unapproved these
these have they have a there there's
snug but they're not overly tight like
let's say the Bowers and Wilkins px
they're not as loose as let's say the
1000 x m3 these have a very loose fit as
and so do the bose qc25 but let's see
how the yeah yeah and these and these
are a little looser than the Jabra lead
85 h's yeah these have a snug fit but
it's not uncomfortable the ear cups are
spacious the ear cups are more spacious
if then the 1000 X and threes okay hold
on let's let's have a look here these
these ear cups are very reminiscent to
the ones on bose qc25 s but they're not
as deep but these are much more these
are slightly more spacious than the ones
on the 1000 Exim threes what else is
there let's check out what you get in
the case okay so we got this don't eat
that
we got a audio jack there's a micro oh
okay okay cool cool cool cool
so USBC cable so that means these
headphones have USB C charging that's
USBC is starting to make its way to
other headphones before it was only on
like super high on you know not super
high-end but like the more premium ones
1000x and three surface headphones but
now the new sony XP seven hundreds which
are back there have USB seen of the
Jabra elite 85 HSM USB see you know if
you have an Android device and it has an
you probably have a USB C port and means
are gonna be able to charge your phone
your headphones with the same cable
which is awesome and if you have an
iPhone then you know you're still going
to be having to have a USBC cable and a
lightning cable cuz you know Apple and
magic so now hold on I'm gonna go ahead
pair these headphones up to my phone and
then we're gonna check out the app see
what these headphones are all about and
we're back I just went ahead and a pair
of the headphones over to my phone and
open up the Jabra what does this sound
plus app yeah the Jabra sound plus app
so it looks like we have active noise
cancellation we're gonna go ahead turn
that on okay
there's there's no cabin pressure which
is good to see there's a here through
function so obviously we're gonna be
opening up and picking up all the
ambient sound around us so that it's
kind of like using open-back headphones
in the sense that you can hear your
music and still hear what's going on
around you that's cool that's cool to
see on these 300 all the headphones and
then you just go ahead turn that off
what we're gonna turn it back on just I
can hear myself we got a music EQ here
hold on let's see okay there we go I it
was a little easier to grab onto these
nodes so that we can adjust it all done
definitely not perfect I gotta go ahead
put that back to default you can edit
the widgets what else we got here we got
Oh sound scape what is this like below
where it's kind of like we're with Sony
where you can like adjust the
positioning of the music or make it
sound like you're in a concert hall
features that I never even bother to use
it's just a waste of space on the app
let's see what else we got we have what
is this a smart sound no we'll do that
later
let's see what we got here commute okay
so it looks like depending on what you
which ones that you have on it changes
the behavior of the headphones
themselves we got in public so what are
these going to be automatically
adjusting themselves depending on your
environment because the m3s do that but
that's one of the features that I also
never use I just rather you know toggle
AMC or Abbey mode on or off on my own
depending on what I need okay cool so
here through you can adjust the level of
here through on these that's good
because there are some headphones where
you just can't adjust a level of ambient
noise like the surface headphones I
don't think you can adjust the ambient
level on the surface headphones now one
of the things that I definitely need to
test on these headphones is is is there
ambient mode they're here through mode
smart enough to automatically pause
pause if the hear pause to hear through
if it detects like a random loud sound
because like let's say for example the
m3s if you're walking outside i'm gonna
check these off so let's say for example
with the m3s if you're walking outside
and you have their ambient mode turned
on if if like a random loud sound
happens so like let's say if siren rolls
by or a dog starts barking or a car
backfires and it happens a lot in the
city and you hear this loud bang if
these headphones pick that up these
headphones will pick that up and then it
will automatically pause ambient mode so
like you don't hear that loud bang in
your headphones which you know first of
all it's gonna scare the hell out of you
but then also you know it's it's bad for
your hearing but then there are other
headphones like let's say
the SR 50 BTS they do this they pick up
everything so if if a car rolls by and
backfires or if I'm siren rose by Oh for
dog barks these headphones are going to
still play that with their ambient mode
shoe you're gonna hear all of that and
it's gonna be amplified it's gonna be
even louder so that's definitely
something I want to see got a test with
the admin mode on these headphones and
also we got to see what does the ambient
mode on these headphones pick up because
again the m3s do a very good job of just
picking up people's voices and you can
also set them to only pick up people's
voices and noise pollution like let's
say the rumbling of an AC or I don't
know like let's say traffic rolling by
it does they do a good job of still not
letting that noise pollution in that's
why the ambient mode on these headphones
is so good all right so let's see what
else we got going on with this app here
so call experienced auto answer coal use
on your detection okay so do these
headphones have on your detection hold
on let's figure this out hold on let's
see if these headphones do you have on
your detection
oh okay okay so they have on your
detection okay and it's quick hold on
off and it just paused
okay so right now the music's paused and
we're gonna go ahead put them back on
and it's already playing music okay cool
I'm not really the biggest fan of on
your detection the surface headphones
have that feature and I haven't been
able to figure out how to turn it off
usually when headphones do have on your
detection I turn that off just because I
don't know I like having direct control
over over my music and you know it's
something that never really bothered me
that there's that the entries they don't
have on your detection but definitely we
gotta see the accuracy of the on-air
detection on these headphones because
there are some headphones out there
let's say for example the Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins px when you wear them with on
ear detection turned on sometimes when
you're walking around in your heads
moving around and they'll automatically
start playing and pausing your music and
even though if you go in and you adjust
the sensitivity of their own ear
detection sometimes it just still does
it so that's why I always just try to
keep that feature off but again that's
something we gotta have to check out
with the on error detection on these
headphones or are they going to start
randomly playing and pausing your music
if you're walking around because if they
are then that's a huge deal breaker in
the sense of I'm never gonna want to
have to use the on ear detection on
these headphones all right well now
we're gonna pause that okay that's
paused let's see what else these
headphones have these have audio
experience auto resume audio okay so
that's dent surrounding audio okay so
that's to hear through call experience
alright so I think that's it we got to
figure out what with these extra tabs on
the side what are they going to
automatically adjust themselves
depending on what I'm doing or do I have
to go in and set them up too if that
profile I got to figure out what this
smart sound is let's go to about that's
set up date we're gonna have to do
later voice assistant hmm do only have
Google assistant integration cuz if
that's true then that kind of sucks
personally I prefer to use Google
assistant over Alexa because I just find
Google assistant to be more useful event
alexis and it doesn't say if it even has
Google assistant integration but it does
have a Lexus so hopefully Google
assistant makes this way here cuz again
I'm not the biggest fan of Alexa even on
my 1000x and threes alright so I think
that does it for the first impressions
video build quality wise not bad
I like the synthetic leather on these
headphones I think it feels better than
the synthetic leather on the m3s design
wise I think they do look a little
chunky but definitely not not like super
bad they don't look as sleek they don't
look as sleek as these and they don't
look as sleek or as stylized as these
design wise again it's subjective but
not the biggest fan of this fabric here
but but it feels good build quality wise
at the fabric yo feels good listen
thetic feather leather feels good the
the headband isn't too isn't too tight v
headband it doesn't click it slides this
here is definitely supposed to look like
brushed aluminum but it's not it's all
plastic but these headphones look well
put together except for these ear cups I
am not liking how these ear cups lock
and dislike look at that I don't like
that
alright well anyway we're gonna go ahead
end it there
so this has been
a first look at the Jabra elite 85
meters these are Japanese for right now
top-of-the-line a and C headphones these
go for 300 bucks and these are going to
be competing against the likes of the
sony 1000 XM threes surface headphones
and even the bose QC three 5s even
though I know everybody including myself
is still waiting for some type of news
to come out about the Bose v bosse QC
45s but yeah other than that I'll catch
you guys later and lookout for a review
on these guys and about a week or so if
you made it this far
