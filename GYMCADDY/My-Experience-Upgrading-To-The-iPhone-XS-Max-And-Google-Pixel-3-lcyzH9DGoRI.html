at a level yet where I can get a new
phone every few months so when I was
able to upgrade for my iPhone 6s plus to
my iPhone tennis max I was very excited
and then shortly after Google decided
people sent me their new pixel 3 which
just made me completely ecstatic so
using these new flagship devices
back-to-back has kind of been like
sensory overload considering what I was
using previously so I wanted to share my
experience with you guys and wanted to
point out what I like and what I dislike
about both of these phones one of the
things I feel I phones always had over
Android devices was just our overall the
build quality there was a time not all
flagship Android devices were this slab
of glass and metal like the iPhone was
since the iPhone 4 and when Google first
released our first pixel phone it was a
good first try but it was certainly some
room for improvement even the pixel 2
was a little lackluster compared to its
competition build quality wise but now
the pixel 3 this phone does have to
build quality deserving of a flagship
now the pixel threes build quality isn't
better than the iPhone 10 as but it is
up there and even gives the iPhone 10 or
a run for its money one of the reasons
why I like the picks were 3 so much is
because it's been bad fully designed to
be used even without a case like I
mentioned of my iPhone 10s max video the
iPhone 10s just isn't designed to be
used without a case it's way too round
it's way too slippery and it's hard to
know which way is up or down whereas a
pixel 3 has this optional always-on
display so you never end up picking this
phone up upside down all of the physical
control buttons on the right side making
this an awesome one-handed device the
chance for that just makes it super easy
to hold on to and the new textured back
also gives you a good amount of grip in
the hand and you don't have to worry
about the pixel 3 slide around the table
when you place it down and not to
mention the minimal camera hump
now when the pixel 3 first came out
there were a lot of people saying that
they knew it's back scratch to weight so
easily but I've been using this phone as
my daily driver for the last few weeks
and the back looks perfectly fine to me
so for an $800 phone the build quality
on the pixel 3 does deliver this time
around media consumption on the pixel 3
is also up there with the iPhone 10's
max since they both have OLED panels
provided by Samsung you're getting
comparable vibrant colors and restore
blacks that otherwise wouldn't be
possible on LCD screens but something
that I really don't like about the pixel
3 when watching videos with it is just
how much the dual front were
speakers vibrate the phone it just makes
it much harder to focus on or get lost
in the videos you're watching Dan with
the iPhone but somewhere the pixel three
does fall short is its battery life
plainly he said the pixel three is not
an all-day phone for the way I use it
but the principle three does offset this
poor battery life by coming included
with a fast charger right of the box
something that the thousand dollar-plus
iPhone doesn't and if you want fast
charging on your iPhone and you're gonna
have to pay an additional seventy bucks
but I also want to take a moment to
acknowledge the new pixel stand like
I've mentioned in the past I've never
really cared for wireless charging
because it wasn't as fast and was
wasteful compared to having a wired
charger but the new picks will stand you
still get rapid charging with the pixel
3 when you drop a pixel 3 and the stand
is gonna start charging your phone at 10
watts instead of 5 watts like other
cheap chargers so you're truly getting
the convenience of wireless charging
without sacrificing speed and this is
truly impressive cuz for the time being
there isn't an accessory for the iPhone
that can match this the air power is
nowhere to be found and even though
Logitech does sell a similar standing
wireless charger for the iPhone that
charges it at 7.5 watts that charge was
still wirelessly charges the iPhone
slower than if it had a wired connection
so what I'm saying is the new picks will
stand is to the pixel 3 like air pods or
to an iPhone they're a must-have
accessory that elevates your user
experience and you're not gonna want to
live without it after you've gotten so
used to it when I was got back to the
phones
the line between Android and iPhone has
increasingly blurred over the years
because they each take from one another
Android has always given the user as
many customization options as possible
but sometimes it can get a little
overwhelming and it can take a bit of
trial and error to get your phone
perfectly dialed in to how you want it
I'm still messing around with the
settings and home screen on my pixel 3
to get it just right the iPhone on the
other hand has always tried to make
things as simple as possible but does
limit the user one of my biggest gripes
with the iPhone is that you can't place
apps on the bottom half of the screen
unless you have extra apps up top
pushing them down for you even though it
did take me a little while to get used
to navigating through the iPhone 10s max
I've grown to really like the new
gesture based navigation
it's very fluid but it does force you to
use two hands on your iPhone more often
than not the virtual home button on the
pixel 3 is fine but one of the things I
dislike most about Android right now is
multitasking more often than not I end
up picking the wrong app or accidentally
opening the app drawer so even though
stock Android is much easier to use
these days I still feel the iPhone still
gives you a cleaner and easier user
experience I'll be it
more limited now even though I'm not a
die-hard Android or Apple fanboy one of
the things that always made me am
prehensile about switching to an Android
device these days what's the real mental
fingerprint sensor on most devices after
a few days I did get used to this
rear-mounted sensor but I did notice I
had significantly more failed attempts
than what I was used to when I had my
iPhone 6s plus and since I'm pretty
indifferent when it comes to face ID you
can say I'm really hoping under screen
fingerprint sensors to really catch on
and improve in the next year or so but
one of the things I really like about
the pixel 3 is the active edge I greatly
prefer Google Assistant over Siri I can
trust Google assistant to correctly act
on my voice commands than Siri that's
why I still mainly use Google assistant
on my iPhone and why I have so many
Google homes around the house and just
being able to squeeze the pics for three
and dance floor talking is another
underrated feature Google's new call
screening feature on the Pixlr 3 is also
a pretty cool concept and I feel it has
a lot of potential unfortunately right
now since the general public just isn't
educated on this call screening feature
they either just end up hanging up or
they proceed to leave a voicemail so for
the time being the call screening
feature has been a pretty cool feature
to play around with for the first week
I've had the phone but now I just don't
use it because I found it's faster to
either reject or just answer to call
myself but now let's talk about the
cameras even though the pixel 3 only has
a single camera I think it manages to
capture better stills than the iPhone
key word being stills the pics were 3
manages to capture more color accurate
cells than the iPhone the pixel 3 also
manages to capture a much wider field of
view than the iPhone making it much
better for both selfies and indoor use
Google is also doing a lot with software
they have much better and sharper edge
detection than iPhones
remote but Google does like to get
carried away with their bokeh effect so
much in fact I have to go in and
manually reduce it in most of the time I
just feel Google is trying too hard and
going hey we can do bokeh effect too and
we only have a one lens but keeping on
the topic of Google's software I also
really like the pixel three cause of all
of the baked in panoramic effects
Google's software does a really good job
of stitching together photos and making
them look really good while also
avoiding creating weird artifacts but if
you take a second to look closer you'll
notice it doesn't look like a real
picture it starts to look more like a
render than a photograph but still as
time goes on Google will continue to
improve on this but even though the
pixel 3 does take some great stills
I think the iPhone still takes much
better looking video I just can't help
but notice the pixel 3 video is a little
more washed out the foreground and
background separation is a little weak
and to me the image just is an S crisp
as the iPhone but overall even though
phone updates are becoming more and more
incremental it's obvious Google is
really trying to catch up with Apple by
really improving their hardware but also
pushing the boundaries regarding what
can be done through software when Apple
first released our iPhone the biggest
thing they had going for them was that
they made their own hardware and were
able to fully optimize it with their own
software they've also done a very good
job with the years of building their own
ecosystem of products and services that
make you less likely to leave their
walled garden which means you end up
giving Apple more and more of your money
Google on the other hand took a
completely different approach when it
came to Android their operating system
was open sourced that any manufacturer
could use for free Google's main
objective was just to get as many people
as possible to use their digital
services but now Google is taking a more
Apple approach when it comes to
releasing our own hardware like during
new pixel 3 and they're really trying to
compete with their own ecosystem through
their physical and digital products and
since phone upgrades these days are
becoming more and more incremental
ecosystems and digital services like
cloud storage of voice assistance and
timely updates are more important than
ever when it comes to choosing your next
phone and I feel the line between
Android mainly the pixel 3 and pixel 3
Excel and iPhone is becoming
increasingly blurred if you made it this
