arrive in the mail I thought it'd be fun
to review the Samsung gear icon X
wireless earbuds rumors have been flying
around that Apple took so long to
release your pods because of syncing
issues but if Samsung and other smaller
companies have managed to release
similar products what's a capo so long
let's find out how the icon next perform
well they haven't exploded in my ear
like the note 7 just yet so that's good
first when you slide out the Box you're
going to get a smaller box that has a
quick start guide that you're going to
drastically need below that are you
going to get some different sized
silicone eartips and some infants or you
can customize the fit to your liking
you're also going to get a USB cable and
a USB connector you also get a carrying
case itself that also acts as a charging
cradle and the earbuds themselves
overall it's a good presentation these
earbuds do much more than just play
music you can also measure your heart
rate speed distance traveled and
calories burn there are also water swap
resistant but just keep in mind you can
only use these earbuds to their full
potential if you're using Samsung's s
health app which is only available on
Android devices but don't worry you can
still sing these earbuds to an iphone
all you have to do is just take the
earbuds out of the charging cradle and
head over to your Bluetooth settings
page on your iPhone and pair them if you
decide to use the icon X with your
iPhone you won't be able to get any of
the fitness feature like the heart rate
monitor or the calorie tracker although
the icon next are packed with a whole
bunch of features the most important
aspect we're interested in is what they
sound like after listening to a few
songs from different genres i can say
these earbuds don't sound too good
there's barely any instrument separation
the cell model the highest center ring
or give off a tinny sound and there's
Billy only base to them if you're
getting these your phone's is not
because you're looking for something
that sounds good you're getting them
because you're interested in their
fitness capabilities the good thing is
since you're so lightweight they don't
fall out of your ear each year but
features of the trackpad you can use to
control your music by tapping one so you
can play or pause your music a double
tap will skip to the next song and a
triple tap will go back a track you can
swipe left or right to adjust the volume
in New your buds as well it's a cool
approach to controlling your music but
it's a little clunky at best I notice
that while testing the trackpad I kept
getting the wrong command of the year
buds eat sherbet has a 47 million air
battery that should get you around three
hours of playback time the case itself
has a 315 milliamp battery back in
charge of each year but back to full
battery five times all you have to do is
just play the earbud in the case and
close the lid and they'll start charging
back up there's even an indicator light
on the front of the case i will tell you
of the year bunch of charging if the
case itself runs out of battery all you
have to do is just charge it from the
micro USB port on the back the Samsung
gear icon X is very much a beta test
product like the first Apple watch was
it's giving us a preview of what Samsung
has in store for us concerning Fitness
technology the heart rate monitor on
these earbuds is not the best and found
them to be off the majority of the time
the trackpad interface can be very
clumsy at times the three hour battery
life and lack of quick charging
capabilities means you can't just pick
up these your phones and go if there are
no charge they also don't sound too good
if you're an early adopter and likes to
be on the bleeding edge of technology
then pick up a pair of icon X if you're
into running and have a samsung device
not having to carry your phone around
and being able to track your runs with
your earbuds is pretty cool but if
you're in the market for well as your
budget for the gym then I advise you
pass on these instead look into the day
products trees or the power base threes
