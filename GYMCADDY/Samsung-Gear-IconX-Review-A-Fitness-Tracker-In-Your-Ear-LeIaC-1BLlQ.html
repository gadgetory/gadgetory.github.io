arrive in the mail I thought it'd be fun
to review the Samsung gear icon X while
this earbuds rumors have been flying
around that Apple took so long to
release ear pods because of syncing
issues but if Samsung and other smaller
companies have managed to release
similar products what's a cap oh so long
let's find out how the icon next perform
well they haven't exploded in my ear
like the note 7 just yet so that's good
first when you slide out the box you're
going to get a smaller box that has a
QuickStart guide that you're going to
drastically need below that you're gonna
get some different size silicone
irritants and some earphones so you can
customize the fit to your liking you're
also going to get a USB cable and a USB
connector you also get a carrying case
itself that also acts as a charging
cradle in the earbuds themselves overall
it's a good presentation these earbuds
do much more than just play music you
can also measure your heart rate speed
distance traveled and calories burn
they're also water and sweat resistant
but just keep in mind you can only use
these earbuds to their full potential if
you're using Samsung's s health app
which is only available on Android
devices but don't worry you can still
sync these earbuds to an iPhone all you
have to do is just take the earbuds out
of the charging cradle and head over to
your Bluetooth settings page on your
iPhone and pair them if you decide to
use the icon X with your iPhone you
won't be able to get any of the fitness
feature like the heart rate monitor or
the calorie tracker
although the icon acts are packed with a
whole bunch of features the most
important aspect we're interested in is
what they sound like after listening to
a few songs from different genres I can
say these earbuds don't sound too good
there's barely any instrument separation
the sound model the highest center ring
or give off a tinny sound and there's
barely any bass to them if you're
getting these earphones it's not because
you're looking for something that sounds
good you're getting them because you're
interested in their fitness capabilities
the good thing is since they're so
lightweight they don't fall out of your
ear each your but features of the
trackpad you can use to control your
music by tapping one so you can play
your pause your music a double tap will
skip to the next song and a triple tap
will go back a track you can swipe left
or right to adjust the volume in your
beds as well it's a cool approach to
controlling your music but it's a little
clunky at best I notice that while
testing the trackpad I kept getting the
wrong command of the earbuds each herb
it has the 47 millionaire battery that
should get you around 3 hours of
playback time the case itself has a 315
milliamp battery back in charge of each
earbud back to full battery 5 times all
you have to do is just play the earbud
in the case and close the lid and
they'll start charging back up
there's even an indicator light on the
front of the case that will tell you
you're a bunch of charging if the case
itself runs out of battery all you have
to do is just charge it from the
microUSB port on the back the Samsung
gear ikonics is very much a beta test
product like the first Apple watch was
it's giving us a preview of what Samsung
has in store for us concerning fitness
technology the heart rate monitor on
these earbuds is not the best and found
them to be off the majority of the time
the trackpad interface can be very
clumsy at times the three hour battery
life and lack of quick charging
capabilities means you can't just pick
up these earphones and go if they're on
low charge they also don't sound too
good if you're an early adopter and
likes to be on the bleeding edge of
technology then pick up a pair of Ikon X
if you're into running and have a
Samsung device not having to carry your
phone around and being able to track
your runs with your earbuds is pretty
cool but if you're in the market for
rallies at your budget for the gym then
I advise you pass on these instead
looking through the day products threes
or the power B's threes links to the
reviews on the description well if you
made it this far and leave us a like it
really helps if you like videos like
this subscribe there's more to come if
you're looking for more product reviews
