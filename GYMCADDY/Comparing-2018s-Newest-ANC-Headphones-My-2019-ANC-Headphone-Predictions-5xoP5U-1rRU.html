market is increasingly becoming more and
more competitive these days because we
have experienced companies releasing
second third or fourth generations of
their products we have giant companies
that want to get in on the action and we
have other companies that just want to
bolster their declining smartphone sales
by giving you a free pair of headphones
if you pre-ordered their shiny new
marginally better smartphone now there's
no way I'm gonna be able to cover all of
the new ANC headphones that were
released this year but we're gonna look
into the new $350 ANC headphones that
were released in the second half of 2018
I'm gonna let you know what I think we
have to look forward to in 2019 and here
are a few ideas and suggestions that I
would like to see implemented into
future ANC headphones the reason we're
looking at these $350 ANC headphones
today is because the market has pretty
much dictated that $350 is the most
people are willing to pay for premium
ANC headphones anything more than that
means you're buying ANC headphones that
are made out of finer materials or Apple
courageously released her own rumored
ANC headphones for those who don't know
the Sony 1000 XM 3s or currently my
favorites and most recommended ANC
headphones
I think the Microsoft Surface headphones
or a really good first try but do you
have room for improvement and I would
avoid the AKG and 700 nc's at all costs
but if you want to pick up these or any
other agency headphones mention in this
video I'll have links to the description
below and if you use those links you
really upset the channel now the first
thing anyone should consider when
picking out a pair of ANC headphones is
their design build quality and most
importantly fit headphones like the Sony
1000 x m3 bose QC 35 and sennheiser PXE
550 s have a subtle but
professional-looking design that are
going to look good on almost anyone who
wears them but there are other
headphones like the Microsoft Surface
headphones Beats Studio 3 and Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins px that have a more stylized
design or coming loud bright colors that
some people like while others don't and
like I said the full review I like how
the surface headphones look but the
thing all of these ANC headphones have
in
is that her aiming for a low-profile
headband in earcup design and this is
what most people looking for whereas
there are other headphones like the AKG
and 700 and C's and Sony XP 950 n1 that
just have these thick head bands and
huge ear cups that stick out that in
short just make people feel embarrassed
when they wear them out in public so if
companies want to stay competitive they
don't just have to continue making
good-looking headphones they need to
continue to shrink them down and make
them as low profile as possible
but obviously any time you try to shrink
a product down it makes it hard to stick
other components inside like the battery
now ansi headphones these days have an
average battery life of about 25 hours
with anc turned on there are exceptions
to this like the surface at phones
clocking in at 15 hours and the Sony's
overachieving at 30 hours and for the
most part a 25 hour battery life on
headphones should last most people about
a week and a half maybe 2 weeks in
between charges so I don't think
headphone manufacturers should spend a
lot of time trying to increase that
number but I do think it would be pretty
cool if we saw a pair of headphones that
could be used to charge your phone and
it would be even cooler if you could
charge your phone with your headphones
wirelessly I know Jean me or huawei
already has a pair of wireless earbuds
that can be used to charge their phone
but something I really do see headphones
improving on in 2019 is their fast
charger for a while the B studio 3ds had
the best fast charging where 10 minutes
got you 3 hours but now it's only
turning up a notch because 10 minutes
gets you 5 hours so I really do see
headphones improving and flaunting their
fast charging feature to entice heavy
commuters but another thing I want to
see improved in 2019 is wireless
connectivity one of my biggest gripes
with the Sony 1000x m3 is that they can
only be connected to one device at a
time which makes switching from your
phone to your computer on over Hilo
bases a hassle and this is the case with
a lot of other anc headphones whereas
there are other headphones like the
surface headphones and the bose qc25
that can be connected to two or more
devices
at the same time I just want to see
multi device connectivity become more
common on anc headphones because this is
one of those features
you're really gonna miss when you don't
have it anymore now whenever a new
smartphone is released the key main
improvements people are looking for or
speed battery life and camera quality
and the version of this for ANC
headphones is fit sound quality and ANC
performance in general the active noise
cancellation in ANC headphones is
designed to block out constant
low-frequency sounds like road noise the
constant hum of an AC unit or de jet on
a plane but what separates good ANC
headphones from great ANSI headphones is
also being able to block out random high
frequency sounds like chatter ANC tests
you just heard you may have noticed that
the AKG is that a better job of blocking
out road noise than chatter the surface
headphones were able to block out more
noise than the a kgs in general and the
Sony's not only blocked out the most
amount of road noise they also did a
much better job of blocking out chatter
but another thing to take into
consideration with ANC headphones is the
amount of cabin pressure their ANC
produces headphones like the Bose QC 3
5s and JBL ever 'silly just have a lot
of cabin pressure making them very
uncomfortable to wear for some people
like myself whereas there are other
headphones like the surface headphones
and Sennheiser 4.50 BT NCS that have a
very mild amount of pressure that's much
more manageable and there are other
headphones that have almost no cabin
pressure like the 1000s and threes that
still manage to block out a lot of sound
but it's my hope that in 2019 we start
to see even better active noise
cancellation that's able to block out
more noise with less and less cab
pressure but even though active noise
cancellation is great and all it does
hinder your headphones sound quality
with active noise cancellation turned on
the soundstage and instrument separation
is narrowed on a lot of ANC headphones
and the bass on some headphones starts
to sputter more frequently and in some
cases some ANSI headphones don't get as
loud as they could with ANC turned on so
whenever you want to get the best sound
quality out of your ANC headphones you
should listen to them with ANC turned
off and again as we head into 2019 I
would really like to see improvements in
ANC technology where it's not just
blocking out a lot more noise or less
cabin pressure but doing so without
affecting your sound quality and a lot
of ANC headphones these days are also
bringing extra features where they will
pump in the ambient sound around you
giving the headphones and open-back
effect and having this type of feature
on headphones is especially useful if
you plan on walking around with them in
the city on your commute to work this
feature allows you to have your
headphones on and listen to your music
but still be aware of your surroundings
the only thing is that I want companies
to remember is to implement this feature
correctly as in prioritizing people's
voices instead of a straight-up noise
pollution looking at you Microsoft and
shutting off the feature when a random
loud sound occurs or you don't suffer
any blaring sirens or jump-scares AKG
but still this is one of those features
I want to see become more and more
common on ANC headphones because it's
sorely lacking on other popular
headphones like the both QC 35 s and
Beats Studio 3 but the number one
feature I know for a fact that's going
to make a very big push on a and C
headphones in 2019 is going to be the
integration of voice assistance and
headphones like the bose qc25 sony's
whole headphone lineup and the surface
headphones have some type of voice
assistant integration hey Cortana what
is the Microsoft Microsoft is at 106
point five trading up three point three
eight percent as a 3:30 4:00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time and personally I
really like having voice assistance
built into my headphones besides making
you feel like a very cheap version of
Iron Man voice systems and headphones
read out notifications to you as they
come in and you can interact with them
very quickly but I would like to see
more headphones take the bose route
where they support more than one voice
assistant so he can choose which one to
use
unlike Sony which is strictly Google
system and I would also like to see more
headphones where you can activate your
voice assistant by just saying the hot
word like with Cortana on the surface
headphones just as long as there's voice
mapping so not just anyone can run up to
you and pull up your voice assistant and
try to mess with you but more
importantly if ANSI headphones are
commonly going to have voice assistance
we need them to start coming with a
dedicated voice assistant button right
now on both Sony's and boses headphones
in order to use your voice assistant you
have to press down on a physical button
on the headphones and then talk one B T
C equals 3,740 United States dollars and
there's nothing wrong with pressing this
button it's a very efficient and
accurate way to talk to you assistant my
problem with Sony's and boses method is
that if you want to use this feature you
end up sacrificing some functionality on
your headphones with the Sony's you
won't be able to manually cycle between
having a and C turn on/off or ambient
mode and on the Bo's you won't be able
to manually toggle the level of your a
and C things that I like to adjust on my
headphones on a regular basis and don't
want to have to pull out my phone every
single time I want to toggle them so if
a and C headphones are going to have
voice assistance we want to be able to
use them without having to sacrifice any
functionality on our headphones like we
do today and finally the last thing was
the improved on a and C headphones for
2019 is their microphone sound quality
the microphone sound quality on some ANC
headphones can be very hit or miss
sometimes and it's kind of like how
Linus complains that laptops these days
are still coming with some very crappy
webkinz and the microphone sound quality
can be very important for working
professionals that want to take phone
calls with these headphones but overall
as we close out 2018 the number one ANC
had
to be right now or the Sony 1000x and
three they look good they fit well they
sound good and they currently have the
best active noise cancellation on the
market but even though they're very good
they still have room for improvement
the 1000x m3s lack multi device
connectivity I want to see an additional
dedicated voices system button and I
would like a faster and more efficient
way to switch from a and C to ambient
mode similar to what the surface
headphones has going on with her dials
but still as 2018 comes to an end you
can't go wrong with picking up the 1000
X entries but I'm still very excited to
see what 2019 brings to this
increasingly competitive agency
headphone Morgan I have some pretty high
hopes for Bose Sennheiser and Apple if
you made it this far I guess you enjoyed
the video so hit that like button and
get subscribed it helps out more than
you realize
