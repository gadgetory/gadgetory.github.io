FiOS service plan here at home and I'm
getting 300 megabits per second internet
speeds which is obviously awesome but in
order for me to actually get those
internet speeds wirelessly I'm I'm
having to use my own access points now
in the process we also got updated TV
set-top boxes now this is the new
Verizon FiOS 1 TV set-top box now the
set-top box does have a few improvements
over the old set-top boxes first off it
is much smaller it's also much snappier
so whenever you're navigating through
the menus everything just moves quicker
and it also comes included with this new
minimalist remote which is much smaller
than the outgoing remotes it has much
clicker buttons and you can also do this
watch Comedy Central now that's awesome
but what isn't so awesome is that I did
notice there was some latency going on
whenever I was trying to watch TV while
using an external sound bar now whenever
I would watch Netflix or YouTube videos
while using the sound board there was no
latency or whatsoever I was actually
pretty awesome but then when I tried
watching TV with the sound bar some type
of latency would form after a few
minutes of watching TV now just so that
we're all on the same page I'm using a
samsung seven series 4k Smart TV with a
JBL sound bar which for transparency JBL
did send this out for review so expect a
video on this in a few days or so now
again so that we're all on the same page
if the Verizon FiOS set-top box is
hooked up to the TV via the HDMI one
port and the sound bar is hooked up to
the TV we have the HDMI 3 port because
that's where your connection is now if
this is your first sound board if you
want to get the best performance out of
your new sound board it's in your best
interest to use the HDMI out port found
under the sound bar and hook it up
either into your receiver or directly
into the TV if you don't have a receiver
now if you're anything like me you
probably tried calling Verizon FiOS
technical support and they unfortunately
couldn't help and so then you tried
messing around with all of the audio
settings
found on the TV sound bar in Verizon
FiOS OtterBox and unfortunately nothing
worked until I realized there was a
secret menu found on the Verizon FiOS at
ibattz now in order to get into the
secret menu what you want to do is you
want to grab your Verizon FiOS set-top
box control and you're gonna hit power
and then okay twice so it's going to be
power okay
okay and that in that order so we're
just gonna give it a try power okay okay
and this is what you want to see don't
worry we didn't break it this is good
now we're going to get this controller
and we're gonna click on left we're
gonna scroll down to user settings and
then we're gonna scroll down to
additional HDMI settings and then we're
gonna go to where it says audio output
now this is going to be for you set on
auto you're going to want to switch this
over to LPCM and click OK
you're going to click exit and then
we're going to power on the set-top box
again and that's how you fix any audio
latency issues while trying to watch TV
while using an external sound bar now I
know this video is very different from
the types of videos that I usually make
and it's probably gonna help a very
small portion of people but I've been
dealing with this issue for almost a
week now and it just this audio latency
would just drive me insane
any time I was trying to watch TV and it
was a hair pulling process trying to fix
this issue because everything that I did
just didn't work so remember all you got
to do is click power ok ok and then
you're going to get access to that
secret menu if you made it this far I
guess you enjoyed the video so hit that
like button and get subscribed to help
someone than you realize if you want to
pick another part except mention in this
video those will be linked in
description down below any girls will
support the channel by checking out the
March store but other than that I'll
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
