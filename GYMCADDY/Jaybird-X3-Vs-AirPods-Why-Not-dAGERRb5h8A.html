get the air pods or the j-bird x3 well
Apple wholeheartedly believes that
Wireless is the future and sinister 2016
September keynote they have released
three completely different wireless
earphones that feature the brand-new w1
chip so does that mean you should just
follow the crowd and get one of Apple's
products or should you go with something
different like the j-bird x3 unlike the
power B's 3 or the airpot the jaybird x3
or hybrid wireless earphone as in they
perform very well in the gym but are
still modest enough to be worn around
everywhere else
obviously these your phones are
connected to each other via a non tangle
flat cable they also come with multiple
silicone ear fins silicone ear tips and
comply ear tips unlike Apple's
one-size-fits-all ear pods you can
literally spend hours mixing and
matching ear tips and fins to get that
perfect fit for yourself they are pods
on the other hand are apples the latest
product to be released
although subject to some really bad
jokes the air parts are one of the
better truly wireless earphones
available on the market they have the
exact same fit as the ear pods so take
that as you may the air pods are also
smart enough to know when they are
placed in your ears and will pause your
music automatically when you take them
out in order to charge either of these
earphones they both require some type of
proprietary cradle the air pots can only
be charged by being placed in their
carrying case which also has to be
charged of your lightning cable each
individual air pod can last 5 hours on a
single charge and can last up to a total
24 hours with the help of the carrying
case the jaybird x3 on the other hand
can last with straight eight hours on a
single charge the extra charge via a
small proprietary cradle if you lose the
cradle for either one of these you're
screwed
controlling sound the j-pod x3
completely obliterate the air pods the
overall sound is better
amazing soundstage punchy bass and very
clear mids and highs and the coolest
part is you can customize your sound
with Jaybirds my sound app I'm kind of
amazed Apple hasn't integrated this into
iOS the air pods on the other hand sound
not as great and are very muddled if
you're looking for something that just
sounds great then just go for the J but
x3 controlling your music playback is
extremely different on each ear phone
the air pods don't have an inline
controller and forces you to use Siri by
double tapping either ear phone this
makes what were one simple task like
adjusting the volume or skipping the
track that much harder since the J
products trees still have a wire
feature an inline controller but to be
honest it's not the best controller I've
used the clicks are very dissatisfying
and in order to use all of the commands
you have to memorize the click orders
like you were memorizing word
definitions for the SAT both of your
phones are compatible with either Apple
or sandal Bluetooth devices but the air
pods are better when used exclusively
with Apple products the air plus feature
Apple's in UW one chip which makes
pairing and going from device to device
a breeze the J products three on the
other hand still uses Bluetooth
technology and can connect with up to
two devices simultaneously but if you
try to use the controller commands while
they're connected to two devices where
things are will happen the air plugs are
extremely lightweight and can be worn
for long periods of time without feeling
any discomfort they rest right outside
your ear canal which allows ambient
noise to pass through which some people
like and others don't the J Betar in-ear
earphones and offer passive noise
cancellation unfortunately they aren't
as comfortable and do cause discomfort
or irritation after a while links to
their full individual reviews or post in
the description so which should you get
if you're looking for something that
sounds great something rugged or
something you can take almost anywhere
then get the J board x3 but if you're
looking for something to listen to music
with while you're working or something
you can wear for long periods of time
then get the air pods the air parts
really don't do two hours gym if you
really want the convenience of Apple's
new w1 chip but still want some wireless
earphones that offer versatility then
you're gonna have to wait for the beats
