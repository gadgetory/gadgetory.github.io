review I didn't expect to fall in love
with it as much as I did
since pebble is now dead I can
confidently say the while we fit is a
great if not better alternative to
pebbles past offerings while we first
moved into my radar when they released
it Nexus 6p last year the 6p was an all
metal and very well built phone and
those same characteristics can be found
on the huawei fit you can pick up the
SmartWatch on sale over at Amazon for
$100 link is in the description
matter of fact I'm giving this one away
for a chance to win this while we fit
please click the like button leave a
comment and subscribe to the channel ldm
the winner on January 3rd first off
while we really knocked it out of the
park with the packaging the watch itself
is front and center after moving the
outer casing understand the holes to
watch you'll find some documentation
underneath you will also find a charging
cradle and a micro USB cable and that's
pretty much it there's no extra wrist
straps included let's talk about battery
life the Huawei Fit has an 80 million
battery that will get you five days of
continuous use or one month of standby
time that's pretty impressive for such a
small battery in order to charge the
small watch you need to place him in
this charging cradle the watchman
created will magnetically align itself
and make sure the charging pins make
proper contact it's a foolproof system
even I can't mess up now let's talk
about looks the wobbly fit is perhaps
the best-looking fitness tracker /
SmartWatch you can get on the market
right now for just $100 the silicone
strap has a race design which makes it
look like if we're mad at cloth but
since it's made of a silicon is still
wicks away sweat the straps are also
easily removable so that you can add
different straps if you so choose the
watch itself is made out of stainless
steel and has a Gorilla Glass front
which is scratch and fingerprint
resistant on the bottom of the watch
we'll find a heart rate sensor as well
overall the watch itself looks great the
outer casing of the watch features
tapers and chance for edges which helps
to give the illusion of it being thinner
than it actually is while we fit does a
great job of being a capable fitness
tracker
without actually looking like a fitness
tracker like the pebble 2 or Samsung
gear 2 okay so what can this watch do
you might be asking well it can do
pretty much everything you'd expect from
a fitness tracker it can count your
steps track your distance measure your
heart rate and track your sleep all of
this data can be displayed on as a
company and phone application which can
be found both on Apple or Android
devices the application does leave
something to be desired unfortunately
and it is the weaker link when it comes
to using to why we
but you can still share the data it
collects with other fitness tracking
apps so what we fit can also show you
notifications like incoming text emails
phone calls and other third-party
application notifications the fit also
has a touch screen which you interact
with by tapping and swiping
unfortunately it can mix up to two from
time to time making a little hard to
navigate at times now what we fit is a
famous tracker that is more geared
towards runners if you want to manually
sort of work out the options you will
save or for running walking cycling
treadmill or swimming oh that I mention
you can swim with a small lunch well you
can swim with the SmartWatch just like
other smartwatches
the huawei fit screen lights up when you
raise your arm but my favorite thing
about the small watch is the resistors
it has what that allows you to navigate
through his options without having to
touch the screen it's a feature straight
over Android wear and I wish more
fitness trackers on the market would
take advantage of it here's looking at
you Fitbit charge to the huawei fit does
what it needs to do in order to be
considered a fitness tracker it counts
your steps tracks your distance tracks
your runs and maps it out for you with
the help of your smartphone counselor
calories burn measures your heart rate
tracks your sleep and bugs you wouldn't
have been inactive for too long like I
said before the why we fit is geared
towards more - runners and the app
itself also coaches you through your
math on training it also does just
enough to be considered small also like
to show you complete notifications when
you get a text in middle phone call
but unlike a full SmartWatch you can't
respond to those out of cases from your
SmartWatch you also can't control your
music playback from the huawei fit but
that's okay
smartwatches haven't caught on as much
as manufacturers want them to because no
one has really figured out how to make a
good SmartWatch before we fit strikes
the perfect balance of usability design
and price it tells me just enough if I'm
moving enough how intense my workout was
and roughly how many calories I'm
burning a day so I can get a better
gauge of how many calories to eat per
day it also helps me stay up to date at
a glance with my incoming emails texts
and phone calls when I'm out running
errands but it also looks amazing and
professional enough where I can even
wear it into a meeting and still look
presentable the long battery life also
means I don't have to put it to charge
before bed like the Apple watch or gear
fit if you're looking for a top notch
fitness tracker then I would have to say
go with the Fitbit charge to the Fitbit
charge to is an all-around better
fitness tracker and has a better phone
application than the Huawei links to its
reviews in the description but if you're
looking for a sleek-looking SmartWatch
that can show you full notifications
and still track your fitness that's
fairly well then I say pick up the while
we fit for just $100 it's a pretty damn
solid deal well if you made it this far
and leave us a like it really helps if
you like videos like this subscribe
