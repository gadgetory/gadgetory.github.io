though truly wireless earbuds are all
the rage these days
besides ear pods I still prefer to use
wire to earbuds too like these for
working out at a gym cuz they usually
have a longer battery life their
Bluetooth connection is much more stable
and you still have full control over
your music playback because of the
inline controller and today I'm going to
be comparing my top two favorite sports
wireless earbuds for working out we have
the brand new j-bert x4 and my personal
daily drivers the power beats 3 besides
some minor cosmetic and tax pack changes
the new j-bert x4 aren't all that
different from the previous cheaper x3
and that's not a bad thing if it ain't
broken don't fix it and just like the
x-rays before it the new j-bert x4
currently retail for one $29.99 now I
know this vs. video might seem a little
unfair cuz the power B's 3 retail for
$200 but since the power piece 3
routinely go on sale on Amazon for less
than $140 and I sold directly from
Amazon I think it even things out now if
you want to pick you these your phone's
up I'll have links or description below
and if you use the links really upsets
channel I highly suggest you check them
out because these earphones routinely go
on sale and also check out my show it
down below the biggest and most
important difference between these 2
earphones is going to be the way you
wear them personally I really like the
power beats 3 cuz of their ear hooks
once you put them in they're staying
there throughout your whole workout you
could be sprinting or dismounting from a
pull-up bar or whatever and the power
base 3 ain't going anywhere but you can
only wear the power base 3 one way
whereas the J Brand X 4 gives you
multiple wearing options instead of your
hooks the x-force have your fins and
even though they do do a very good job
of keeping the X 4 in place they're not
as secure as having your hooks that wrap
around your ear but you can also wear
the X 4 is in there over your style for
an even more secure fit and since the X
4 is also come included with compliant
ear tips you can use these zero tips if
you want a more snug fit that will also
offer more passive noise isolation than
the silicon ear tips that come included
with both the X fours and power beats 3
the power peas 3 have a
one-size-fits-all solution whereas the J
Brand X 4 or all about options you can
customize them until you get
perfect fit and since they're so low
profile they're also a good option for
people who might want to wear them with
headgear one of these earphones also
have flat soft touch tangle free cables
connecting the ear buds to one another
and like I mentioned earlier one of the
reasons I still prefer to use wire ear
buds like these at the gym instead of
truly wireless earbuds is because of
their inline controller with truly
wireless earbuds you usually only have
partial control over your media playback
and you have to rely on your voices
system for the rest it's kind of like
how some people refuse to give up on the
headphone jack on phones well I don't
want to give up on the mi controller on
earbuds and having this inline
controller means you don't have to test
your phone as much at the gym and you
don't have to ask your voice assistant
to do simple things like adjust a volume
or skip a track and both of these
earphones have very easy-to-use
controllers with very clicky buttons
personally the only thing I don't like
about the x4 is is that you have to
press and hold the plus or minus button
to skip a track or go back a track but I
would rather have an inline controller
than having to shut on my voice
assistant when I'm out of breath in a
noisy gym to skip through my tracks or
just adjust my volume now when it comes
to battery life things are also very
different between these two your phone's
the power beats 3 haven't advertised by
a life of 12 hours and for me I can
usually go about four to five workouts
in between charges with the power of
beats 3 whereas the x4 is have an
advertised battery life of 8 hours and
these are good for a 3 full workout now
one of these your phones also feature
quick charging the power beats 3 will
get you one full hour of playback time
from just five minutes of charging from
a dead battery whereas the x4 is will
get you to the same one hour of playback
time or from a 10 minute charge and the
way you charge these earphones is also
very different sense the power piece 3
choice via on mic USB port you can use
any microUSB cable you have lying around
but I still wish Apple decided to use a
lightning port instead so I can charge
these earphones and my iPhone with the
same cable but unfortunately the J
products for is charged via a
proprietary charging cradle on one hand
it allows the X force to be very
low-profile but it also means you have
one more cable to keep track of now when
it comes to cell quality beats have
always had this reputation of having
lots and lots of bass and that's no
different the power of history but even
though the power of these three have a
lot of
the maids are still present and the
highs of a crash and for working out the
power B stories sound just fine the J
products fours also sound very good for
sports wireless earbuds but since they
connect to jeepers job you can adjust
the EQ and make them sound however you
want so you can tailor the J Brand X for
so they send the best for the type of
music you listen to sense I listen to a
lot of rap hip-hop in idiom I do like a
lot of bass in my music but if you
listen a country then you might want to
have a little more emphasis on the mids
and with the J birds you can do that now
with the power beats 3 yeah you can go
into iphone sound setting and pick from
a few EQ presets but you don't have as
much freedom as you would with tapered
zap now one thing the power beats 3 has
that the X force don't is apples w1 chip
obviously the power of these three will
work with non Apple devices just fine
but if you have multiple Apple devices
then switching between them with the
power base 3 is seamless now I know the
majority of people watching this already
know this but apples w1 chip also means
the power base 3 have almost no lanes
say between audio and video when
watching YouTube videos on your iPhone
and the power base 3 also have a
slightly longer range than the jaybird X
4 whereas DX 4s do have a little bit of
latency when watching videos and their
wireless connection won't go through as
many walls as the power base 3 now like
I said at the beginning of this video
the power piece 3 and J bar X 4 on my
top two favorite sports wireless earbuds
for working out and I feel that he can't
go wrong with either of them but
objectively the power beats 3 are still
a little better than the J Brand X 4 cuz
if their wraparound ear hooks and
slightly longer battery life but I
wouldn't pay $200 for them I would only
grab them if they're on sale which they
usually are on Amazon but if you want a
more low-profile design or if you just
want to save a few bucks then the J bar
x4 are also a good option I've never had
a problem with the previous J bar x3 and
I expect the same from the new x-force
and for the time being I'm still going
to be using white earbuds like these for
working out instead of truly where on
this earbuds I don't think that having
to pay a premium and having to
compromise on battery life media
controls and connection stability is
worth not having a wire connecting to
ear buds except for ear buds that's a
different story if you made it this far
