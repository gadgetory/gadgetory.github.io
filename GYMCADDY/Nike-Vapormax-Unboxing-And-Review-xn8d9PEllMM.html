first year max shoe and when the
legendary synchro Hatfield design issue
with the window in the midsole people
lost their mind the hedge over at Nike
were petrified that the air max bubbles
might pop while people wore them causing
bad PR for the company Tinker Hatfield
was almost fired but what people didn't
know whether they had just witnessed the
birth of an icon and now Nike has
released our all-new vapor max perhaps
their most drastic design today okay
hold on we've got a lot to cover first
up the price the nike vapor max
currently retailed for 190 and they
dropped in three different colorways
pure platinum like the ones that's
currently on sale over at famous rom-com
university red and a limited triple
black colorway
let's assure Nike will continue to
regularly release some colorways of the
paper man if you want to pick these up
I'll have a link in the description
below and comment down below telling me
what color way you like that up on the
paper max is Mew you've got a Nike
Flyknit material that makes the shoe
extremely lightweight and breathable
the flannel no vehicle max is almost
identical to the planet found on the new
lunar epic low climate - except the toe
box has much larger perforations woven
into it the vapor max all it has Nikes
double balloon fly wire system hopefully
the extra flag wear will help with
durability in the long run for those who
don't know fly wire is specific to Nike
and it really helps with the lockdown
when you turn the laces it really
compresses your whole foot evenly M is
quite nice actually throughout the shoe
there are multiple overlays which help
the shoe keep its shape the vapor max
also has a built-in heel counter that
really helps keep your heel in place
when you walk thankfully these shoes
don't suffer from heel slippage or like
other Nike shoes - I do want to point
out that three quarters of the tongue is
attached to the upper of the shoe and
I'm happy to report the shoe doesn't
suffer from the tongue shifting all
around when you walk like the og mic is
an epic dip but just like other making
shoes I just wish the tongue had more
padding the insole on the vapor max is
also a little different it's much
stiffer and it seems I can also like a
styrofoam hybrid alright let's get into
the actual bubbles the soul is separated
into two sections
you've got the forefoot and the mid foot
section and we've got the heel section
this gives us you a lot of flexibility
and it's almost on par with the Nike
make on three the bubbles themselves are
very easy to press but when they're on
feet the Air Max bubbles do a very good
job of keeping their shape the bottom of
the air max bubbles have extra rubber on
them for traction and durability there
are also other sections of the shoe that
has denser and stickier rubber on them I
guess Mike engineers put that rubber
there because they determined that's
where the most wearing tear would happen
but the rubber used on the bubble seems
tough enough and has proven to be pretty
resilient and other YouTube videos I
would really like to see a pair of vapor
max after a marathon run I want to see
how worn out the tribe would be in the
Pigasus skate I can tell you right now
the Nike Vapor back feel very different
with their own feet if their ride is
very soft but it does take some getting
used to since there is no Mitzvah on the
shoe it's quite literally just your foot
on the air mass bubbles and that's where
my problem is the air max bubble is kind
of encase or hug the bottom of your foot
but I feel the shape of the heel is a
little off the forefoot and miss wood
area feel fine but the heel on this shoe
feels like it's a little too small and
angled wall this ends up feeling like
you're wearing squishy cleats
don't get me wrong the vapor masks are
fairly comfortable but nowhere near as
comfortable as other youtubers will lead
you to believe also when it comes to fit
just like other nike shoes there are a
little narrow but lengthwise they are to
the side overall the vapor max is a very
radical shoe that has received massive
amounts of hype the last couple weeks
the upper of the shoe is amazed it's a
clean silhouette the flannel is very
breathable uncomfortable and there's no
huge slippage the new air max bubbles
give the shoe a completely unique look
and ride but I think there is room for
improvement it's special in the helix
the vapor max is a decent shoe but don't
expect it to be life to using like
others will have you believe hey if you
made it this far I hope you enjoyed the
