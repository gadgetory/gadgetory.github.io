it sounds relatively good for its size
and it's pretty adorable and I can't
wait to get ahold of the JBL post three
well while we wait for that I thought
it'd be a good idea to review JBL latest
drop the Everest Elite 1050 and see
these are JBL's newest noise cancelling
earphones so I they worth the money
let's find out don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe the JBL Everest
elite 750 NC currently come in three
colorways blue gunmetal and silver
personally I got the blue ones cuz I
think they stand out comment below and
let me know which colorway you like best
these earphones currently retailed for
$299 if you want to pick these up I'll
have links in the description below and
I'll keep them updated so you can get
the best deals possible and if you're
looking for deals on other headphones
check out my friends over at rizz knows
they find deals on almost everything ok
so let's talk about what coming inside
the box obviously you get the headphones
but you also get a horse shell carrying
case which I really like there's a
pocket on the outside and there's
another pocket on the inside there's
even a little loop so you can attach it
to your backpack inside the case there's
another case that carries your micro USB
cable audio cable and that weird 2 prong
adapter that plane still insist on using
seriously why don't I still use those
things so the earphones themselves are
super lightweight probably because
they're mostly made out of plastic that
your clips go over year end there's a
good amount of padding but there isn't
as much padding on the headband but I
don't really mind it the right ear cut
has all the controls there's a power
button of volume and playback control
rocker on microUSB port a bluetooth
blind and a smart line one that in a
second I just want to point out that
comfort wise these get an 11 out of 10
the clamping force on the headband is
just so perfect it doesn't feel like
it's squeezing your head yes it's just
so lightweight you don't have to
constantly be readjusting enough I have
no issues wearing these for an extended
period of time they're as comfortable as
the both to c35 but at a slightly
cheaper price unfortunately the buns on
the JBL Everest Elite 750 NC feel
anything but elite sure they have great
tactile feedback but they are very hard
to tell apart I just touch in order to
turn them on you just slide the power
button off for a few seconds until the
light turns blue in order to adjust the
volume you just press the volume rocker
or down in order to play or pause your
music users press the center button what
if you want to skip a track you press
and hold the volume up button if you
want to go back a track you press and
hold the volume down button if you want
to activate Siri you double press the
center button personally I really don't
like the setup it makes skipping tracks
longer than it should and it makes going
back a track a little more difficult
Dennis should I prefer double or triple
pressing to play pause button in order
to control my music playback it makes
everything so much quicker concerning
battery life JBL claims these headphones
look at you twenty I was a playback time
what noise cancelling off and JBL claims
a battery life of 15 hours with noise
cancelling on but in my own test with
noise cancelling on and the headphone
set at 75% volume I got a battery life
of 12 hours so it's not the greatest
compared to others on the market but
they do quick charge in 3 hours
concerning wireless connectivity JBL
decided to use bluetooth for that all on
these headphones they have no problem
keeping a clear connection through
multiple walls but they only have a
range of about 60 feet with direct
line-of-sight and since they only use
bluetooth for that oh you can only be
paired to one device at a time so if
you're using your headphones with your
phone and now you want to listen to
something on your laptop you have to go
through the setup process every single
time you're switching short unlike
Bluetooth 4.2 where you can be paired to
two devices at the same time and easily
switch between the two without needing
to go through the setup process I'm just
surprised JBL decided to use bluetooth
for that Oh instead of Bluetooth 4.2
when it comes to sound quality these
headphones sound ok I feel that the
sound stage is a little narrow in the
instrument separation could be better
but they have good vocal separation the
bass is decent and the highs are clear
to a certain extent if you're listening
to music with a lot of bass or really
high highs that's where these have some
good suffering the bass were just
getting muddled out and the highs would
just get blown out these headphones
don't have a lot of range to them and
they aren't that loud which might be a
good thing in the long run because
they'll seem to hear what the active
noise-cancelling is really good you can
even adjust how much noise cancel you
want through JBL headphones app if
you're walking in the city and you want
to be aware of your surroundings you can
set them to ambient awareness high and
they'll funnel in some of the ambient
noise if you want to escape from the
world and you don't want to
here on anything you can set them to
ambient awareness low and block out
everything you can even set different
ambient awareness levels in each year
but something I did find in my testing
was that if you set these headphones to
the lowest ambient awareness setting
they do cause a bit of a headache but
that's just me and remember that smart
button I mentioned earlier you can cycle
through the different ambient awareness
levels with a single tap so you don't
actually have to open up the app every
single time concerning Davio's app it's
pretty good its laid out well and it
works without any issues unlike other
apps out there there's an equalizer with
preset settings and you can even make
and me my own custom EQ and since it's
saved to the firm one of the headphones
the EQ settings will follow you
everywhere you can also see what you
current battery statuses on the
headphones the biggest difference
between the JBL Everest elite 750 NC and
the JBL Everest elite 700% a smaller
form factor is that the 750 NC now has
an echo cancelling microphone people
didn't even know songs to them through
my headphones and the call quality was
crystal clear for them and I could speak
in my normal voice unlike other
headphones who have to speak a little
louder so the mic in hear me clearly so
what's the verdict on the JBL Everest
elite 750 and C well they're okay the
button layout needs some improving and
the sound quality didn't blow me away
they sound good in the middle of the
spectrum but the highs and bass get
muddled when stirring music is playing
they're very comfortable to wear and the
North cancellation is very good I really
like being able to send my ambient
awareness level but the battery life
needs some improvement and I really
don't know why JBL decided to use
bluetooth for that Oh on a pair of $300
headphones in 2017 it makes using these
headphones with multiple devices harder
than it should these days with bluetooth
for that - or Apple's w1 chip if these
were priced at $250 or less then yeah
but I wouldn't pay $200 for these hey if
