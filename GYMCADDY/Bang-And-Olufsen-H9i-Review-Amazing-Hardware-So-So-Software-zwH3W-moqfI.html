their h 9i and HH i headphones and their
slightly redesigned versions of the
previous h9 + h8 headphones banging
olsen claims they're padding active
noise cancellation sound quality and
battery life have all been improved but
to be frank the h9 i aren't cheap so
let's find out if they're worth of
premium the bien all play h9 i come in
two colorways you can either get them in
all black like I have them here or you
can get them in a natural two-tone color
way as well I usually try to stay away
from all black products cuz they usually
look boring to me but I have to say that
h9 I look incredibly cool and sleek in
their stealthy all black colorway now
when it comes to price Toby Noa h 9i
retails for $499 $100 more than the bow
and wilkins PX which are another pair of
incredible headphones and $150 more than
the sony 1000 XM 2 which are the gold
standard right now when it comes to
active noise cancellation if you want to
pick these headphones up i'll have links
on description below and if you use the
links it really helps out to channel
concerning what's in the box the h9 i
are pretty standard issue you get a USB
see two USB a cable for charging a
pretty cheap 3.5 millimeter audio cable
for wire listening with no inline
controller and an airplane adapter and a
carrying pouch now the quality of the
carrying pouch is pretty nice and i'm
not worried about it falling apart too
quickly because it is a pretty fake
fleece but when i'm paying $500 for a
pair of headphones I'm kind of expecting
a hard shell carrying case the sony 1000
XM - both QC 35 series 2 NB Studio 3 all
come with hard shell carrying cases and
even though the powers in wilkins PX
also come with a carrying pouch it's a
diamond weave pouch that looks much
better than this one
if you plan on traveling a lot with the
h9 eyes
I suggest you invest in a hard shell
carrying case ok now let's talk about
the headphones themselves first off
these are not vegan-friendly
the headband is covered in Callaghan
leather which has a beautiful textured
look and the ear cups are covered in
lambskin leather which just feel
incredibly luxurious on the side of your
head and just to the touch
under the headband we have fabric with
minimal padding and the rest
the frame is made out of brushed
aluminum the earcups swivel and pivot
very gracefully but unfortunately these
headphones do not fold up now when it
comes to comfort these headphones feel
amazing right out of the box there's no
need for a break-in period and this is
coming from someone with a big head they
have very little clamping force but just
enough to keep them in place while
you're walking around the East Nine eyes
weigh in at 285 grams but for some
reason they feel much lighter than that
and overheating is not an issue with the
pads on these headphones there are times
where I actually forget I'm wearing
these headphones well without a doubt
the boss QC 35 series two are the most
comfortable headphones on the market
right now
and the BN o h9 eyes are a very close
second and that's because of the rounded
ear cups when you put these headphones
on your ears are not craft whatsoever
but since these ear cups are round
instead of oval they might rest on your
you lose a bit if you have larger ear
lobes this your cups rest on my ear
lobes just a little bit but I don't
notice them after a while now let's talk
about the tech specs the write your cup
is where all of the action is there's
your 3.5 millimeter audio jack for Wired
listening and these headphones do work
passively there's your USB C port for
charging and an on/off switch and that's
it when it comes to physical buttons
everything else is controlled with the
touch pad on the right ear cup you swipe
down to turn your active noise
cancellation on or off you swipe up to
turn transparency mode on or off which
is similar to Sony's ambient sound mode
you tap once to play or pause your music
you swipe forward to skip a track and
you sway backwards to go back a track
these touch controls work well and are
accurate for the most part but there are
hiccups here and there adjusting the
volume of the touch controls is a pain
in the neck though in order to adjust
the volume you have to do circles on the
touch pad but you have to place your
finger just right on the touch pad and
it takes forever to raise or lower the
volume and sometimes it just doesn't
work so I usually just end up whipping
up my phone and adjusting the volume
from there these headphones also have
proximity sensors built in just like the
bottom opens px but unlike the px they
will start to randomly start playing and
pausing your music if you move your head
around too much which is a good thing
when you take these headphones off
they'll automatically pause your music
and when you put them back on
they'll start play it again although
this feature is nice and all I just wish
you could turn it off these headphones
are also using bluetooth 4.2 and they
have a very respectable range of about
40 feet the connection is very stable
and they have very little latency when
watching videos there's a little bit of
lag but you really won't notice and
these headphones can be connected to two
devices at a time which is good but
these headphones don't support the apdex
HD audio codec if you're an iPhone user
and won't matter to you but I know that
for some people it does matter now when
it comes to battery life the h9 IR
little below average in my testing with
ANC and Bluetooth turned on I average 20
hours of playback time with the volume
and sent after 50% and with ANC turned
off I average 24 hours of playback time
although these numbers are a little
higher than what B&amp;amp;O advertises the
average battery life for AMC headphones
these days with ANC and Bluetooth turned
on is 25 hours playback time
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen also doesn't have
official quick charging numbers for
these headphones but I found that
charging them for 15 minutes from a dead
battery will get you about two and a
half hours playback time and that's
pretty good and it does help make the
shorter battery life
not that big of a deal now when it comes
to sound quality the ace 9 I are all
about balance and clarity their sales
stage is nice and wide and their
instrument separation is very good as
well something that you're obviously
going to be expecting when you're paying
$500 for a pair of headphones the low
ends are nice and deep and they do a
good job of not modeling the rest of the
sound if the bass really gets going but
don't expect any hand something bass the
highs are also very clear and there's
almost never any turning for the most
part these headphones have a flat sound
signature but you can't go into the
piano play ad and adjust their EQ a bit
you can choose from their preset or you
can make your own personally I like to
have mine on the excited side because it
gives the headphones are a good amount
of base but vocalists are still front
and center regarding their noise
cancellation it's pretty good they do a
very good job of blocking out both
constant sounds like road noise and they
also do a good job of blocking out
chatter but the noise cancellation on
the h9 I does cause
a little bit of pressure on your eardrum
not a whole lot like the bose qc25 where
it's unbearable for some people like
myself but you will notice it if you're
not playing music but if you're playing
music with the noise cancellation turned
on then you won't notice there
whatsoever
these headphones also have what Bing and
all of some calls transparency mode and
the headphones will pump in the ambient
sound around you so you can still hear
what's going on when you have these
headphones on this feature is useful if
you're walking around in the city now
let's talk about what I don't like even
though that h9 i our beautifully
designed
I think Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen could have done
better when it comes to these headphones
UI and phone application for starters
all of the times on these headphones are
the same so when you turn noise
cancellation or transparency mode on or
off you hear the same tone and there
have been multiple times where I'm just
swiping up and down on these headphones
trying to turn noise cancellation on if
the headphones used a different tone for
each setting or if they outright told
you noise cancellation on or noise
cancellation off then there wouldn't be
as much confusion I also think Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen should bring more functionality
to their app you should be able to
toggle your noise cancellation and
transparency mode settings straight from
your phone I also want to be able to
adjust how much noise cancellation and
how much ambient sound I want on these
headphones and like I said earlier I
wish these headphones came included with
a hard shell carrying case but I do feel
that Bing and all of them can and should
bring the extra app functionality and
verbal readouts through a software
updates and here is the microphone test
on the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen h 9i headphones
and i think it sounds pretty good but
this audio clip is being recorded by the
microphone on the h 9i headphones so you
can be those of that so to wrap things
up if you're somebody that likes the
finer things in life I think you'll be
happy with the Bing in all of them h 9i
headphones they're very comfortable too
where they look great they sound very
good and their noise cancellation is
very solid they do have a little bit of
cabin pressure but it's nowhere as harsh
as the bose qc25 their battery life is a
little below average but there are
unofficial quick charging does help
compensate a bit
I just hope Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen pushes out a
software update that improves the UI on
these headphones and bring some extra
functionality to their app but for sure
the h9 eyes have earned a slot in my top
