like a microbe but admittedly it is
expensive for what it is and not to
mention bad really fun the speaker is
not the best but I can't deny that it
sounds really good but if you're looking
for an ultra portable speaker that you
can quickly clip on to your backpack
then I feel the new JBL clip 3 can get
the job done better than the bose sound
like micro at a fraction of the price
just super clear this isn't a full
review on either of these speakers I'm
just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with your person's decision
if you want to learn more about either
of these speakers then watch their full
reviews the both sound like micro was
released back in the fall of 2017 and
when it first went on sale it was
retailing for a hundred and ten dollars
but now Bose has reduced the price to
$99.99 the new JBL clip 3 was released
in the spring of 2018 and currently
retails for 59.95 if you want to pick
either of these speakers up I'll have
links in description below and if you
use the links it really helps out the
channel I suggest you check them out
because you never know when these
speakers might go on sale so you make a
lucky from a design perspective these
speakers are very different the Bose
Soundlink micro is slightly bigger and
heavier than the clip 3 and it also
feels much more premium the whole body
is covered in a very rugged soft touch
rubbery skin and there's a slightly
elastic strap in the back that allows
the micro to latch on to many different
objects whereas the clip 3 has a durable
fabric mesh on the front and a hit of
softest rubber on the back but the
built-in clip on the clip 3 does limit
the amount of things the clip 3 can
actually attach to both of these
speakers have their control buttons so
you can quickly and easily adjust your
music playback and both of these
speakers charge via mic USB cable but
only the clip 3 it has an audio jack for
Wired listening whereas the Bose can
only play music wirelessly but like I've
said in the past I feel not having an
audio jack on smaller speakers like
these is it a big deal because phone
manufacturers are killing off the audio
jack anyway but if you really need that
audio jack then the clip 3 has you
covered one of the things the clip 3 has
over the micro is battery life Bose
advertises a six hour battery life on
the micro whereas JBL advertised
a 10-hour battery life on the clip three
and you can hit those numbers if you use
these speakers at 50% volume but
realistically speaking they're gonna
want to listen to music that a higher
volume so with the volume set at 80% the
micro manages to average just three
hours to play that time where else to
clip three and manages to average five
and a half hours of playback time and
what the volume set at 100% the micro
manages to hit only one and a half hours
of playback time and the clip three
manages to hit three a playback time I
just feel that if you're planning on
taking either these speakers with you on
a long hike battery life is going to be
more important than sound quality both
of these speakers are also rocking and
ipx7 certifications so water shouldn't
be a problem but while shooting my
b-roll I noticed the micro scents like a
rock whereas the clip 3 actually floats
now when it comes to speaker setup
things start to get very interesting the
sound like micro has a single transducer
and a passive radiator underneath the
perforated portion of the body whereas
the JBL clip 3 has a single 40
millimeter diameter transducer and as a
result both of these speakers are very
directional
the clip 3 has a leg up on the bows when
it comes to battery life but the bows
weren't that a doubt has the better
sound quality the clip 3 sounds way
better than the outgoing clip 2 but the
bose sound like micro sounds clearer
than the clip 3 has a wider soundstage
and has even more bass the Bose
Soundlink micro even has almost as much
space as the JBL flip or hook three
sounds good but the Bose sounds way
better but both of these speakers have a
little distortion at higher volumes
which is a nice sensation but now let's
talk about wireless connectivity both of
these speakers have solid wireless
connections and stuttering isn't a
problem and both of these speakers have
very little latency so either one of
them is just fine if you want to watch
youtube videos with them but my biggest
gripe with the clip 3 is that it doesn't
have JBL connect plus you can't pair it
up to any other JBL speaker or
enhancement the micro if you have
another Bose speaker lying around you
can pair them up and get stereo sound
going I don't know I just feel that the
clip 3 should have came included with
JBL connect plus and I'm not sure if
that's a feature they can add this
speaker through a software update in the
future
well with all that being said I still
feel the clip 3 is the better bang for
your buck when compared to the bose
sound like a micro I mean don't get me
wrong I like the micro it feels very
premium I like that you can pair it up
to another Bose speaker and it's sound
quality is very impressive for its size
but it's short battery life is a huge
drawback given that it's marketed as an
ultra portable speaker to take with you
on the go after a few hours the Micro
Touch first into a hockey puck even
though the clip 3 doesn't sound as good
as the micro I feel that it sounds good
enough if you made it this far I guess
you enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
