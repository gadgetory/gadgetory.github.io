rework their pricing structure.
The Beats Studio3 and the Beats Solo3 only
have a fifty dollar price difference between
them.
And like I said in my initial review, I feel
the Beats Studio3 are still over priced for
what they offer.
But regardless, if your trying to decide between
the Solo3 and Studio3 lets run down the differences
between them.
And you can watch my full review on the Beats
Studio3 here after you’re done watching
this video.
Like I just said, theres only a $50 difference
between these two head phones.
The Beats Solo3 typically retail for $299.95
and the newer beats Studio3 retail for $349.95.
And in classic beats fashion, both of these
headphones come in multiple color ways.
And more are bound to come out.
And I cant lie, they look really cool.
Personally I just wouldn’t pay full price
for these headphones, but amazon usually has
good deals on them.
If you still want to pick either of these
headphones up I’ll have links in the description
below and I’ll keep them updated so you
can get the best possible.
Unboxing these headphones is identical but
there are some noticeable differences with
the accessories.
They both come included with a micro usb cable
for charging, an audio cable with an inline
controller, and a carabiner.
But the first most noticeable difference when
you open the box is the carrying case.
The Beats Studio3 come included with a very
good hardshell carrying case.
It looks nice and it genuinely does a great
job of protecting your beats against major
bumps or if you cram it in an over packed
bag.
Where as The Beats Solo3 come with a very
cheap nylon bag that dosnt do much.
Im making a big deal about this cause there
are plenty of other headphones that are far
less expensive and come with a much better
carrying case.
Right now the Skull candy crusher wireless
and the Bose sound link headphones come to
mind.
Concerning build quality, both of these headphones
use the same exact materials.
They’re both mainly made out of plastic,
they have minimal padding on underside of
the headband but have a lot of grip, they
both use the same synthetic leather on the
ear pads and both ear pads are equally as
plush.
They both even have the same buttons on the
left ear cups so you can control your music
playback and activate siri by pressing and
holding the beats logo.
Or you can just say hey siri.
Regarding tech specs, these headphones are
very similar.
They both have Apple’s W1 chip, in fact…
the beats Solo3 were one of the first Headphones
to debut the W1 chip last year.
And for those who don’t know, the W1 chip
allows for near instant pairing with your
iPhone.
And once your headphones are paired with your
iPhone they will automatically pair with all
of your other Apple devices associated with
your icloud account.
So you can be listening to music on your iPhone,
then watch a video on your iPad and then switch
to your MacBook all without having to pair
your heads phones.
And although this is very convenient its not
totally unique.
The Bose QC35 II can also do this, but not
to this extent.
The QC35 II can only be paired up to two devices
at the same time and for some people thats
plenty.
But for those who want to use either of these
beats with non apple devices all you have
to do is press and hold the power button for
5 seconds and pair them via bluetooth.
And underneath the power button you will also
find a battery gauge.
Both of these headphones use micro usb ports
for charging and everybody and their mother
will tell you that apple should have used
a lightning connector or USB type C port instead.
And on the other side theres your Audio jack.
These headphones even have the same battery
lives… depending on how you use them.
The beats Solo3 advertise a battery life of
40 hours, but in my testing they actually
average about 50 hours.
The Beats Studio3 also advertise a battery
life of 40 hours but with noise cancelation
tuned off.
And it averages about 47 hours of play back
time.
And with noise cancelation turned on I routinely
get about 25 hours of playback time.
Not bad at all.
And they both have really impressive quick
charging.
5 minutes of charging on the solo3 its you
ten hours and 10 minutes of charging on the
Studio3 also gets you 10 hours.
The main difference between the Beats Solo3
and the Beats Studio3 is form factor.
The Solo3 are on ear headphones and the Studio3
are over ear headphones.
The solo3 are meant to rest directly on top
of your ears and create a decent seal which
provides some passive noise isolation and
the Studio3 are meant to encase your ears
and have the added benefit of active noise
cancelation.
Both of these headphones have a good amount
of clamping force on them but they’re still
comfortable to wear.
And like I said in my initial review, the
Studio3 and Solo3 stay in place very well
even when you’re working out.
I guess thats why I see so many people at
the gym with them.
But the different style of ear cups means
the Studio3 is more comfortable to wear than
the Solo3.
Since the Solo3’s are constantly pressing
against your ears they to tend to heat up
much faster than the Studio3.
Not to mention the constant pressure on ears
does get annoying after awhile.
The Beats Studio3 aren’t the most comfortable
over ear headphones on the market right now,
but I do prefer them over the Solo3.
One criticism I do have about both of the
headphones is the range of motion on the ear
cups themselves.
I wish they would pivot more so they could
fit my head a little better cause I do feel
some pressure on the anterior portion of my
ear.
Regarding sound quality, these headphones
do have very similar sound signatures.
They have a good amount of bass and a lot
of emphasis on the treble.
But the low ends and miss do get lost and
instrument separation need improvement.
But regardless, the Studio3’s do sound better
than Solo3.
They perform a little better in the low ends
and the sound stage is slightly wider.
Like I mentioned earlier, the beats Studio3
have active noise cancelation and it automatically
adjusts depending on your surroundings.
And to be honest the noise cancelation isn’t
the best.
It dosnt do a great job of blocking out sound
and when the noise cancelation is turned all
the way up you do start to feel a good amount
of cabin pressure.
I actually prefer to use the beats Studio3
without the noise cancelation.
But its nice to have it just in case.
Honestly, if you’re trying to choose between
the Beats Solo3 and Beats Studio3 then I say
just spring for the Studio3.
The extra $50 dollars means slightly better
sound, they’re much more comfortable and
you get decent enough active noise cancelation.
And personally I think the Studio3 look better
then the Solo3, I feel the ear cups on the
Solo3 are too small and they look funny on
an adult.
And like I said, the Beats Studio3 do look
cool, just not $350 cool.
But if I was looking for a pair of headphones
to work out in then I would go for the Studio3.
But in my opinion, I feel apple and beats
need to drastically reduce the price of the
Beats Solo3.
I feel that for what they are I think the
Solo3 should be retailing for around $199.99.
cause I truly feel if you pick the solo3 over
the studio3 with only a $50 price difference
you will suffer from buyers remorse down the
road.
But remember, this isn’t a full review on
either of these headphones, I’m just pointing
out the most important differences between
them so I can help you with your purchase
decision.
