start integrating Amazon Alexa into
their cars in 2018 but if you can't
afford a BMW or if you just can't wait
to have Alexa in your car then you could
just get the Garmin speak and since
Americans on average spend 101 minutes
per day driving
I actually think Alexa is more useful in
the car than at home don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe and let's see
if the Garmin speak isn't good first I
just want to point out how small the
Garmin speak actually is it's slightly
smaller than the air pods case it's like
a miniature version of an echo dad with
the built-in GPS on the front you've got
the classic echo ring that lights up
when it's interacting with you there's a
114 by 64 pixel screen on the front two
built-in microphones our speaker on the
back and an action button and a mute
button on the side but although the
Garmin speak is like a miniaturised echo
dot it costs three times as much
retailing for one $49.99 if you want to
pick this up I'll have links to
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best view
possible the Garmin speak also has the
built-in magnetic mount that you can
stick on to your windshield and you can
quickly remove the Garmin speak and
store it if you don't want to risk
having your car broken into the
government speak also comes included
with a power cable that you plug into
your cigarette lighter you power the
Garmin speak through the microUSB port
on the right side and unfortunately it
doesn't have a built in battery and
personally I think the Garmin speaker
would have been much cooler if you
didn't always have to have it plugged in
and here's a protip the Garmin speak can
also be powered by a USB port so you can
use that and use the cigarette lighter
to power something more important in
your car like let's say a radar detector
I like to get directions to the George
Washington Bridge
starting Brownwood garment getting
directions to George Washington Bridge
there are currently three minutes of
delay on her route URL the fastest
wooden should arrive at 5:23 had to
route and turn left
setting up the garments speak is pretty
straightforward you mentor onto your
windshield power it up and download the
garment speak app on your phone and the
app will walk you through the rest of
the setup process after you've paired it
to your phone's Bluetooth you can either
have Alexis speak to you through your
car stereo but you have to have your car
sources that's a Bluetooth or you can
just use the built-in speaker and
personally I prefer to have Alexis speak
to me through the built-in speaker
because that way I can still interact
with Alexa when I'm listening to the
radio but if your car doesn't have
bluetooth you can also just use the aux
jack built into the power cable Alexa
let's play a game okay and personally I
think Alexa is more useful in the car
because when you're stuck in traffic you
can listen to your flesh breathing and
get caught up for the day you can order
stuff straight from your car you can
control your smart home you can check
the weather you can ask for stocks you
can do anything you can at home with
Alexa and the car Alexa what's my
briefing
here's your Flash briefing you can also
get turn-by-turn directions with Garmin
by just saying Alexa get directions to
so-and-so place and the screen on the
front display is easy to see arrows lane
assistance and distances Alexa get
directions to the nearest chick-fil-a
starting route with Garmin getting
directions to chick-fil-a you should
arrive at 556 what I really like is as
you're getting closer to your next turn
or exit you'll notice the green light
rings slowly fill up so you know once
it's filled you better be ready to take
that turn or exit now the screen itself
that displays the arrows is easy to see
all the time but the light ring does get
harder to see winters direct sunlight on
it but when you're not using the Garmin
speak is just as a black puck floating
in front of you
I think would be cool if you could have
the screen displaying the current speed
limit maybe display the time or maybe
even periodically show you upcoming
forecast with traffic updates or maybe
even upcoming events on your calendar
I just feel the Garmin speak isn't being
used to its full potential
but although as getting Alexis to get
directions for you works most of the
time you can also just use their going
to speak app to manually input your
destination and sometimes you have to
because sometimes when you tell Alexa to
navigate to the nearest commercial
storage in or whatever it won't actually
start navigating to the nearest one
which is pretty aggravating the voice
recognition on the Garmin speak is
significantly better than what's on some
cars but it's still not as good as an
actual Amazon echo if you're playing
music and the volume is low you can
still speak to Alexa but there are just
some times that even if you are none
state you speak very loudly and you have
nothing else playing in the car the
guard may speak just doesn't understand
you but overall the Garmin speak does
have a high success rate but it's just
not as good as an actual Amazon echo and
finally the Garmin speak does have some
built in games and honestly it's a
pretty fun party trick if you're tired
of listening to the same ten songs on
the radio then you can pass the time and
exercise your mind by playing one of
these games and honestly I don't know
how many games are actually are because
every time I play
it's always a different one but they are
genuinely fun to play and it's a really
good breath of fresh air from listening
to this paseo all the freaking time
alexa let's play a game okay I knew lots
of games do you want to give categories
game a try
yes Patti you're playing categories game
for instructions say help me or say
start playing start playing
I wrote the letter I this letter is
harder than 60% of all letters first
category is food say the category name
followed by your answer for example food
Apple
food ice cream
ice-cream is correct very good
now think about
animal
animal iguana
it what is correct nice answer do you
think about
name
okay well I couldn't hear the word
please say it again name iris iris is
correct
great could you think of a
TV series in this letter
you can also say I don't know or say
repeat category only six seconds left TV
injustice injustice is correct booyah
so to wrap things up the garment speak
is a glimpse into the future it's only a
matter of time until other voices
citizens find their way into your car
but instead of having to buy a whole car
you can just get this accessory and
being able to maximize your time in
traffic with Alexa helps your day go by
a little smoother for some reason I
always tend to remember I'm running low
on strange things while I mean traffic
and right from there I can order
straight from Amazon the turn-by-turn
directions are super minimal but for me
is just enough I just need to know when
to turn and in which lane that should be
in I don't constantly need a map in my
face but the garment speak isn't without
its problems sometimes you might get the
red ring of death if your phone doesn't
have a good enough LTE connection
sometimes the Garmin speaker randomly
shuts off sometimes when you get into
the car and power up the Garmin speak
Alexa won't speak to use to you either
have to reboot the device or go into the
settings menu in the garment speak out
and switch switch manually a few times
but hopefully those are just software
bugs and they'll eventually get patched
with upcoming software updates the
garment speak isn't 100% perfect but if
you're heavily invested in the Alexa
ecosystem and if the garments speak
decides to cooperate then the garment
speaker really comes in clutch partially
I think Amazon should have an Amazon
echo and gommi speak bundle hey if you
