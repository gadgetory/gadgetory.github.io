new Apple watch Series three and the new
Apple TV 4k but the main source of the
show with the new iPhones and this year
Apple announced a total of three new
phones so what are the key differences
between the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10
and which one is right for you we're
about to find out don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and you can watch
some of my other videos here after
you're done watching this video let's go
over with the iPhone 8 iPhone a plus in
the iPhone 10 have in common all of
these iPhones have wireless charging and
since they are using the Qi standard
they will work with the same wireless
charging pad as Android devices they
both have the same glass front and backs
both iPhone screens have two-tone
technology which is found under new iPad
pros true tone means they both adjust
the ambience of the display relative to
its surroundings giving it a much more
natural and even look and all of these
iPhone screens achieve the same
brightness of around 625 myths all of
these iPhones are also ip67 certified
which means they are dust in a
water-resistant they all have the same
processing power and have the same a 11
Bionic chip from Apple all of the
cameras are 12 megapixels except only
the 8 plus and the iPhone 10 will begin
portrait mode they also all have the new
improved flash all of these iPhones can
shoot in 4k 60 frames per second and
1080p at 240 frames per second which
means to move a 4k video in more
detailed slow motion video but keep in
mind those shooting modes take up a lot
of storage space all of the phones have
the same megapixel front-facing camera
except the iPhone 10 can also take
portrait mode pictures on the front as
well they also all have stereo speakers
a lightning connector on the bottom and
neither one of them have an audio jack
and finally they all have fast charging
30 minutes of Wired charging will give
you 50% battery life but I'm assuming
that's what the wired connection and I'm
not sure if that will also apply with
charging wirelessly the biggest
difference between the iPhone 10 and the
iPhone 8 and 8 plus is obviously the
display the iPhone 10 has set bezels
design and a 5.8 inch screen and a body
that's slightly larger than the standard
iPhone 8 for comparison the iPhone a
plus has a 5.5 inch screen and a larger
body with a bigger footprint so with the
iPhone 10 you get
the benefit of a larger screen but you
should also be able to use it with just
one hand for the most part the iPhone 10
also doesn't have a home button while
the iPhone 8 and 8 plus still do and
share a very similar design layout to
your classic iPhone and since the iPhone
8 does have a home button it still has
touch ID although all these phones have
the same glass fronts and backs the
metal on the sides is different the
iPhone 10 uses stainless steel which is
tougher while the iPhone 8 has aluminum
sides which is a softer metal than
stainless steel so hopefully the iPhone
10 should withstand drops in scuffs
better than the iPhone 8 but you do have
more color options to choose from with
the iPhone 8 the iPhone 8 will come in
space grey silver and gold while the
iPhone 10 will only come in space gray
or silver since the iPhone 10 doesn't
have a home button for touch ID and uses
Apple's in your face ID instead of using
your fingerprints our unlock your phone
or use Apple pay you will now use your
face face ID is supposed to be more
secure than touch ID and will also work
in the dark face ID will only unlock
your phone if you look at it directly
and it will still work even if you put
on glasses change your hair style grow a
beard put on a hat or a scarf age lose
or gain weight face ID is set to be so
secure that it won't even be fooled by a
picture of your face like the Samsung
Note 8 or even a mask Apple will also
not be sending your faces data to the
cloud and all face ID processing and
files will be done and stored locally on
your device which is a good thing for
privacy face ID will also allow apps
like snapchat to create better filters
that go on your face and you can also
make an emojis and emojis are emojis
that recreate your facial expressions so
you can send them to your friends but an
emojis are only available on the iPhone
10 and not on the iPhone 8 but
personally I can't wait to see what else
developers do with the new face ID
technology display technologies on the
iPhones are different the iPhone 10 has
an OLED screen which Apple calls its
super Retina display it will have
infinite contrast ratios and blacker
blacks colors will be more vibrant
thanks to its high dynamic range aka HDR
and the screen is also sharper with the
PPI of 458 pixels
per square inch density for comparison
the iPhone a plus has a retina HD screen
which is still in LCD screen and has a
pixel density of 401 PPI and the iPhone
8 has a screen density of 326 PPI
so although the screens on the iPhone 8
will still look good it won't look as
good as the iPhone 10 although all the
iPhones have the same 12 megapixel
cameras on the back there are some key
differences
for starters both cameras on the iPhone
10 have optical image stabilization
while only the main camera on the iPhone
8 plus has optical image stabilization
which means better stabilized pictures
and videos even when you're zoomed in
with the iPhone 10 the camera sensors on
the iPhone 10 are also slightly larger
and have a lower aperture which means
better quality pictures in low light on
paper the iPhone 10 should take better
pictures than the iPhone 8 plus but the
real question is is the difference
between the two phones really that
noticeable my real life on these devices
is also slightly different although
Apple does state the iPhone 10 has a
better life two hours longer than the
iPhone 7 the battery life on the iPhone
10 is slightly shorter than the iPhone 8
plus but it does seem the iPhone 10 will
have a slightly better battery life than
the standard iPhone 8 which is still
impressive with that 5.8 inch screen so
in order of best battery lines the
iPhone 8 plus should have the longest
battery life followed by the iPhone 10
with a slightly shorter battery life and
the standard iPhone 8 should have to
show its battery life of the three the
standard iPhone 8 64 and 256 gig models
will retail for 699 dollars and eight
hundred $49 respectively while the
iPhone 8 plus 64 and 256 models world
retail for seven hundred ninety nine
dollars and ninety nine dollars
respectively and then there's the iPhone
10 64 gig model which will retail for a
price of 999 dollars in the iPhone 10
256 gig model with a retail price of
1000 $149 and personally if I were
getting the iPhone 10 I would just cough
up the extra $150 for the 256 gig model
because you're getting quadruple to
storage and all that extra storage will
really come in handy with those large
video files shot in 4k 60 frames per
second and it's only natural all of
these new augmented reality apps that
are on the horizon will be pretty large
but at the end of the day the iPhone 10
isn't that big of a difference over the
iPhone 8 you're really paying more for a
different styled phone with a better
screen slightly better cameras and
slightly more premium materials although
face ID doesn't look promising I'm sure
you will still have some growing up to
do like touch ID did when it first came
out and with the iPhone 10 you're also
giving up the home button and for
someone who's been using an iPhone for a
while getting you sitting your gesture
controls might take a while and you
might be potentially getting a shorter
battery life personally I think if
you're a power user you might be better
off with the iPhone 8 plus but that's
still hard to say without a full-on
review and personally I wouldn't be
surprised if Apple announced an iPhone
10 plus variant I'm so used to carrying
around an iPhone 6s plus that I would
love to have an iPhone with the same
size but with the six point four inch
screen comment down below if you want an
iPhone 10 plus as well hey if you
