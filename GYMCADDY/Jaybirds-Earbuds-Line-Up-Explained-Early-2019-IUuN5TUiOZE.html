brand new for 2019.
And besides the truly wireless Jaybird Run,
the rest of Jaybird’s products might seem
like they’re all the same…
But thats not true, there are some key difference
between the Jaybird Tarah, Jaybird X4, and
Jaybird Tarah Pro that you’ll want to take
into consideration before buying your first
pair of Jaybird ear buds.
So today we’re going to break down Jaybird’s
product line and hopefully find out which
ones right for you.
The Jaybird Tarah are jaybird’s budget friendly
entry level model retailing for $99.99.
The Jaybird X4 are an updated version of the
hugely popular Jaybird X3’s and X2’s which
currently retail for $129.99.
The Jaybird Tarah Pro are hands down my most
favorite pair of earbuds Jaybird has ever
put out and retail for $159.99.
And finally theres the Jaybird Run, these
are currently the oldest model of earbuds
in Jaybird’s line up as of Q1 2019 and retail
for $179.99.
If you want to pick any of these earbuds up
I’ll have links in the description down
below.
I suggest you check them out cause you never
know when they’ll go on sale so you’ll
might get lucky.
So as you can obviously tell… the Jaybird
Tarah, X4, and Tarah Pro are all wired bluetooth
earbuds.
They all have a wire connecting the earbuds
to one another and they all have an inline
controller so you can fully control your music.
Where as the Jaybird Run are a pair of truly
wireless earbuds that allow you to go completely
wire free and you get a charging case.
Think of these as sport oriented AirPods.
Pretty basic stuff.
But what makes the Tarah Pro stand out from
from the Tarah and X4 is that it has a fabric
braided cable, so it makes these earbuds feel
more premium and it also makes them more rugged.
Where as both the Tarah and X4’s have soft
touch plastic cables connecting the their
ear buds.
Now the Tarah and X4’s are by no means fragile…
Jaybird’s entire line up is sweat proof,
but you do have more peace of mind throwing
around the Tarah Pro’s in your gym bag.
But now let's talk about fit.
What put Jaybird on the map was its two piece
Ear Fin and Ear Tip fitting system that was
used on all of the X4’s predecessors and
its also used on the Jaybird Run.
You can mix and match Ear Tips and Ear fins
until you find your prefect fit.
And if you want you don’t even have to use
the Ear Fins.
But if we look at the Tarah and Tarah Pro,
they don’t have the same two piece fitting
system like on the X4’s.
Instead they have single ear gels that have
the ear tips and ear fins combined into one.
Personally I don’t mind it one bit, but
the single one piece eargel does hold back
the entry level Tarah’s.
You see, with the Jaybird X4’s if you want
you can wear them in their standard fitting
position or you can rotate the ear fins and
wear them in their over ear position.
And a lot of people like this over ear position
cause it offers a significantly more secure
fit over the standard fitting position.
But since the ear fins on the Tarah’s cant
rotate you can only wear them one way.
Now, even though the Tarah Pro use the same
ear gels as the entry level Tarah… the earbuds
on the Tarah Pro actually rotate so you still
have the option of wearing them in their more
secure over ear position.
So if you’re an endurance or marathon runner
looking for a pair of wireless earbuds that
aren’t going to eventually wiggle out you’re
probably better off going with the X4’s
or Tarah Pro’s cause of that over ear fit
option.
But another thing to take into consideration
is going to be battery life cause its completely
different across the board.
The Jaybird Tarah has the shortest over all
battery life here with an advertised battery
life of just 6 hours.
The X4’s have an advertised battery life
8 hours which is pretty average, and the Jaybird
Tarah Pro have an advertised battery life
of 14 hours which isn’t just industry leading…
its also very impressive given their size.
But the Tarah Pro’s also has some of the
best fast charging out there right now.
If you charge the Tarah Pro’s up for 5 minutes
from a dead battery they’re going to get
you 2 hours of playback time.
Where as both the X4’s and Tarah are only
going to get you one hour of playback time
from a 10 minute charge.
So if you’re looking for a pair of wireless
earbuds with great battery life and fast charging,
then the Tarah Pro is the way to go.
Now when it comes to the battery life on the
Jaybird Run, they have an advertised battery
life of 4 hours of continuous playback time
which is pretty average for truly wireless
earbuds these days.
And the case is able to supply the earbuds
an additional 8 hours of battery life.
So the Jaybird Run have an over all battery
life of 12 hours.
But what really holds the jaybird Run back
for me is their lack of fast charging.
But when it comes to wireless connectivity,
all of jaybird’s wired bluetooth ear buds
have stable connections that don’t cut out
and they’re all decent for watching videos
on your phone cause they all have little latency.
But unfortunately the same cant be said for
the Jaybird Run.
The Jaybird Run do have a lot of latency so
they arent the best for watching videos.
And latency in truly wireless earbuds is pretty
common these days cause they’re still relatively
new technology.
But the one thing you’re not going to have
to sacrifice when choosing between any of
Jaybird’s earbuds is going to be sound quality.
All of jaybird’s earbuds sound great its
what made Jaybird so popular.
all of Jaybird’s earbuds connect to their
App so you can select from pre made EQ’s
or you can make your own so you can make them
sound how ever you want depending on the type
of music you listen to.
If you like to listen to rap and hip hop you
can make them have lot and lots of bass like
the Powerbeats 3 or if you listen to rock
you can make them have an emphasis on the
mids.
And over all, Jaybird has one of the best
and most stable companion apps out there.
But the last thing I want to touch on here
the control buttons on these earbuds.
Like I mentioned earlier, the jaybird Tarah,
X4 and Tarah pro all have inline controllers
and I personally prefer to still use wired
bluetooth ear buds earbuds at the gym cause
their inline controllers give you full control
over your music playback so you don’t have
to touch your phone as much versus truly wireless
earbuds which only give you partial control
over your music playback.
On the Jaybird Run each ear bud has a button,
and through the app you can select from one
the two button layout set ups.
Personally I prefer to use the Alternate controls
cause you can adjust the volume of your music
by pressing once on the left or right earbud
and you can skip forward through your music
by double pressing either ear bud.
But even though the media controllers on the
Jaybird Run are decent I still prefer to just
use a full on inline controller.
And personally I think the inline controllers
found on both Tarah models are better than
the inline controller found on the X4 cause
the raised plus and minus buttons are easier
to tell apart by just touch versus the X4’s
circular buttons.
So over all, the main things to consider when
choosing between Jaybird’s ear buds is going
to be Fit, battery life and price.
The Jaybird run are a very convenient pair
of workout earbuds cause they lose the cord,
but losing the cord means paying a premium,
compromising on battery life, and having to
deal with significant latency which could
suck if you like to watch videos while you’re
jogging on the treadmill.
Personally, I think the Jaybird Tarah pro
are the best wireless earbuds Jaybird has
ever put out and they’re currently one of
the best sports wireless earbuds on the market
right now.
They’re super durable, their battery life
is amazing, they sound great and they have
no connection issues what so ever.
But if you’re looking to save some money,
you’re still better off going with the Jaybird
X4’s rather than the entry level Tarah’s.
Even though the Tarah’s are decent, I think
you’re still better off ponying up the extra
cash cause with the X4’s you get a slightly
longer battery life, you get more fitting
options, and you get a carrying pouch.
Cause another way the entry level Tarah’s
cut costs is by not including a carrying a
pouch like all of the other earbuds here.
So right now, I think you cant go wrong with
picking up either the Jaybird Tarah Pro or
Jaybird X4, cause i think its pretty obvious
the Jaybird Run are currently the next model
to get updated.

Tarah Pro or Jaybird X4 please make sure to
