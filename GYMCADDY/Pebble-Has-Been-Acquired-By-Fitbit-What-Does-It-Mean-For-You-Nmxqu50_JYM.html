reviewing the pebble to SmartWatch but
the news came out that public is now
dead news has come out that Fitbit will
be acquiring key pebble assets like
intellectual property software engineers
and testers if you were to watch star
take like I do then you know this is an
aqua hire but what does this mean for
you well I'll tell you if you recently
bought any pebble product I highly
advise you go back and return it if you
can no longer return your pebble
smartwatch then you should know pebble
has let you out on the cold
pebbles blog post talking about the
buyout states one to one publish support
is no longer available and any pebble
currently out in the wild is no longer
covered by or eligible for warranty
exchange this means your pebble is no
longer under warranty
it also means pebble will no longer will
be putting out any software updates for
any current products you're stuck with
what you have after inspecting pebble
sites you can clearly see there are no
longer selling any product and that's
the right thing to do but other retail
stores like Amazon Best Buy Target and
Walmart are still selling public devices
I highly advise you don't buy any of
these watches pebble was once opposed to
tall for Kickstarter a crowdfunding
startup that actually delivered on his
promises since pebble is no longer
shipping products pebble to backers who
still haven't received their watch won't
be getting one the time to core and time
round which were originally intended to
ship last month and later is scheduled
to ship in January 2017 are completely
canceled pebble death stayed that
backers who haven't received their
watches will be given a refund but
aren't expected to fulfill those refunds
until March 2017
come on pebble Astral's grimy at least
pay those people some interest
if you back to pebble to let me know how
you feel in the comments I'm genuinely
interested but pebble dying isn't a big
blow for the fitness tracker industry
and you shouldn't be mad at Fitbit for
killing them to be honest while I was
working on my pebble to review I
couldn't help but to compare it to the
Fitbit charge to sure the pebble to has
a seven-day battery life is
water-resistant to 30 meters and had a
much larger screen and was $130 compared
to the $150 to charge to goes for but
the build quality software and user
interface were also par at best compared
to other fitness trackers and I know
more competition in the marketplace
means innovation but how much
competition was pebble really putting up
in the first place so if you were
thinking about picking up a pebble
- or any other pebble product for
yourself or as a gift I highly advise
you refrain from buying anything from
pebble at this point if you are truly
interested in buying a fitness tracker
for yourself or for someone else
that I highly recommend you check out
the Fitbit charge 2 or the Fitbit flex 2
links to their reviews are in the
description if you recently bought a
Pebble watch then I say you return it
ASAP I know I am well if you made it
this far and leave us a like it really
