speaker is the Sony GT KX p90 this is
perhaps the largest portable bluetooth
speaker on the market right now
the xb9 t even Dwarfs his little brother
does sony XP 60 so what does the size
difference between these two speakers
mean we're about to find out don't
forget to Like comment and subscribe and
if you want to learn more about the so
many xb6 T type here after you don't
watch this video and there will be a
sound test at the end of this video too
personally I like to group the sony
xba-1 XP 30 and the XP 40 they share
very similar designs and only have
slight performance differences between
them the Sony xb9 t-- currently retails
for for $49.99 in the smaller XP 60
retails for 3 $49.99 that's 100 all the
price difference if you want to pick
either these speakers up I'll have links
in description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best you
possible Sony speakers routinely go on
sale so you might get lucky the Sony xb9
t uses the same materials as the sony XP
60 and the older sony XP 7 the majority
of the body is made out of textured hard
plastic and on the back there's some
wood paneling to our rubber pads on the
bottom and on its side so you can stand
the speaker up right or lay it flat and
there are handles on either side that
make transporting this behemoth of a
speaker just a little easier just like
all other Sony extra bass because the X
being 90 has a metal grille in the front
and a built-in light feature the X being
90 has a height of 29.1 inches a width
of fifteen point nine inches and the
death of sixteen point three inches
anyways in at 36 and a half pounds or
for my international people this speaker
is 0.74 meters by 0.4 meters and it
weighs in at sixteen point five six
kilos and a good chunk of that weight is
due to the rechargeable battery it takes
a big battery to power this Hulk of a
speaker overall the XP 90 is three times
as big and weighs twice as much as the
XP 60 and for those wondering no neither
of these speakers are waterproof so
don't get them wet or else you're gonna
be out good chunk of money speaker setup
on the sony
bigger and different than the Sony XP 60
the Sony XP has you world 180 millimeter
or seven inch woofers and 360 millimeter
or two point three six inch tweeters but
at any given moment you're only using
two of those three tweeters when the
speakers upright you're using the top
two tweeters bowing the speakers laid
flat you're using the two tweeters on
the side the light feature on the Sony
expedient than the one on the XP 60 you
still get the same full color ring
around the speaker and stroll lights on
the top and bottom but the XP 90 also
has multicolored lights that illuminate
the woofers in different colors whereas
on the XP 60 the woofer is only light-up
white and there's also infinity mirrors
built in until the top and bottom over
all the light feature on the XP 90 is a
little more intricate than the one in
the XP 60 on the top of the speakers
you'll see there's your power button
Vulcan troll blinds and thankfully they
added a play/pause button and this is a
big deal because I'm the XP 7 there was
no play pause boy sure if your phone or
the included remote wasn't near you you
couldn't control your music playback and
for those wondering the XP 60 or the XP
90 don't have an included controller and
honestly I don't care
and you'll also find other buttons like
the function by into cycle between your
audio sources and the add and party turn
button you can also use the party chain
button to turn off the light feature by
pressing and holding if you have two
sony xb9 TS you can pair them together
and have them play in stereo mode or if
you have other XB speakers like the XB
30x be 40 or they're slightly smaller XB
60 you can pair up to 10 speakers
together and have them all play in sync
and thankfully stony streamline the
pairing process on the XB 60 and XB 90
all you have to do is press the party
timeline on each speaker and you're done
it's just like JBL speakers a little
further up you'll also see a slit where
you can rest your phone or tablet and
even more up you'll find an NFC touch
point on the back of the speaker you'll
find RCA portion he can daisy chain more
speakers together a USB port and a mic
input but Sony did not include a 3.5
millimeter audio jack which is a bummer
through the USB port you can charge your
own phone and play mp3 WMA and wav files
off of most devices well you can't play
music through the USB port when using an
Apple device so yours
stuck with only a bluetooth connection
but like I said in the past Sony does a
really good job of having a really clear
wireless audio connection on both their
speakers and headphones so personally I
don't really need an audio jack on the
XP 90 but I know for some certain users
it might be a must-have when it comes to
tech specs both the Sony xb9 t + XB 60
are using bluetooth 4.2 and can be
paired up to 3 devices at the same time
and you've got a wireless range over
around 40 feet with direct line-of-sight
on either of them and you also do a
really good job of keeping a solid
connection through multiple walls
concerning battery life sony claims the
XP 90 is good for 16 hours of playback
time and technically that is true if you
use the speaker at a low volume and what
the life feature turned off but real
dual battery life with the sony xba-4
all you Matt a moderate level and what
the life feature turned on I've averaged
about nine hours of playback time which
is two hours more than the real world
battery life of the XP 60 under the same
circumstances but if you play music on
the XP 90 at full volume you'll get
about 4 hours of playback time which is
the same as the XP 60 at full volume so
if you take either of these speakers
somewhere remember to pack the power
cord new to the XP 60 and XP 90 is
stamina mode and basically what it does
is that it reduces the output of the
speakers so there won't be as much space
they won't get as loud in the sound
isn't as crisp but you'll be able to
squeeze out about 2 more hours of
playback time and thankfully Sony got
rid of the place charge feature that was
on the XP 40 and the XP 30 when the
battery on the XP 60 or XP 90 get below
20% it'll simply say please charge and
flash a few times and that's it but it
will no longer nag you to put it back on
the charger or limit the volume like the
XP 40 or dxb 30 and for those wondering
if you press and hold the stamina button
the speaker will tell you its current
battery percentage just like the XP 60
the XP 9 t is all about loudness and
bass there's a lot of sub-base you get a
feeling in your chest and personally I
love it and concerning sound quality
both the x p6 c and xB 90 sound the same
as in the xB 90 doesn't have the widest
soundstage instrument separation isn't
the best and the vocals do tend to get
lost at times but I would still
recommend it for hip-hop and EDM and
that's what Sony's going through with
the speaker but the biggest difference
between the XP 60 and the XP 90 is
obviously going to be loudness and Max
volume the xc60 likes to hover in the
mid 80 decibels range while I max volume
dxb 90 likes to hover in the low to mid
90s range and although it may not seem
like much in person the loudness
difference is very noticeable and that
max volume neither of these two speakers
suffer from too much sound assertion at
all which was an issue with the XP 7
both the Sony XP 90 and xB 60 connect to
Sony's music Center app and like I've
spent the past it only works properly
half the time through the app you can
adjust the EQ of either of these
speakers you can either select from a
few pre-made cues or you can even make
your own or you can just use Sony's
clear Audio plus setting which will
automatically adjust the EQ of the
speakers depending on what you're
listening to and through the Music
Center own app you can also pay from a
few different illumination settings you
can choose from rave chill a rave mode
without the strobe lights Hardware only
reds and oranges will flash cool where
only blues and greens will flash their
strobe and there's also a few calm
options as well you can also use Sony's
yes abou lab to customize the life
feature after you've selected a light
mode so if you want to have the speaker
flash red in strobe mode guessable can
make that happen well like I've said
before I feel Sony's app for the XP 60
and SP 90 she'll look more like the 1000
X 10 to headphones it's cleaner and it's
easier to get to each setting quicker
although the XP 60 and XP 90 don't have
the annoying please charge feature like
the XP 30 and SB 40 both the XP 60 and
xb9 t have a quirk that i hate whenever
you plug either of these speakers to
charge even though they are turned off
the speakers will go into demo mode in
cycle through the light modes so then
you have to wait a few seconds and then
press and hold the party chain bind to
turn off demo mode if I have the
speaker's off I want it completely
turned off I don't know why Sony does
things like this right now I'm standing
about 5 feet away personally I don't
think my
good but it does get the job done but
this audio clip is being recorded by the
market phone on the XP 90 so you can be
there so to wrap things up the Sony xb9
t is a good option if you regularly host
parties although it does have a built in
battery don't expect it to last the
whole length of you get together
especially if you've got it set at max
volume if you're considering either of
these speakers for personal use i would
recommend you go with the sony XP
it's big enough that it gets pretty loud
and there's enough wallis shaking bass
to keep a bass ed happy but it's still
small enough that transporting it to
other places isn't as much of a hassle
as the Sony NEX p90
I think the XP 90 is overkill for
personal use but I think Sony hit gold
with the XP 60 personally I just really
like the Sony XP sexy
and here's the Santa's I'm gonna cycle
through some speakers of the same size
and as always all these speakers will be
playing at the same decibel level
streaming from the same device and at
the same distance away from the same
microphone so hopefully the only
difference is sound quality
[Laughter]
