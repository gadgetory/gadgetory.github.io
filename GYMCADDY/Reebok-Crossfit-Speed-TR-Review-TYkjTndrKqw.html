realizing they aren't the best crafts
issue out there I decided to give the
Reebok CrossFit speed TR try and says
Reebok is now phasing out their nano 6.0
you can really only choose between the
Nano 7 the crossfit speed to your and
across the transition so how do they
stack up let's find out alright let's
talk about price the Reebok rosters
speak to your currently retails for
$99.99 over every box site wild lies the
Nano 7 or retail between 1 $29.99 and
1:45 depending on the colorway and for
good measure the Reebok CrossFit
transition currently retails for one
$19.99 and you can get them in any color
just as long as that color is black what
I'm saying is is that they only come in
black the Reebok CrossFit speeds your on
the other hand come in five different
colorways as always I'll have links in
the description below if you want to
pick either one of these up comment and
tell me which color weight you like that
sort of big problem that a lot of people
have at the Nano 7 is your fit they are
very narrow at the instep of the foot
and even after wearing them for an
extended period of time
they didn't break into well but the Nano
weave upper on the Nano 7 really make
them very durable so the Nano ease is a
double-edged sword the Reebok faster
speeds you're on the other hand do not
use a nano weave upper and are much more
comfortable they have a very tight mesh
upper that make them very lightweight
and breathable just a fair warning
although these shoes are very
comfortable they do tend to fit a little
big so if you want to snug fit you
should go down half a size there are
overlays all around the shoe that help
with durability and the construction of
the shoe the heel counter also does a
very good job of preventing any heels
lift the tongue is also very decently
padded so if you tighten your laces your
feet will still be comfortable
unlike nike shoes although the Reebok
CrossFit CTR shares the same design
elements as the Nano 6.0 there is no
kevlar on the sides of the upper to help
you out with traction when you're rock
climbing it looks like it does but the
pattern is just there for aesthetics
there's also a lot going on with the
sole of the shoe the Reebok cluster
speak to your has a multi-directional
tread pattern on it that does an
extremely good job of providing you with
traction the speedster also has a rope
roll on the middle portion of the shoe
like the nano 6.0 but it's much smaller
by comparison and since it's so small it
really doesn't provide too much traction
when rope climbing compared to other
shoes the 4 foot section of the shoe
does have one large flexible for
flexibility but the soul is still fairly
stiff and nonetheless overall the sole
on the speed-pr doesn't compress too
much and the majority of the padding
comes from the very soft Enzo
the classic big TR also has the TPU here
clip on the back of the shoe is a much
smaller and less pronounced at the heel
clips out on the neck are two or three
but it still does a good job of allowing
your feet to glide on a wall if you're
doing handstand push-ups as the name
implies the Reebok rafters speak to your
performance very well in a WOD with lot
of speed rolls and moderate weight
lifter the midsole gives you enough
padding so you can do runs and Springs
comfortably and the outsole gives you
ample amount of traction the Reebok
process speed TR also has a flared out
Mitchell design so that you have a large
and stable platform to push off of when
you weight lifts the only issue I found
this shoe was getting enough lockdown
when I needed it since this shoe runs a
little big and like other Reebok shoes
has a large toe box going down half the
size is a good idea overall since the
Nano 7 aren't for everyone because of
the narrow fit or hard midsole the
Reebok CrossFit feature is a great
alternative if you want to stay within
the Reebok product line for $100 or a
great deal considering what you're
getting these shoes would really shoot
you if you do a lot of wads or circuit
training that really doesn't involve too
much heavy weight lifting hey if you
