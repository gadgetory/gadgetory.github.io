announce two new QC 45 ANC headphones
Bose has been pretty busy lately
releasing some pretty out of the box
products there's the noise masking sleep
pods boses new frames which are
sunglasses with built-in speakers which
are supposed to deliver a
first-of-its-kind a or experience and
this the bose home speaker 500 now I'm
gonna be honest I didn't expect to like
the smart speaker as much as I did and
it sounds very impressive for its small
size but what isn't small is this
speaker's price tag at $400 the boat
home speaker 500 is one of the most
expensive Amazon flex enabled speakers
out there not including TV sound bars
but if you want to pick this speaker up
I'll have links or description down
below both is obviously aiming for a
more mature affluent crowd looking for
all good-looking Amazon up its a speaker
to use in their home and thanks to this
speaker's small sized rounded design and
aluminum body
I think this because gonna look great in
almost any room you place it just like
Bose does sound like revolve speakers
the 500 has milled holes going all
around the body and there are control
buttons up top now I really like the
fact that Bose was smart enough to
include a full set of physical media
control buttons on their new smart
speaker with a lot of older smart
speakers whether they were team Elissa
or team bool you were sometimes forced
to use voice commands cazzo speakers
just didn't come with something as
simple as a physical play pause button
but thankfully that's not the case here
if you want you can ask Alexa to control
you music playback or you can do so
manually with the control buttons up top
and even though this might seem basic or
obvious it's one of those small things
you miss when you don't have it anymore
there's also a physical button up top to
invoke Allison there's a button to mute
the mics and there are physical by
Institute switch between your wired or
Bluetooth audio sources Bose even gives
you 6 programmable buttons that you can
adjust through their Bose music app you
can listen to podcasts through services
like 2 and
or you can have specific radio stations
or playlists set up through services
like Amazon music Spotify Pandora or
Deezer the only complaint I have about
BOCES buttons is that they're too smooth
at which the icons had a bit of a rate
structure to them but another complaint
I have about the 500 is the screen on
the front first off it's an LCD screen
that strictly used to show you the album
art or thumbnail of anything you're
listening to and whenever the speaker
isn't in use it'll display the time but
unfortunately the screen doesn't look
nearly as good as the marketing material
makes it out to be and it looks like
bows I don't get the memo that screens
are going basalis now but all of that is
forgiven when it comes to this speakers
sound quality the 500 has a dual speaker
setup that shoots out its sides so
sounds gonna bounce off the walls and
create a 360-degree listening experience
but the tiny bows 500 sounds so big it
has no problem keeping up a larger
speakers like the Marshall stand more -
and even the JBL boombox
now we're gonna jump into a sound test
for the sake of fairness since the Bose
500 and stand more - or both large
speakers the boombox is also going to be
playing well plugged in because it does
increase its output
so like I said sound quality wise the
500 sounds very very impressive for its
compact size it's able to keep up with
considerably larger speakers without any
problems
clarity and soundstage on the 500 is
very good but I can't help but notice
instrument separation is a little better
on the boom box but that is expected
because the boom box does have more
hardware going for its compared to the
500 but what really blew me away about
the 500 is the amount of base the
speaker puts out the 500 is half the
size of both the Stanmore and boom box
but it still manages to put out just as
much wall shaking base and you can
adjust the speaker space and trouble
through buzzes music app and again don't
let the speaker's small size fool you
because when it comes to max volume the
speaker also gets just as loud as these
other two larger speakers so overall I'm
very impressed by the sound that comes
out of this relatively small speaker and
I really like it a lot
but if you're considering picking the
speaker up there are a few things you
should know especially if you're already
heavily invested in Aladdin or boses
speaker ecosystem the 500 is part of
boses new smart speaker lineup that all
have Alessa built-in if you want a pro
multiple speakers together you can only
do so from boses new lineup of smart
speakers and sound bars but you can't
pair the 500 to older sound touch or
sounding speakers so for example if you
have a Bose Soundlink revolve plus you
can't pair that speaker to the 500 or if
you have a Bose soundTouch dartium you
can't spare that speaker to the 500 even
though this does suck it's pretty common
for smart speakers these days but
unfortunately the 500 also won't play in
sync with other enabled speakers which
is honestly very disappointing and I
hope they fix this with a software
update in the future and send some
critique in the 500 right now I thought
I would also mentioned that I would have
liked if it had a USB C port on the back
next to the aux jack I just feel that
home speakers like these should have a
USBC
out port so you can have the
option to charge your phone because
again it's one of those small things you
miss when you don't have it anymore and
I really appreciate it when other
speakers do have them but overall I'm
very impressed by the Bose home speaker
500 even though it has a very small
footprint the amount of sound coming out
of this little speaker is truly
impressive and not to mention it's
aluminum body makes it look really good
I just wish Bose had to use a better
quality screen to compliment the rest of
the speaker it's obvious Bose as
targeting an affluent crowd with the
speaker and if you've got the money to
spend I don't think the speaker will
disappoint just remember if you're
already heavily invested in boses eco
system then the 500 or won't work with
older speakers if you made it this far
