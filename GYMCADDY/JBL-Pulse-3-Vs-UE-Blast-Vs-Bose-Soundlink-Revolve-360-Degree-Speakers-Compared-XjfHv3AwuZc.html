evenly fill a room of music and the JBL
pulls 3ue blasted bose soundlink revolve
or three very popular options right now
that all cost about the same but they
all have very different designs very
different features and they all produced
at 360 degree sound in very different
ways don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and you can watch some when
the video is here after you're done
watching this video
the ue blast is the most expensive
advanced and rugged speaker in this
group it currently retails for $230 and
it comes in 4 colorways red blue black
or white the Bose Soundlink revolve is
the smallest and classiest speaker in
this group any retails for $200 and it
only comes in two colorways black or
silver and the JBL pulls three is the
coolest speaker cuz come on has a
built-in light show and it also retails
for $200 but also usually goes on sale
if you want to pick either of these
speakers up I'll have links to
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deal
possible now remember this isn't a full
review on either of these speakers I'm
just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with your purchase decision
if you want to watch the full reviews
search the channel or tap the icon on
the top right like I mentioned earlier
all three of these speakers are
360-degree speakers but they all have
very different speaker setups the
bosonic revolve is the smallest speaker
here but don't let its size fool you it
has dual passive radiators one downward
facing full-range transducer and then
acoustic deflector which are all
vertically stacked the UE blast is
rocking two thirty-five millimeter
drivers and two 81 millimeter by thirty
nine millimeter rectangular passive
radiators which were all housed
internally and the JBL pulls three has
340 millimeter drivers one at the zero
120 and 240 degree mark and two exposed
passive radiators one on each side now
it's important to keep in mind even
though the JBL post three is the largest
speaker in this group almost all of its
sound it's coming from the bottom
portion of the speaker what the fabric
is and as you'd expect all three of
these speakers sound and perform very
differently
I personally think that you eblasts is
the worst seven speaker in this group
even though it has the most thumping
bass and I guess the loudest it has very
we close at mid and ear piercing highs
the sound isn't as detailed or as rich
as these other two speakers and there's
very little instrument separation the
Bose Soundlink revolve gets the least
loudest in this group and it really
likes to push the mids and vocals
forward just like his big brother the
Bose sound like revolve it has some
really good performing lows but not so
much thumping bass it sounds good but
it's not the best for people who really
like bass heavy music instrument
separation is much better than the UE
blast and the highs are much more tamed
as well and the JBL post 3 has the most
even sound signature in this group but
it also has the most treble which is
pretty common for JBL speakers the lows
and mids or almost as good of the bose
but it does have a little more thumping
space the highs are a little brighter
than the Bose as well in general I
prefer the 7 to JBL post 3 it's an
overall good performer for most music
genres regarding battery life on the JBL
post 3 it really matters on how you use
it if you play music at max volume and
with an intensive light feature mode set
at full brightness then you'll be lucky
if you get 6 hours of battery life but
if you play music on the post 3 out of
moderate volume with a less intensive
light mode like jet set at a lower
brightness then you'll get a battery
life of around 15 hours so at least I
have the battery life on the UE blast is
pretty average even with Alexa turned
off and it not being connected to Wi-Fi
I'll go into that in a minute
the UE blast is good for about 8 hours
so playback time atom moderately to high
volume and the bosonic revolve is good
for about 11 hours of playback time from
a single charge
not bad given its size and all three of
these speakers also charge via a micro
USB cable but I do want to point out to
you eat blast doesn't have an ass jack
whereas the bows in JBL do so with the
UE blast you can only stream music over
Wi-Fi from select streaming services or
via bluetooth from your own device
whereas with the post 3 you can still
use a wired connection if you want to
instead of just relying on Bluetooth and
the bose sound we provoke lets you
listen to music via bluetooth the aux
jack or you can even get a wired
connection through its microUSB port all
three of these speakers
ah afraid of a little water either the
Bose Soundlink revolve is ipx4 rated so
we can get wet without any problems
but you should not submerge it
underwater the jb upholstery is ipx7
certified so it's fully waterproof down
to one meter of water for 30 minutes and
it even floats but even though the JBL
pole story is fairly rugged if you drop
it or bump it against something you do
risk
retching or even cracking the acrylic
top whereas the ue blast is the most
rugged rock in an ip67 rating which
means it's both water and dust proof so
the blast can really take more of a
beating than the other two speakers the
ue blast also has the longest Bluetooth
range in the group of about 120 feet
whereas the poster II has a Bluetooth
range of around 70 feet and the bose has
a range of about 40 feet but the ue
blast can only be paired to one device
at a time whereas the JBL and bose can
be paired to two devices at the same
time which makes switching from one
device to another super easy something
you can't do on the blast what really
makes the ue blast stand out it's a
deluxe a voice integration after you've
connected the blast to your home Wi-Fi
network and sign in to your Amazon
account the blast will work just like an
echo dot or standard echo Alexa what's
the weather like in New York City today
you can look for mostly sunny weather
with a high of 38 degrees in a low of 24
degrees where you can also only control
your music playback by asking Alexa and
it's important to keep in mind the Alexa
voice commands will only work if you're
using one of the supported music
streaming services and if the speaker is
connected to Wi-Fi and I've been very
vocal about this in past videos but the
blast and mega blast not having a manual
way to pause or skip a track is very
annoying or just sometimes we're being
able to manually control your music
playback is the most convenient I just
don't understand why you even just add
all multi-purpose button on top coz the
blast over-reliance and Alexa can be a
burden for people who don't use Alexa
don't have a stable Wi-Fi connection or
who don't use one of the supported
streaming services because both the Bose
Soundlink revolve and JBL pulse relay
you fully control your music playback
straight from the speaker itself and on
that note the Bose has some really well
laid out concave buttons that make it
really easy to know which buttons you're
pressing just by touch whereas all of
the buttons on the JBL post 3 or flat so
you never really know what your press
without looking I just wish the blinds
up to JB ' were raised but what really
makes the JBL post three standout it is
360 degree light feature it's the best
out there you can control it directly
from the speaker itself or you can also
control it from the JBL connect that and
you have several light modes to choose
from there's wave jet fireworks
equalizer rave rainbow campfire and you
can even make your own and if you want
you can even change the color by using
your phone's camera or the color wheel
just keep in mind the light feature
doesn't do too well with direct sunlight
so if you do decide to use the speaker
outside just turn the light feature off
by pressing and holding the light button
on the back that way you'll save a
little battery life you're welcome and
finally let's talk about chaining these
speakers together to other speakers as
right now the UE blast cannot be chained
to any other UE speakers or whatsoever
which is a bummer because that's a
pretty standard feature these days the
JBL post we can be paired to other JBL
speakers using JBL connect plus like
another post three thoughful afford the
JBL boom box and now the JBL charge 3
thanks to a for more update but the post
we cannot be paired to all the JBL
devices using the older JBL connect but
using JBL connect plus is super easy you
literally press one button on each
speaker and you're done you can chain up
to 100 JBL speakers together but if you
want to get left and right stereo audio
going you need to pair two of the same
JBL speakers together whereas the bose
sound look revolve lets you get left and
right stereo audio with almost any to
both speakers that are paired together
but I do have to admit the pairing
process on the Bose speakers isn't as
seamless as JBL speakers it doesn't
always work on the first try and it does
take a little longer personally my
favorite speaker in this group is going
to obviously be the JBL pulse 3 because
of the light feature but with the light
feature aside I still prefer the JBL
post 3 because of how it sounds like I
said earlier the ue blast has some
really weak laws and mids and the sound
isn't as rich or as detailed as these
other speakers do you weight blasters
really only worth getting if you're
heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem
the Bose Soundlink revolve sounds really
good for its size and it's a good
sounding speaker in general I just
personally don't like how it pushes the
vocals so forward but some people like
that if you're looking for a small solo
speaker you can't go wrong with the Bose
Soundlink revolve but personally I
prefer the JBL post 3 because you're
getting so much for the same price as
the other two speakers
you're getting good sound and an amazing
life feature but remember this isn't a
full review on either of these speakers

important differences between them so I
