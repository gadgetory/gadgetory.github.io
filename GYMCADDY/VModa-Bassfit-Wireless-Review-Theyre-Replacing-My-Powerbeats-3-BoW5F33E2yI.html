for their V motocross V 2 wireless
headphones and for the longest time
v-moda has been trying to establish
themselves as that cool audiophile brand
so that's why I was a little surprised
when v-moda announced their new v-moda
base Fit Wireless their first wireless
headphones for the gym and for the first
tribe I think they did pretty good and
besides some minor nitpicks
I personally really liked these new
headphones but first a word from one of
our partners before I started using nor
VPN I would never use public Wi-Fi cuz I
didn't want to risk having my data
exposed which meant any time I traveled
or was in a dead zone in the city I
would have little to no internet on my
phone but now with no one VPNs
military-grade encryption I can use
public Wi-Fi and know that my dad it is
safe from would be hackers Nord VPN can
do a lot more but this is one of the
main reasons I use them see how you can
enjoy three years of online security for
only $2.99 a month by clicking on the
link in description down below
partially I still prefer to use a wire
to Bluetooth headphones at the gym
instead of truly wireless earbuds
because they typically cost less they
fit better they perform all-around
better and you still get to keep your
inline controller she can easily and
quickly adjust and skip through your
music without having to wait for your
phone as often when you're working out
like I mentioned in the past I really
like and recommend the power beats three
and J products for but I only recommend
picking up the power of these three if
you get them on sale for about $130 or
less versus their a typical retail price
of $200 and for comparison the J Brax
fours have a retail price of $130 and so
do the new V motor basements if you want
to pick either of these headphones up or
have links to description below and if
you're using links really upsets Channel
first let's go over what comes in the
box the v-moda based fit come included
with a highly preferred a carrying pouch
which i think looks pretty cool they
also come included with a whole lot of
accessories they come with a total of
eight pairs of ear tips which i think is
over killed they come with three pairs
of ear fins and they only come with one
pair of ear hooks now that you know
because on the base fits are removable
and will
the parents of this in a minute but I do
wish we got a second pair of your hooks
cuz to be frank
they are pretty stiff compared to the
ear hooks found on the powerbase 3 so
just in case for some reason they snap
wear out or even get lost I would like
to have a backup pair just in case
instead of having eight pairs of ear
tips but one of the major knit picks I
have about the base fit ears their lack
of the USBC I'm still using micro USB
and given that one plus was able to use
USB see under $70 bullet wireless
headphones which are amazing by the way
I think more companies in general need
to start using USB see even under
cheaper products now that is 2019 but
now let's talk about fifth because this
perhaps the most interesting and unique
thing about these headphones now
personally I prefer to have ear hooks on
my headphones than just your fins that's
the main reason why I like the power
beats so much
besides the w1 chip and even though the
jab relaxed for sound great and/or
all-around good some people just can't
use them because your fins don't work
for them but with the bass fit you can
have both and then some if you just want
to use it your friends you can do that
or if you just want to use it your hooks
you can also do that or if you want you
can also use it your fins and your hooks
at the same time and personally I didn't
expect to like this try fit design so
much out of all the sports wireless
earbuds I've ever used I don't think any
of them have been as secure as the
basement but I do want to put a few
things out the ear fins that come
included with the bass fit are flexible
and they're comfortable and they're just
as comfortable as Jaybirds your fins but
that your hooks that come included with
the bass fit or a lot stiffer than that
your hooks found on the power baits so
they're not as comfortable but once you
adjust them to your liking you'll be
fine we're going tech specs v-moda
advertises an 11 hour battery life on
their bass fit Wireless and I've been
able to go four to five workouts in
between charge of these headphones which
is the same as the power of these three
will usually last me and it's a little
better than the jaybird x4 and the bass
fit Wireless also have fast charging
will they'll get you two and a half
hours of playback time from a 15 minute
charge from a dead battery which is also
pretty similar to the fast charging on
the power
three and is significantly better than
the fast-charging on the G products for
and when it comes to Bluetooth the base
virtual rocking Bluetooth or not - they
have abducts support which is good for
Android users they can be connected to
two devices at the same time and if
you're an iPhone user these are good for
watching videos while you're on the
treadmill cuz they have very little
latency but when it comes to their
Bluetooth range you definitely want to
keep your phone nearby these are a hard
stop at 30 feet and if you get any
workout equipment between you and your
phone then you're gonna start hearing
some stuttering
but when it comes to their sound quality
the v-moda bass fit sound and perform
very similarly to the power beats 3 they
have an emphasis on the bass but more
importantly the highs don't get tinny or
blown out and just a heads up these
headphones also get a little other than
the power beats 3 and significantly
louder than the x-force and I personally
think they sound perfectly fine for
workout headphones and I like having a
lot of bass in my music when I workout
but unlike the jaybird X fours the baits
fit don't have an app or adjustable EQ
so if you're someone who likes to have
direct control over their headphones
sound signature you're still better off
just picking something up from jeepers
lineup it's kind of like their special
sauce and like I mentioned earlier one
of the biggest reasons why I still
prefer to use Y Bluetooth earbuds at the
gym over truly wireless earbuds
is because of the inline controller and
the inlet controller on the base Fitz
has the same setup as the one found on
the power beats you've got your volume
up in volume down lines and there's a
multi-purpose button in the center press
once to player pause that will press the
skipper track and triple press to go
back a track and the center button also
acts as a power on button
but another nitpick I have about these
headphones is the way you turn them off
you have to press and hold the setup
button down for five seconds to power
these headphones off but overall I think
the v-moda base pair Wireless are a very
decent pair of workout headphones it's
obvious v-moda tried to copy the power
beats three but added their own touch
with their new traffic design
magnetically attaching your buds and
they even threw in a tech support for
the Android users I think the base fits
are adequately priced at $130 but if
they go on sale in the future then there
are even easier to justify the only
thing I wish the base if it had was USB
see
but either way the base fit will be
added to my stable of favorite workout
Bluetooth earbuds if you made it this
far I guess you enjoyed the video so hit
that like button and get subscribed it
helps out more than you realize
