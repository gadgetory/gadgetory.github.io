are finally here instead of being called
the bose QC 45 is like everybody
expected them to be called they're
actually called the bose noise-canceling
headphones 700 now we can argue about
how great or bad that name is but
there's a whole bunch of other stuff to
talk about here now boses new headphones
have been redesigned from the inside out
namely they look nothing like the
current bose qc25 now i'm going to
reserve a final judgement until I
actually see the bose noise-canceling
headphones 700 you know that name just
rolls off the tongue I'm gonna reserve
judgment until I actually see them in
person because who knows maybe they look
a lot better in person than they do in
pictures let's say for example I'm a car
guy when I first saw the McLaren Simon
20s on the computer I thought my god
that's an ugly looking car but then when
I saw it in person I thought my god this
car is beautiful
so maybe the bose noise-canceling
headphones 700 might have the same
effect so again I'm going to reserve
final judgement when it comes to the
design of boses new headphones but from
an objective standpoint it looks like
they still have those super spacious ear
cups that have been super popular with
people on the bose qc25 but again
objectively it looks like this new
design isn't going to allow you to
collapse your headphones down like you
can with the Bose qc3 5s or there's Sony
1000 X and 3 you're only gonna be able
to leave them lay them down flat now
this isn't a huge deal but it's also
going to mean that the carrying case
that comes included with the bose
noise-canceling headphones 700 is going
to have a lot more surface area than the
carrying cases that come included with
the bose qc25 or there's sony 1000 XM
threes now the other thing that I want
to talk about here is that the bose
noise-canceling headphones 700 again
it's a great name these headphones are
going to be going for four hundred
dollars and they're going to be released
out in June now bose going up in prices
does have me a little concerned because
they're probably going to be given away
market share
to their competitors namely the Sony
1000x and threes now when Sony first
released their Sony 1000x is the
original ones they were going for $400
whereas the Bose QC 3/5 is the original
ones were going for $350 but then when
Sony released or refresh 1000 X and twos
which is what I have here they chopped
the price down to 350 and when they
released them threes they kept the price
at 350 so again I am a little concerned
that Bose might be giving away a little
bit of market share when it comes to
their headphones but maybe this will
might mean that their build quality is
going to get even better which honestly
boses headphones the most QC 35 s have
great build quality all around but again
like I said I am going to be reserving
final judgement when it comes to the
design of the bose noise-canceling
headphones at 700 until I actually see
them in person but comment down below
I'm sure you guys are gonna let me know
what you guys think about the new looks
of these new headphones alright but with
simple stuff out of the way like design
and price let's get into tech specs now
thankfully these new headphones have
been upgraded to USBC which i think is
long overdue because i personally think
the bose qc25 series 2 should have had
USBC but unfortunately it looks like
these new headphones are still rocking a
20 hour battery life
now since the headphone market is
currently heating up a lot of other
manufacturers are starting to
differentiate each other through their
battery life the 1000x and 3's have a 30
hour battery life and the new job relate
85 h's have a 36 hour battery life and
even sony's new wh XP 900 n which go for
$250 have a 30 hour battery life so
personally I think that's seeing a 20
hour battery life on the bose
noise-canceling headphones 700 is a
little weak personally I would have
liked the seen boses new flagship
headphones have a battery life in the 30
hour range or at the very least have a
25 hour battery life but with battery
life out of the way one of the main
things Bose is really trying to drive
home is that they've improved
they are ANC technology now like I've
said in a few videos the ANC technology
on the bose qc25 is pretty dated
compared to a lot of other headphones
out there namely there's a lot of cabin
pressure on these headphones whenever I
wear these headphones I can't wear them
for more than 10 minutes before they
give me a headache now I know that might
not be the case for everybody but it is
for me so definitely one of the first
things we got to check out when we get
boses new headphones is to see if they
fix the cabin pressure issue but unlike
the active noise cancellation on the
bose qc25 where you can only choose from
high-low or off the anc on boses new
headphones have 11 steps to choose from
so you're gonna be able to have more
customization options over your ANC on
the new bose noise-canceling headphones
700 i'm getting better
just like on the anc on the 1,000 XM
threes and just like the 1000 X and
threes both new headphones now have a
conversation feature so this is going to
be very similar to quick attention on
the 1000 XM threes where if you flick or
press or do something on the headphones
they're gonna pause your music and pump
in all the ambient sound around you so
you can have a short conversation with
someone like let's say if you're at a
cashier if you're gonna get a new change
or if you're making an order it's gonna
be great for that but again
unfortunately like the 1000 X m3s
have a bose noise-canceling headphones
700 again I'm getting better they now
have a touchpad now personally I don't
mind that the new Bose headphones happy
touchpad but I do think it would have
been in boses best interests to keep
their physical control buttons like the
on the bose qc25 because some people
just don't want to deal with having a
touchpad on their headphones and for
some very casual users when it comes to
choosing between the Bose qc3 5s and the
Sony 1000 X and 3's I wouldn't be
surprised some people went with the Bose
just because they had physical control
buttons
unlike the surface headphones which have
a touchpad but continuing down the line
of features the bose noise-canceling
headphones 700 still have both google
assistant and also support just like on
the bose QC three 5s and they also have
Bose AR now if you don't know what Bose
AR
I did do a quick little video on that
feature which you can click or tap right
over here to check that out now in short
both AR is still very much in its
infancy so don't go picking up both a
new headphones thinking that Bose AR is
this new wonderful feature that you just
gotta have it's still very much in its
infancy but the bose noise-canceling
headphones 700 aren't the only new
product Bose announced today they also
announced their new bose earbuds of 500
and the bose noise-canceling 700 year
but what are they called what are you
hold on the bose earbuds 500 and the
bose noise-canceling earbuds 700 these
names are amazing so if a bose earbuds
of 500 or do out later this year in late
2019 and if the bose noise-canceling
earbuds 700 or do out in 2020 so again I
don't I don't know what's up with the
Bose is a new naming scheme but with
size telling us that they're coming they
have an unannounced and official price
but if I were to bet I'm willing to bet
that the Bose are noise canceling
earbuds 700 will be going for you know
what $350 and the Bose earbuds 500 are
gonna be going for $250 but now that the
bose noise-canceling headphones 700 are
official let's start a new rumor now
just looking at the new naming scheme
with the bose noise-canceling earbud 700
and the bose earbuds 500 i'm starting to
wonder if there's going to be a cheaper
on version called avi bose
noise-canceling headphones 500 or maybe
they won't have noise cancellation and
they'll just be called the Bose
headphones 500 the statement scheme is
so simple but in all seriousness I do
think it's pretty important for both to
have a cheaper entry-level model because
right now if they're bose
noise-canceling headphones 700 are gonna
be going for $700 so I think they're
going to need something to be slotted
around the 200 or 250 dollar range so I
think having a bose noise-canceling
headphones 500 and on-ear version would
be pretty smart on boses part and
besides right now we have the bose qc25
which are $350 and
the Bose Soundlink 25 I think that's
what they're called they haven't been
upgraded in a year so those are
definitely due to be replaced but like I
mentioned earlier the Bose earbuds 500
or do out in late 2009 teen and the bose
noise-canceling earbud 700 or do out in
2020 but right now all eyes are on the
bows of noise cancelling headphones 700
which are gonna be out on June 20th and
they're currently available for
pre-order and they're gonna be going for
the hefty hefty price of $400 so comment
