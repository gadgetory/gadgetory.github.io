would be a good idea to announce a whole
bunch of new products today after the
season finale of Game of Thrones but
flippy just announced their new Fitbit
ionics more watts their first pair of
wireless earphones the Fitbit flyer and
the new Aria - smart scale and I started
to wonder how will flip is a new
SmartWatch and wireless earphones
compared to the direct competitors of
the Apple watch series - and the J Brand
X 3 don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and comment down below if
you're interested in either fitbit's new
products or comment down below with your
favorite part of Game of Thrones season
7 okay
Fitbit ionic this thing has been leaked
so many times that it was only a matter
of time they finally announced it this
is basically a much better looking
Fitbit blaze with the touch screen LCD
on the front that will get significantly
brighter so it's easier to see in direct
sunlight to start is going to come in
three different colorways charcoal and
smoke gray select blue and burnt orange
and blue gray and silver gray the Fitbit
ionic has quick release pants and is
going to retails for 299 95 the Fitbit
ionic is going to come included with
your classic fix silicon wristband but
you will also be able to get or perform
the sport band for 2995 or perforated
leather band for 59.95 and just like how
Apple teamed up with Nike to release a
Nike edition of the Apple watch
Fitbit teamed up with Adidas or added s
depending on where you're from to bring
you an adidas edition Fitbit ionic I'm
guessing it's going to have an exclusive
wristband and some extra software or
skins now I'm gonna run down the tech
specs and new features that really
matter first orders is supposed to have
a multi-day battery life of four days
and a GPS battery life of 10 hours
speaking of GPS it has a built-in GPS
you can go running without your phone
the Fitbit ionic can also store 300
songs and peer directly to your wireless
earphones via bluetooth for that oh and
the Fitbit ionic can also play music
from Pandora the Fitbit ionic is also
using a new heart rate monitoring sensor
they are calling the try way color
sensor it basically uses a combination
of red green and infrared lights to
detect your heart rate and it's water
resistant up to 50 meters so you can go
swimming with it and it will track your
laps the fit that ionic will also play
nice with most mobile devices so if
you're using an iPhone Android
or windows phone they should be able to
work just fine Fitbit will also be
launching an app store so you can
download third-party apps and you watch
faces to the Fitbit ionic and it also
has a built-in NFC chip so you can do
payments straight from your wrist and
just like any other SmartWatch you will
be able to get phone notifications and
do certain tasks straight from your
wrist and just like other Fitbit devices
the Fitbit onic will pair to Fitbit
mobile app which is arguably the best
and simplest fitness tracking app on the
market and those wondering as right now
it seems like the Fitbit ionic won't
have wireless charging let's talk about
the Fitbit fliers
I did not see these coming but these are
fitbit's first wireless earphones
they're going to come in two colorways
lunar gray and nightfall blue and
they're going to retail for one twenty
nine ninety five they're pretty standard
when it comes to sport wireless
earphones they're going to be sweat
proof and they're going to come with
multiple pairs of ear tips wings and
fins they're going to have a six hour
battery life and they're supposed to be
very low profile so you can wear them
even when you have a helmet on and
they're supposed to have a quick
charging feature so 15 minutes of
charging should get you an hour of
playback but the fifty Flyers sound like
a direct copy of the J Brand X 3 which
cost the same routinely go on sale on
Amazon for $99 and looking at the specs
to j-bird x3 already have a leg up
because they have an eight hour battery
life while the Fitbit Flyers have a six
hour battery life sure the Fitbit Flyers
claim they have superior components and
superior sound quality whatever company
does the Fitbit flyer is just another
entry to a highly saturated market on
wireless earphones reading off the spec
sheet isn't going to help you make a
purchase decision so keep an eye out for
a jaybird x3 versus a Fitbit flyer
versus video in the future if the fitbit
flyer had a built-in heart rate monitor
like the JBL Under Armor Wireless sport
heart rate i would have been very
impressed I really liked those earphones
but they didn't sound too good
and they really need a better name now
is the Fitbit ionic going to be an Apple
watch killer no I think the Fitbit ionic
is going to be a better SmartWatch
option for fitness focused people or
people who already heavily invested into
the Fitbit ecosystem I
just want to see if Fitbit acquiring
pebble paid off and right now the Fitbit
ionic is cheaper than the 38 millimeter
Apple watch series too but that could
change after Apple's keynote in
September they could announce an Apple
watch Series 3 and put the Apple watch
series 2 on sale for lesson 2 Fitbit
ionic everything Fitbit announced should
start shipping in October and is already
up for pre-order but personally I would
have run out and make a pre-order just
yet we've got apples keynote to look
forward to and the IFA convention in
Europe is about to kick off so we can
see announcements from the likes of
Samsung Sony and LG but comment down
below is the Fitbit ionic your perfect
fit bits SmartWatch or what would you
