unboxing and first impressions video on
the brand-new Sony WH xB 900 M now for
the last few months I've been saying
that Sony was probably going to be
upgrading their XP 950 and one extra
bass headphones and they're here on twos
which are a pair of anc headphones that
are slotted below everybody's favorite
1000x and threes but the xB 900 ends
design-wise is what happens if the xB
950 and ones in here on twos were to
wear the Patara earrings and personally
I absolutely love how these new
headphones look Sony has gotten rid of
their super bulky industrial design and
has instead gone with this new
minimalist design similar to what we
first saw on the 1000x and threes now
even though the XP 900 ends look very
similar to the 1000 X and threes there
are some build quality differences I've
noticed already now first off the
plastic on the XP 900 ends is textured
instead of all smooth like on the 1000 X
and 3s and on like the 1000 X and 3s
whose ear cups have soft touch material
on them the ear cups on the XP 900 ends
is all plastic as well but more
importantly one of the biggest
differences I've already noticed about
these $250 headphones is that the
leather add on them feels much better
than the leather at use on the 1000 X
and threes now like I mentioned in my
1000 X m4 video a few months ago one of
my biggest complaints about the m3s is
that the leather on them
feels very plastic II even after almost
a year of heavy usage so right now I
can't help but notice that the
leatherette on these $250 headphones
feels slightly bad
then the leatherette on the $350 1000x
and threes and that's not a bad thing at
all but the XP 900 ends do have some
similar looking ear pads to the 1000 X
and threes at a glance they definitely
look more spacious than the ear pads on
the XP 950 n ones but they will look as
spacious as the ear pads on the here on
to switch honestly isn't a big deal
because to me the here on shoes were
always a bit oversized at the bose qc25
but that's not a problem so I'm actually
gonna put these headphones on for the
first time right now because who knows
maybe these headphones are more
comfortable than the 1000 X and 3's
maybe sony has reworked their ear pads
and maybe we can see these reworked ear
pads on the 1000 X and for is if they do
come out in August so anyway here we go
here we go first time on these are more
spacious than the 1000 X and threes
these are way more okay hold on these
are way more spacious than the 1000 X
and threes they have is the same you
know not to type clamping force these
ear cups are with which spaces don't
know 1000 X + 3 is that's awesome if we
can get these ear pads on the 1000 like
some fours
it's a wrap oh man these do another
thing another thing one of the biggest
problems about the XP 950 n ones and the
here on twos is that these things are
huge you can actually see both of these
headphones in your peripheral vision I
would see them right there ok but nope I
can't see these this is great this is
just as low-profile and the headband
headbands low profile the the FET here
sony knocked it out the part with these
guys I like it ok but just so that you
guys can see exactly what I'm talking
about here are the XP 900 ends we're
gonna switch over to the XP 950 n ones
alright boom you see these things are
huge all of this I can see this right
here alright and now we're going to
switch over to the here on twos again
these are another pair of very big
headphones and just like the X being
50n ones you can literally see this
right here in your peripheral vision but
if we go over to the brand new XP 900
ends boom
way more low-profile the headbands more
low-profile - but the ear cups that your
pads they're they're more spacious than
the 1000 X and threes I can't stress
this enough if Sony manages to use these
types of ear pads on the 1000 X some
whores if they come out in August it's
it's a wrap but the last thing I want to
check out in this first impressions
video is going to be the base on these
headphones now as the name implies these
are a part of Sony's extra base
headphone lineup
so I want to see if the new xB 900 ends
have more base than the outgoing xB 950
enones now I already have a baseline of
what these headphones sound like with
their extra base set to 10 so let's
check out if these headphones have the
same amount or more bass in the outgoing
model personally I think they're gonna
have the same amount of base but here we
go gonna bump up the volume
oh don't move it yeah you see their
backside at 10:00 and I even raise the
base up a little bit on these they have
the same amount of base as the XP 950 n
ones that's not a bad thing they still
sound good but if you're expecting more
base than the XP 950 n ones they they
have the same but I think we're gonna
leave it at there because it is honestly
all hundred-plus degrees in here plus
lights but this has been a first
impressions video on the brand new sony
XP 900 ends I think where Sony has done
here is that they've merged their XP 950
N ones and they're here on twos and now
we've got this personally I think it's
gonna be highly unlikely that we're
going to see an official replacement to
the here on twos because honestly to me
it doesn't make any sense when we've got
these but like I said this has been a
first impressions of video on the XP 900
ends and honestly these guys have made a
very very good first impression on me
but look out for a few videos on these
guys in the future but other than that
I'll check you guys out next time if you
