the new top dog is the JBL Boombox.
If you’re considering either choosing between
these two speakers or even considering upgrading…
you probably want to know the main differences
between these two speakers.
So which is right for you?
We’re about to find out.
Don’t forget to like comment and subscribe
and you can watch my full review on the JBL
Boombox here after you’re done watching
this video.
When it comes to money theres a $150 price
difference between the two speakers.
The JBL Boombox currently retails for $449.95
and the older JBL Xtreme currently retails
for $299.99 at most places.
But I’ve actually managed to find the JBL
Xtreme for as low as $226 on amazon.
If you want to pick either of these speakers
up I’ll have links in the description below
and I’ll keep them updated so you can get
best the deal possible.
Design wise both of these speakers have the
same characteristics.
Both of these speakers have the same nylon
mesh weave on the outside that make the speakers
fairly rugged and repel almost everything.
They both have the same button layout on the
top so you can control your music playback,
adjust the volume and even activate siri by
pressing the play pause button.
They both have dual USB ports on the back
so you can charge your own devices, they both
come included with a power brick and charge
via their AC in ports, and they both have
AUX jacks.
They even have similar speaker set ups.
They both have dual woofers on the front,
dual tweeters, and they both have passive
radiators on each side.
But obviously the larger size of the JBL Boombox
means much larger diameter woofers, tweeters
and passive radiators.
All in all the JBL Boombox is almost 3 and
half times bigger and weighs 2 and half times
more than the JBL Xtreme.
But the larger size of the BOOMBOX means it
can house dual .79 inch diameter tweeters,
dual 4 inch woofers, and 4.17 inch diameter
passive radiators on each side.
Where as the JBL Xtreme has dual 1.38 inch
diameter tweeters, 2.48 inch woofers, and
2.87 inch diameter passive radiators on each
side.
Although the JBL BOOMBOX is meant to be highly
portable and has a built in carrying handle
that dosnt detach… it doesn’t have the
optional shoulder strap attachment like the
JBL Xtreme.
And even though the JBL Boombox only weighs
11 and half pounds it does get heavy after
awhile.
Personally I think the JBL Boombox needs a
shoulder strap option more than the JBL Xtreme.
Like JBL could have just added the little
hooks right here.
Tech specs on either speaker are a little
different.
The JBL Xtreme is using bluetooth 4.1 and
has a slightly shorter range of 50 feet where
as the JBL Boombox is using bluetooth 4.2
and has a range of 70 feet.
But both of these speakers can connect to
multiple devices at the same time, which is
good.
Both of these speakers aren’t afraid of
a little water.
But the JBL Xtreme is only splash proof where
as the JBL BOOMBOX is IPX 7 certified.
This means if the Xtreme gets a little wet
you don’t have to worry about it but if
it gets submerged under water you’re gonna
have a bad time.
But since the Boombox is IPX 7 certified it
can get submerged under water without any
issues.
It can even float in water and keep playing
music.
the first most noticeable upgrade to the JBL
BOOMBOX is battery life.
I’ve found that with the boombox set in
outdoor mode and at a moderate volume you
can get a battery life of 24 hours.
But if you use your Boombox in the slightly
better sounding indoor mode at the same moderate
volume you should get a battery life of 21
hours.
Where as under the same conditions you should
be able to get a battery life of 16 hours
on the JBL Xtreme which is technically more
than its advertised battery life.
None the less both of these speakers have
impressive battery lives that will last you
multiple listening sessions.
Regarding sound quality, these speakers perform
very differently.
The JBL Boombox has over all better instrument
separation and a wider sound stage.
It also has deeper bass, and theres even a
hint of sub bass which is totally nonexistent
on the JBL Xtreme.
And to be clear, this is while the BOOMBOX
is in the slightly better sounding indoor
mode.
The JBL Boombox also gets about 15 decibels
louder than the JBL Xtreme.
When the JBL Xtreme is at 100% volume its
like the JBL Boombox is at 70% volume.
Over all with the JBL Boombox, you’re not
just getting a louder speaker youre also getting
a better sounding speaker than the JBL Xtreme.
But another important thing to consider before
buying either of these two speakers is compatibility.
The JBL Boombox is using JBL Connect Plus
while the JBL Xtreme is using the older JBL
Connect.
And this is more important than you think.
With JBL Connect plus you can sync up to 100
JBL connect plus enabled speakers.
Right now the JBL Boombox can connect with
the JBL flip 4, or the JBL Pulse 3 cause they
are both using JBL Connect plus.
But the JBL Boombox can not sync with JBL
speakers that are using the older JBL Connect.
So you can’t pair the boombox with the JBL
Xtreme, JBL Pulse 2, JBL Charge 3 or any other
older JBL speaker.
But representatives on JBL’s forums have
gone on record saying that the JBL Charge
3 should be a getting a firmware update this
October so it can sync with JBL Connect Plus
speakers.
And they have also stated that due to technological
limitations the JBL Xtreme will never be able
to sync with JBL Connect plus enabled speakers.
So if you get the Boombox don’t get upset
if it wont pair with your older speakers.
And if you get the Xtreme don’t get upset
if it wont pair with any future JBL speakers
you might get.
So is having a better sounding and louder
speaker with a slightly better battery life
worth a $150 premium… thats up to you to
decide.
Personally I’m pleased with the JBL Boombox,
but I did expect it to get louder.
If you decide to get the JBL Xtreme just keep
in mind its probably on its way out.
I’m willing to bet JBL is going to announce
the JBL Xtreme 2 at CES 2018.
But I’m not knocking the JBL Xtreme its
still a solid speaker.
Now keep in mind, this isn’t a full review
either of these speakers, I’m just trying
to point out the most important differences
between them so I can help you with your purchase
decision.
