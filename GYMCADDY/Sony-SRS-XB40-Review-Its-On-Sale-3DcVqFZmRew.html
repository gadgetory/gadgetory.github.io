seizures or anything else just a heads
up
Oh Sony might be working on a comeback a
few weeks ago I received a Sony xb9 50
and one and i fell in love with them if
they're now my go-to noise-canceling
your phones and back at CES 2017 Sony
announced two new SRS XP 40 wireless
speaker and says Sony is on the up and
up I thought I'd give the SRX before you
try so let's see if this guy's worth the
money and please don't forget to hit
that like button so the Sony S or s XP
40 currently come in three colorways
over at Amazon black blue and red could
the s rise like before t can you color
wait in the future maybe personally I
prefer the black version because it
allows the speaker to disappear when
it's not in use and I feel it enhances
the light show feature coming below and
let me know which colorways you like
best the Sony S or s XP 40 currently
retails for 248 over at Amazon and
knowing Amazon they'll put the speaker
on sale from time to time if you want to
take the speaker up I'll have a link in
the description below and I'll keep it
updated so you can get the best deal
possible the Sony SRS actually 40 is
your wireless midsize speaker that
features a rechargeable battery Sony's
extra base feature it's water-resistant
and has built-in lights that flash
according to your music inside the box
you really only get the speaker itself
its charger and whole bunch of
documentation the speaker itself has a
taper design and has soft touch plastic
all around its body
it's actually quite nice to touch at
home and for its size it's not too heavy
this particular speaker isn't as dense
as other speakers on the market right
now and when you place it on the table
you can either lay it flat or stand it
on one of its sides and it actually does
a pretty good job of staying upright if
you lightly tap it by accident but just
to be safe I advise your late a flight
if you can concerning blinds and ports
the Sony SRS XP 40 hazard standard power
button volume up volume down and add
button to chain other Sony speakers
together a play/pause button a phone
button to accept calls with and that
extra base button all of which have
great tactile feedback to them which is
very important and there's an NFC touch
point as well if you use Android if you
double press the play plane you'll skip
a track and if you triple press the play
button you go back a track if you're
using an iPhone and you press the phone
button you'll
I can see me from his or her slumber
what's the weather like in New York City
today the temperature will range from 57
degrees to 75 degrees and if you press
and hold the phone button the speaker
will tell you its current battery state
only banking and if you press and hold
the extra base plane you can turn off
the strobe lights as well on the back of
the speaker you'll find a Philly port a
reset button and a USB port so you can
use the answer is XP 40 as a power bank
to charge your other devices but Sony S
aureus XV 40 is a bro
the speaker is using bluetooth for that
too and can connect up to three devices
at the same time and if you have an NFC
enabled phone then pairing is just much
easier but connection range is a little
short as 50 feet compared to other
devices I've review but this speaker has
no problem connecting through multiple
walls concerning battery life the box
advertises 24 hours but I'm assuming
that's at medium volume with the strobe
lights turned off and with a wired
connection because I've only managed to
get about a 15 hour battery life using
bluetooth at a higher volume and with
the strobe lights to turn on like I said
earlier you can pair other Sony speakers
together to play music simultaneously
time to be exact or you can have two
speakers paired together and have them
create a stereo fact concerning sound
quality Sony did a good job of cleaning
up the extra bass feature on the SOS XP
40 like you did on their XP 950 n1 side
notes only needs to work at the mainland
structure first you need to understand
the sony srs XP 40 is a based focused
speaker it's going to perform its best
when you play techno evm R&amp;amp;B rap and
hip-hop but for the most part there's no
rats penis tinning or any clashing
anywhere on the volume spectrum of the
speaker with extra bass turn on the
overall sound does get a little shallow
but as you'd expect the bass is
accentuated but with extra bass turned
off everything is brought forward so you
might want to toggle the extra bass
feature on and off depending on which
song you're listening to like songs
already have a lot of bass to them don't
need more bass like I said earlier the
speaker does have an aux jack on the
back end
you'd expect if you have a wide
connection the sound quality does
improve but the difference in sound
quality between the wired connection and
the wireless connection on the SSB 40 is
so small it's hard to tell apart really
if you use a wired connection on the
speaker it's because you want to save
battery life and when it comes to
streaming videos the lag between the
video and the audio is so small there's
hardly any syncing issues if any because
other wireless speakers and headphones
on the market do have a significant lag
to them which lead to words and lips lip
syncing and in my opinion reducing the
overall experience but in general the
Sony SR is actually 40 does sound really
good I just wish it was a little louder
I feel that for its size it should be
able to pump out a little more noise but
perhaps Sony did that for sound quality
although in general I do really like
this speaker it still has its issues the
biggest issue the speaker has right now
is Sony's mobile app Sony insists that
you use the SRS sv40 with their music
center app and Fiesta Bowl app so you
can do things like adjusting EQ chain
other speakers together control your
speaker from your phone and play with
the light show setting but after trying
and Damle or pulling my hair out I
couldn't get either one of these apps to
work and is no surprise Sony's music
center app has a 2 star rating with bad
reviews from users and Fiesta Bowl isn't
doing too well either but luckily you
can still use the speaker without any
issues if you can't connect to either
app actually while I was recording the
videos for this review both deaths
decided to work music Center allows you
to control their speaker from your phone
play around with the EQ a little and you
can adjust elimination settings it
technically works feasible on the other
hand is a whole of a disaster you can do
things like play sound bites adjust
lighting colors and distort the audio
and pretend to be an amateur detail
honestly don't even bother downloading
the apps save yourselves 100 megabytes
of storage on your phone and take a few
selfies of yourself listening to music
on the SOS XP 40 instead
another quart I want to point out is
that when the speaker tells you the
battery is low it'll automatically set
the volume to low as well and if you try
to raise the volume from your phone the
speaker won't get louder even if the
phone says it's at next volume so you're
forced to go and turn off your speaker
and turn it back on
hopefully these quirks can be fixed
through some firmware and app updates in
the near future
but with all that being said I like the
speaker the light sure looks good but
personally I could have done without
those strobe lights on either side
I just feel those are a little too harsh
but in general the Sony answer is
actually 40 is the good mid-sized bass
focused speaker that will look great in
your bedroom or living room but it's
still lightweight and small enough to
take with you from time to time it's IP
x5 water-resistant which means a little
water won't do it any harm just don't
submerge it or else you're out 250
dollars the real world battery life of
15 hours is plenty and you can use this
because a power bank is charging from
your strong and clear wireless
connection the speaker offers is pretty
impressive Sonia is pretty laser focus
on capturing the base highs demographics
with this product and even with or
without its app functionality the
speaker's still performs well but a part
of me still wants to go and play around
with the EQ to bring the best out of the
speaker but yeah
the sony SRS extra 40 is a pretty solid
