headphones isn't going to cut it no you
need headphones that can deliver the
amount of bass you demand and then some
and two of the most popular options on
the market are the skull candy crusher
Wireless and the Sony xb9 50 n-1 and
although both of these have a lot of
bass there are some key differences
between them so what to write for you or
about to find out don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and you can watch
some of my other videos here after
you're done watching this video let's
talk money the Sony xb9 50 anyone
technically retail for two hundred and
fifty dollars but they're usually on
sale for 178 ninety-nine on amazon and
sometimes if are even as low as one
$29.99 which is just nuts and you've got
two colors to choose from black or green
the school candy crush or wireless
retail for $200 but they're usually on
sale for one $49.99 or a little less and
they also come in two colorways black or
gray and tan if you want to pick either
of these headphones up I'll have links
on description below and I'll keep it
updated so you can get the best deal
possible okay let's do a rundown of
design and build quality like I said in
my initial review the build quality of
this gold candy crusher for their price
point is amazing the majority is covered
in soft touch Robert the headband is
stainless steel the ear cuffs slide to
adjust in overall and they are very
sturdy the Sony xb9 50 and one are made
mostly at its actual plastic panels that
are snapped into place the headband is
also made out of stainless steel and
they have a whole lot more padding than
the Skullcandy crusher but even though
the xb9 50 no1 cost more than the
Crushers the build quality is nowhere
near as good i also want to shine some
light on the included carrying cases in
cables the Skullcandy crushers come
included with a very durable yet plush
soft shell carrying case and soft touch
were pre coded and branded audio cable
within like controller in a micro USB
cable for charging the carrying case
included with the sony is really just a
thin bag and the cables are
run-of-the-mill
I have to give props to Skullcandy for
their choice of materials here getting
into technical specifications the sony
xb9 50 n1 do offer active noise
cancellation it's okay in already quiet
environments but it's not comparable to
the bose QC 35 or
the Sony WH 1000x m2 which are the newer
versions of the sony MDR 1000x
but the Skullcandy crusher is completely
outclassed exp 950 n1 in the battery
life department on the full charge the
crusher should last you 40 hours at
moderate listening levels Wireless of
course but I've actually managed to get
more hours in them with noise
cancellation on the XP 950 and one show
the last 22 hours but with ANC off I've
managed to get around 26 hours of
playback time and both of these
headphones have similar Wireless ranges
at 35 feet for both with direct
line-of-sight to your Wireless choice
when it comes to design and comfort the
school candy crushers are sleek and
low-profile enough whereas the Sony's
have a very polarizing design some
people love the round ear cuts and
others hated personally I don't mind it
but the ear cups on the XP 950 n1 are
huge you can actually see them in your
peripheral vision when you put them on
and some people feel silly when they
wear them in public but even though the
ear cups are larger on the Sony the
cutout for the ear is a little too small
and the padding ends up sitting on my
earlobes whereas the cutout on the
crusher is slightly bigger and in case
your ears better but the ear cups on the
crusher do you heat up faster than the
XP 950 n1 when it comes to comfort the
XP 950 n1 win hands down the Skullcandy
crushers have a lot of clamping force
and it causes discomfort in the jaw area
after some time your cups on the
crushers do not swivel and they pivot
very little they don't sit right on your
head whereas that your cups on the Sony
have a lot more range of motion and they
adapt to more people's heads basically
if you have a big head those gold candy
crush isn't for you
now it's gonna the sound quality both of
these headphones have lots of bass to
them that's where you got them and
they're both adjustable if you want more
bass on the scroll candy crusher you
just have to slide the slider up on the
left ear cup if you want to adjust the
base on the XP 950 n1 you have to do
that through so nice headphones app
available on both Android and Apple and
through the app you can also turn noise
cancellation on and off and you can also
play around with the surround sound
settings and for those wondering when
set and Max basal skull candy crusher do
have more
based in the xb9 fifty n-1 but believe
it or not too much base can be a bad
thing
so for real-world use i like to keep my
xb9 fifty on one set at plus seven and
the slider on the crusher at a little
below half and when it comes to sound
quality i have to give it to the Sony
NEX B 950 and one man has to keep the
base and the rest of the sound separate
while what the crushers if the base
really gets going it's going to motor
the sound what the sound on the crusher
is also a more push back and the highest
do cause constant discomfort snares and
cymbals and anything of the like are
just too sharp and there's also a lot of
crackling in the background and I'm
pretty sure it was in a connection issue
because my phone was right next to the
headphones and vocalist on the crushers
sound like they're in an entirely
different room in order to hear them you
have to really crank up the volume
whereas the mids and highs on the Sony
don't cause any discomfort and there's
really no tinning the sound isn't as
push back as the crushers and they do
have better instrument separation and
they also get louder without distorting
the sound too much so sound quality has
to go to the Sony xb9 50 and one also
want to test on the controls real quick
and what is the control you music
playback on the sony you just have to
use the rocker it's fast and efficient
if you want to adjust volume you just
have to use the volume rocker which is
also very easy to find the pressures if
you want to skip or go back a track you
have to press and hold the plus or minus
button for three seconds
I hate when headphones do this cuz it
takes too long I would much rather
double press with triple as a center
button to do the same thing so if you're
in the market for some bass heavy
headphones I would have to recommend the
Sony xb9 50 anyone over the Skjold candy
crusher wireless i can't say enough good
things about the Skjold candy crusher
while its build quality but they aren't
very comfortable to wear for long
periods of time
although the crushers have more bass in
the sony the overall sound quality isn't
as good like I said in my initial review
Skullcandy just needs to make some
adjustments to their next model to make
the Crushers great but right now I think
most people will be better off with the
Sony xb9 50 n1
