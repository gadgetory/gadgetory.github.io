DJI Matic 2 pro and rhodesia I maverick
to zoom these hotly-anticipated drones
this suffer a few setbacks and leaks
have been rampid for the last month but
they're finally here and we finally know
everything there is to know about them
here's everything you need to know about
DJ eyes pneumatic two drones and how
they compare to the Medicare and phantom
4 first let's address price cuz I'm
gonna be honest I did have sticker shock
when I first saw the official product
pages honestly I still have sticker
shock the DJI Mavic 2 pro is going to be
retelling for the low low price of one
thousand four hundred forty nine dollars
and the mapping to zoom is going to be
selling for a mere one thousand two
hundred forty nine dollars and nerve a
label right now for comparison the DJI
Mavic air starts off at $799 the Phantom
four advance goes for one thousand one
hundred ninety nine dollars and the
phantom 4 pro v 2.0 goes for 1499
dollars a starting price of one thousand
two hundred forty nine dollars for
thematic two is a significant jump
because the original maverick Pro
started off at a retail price of nine
hundred ninety nine dollars and the
updated Matic pro platinum starts off at
one thousand ninety nine dollars but if
you take all the improvements DJI
crammed into their pneumatic two drones
I think the new price point is justified
first let's address what's new on both
of these drones I think the most
significant update the pneumatic two is
rocking is 360-degree obstacle avoidance
this is something I've been calling
since thematic air there's a total of
ten sensors placed all around the body
of the drone that basically makes a
crash proof this is great for a wallet
and it means content creators like
myself can focus more on getting the
shot instead of not crashing cuz for
comparison the original maverick Pro
could only sense obstacles to its front
and bottom so it was more prone to
crashing than the cheaper Mavic air
another significant update is the flight
time the two pneumatic two drones now
have a flight time of 31 minutes whereas
the original Matic pro was good for 27
minutes the Medicare is good for
twenty-one minutes and both phantom
drones are good for 30 minutes the medic
tools can now also read - max flight
speed of 44 miles per hour four miles
per hour faster than before whereas the
MAV acara tops out at 42 miles per hour
and the Phantom's also have a top speed
of 44 miles per hour but from my
experience due to their sheer mass
they're not as nimble as the smaller
Joan's transmission systems have also
been improved the pneumatic tubes have a
cusing 2.0 in layman's terms they're
supposed to have a range of up to eight
miles or eight kilometres the video feed
should be coming in at 1080p instead of
720p like the other drones and
interferes is supposed to be less of a
problem in densely populated areas
software wise both of these drones are
also now have advanced optical avoidance
like the one that was debuted on the
mafic era a few months ago so if you
have the Matic to active tracking an
object is going to be able to
automatically dodge obstacles so can
keep the subject and frame instead of
just flying in place and losing the
subject active tracking in general has
also been improved losing the subject is
supposed to be less of an issue thanks
to new trajectory prediction algorithms
and you can now active track subjects
going as fast as 44 miles per hour but
just be warned obstacle avoidance
systems will be turned off so those are
the new major changes coming to both of
the pneumatic to drones 360-degree
obstacle avoidance are 31 minute flight
time with quieter propellers occu SEC
2.0 for a stronger transmission that
shouldn't cut out as much and displays
your feet in 1080p and better active
tracking there's a few other goodies
like 8 gigs of internal storage a new
dolly zoom quick shot mode and a few new
hyperlapse mode but here are the main
differences between the DJI Matic 2 pro
and the DJI Matic - zoom the DJI medic-2
pro has been improved for better
low-light performance it has a one inch
20 megapixel CMOS sensor from Hasselblad
with an adjustable aperture having this
one in sensor in the pneumatic tube Pro
is significant because before if you
wanted a drone with a 1 in sensor you
had to go with something from the
Phantom line I think that for content
creators and youtubers who wanted the
best
image quality thematic - Pro is the one
to get get this supposed to be better
for low-light performance the DJ
automatic to zoom is rocking a 12
megapixel one over 2.3 and to CMOS
sensor which is what you'll find on the
outgoing Matic pro the Maverick error
and even the DJI spark but what makes
the DJI to zoom special is that it has
an optical zoom that can go from 24
millimeters to 48 millimeters and given
with the fact that you have up to a 2
times the last less digital zoom the map
to zoom can get some really up-close
pictures without having to get too close
to a subject but now that I think about
it this is the drum for creeps just
remember with great power comes great
responsibility when it comes to video
capture things have been slightly
improved under Matic - from the manic
pro both method - drones are going to be
able to capture up to 4k video at 30
frames per second 2.7 K up to 60 frames
per second and 1080 P up to 120 frames
per second this is the same type of
performance were getting from the Mavic
era
personally I was really hoping for 4k 60
frames per second and maybe even 1080p
at 240 frames per second so overall
there are some significant hardware
updates to these new Jones that make
them much easier to fly and they already
were I feel the 1249 DJI Matic - zoom is
equivalent to an upgraded Medicare which
retails for $799 you're getting the same
size image sensor and the same video
capture rates as somatic error but the
benefits thematic to zoom brings to the
table is a 31 minute flight time versus
21 minutes and 360-degree obstacle
avoidance even though the Medicare has
really good obstacle avoidance as well
it's still prone to crashing if you're
flying from side to side or if you're
getting elevation and don't notice a
tree branch above it and I feel paying
an extra $450 for thematic - zoom is
worth it because it's virtually crash
proof it just takes one really bad crash
to lose your Medicare and plus having
that optical zoom is a huge advantage
but the medic-2 pro is like having a
phantom drone and the palm of your hand
even though the Phantom lineup is great
lugging it around
is a hassle but that's not an issue with
thematic line up even though thematic to
zoom is still really good and I expect a
really good image quality from that bad
boy I think content creators are going
to love the Matic to pro because it's
going to perform much better in
low-light environments if you made it
