be looking into getting a speaker.
But if you’re looking into getting a speaker
to mainly use at your next cook out or entertain
guests with… then you’ll probably be better
off with a 360 degree speaker cause you’ll
be able to blanket to a large area with music
with out having to blast the volume.
So today we’re going to look at 3 of my
favorite multi-directional speakers.
Theres the brand new Marshall Stockwell 2,
the UE Megaboom 3, and the JBL Pulse 3.
Now both the JBL Pulse 3 and UE Megaboom 3
have a retail price of $200 but they’re
typically on sale these days for around $150
to $170.
Where as the Marshall Stockwell 2 is the newest
speaker here and has a retail price of $250…
but the Stockwell 2 is already going on sale
for $200.
So overall, all of these speakers are in the
same price range… but are very different
from one another.
But if you want to pick any of these speakers
up, they’ll be linked down below.
And if you want to learn more about either
of these speakers, please watch their full
reviews.
So like I mentioned earlier, if you’re looking
for a speaker to use with friends or to take
on the go with you all three of these speakers
are good options cause they’re all fairly
durable.
But I do have to admit that the JBL Pulse
3 is perhaps the most fragile speaker here.
Even though this speaker has an IPX7 rating,
meaning its water proof… due to its acrylic
top if you drop it you do risk cracking it.
Where as since the UE Megaboom 3 has a fabric
covered body it doesn’t show any wear and
tare, and the Stockwell 2 is also a very rugged
speaker but also consists of much finer materials
like a hard rubberized body, a metal grill
on both the front and back, and a great feeling
built in leatherette carrying handle with
red velvet underneath.
But technically speaking, the Megaboom 3 is
the most durable speaker here cause it has
an IP67 rating, meaning that’s its both
Dust and waterproof.
Where as the Stockwell 2 is only water resistant
so it can’t get as wet.
But the JBL Pulse 3 is perhaps the best looking
speaker here cause of its super impressive
light feature.
There are a whole bunch of different lighting
modes to choose from and through JBL’s app
you can customize the light feature.
And this light feature is going to look awesome
in doors or by the pool at night.
But unfortunately, having this super awesome
looking light feature on this speaker does
severely affect its battery life.
Even though the pulse 3 has an advertised
battery life of 12 hours, depending on what
light mode you’re using you’ll might only
be able to get 5 hours of playback time out
of it.
So definitely the Pulse 3 is a speaker that
you’re constantly going to have to keep
on the charger.
And also keep in mind, the light feature doesn’t
look all that great in direct sunlight.
But when it comes to the battery life on both
the Stockwell 2 and Megaboom 3, they both
have an advertised battery life 20 hours.
And when they’re both playing with the volume
set at 80% they’re both good for about 8
to 9 hours of playback time.
So both of these speakers aren’t going to
have a hard time lasting a full day’s cook
out or get together.
But when it comes to ports that’s when things
get very different.
The Stockwell 2 charges via a USBC port and
you can also use this USBC port to charge
your own devices.
Where as the JBL Pulse 3 charges via a micro
USB port.
Now the Megaboom 3 also charges via a micro
USB port, but I do think its important to
point out that this speaker doesn’t have
an audio jack… you can only use it wirelessly.
Personally I don’t mind but I do think its
very important to point out.
But when it comes to bluetooth connectivity,
all of these speakers have stable connections
just as you’d expect.
And all of these speakers can be connected
to 2 devices at a same time so you and a friend
can both be DJ.
But I do want to point out that the Pulse
3 is the only speaker here that does have
a slight latency whenever you try to watch
videos on your phone whether its an android
or apple device.
Its a very slight latency but if youre as
particular as me, you will notice it.
But also, the Stockwell 2 is the only speaker
here that has APTX support.
But more importantly when it comes to speaker
set ups, that’s when things start to get
very interesting.
Again, all three of these speakers are 360
degrees speakers, but the way they go about
it is very different.
The Pulse has 3 transducers all housed within
the fabric portion of the speaker, and as
a result it does in fact evenly blanket an
area with music whether in doors or outdoors.
And there are dual passive radiators that
shoot out the top and bottom of this speaker.
Then there’s the Stockwell 2 which has a
single woofer and dual tweeters that shoot
music out the front and back of this speaker.
And the Megaboom 3 has dual transducers and
dual passive radiators that shoot out the
sides of this speaker.
But now we’re going to jump into a sound
test.
All of these speakers are playing at the same
loudness, the mega boom 3 is playing with
its “the Standard” EQ setting and the
Stockwell 2 is playing with the bass knob
set to 8 and the treble knob set to 7.
So right off the bat, all of these speakers
sound good.
But if I had to single one out as the worst
sounding speaker here, it would have to be
the JBL Pulse 3.
Personally I think the vocals and mids are
very shallow compared to these other speakers
and the sound stage and instrument separation
isn’t as good.
Where as the Stockwell 2 has a much wider
soundstage and the mids and highs are much
crisper thanks to those dual tweeters.
And then there’s that the Megaboom 3 which
also has a decently wide sound stage and well
defined mids and highs, but I will admit the
highs aren’t as crips cause of the lack
of tweeters.
But keep in mind, both the Megaboom 3 and
Stockwell 2 let you directly adjust their
EQ.
The Megaboom 3 has its app and the Stockwell
2 has its bass and treble knobs.
Where as with the JBL pulse 3, you can’t
change its EQ as easily.
But over all, I do think the megaboom 3 is
the best sounding speaker here cause it doesn’t
just sound good, it also gets very loud.
Where as the Stockwell 2 doesn’t get nearly
as loud as the Megaboom 3 or Pulse 3.
And if you’re looking for a speaker to use
mainly out doors then max loudness is definitely
something you’ll want to take into consideration.
But finally, the last thing you want to take
into consideration when choosing between these
speakers is their speaker pairing protocol
just incase you decide to pick up more speakers
in the future.
Personally I think JBL’s JBL connect plus
is the best not out there cause its the easiest
one to use.
You just press one button on each speaker
and the speakers will figure out the rest
by themselves.
You don’t have to open up any other apps
and they establish a reliable connection very
quickly.
And also JBL has a very wide range of JBL
connect plus enabled speakers to choose from.
Now pairing multiple UE speakers is also very
easy cause you just do so through their app
but it just isn’t as quick as JBL’s.
And also UE’s line up of speakers that support
PartyUP isn’t as wide as JBL’s.
But finally, there’s the Stockwell 2 which
simply just can’t be paired up to any other
Marshall speakers.
And personally I do think that Marshall not
having a speaker pairing protocol for their
portable speakers is a huge draw back, cause
being able to pair multiple speakers together
is a very standard feature these days.
But over all, I think that if you’re looking
for a multi directional speaker to use this
summer…
I think you can’t go wrong with the Megaboom
3.
Its a very good sounding speaker that gets
very loud but its also super rugged so you
don’t have to worry about it and its battery
life is going to have no problem keeping up
with you.
The JBL Pulse 3 is also a good option especially
if you plan to use it at night cause its going
to look awesome.
But keep in mind its battery life is really
going to vary so you’re going to have to
keep a charger close by.
And finally there’s the Stockwell 2 which
is a good speaker in its own right, but I
don’t think its for everyone cause it doesn’t
get as loud as these other speakers and you
can’t pair it up any other speakers.
But if you’re still not sold on a Muti directional
speaker and if you just want something to
really blast your music you can also go for
the JBL Xtreme 2 which is now typically on
sale for $200.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
