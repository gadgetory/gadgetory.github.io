was shocked at how small and lightweight
it was I was even more shocked at how
good it actually sounded and how easy it
was to use racers set out to make the
perfect microphone for streamers and I
think they did just that so let's get
into the review and I'm also going to
compare it to everybody's favorite blue
Yeti and the less expensive blue
snowball don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe and you can watch some of
my other videos here after then what's
in this video unless stated otherwise
all of the audio in this video is being
recorded with the razer siren X just
like razors larger microphone the siren
X comes packed in super dense foam that
you could use it as a carrying case if
you're going to be traveling with it
inside you'll find a microphone or
support rod operator micro USB cable
documentation in the base and the siren
next retails for $9.99
for comparison's sake the blue yeti
which is the mic i've been using for a
few months now retails for $150 but is
usually on sale for $129 and if you're
just getting into streaming you might be
tempted to go with a blue snowball which
is a very affordable microphone which
will set you back about 55 dollars if
you want to pick either of these
microphones it up I'll have links to
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best view
possible when you first get to sirenix
you do have to put it together but the
microphone itself is super lightweight
weighing in at just 154 grams the base
however is super dense weighing in at
227 grams but if you don't want to use
the included base the sorry NEX does
have a universal mount on the bottom so
you can use your own at the bottom
you'll also find on microUSB port and a
zero latency 3.5 millimeter headphone
monitoring port so you can hear your
audio in real time and on the front you
also find a volume knob and a mute
buying that flashes green or red the
larger blue Yeti also has a similar
setup to the siren X it also has a
universal mount uses a mic USB port has
a headphone jack on the bottom has a
volume knob up front and a menu button
but the blue Yeti has two extra knobs
the sorry necks dozen first is the gain
AB that increases the sensitivity of the
microchip fine tune the mic right now
I'm actually adjusting the gain knob
this is something you can't do with the
siren X manually but to be honest I feel
that for streaming purposes the
sensitivity of the siren X is just
perfect right out of the box and the
second knob on the blue Yeti lets you
switch from the for recording
the sorry max is a courtyard microphone
and I'll go into that in a minute but
with the blue Yeti you can also choose
from bi-directional mode where the mic
will only pick up sound from the front
and from what's behind it
there's also omnidirectional mic will
pick up everything evenly from each
direction and their stereo mode where
it'll use the left and right channels
and there's the blue snowball that
doesn't use a mic USB point and doesn't
have an audio jack but there is a switch
on the back so you can choose from three
recording patterns the first is cardioid
and that's what we have right now the
second setting is still cardioid but
sensitivity is lowered and the third
setting is omnidirectional but even
though I feel setting number one would
be best suited for streaming the audio
quality still isn't as good as the siren
X right out of the box like I mentioned
earlier the siren X is a cardioid
microphone so I picks up the majority of
the sound that's in front of it and as
you make your way to the back it will
pick up less and less sound which is
good because if you place it right in
front of you while you're streaming
it'll pick up mainly your voice and not
too much keyboard clicking sound or your
pc's fan for example although in theory
the same can be said for the blue yeti
and blue snowball they are gigantic
compared to the Razer 7x so you'll
probably want to place those microphones
off to the side of you so they'll pick
up a little bit more keyboard noise
although you might do the same with the
sorry max just having the option of
being able to play caesarian X in front
of you without taking up so much space
on a cramped desk it's super valuable to
a streamer when it comes to overall
sound quality the razer sorry neck
sounds full deep and crisp it has no
problem picking your voice up either if
you have it right in front of you or off
to the side it also doesn't have a
problem picking you up if you talk very
softly and if you get really excited mid
game and you start talking louder and
even if you start yelling the microphone
still manages to keep a clear signal
only at higher volumes will the
microphone start to crackle or just
sound blown out and again this is right
out of the box the blue yeti also sounds
very good but in order to get the best
sound you need to really play around
with the gain knob I also notice the
blue Yeti is slightly better at
preventing getting blown out when you
start yelling but if you know you're
yellow you can also just lower the gain
knob and prevent blocks that way but
without a doubt the blue snowball is the
worst sounding microphone in this group
for starters the audio isn't as clear
and you can even hear a little static at
times it also does the worst job
of handling loud noises because it does
get blown out more frequently and like I
mentioned earlier although the blue
snowball does give you three recording
patterns to choose from
I feel neither one of them sound as good
as the sorry Nexus default one of the
most important aspects of either of
these microphones is helmet stable
vibration either of their stands to pick
up if you're planning on streaming with
either of these microphones chances are
you're going to be resting them on the
same desk where you're going to be using
your keyboard for starters I can tell
you right off the bat that the blue
snowball picks up the most stable
vibration in this group and that's due
to the mic stiff base all it does is
transfer all the energy into the
microphone the blue Yeti on the other
hand picks up significantly less table
of vibration thanks to the padding on
the bottom of its space but since the
majority of the base is still very stiff
it still manages to pick up some table
vibrations and then there's a serine X
that picks up the least amount of table
vibrations and that's for a few reasons
first the padding on the bottom of the
base is slightly thicker and softer than
the padding on the blue Yeti the overall
surface area in contact with the table
is also significantly less than the blue
Yeti and the serine X also has a
built-in shock mount that helps dampen
vibrations this means when you're
mashing your keyboard the serine X isn't
going to pick up as much table
vibrations as the Yeti or snowball
all in all I do think the Razer sirenix
is the perfect microphone for streamers
for $100 you're getting a microphone
that sounds as good and even at times
better than the blue Yeti but in a much
smaller and in a more manageable package
right out of the box is exactly what a
streamer needs if I didn't already have
a blue Yeti or neither a microphone that
can record a stereo mode I would go with
the siren next for my voice always I
just wish the support rod was slightly
longer so it was easier to plug in the
micro USB cable and I wish I could dim
the recording light on the front if
you're going to start streaming and
you're looking for a microphone you
can't go wrong with the siren X it
sounds and performs way better than the
snowball and the blue Yeti might be
overkill for what you need and remember
the compact size of the siren X is a
huge plus over either of these
microphones hey if you enjoyed the video
