noise-canceling headphones a lot of
people will automatically think about
the bose qc25 or the sony and dr going
down to next and although both of these
are great noise cancelling headphones
they're very different from one another
so it's alright for you let's find out
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and you can check out some
other videos here after you don't watch
this video something I've noticed about
those products is that they very rarely
almost never go on sale although both QC
35 are a year all now they're still
selling for the same $349 and they still
only come in black or silver you can now
customize your own both QC 35 but for a
very hefty price the sony MDR 1000x used
to retail for $399.99 but now you can
get them for as low as three hundred
twenty-eight dollars and they also come
in two colorways black or beige if you
want to pick either of these headphones
up I'll have links in the description
below and I'll keep them updated so you
can get the best deals possible both of
these headphones are over the ear
wireless noise cancelling headphones
they both charge via a micro USB cable
they both have a 20 hour battery life
with noise cancelling turned on they
both have an aux jack for wide
connections they both come included with
a hard shell carrying case they both can
be laid flat or fold up they both
feature button so you can control your
music playback and they both feature and
it's a touch point so pairing with an
Android device is super easy but that's
where the similarities end
design-wise I have to say the bose QC 35
do look a little better than the sony
MDR 1000x build quality is also better
on the both QC 35 since they use glass
filled nylon on the majority of the body
stainless steel on the headband and
Alcantara on the bottom portion of the
headband the sony MDR 1000x is made
mostly out of plastic and a lot of these
pieces or snap together instead of
screwed in like the bows this has
resulted in the headband on the sony MDR
1000 x to come apart during my stress
test
granted it was under a lot more stress
than it would typically be and I just
snapped it back together so it's no big
deal but the materials used on the
jisuk 35 make them lighter than the sony
MDR 1000x the bose qc25 weigh in at
eight point three ounces or 235 grand or
the sony one does an X weighs in at nine
point seven ounces or 275 grams but the
one point four ounce difference doesn't
matter when it comes to comfort you
can't even tell the difference when
you're wearing them but I did notice the
bose qc25 features softer and much more
breathable padding and the sony MDR
1000x
so the boss gc3 flies aren't just more
plush they also help prevent overheating
more than the Sony
1000x and I then notice the bose qc25
has slightly less clamping force than
the 1000 X if I had to choose one only
uncomfort then I'm going to both teach
it to be five when it comes to
controlling me music both took the safe
route while Sony took a different
approach you can control your music
playback adjust the volume and activate
Siri by using the three buttons found on
the poses right earcup with the Sony you
can do the same thing except you use the
touchpad on the right ear color and it's
highly accurate all you have to do is
double tap to play or pause your music
swipe front or back to skip or go back a
track and swipe up or down to adjust
your volume there's also a set of
physical buttons on the left ear cup of
the Sony to toggle your ambient sound
settings or even turn off noise
cancellation straight from your
headphones there are two ambient sound
settings on the sony MDR 1000x first
there's ambient sound normal which will
pump in all the sound from the outside
so you can hear what's going on
this is good to have for safety reasons
if you're walking in the city
then there's ambient sound voice the
headphones will block out most of the
outside world and try to only let in
people's voices so if someone is calling
your name you'll be able to hear them
and then there's your normal noise
cancellation setting which will block
out everything the sony MDR 1000x also
have a feature whereby covering the
right ear cup the headphones will
automatically lower the volume of
whatever you're listening to and let in
the sound from the outside so if someone
is talking to you you can still hear
what they're saying without having to
take off your headphones this by far is
favorite setting thanks to software
updates the products you buy today can
still get new features as they age a
great example of this are the both QC 35
you can now share your music with other
Bose headphones and you can now adjust
your noise cancellation level through
Bose is AB and Bose has been known to do
a great job when it comes to noise
cancellation
when using the bose qc25 and sony MDR
1000x in the same surrounding area the
bose routinely managed to block out in
more of this sound but here's the catch
whenever I wear the bose qc25 for a
prolonged period of time i always get a
headache
while i don't the sony MDR 1000x
whenever you put on the bose you feel
this pressure in your ear like they have
to pop but this is just the noise
cancellation at work you also get the
same sensation with the Sony but not as
much so which has better noise
cancellation by your slim margin to both
TC 35 you but sense they cause me
discomfort and by default I'm going with
the Sony 1000x
when it comes to cell quality I didn't
notice - both Stacy 35 they'd have more
depth to them while the sound on the
sony MDR 1000x was a little more forward
at times well like I said in the past
when it comes to base the both PC 35 is
really hanging and I did notice that
hard volumes the Sony and the are 1000x
they'd have much less distortion and
rasping as Antoninus in the highs if I
had to pick one only on sound quality
then I'm going with the Sony and the
1000x hands down like I mentioned
earlier both of these headphones have a
better length of 20 hours of playback
time with noise cancelling on but in
order to charge the sony MDR 1000x from
zero to full it's going to take four
hours and they will feature any kind of
fast charging the both QC 35 in the
other hand take half as long to charge
in charging them for 15 minutes will
give you two and a half hours of
playback time that's a great feature
that has if you're in a time crunch
living with the Bose PC 35 is also
slightly easier since they can connect
to multiple devices at the same time so
switching between your phone and laptop
is super easy what the Sony on the other
hand you have to go through the pairing
process
every single time when you want to
switch devices and since both of these
headphones are using bluetooth for that
one they both have a range of around 40
feet with direct line-of-sight to your
phone like I mentioned earlier both of
these headphones came included with
audio cables if you want to use them
with a wide connection but the cable
bolos supplied feels very cheap but more
importantly the boss dc35 has a 2.5 jack
instead of a standard 3.5 jack so if you
lose the supplied cable or if you want
to use your own higher quality cable
you're gonna run to some problems the
sony MDR 1000x on the other hand come
included with a much better quality
cable and they also use the standard 3.5
jack on the headphones
alright so to wrap things up I think the
bose qc25 look better they have a better
build quality they're more comfortable
and they feature a watered-down version
of fast charging but the Sony and the or
1000x sound better feature noise
canceling technology that don't cause me
any headaches and they have very useful
ambient sound settings and touch
controls if I had to pick one I would go
with the sony MDR 1000x over the both TC
35 because they sound better and the
ambient sound settings are very useful
but if you do decide to go with the Bose
TC 35 just know that there are rumors
that an upgraded version of the bose
qc25 will be dropping soon that's why
I'm making this video but if you want to
