Mavic era and depending on how you look
at it this new drone is either a
souped-up DJI spark or a smaller Matic
pro and with the starting price of seven
hundred and ninety nine dollars the
Medicare is sand-witch right between the
sparks current price of $399 and the
medic pros nine hundred ninety nine
dollar price tag either way DJI has a
drone for everyone but let's go over the
new DJI Agnetha care okay let's talk
money the new DJI Mavic era has a
starting price of seven hundred ninety
nine dollars with that you get the drone
a newly designed remote controller one
battery four pairs of propellers
propeller guards a protective case and
any necessary cables it comes in three
colors or thick white onyx black or
flame red and they should be shipping on
January 28th well except the red one
that one is shipping a little later and
there's also a fly more combo option for
999 dollars with this bundle you'll get
a total of three batteries three pairs
of propellers are battery charging hub a
battery to power bank adaptor and a
travel bag to carry it all now let's
talk about specs the DJI maverick air
can be controlled with either your phone
or by gestures just like the spark or
you can also use the included controller
when controlled with your phone the DJI
Medicare will have a range of about 250
feet but when controlled with the
included controller the DJI Mavic air
will have a range of 4,000 meters or
two-and-a-half miles and the Mavic air
will have a flight time of twenty-one
minutes for comparison the DJI spark has
a flight time of 16 minutes the DJI
Matic pearl has a flight time of 27
minutes and the DJI maverick Pro
platinum has a flight time of 30 minutes
concerning the camera and gimbal system
pneumatic air has a newly designed three
axis gimbal system similar to the Matic
pro again for comparison to spark has a
two axis gimbal system which only
compensates for pitch control pneumatic
air is rocking the 12 megapixel camera
with an aperture of f28 and can shoot 4k
video up to 30 frames per second 2.7 K
up to 60 frames per second and 1080p up
to 120 frames per second and it has a
max bitrate of 100 megabits per second
and just in case you forget to add your
own SD card thematic error also has
eight gigs of internal storage if you're
shooting in 1080 it's a
space but if you're shooting in 4k that
ain't a lot okay let's talk about design
if you haven't noticed by now this thing
folds up just like the Matic pro it's
slightly bigger than the spark and
slightly smaller than the Matic Pro and
it weighs in at 430 grams and in my
experience the larger to join the more
control you have over it when flying in
windy conditions
pneumatic air also has sensors on the
front backing on its belly and even
though the Mavic air has DJ eyes new
flight autonomy 2.0 which creates a 3d
map in real time so a formatic air can
position itself and avoid obstacles I'm
still a little disappointed it doesn't
have sensors off to the side because I
think I'm still crash into stuff if
you're flying to the side but with these
air eyes advanced pilot assistance
systems the matic air is supposed to
automatically avoid obstacles even while
you're piloting it instead of just
stopping in this tracks like the spark
or magic Pro the Mavic era is also going
to have gesture controls just like the
spark but from the demo on stage the
gesture controls on the Matic error are
a little more robust and more accurate
which is a good thing to see cuz the
gesture controls on the spark are very
hit-or-miss active track has also been
improved and it's also supposed to be
more precise the Sun around DJI also
introduced two new quick stop modes
asteroid and boomerang and I wouldn't be
surprised if these new modes made their
way to the spark in Matic pro in the
near future and finally when used in
sport mode with the included controller
the Mavic air has a top speed of 42
miles per hour but obviously it's going
to take a toll on the battery and your
flying black the onboard sensors will
not be able to save you so talk to me
goose so to wrap things up I think the
DJI Mavic era is a great addition to the
DJI drone family it's clearly giving us
a preview of the next generation DJI
Matic pro the 21 minute flight time is
okay but it's more than enough time to
get some epic aerial shots if you plan
out your shots I like the new design and
I like the addition of the new sensors
but I still wish the Mavic air had
sensors off to the sides
personally I only ever crash when I'm
flying side words never forwards and
very rarely backwards but still I can't
wait to see how the DJI Matic air
performs when I get it the DJI maverick
air has a good blend of the best stuff
from the spark and pneumatic Pro it
looks simple to fly and it could be an
epic selfie machine just like the spark
but it also has the versatility and
capable
of the DJI Matic pro hey if you enjoyed
