marshal Kilburn 2-packs an impressive
amount of sound and a very long battery
life in a pretty small package and even
though there is a lot to like about the
marshal Kilburn tomb there were just
some things about it that just make me
wonder what the heck was marshal
thinking here is everything that I like
about the marshal Kilburn tomb and
everything that I hate about the marshal
kill burn to the kill boom to is
Marshalls largest portable Bluetooth
speaker and retails for $300 and even
though it looks basically identical to
all of Marshalls other speakers the
easiest way to point out a kill burn
chill is by the built-in carrying handle
if you want to pick the speaker up I'll
have links or description below and if
you use the links it really helps out
the channel I suggest you check them out
because you never know when the speaker
might go on sale where most other
speaker manufacturers these days are
wrapping their speakers in a brightly
colored fabric mesh or building and a
light feature Marshall insists on using
the same classic design that has lasted
them for decades and by no means is that
a bad thing
the Marshall kilburn 2 is a very good
looking speaker in its own right and it
can be a great option for someone who
wants something that looks a little more
sophisticated the kilburn 2 has a solid
metal grille in the front or hard
rubberized body that's made to look like
tumbled leather and a non-removable
carrying strap that's lined in red
velvet
now this crank strap does feel pretty
sturdy and it has a good amount of
stretch to it
but only time will tell how it will
actually stand up to regular use if you
constantly take it on to go with you now
even though the kilburn 2 has a pretty
tough exterior that should have no
problem standing up to constant bumps
and scrapes you should play it safe and
keep it away from water since it's only
rocking in IPX 2 rating which is kind of
below average for premium portable
speakers these days when it comes to
specs imports the kilburn 2 choices via
a 2 prong charging cable now even though
yes obviously it would have been much
better of the speaker charge via a USB C
port the kilburn tool actually has fast
charging something that not a lot of
other speakers have if you plug the
speaker in for 20 minutes from a dead
battery you're gonna get 3 hours of
playback time and I've been asking for
fast charging in portable speakers for a
while now so it's cool to finally see it
here the Q blown tool also keeps the
audio jack which is great to see because
some of the manufacturers are starting
the audio jack even on their larger
speakers namely the UE mega boom 3 and
sony xba-1 G but I do wish the kilburn
to your head a USB a out port or USB C
port so you can charge your own devices
when you're out and about but thankfully
the Kilburn 2 is rockin bluetooth 5.0
instead of bluetooth for that - like
most other recently released speakers
and if you're an Android user this
speaker supports apdex HD which is good
and the speaker can also be connected to
two devices at the same time which is
more good if you're a power user and if
you're an iPhone user the speaker also
has very little latency when watching
youtube videos on your phone it's still
there but it's more usable than most
what I'm basically saying is Marshall
managed to tick off all the right boxes
when it comes to your wireless
connectivity on the speaker battery life
from the kilburn 2 is also pretty
impressive
Marshall advertises a 20 hour battery
life from the kilburn 2 and in my
testing with the volume set at 80% the
speaker managed to average a lemon I was
a playback time but that was with the
bass not set to 5 and with the trouble
set to 7 I tried to give the kilburn to
a JBL sound signature because I wanted
to see how its battery life compared
against a JBL extreme - but if you use
the Kilburn - at a higher base setting
than its battery life is gonna drink
faster now haven't the control knobs on
top of the hill burn - is both awesome
and infuriating on one hand I love that
I can adjust a bass in trouble directly
on the speaker I don't have to go
through the extra stuff and open up an
app on my phone whenever I'm going to
listen to music I like to crank the bass
all the way up and when I'm going to
listen to a podcast I crank the bass
down but I hate that the volume knob is
only local to the speaker it's not
actually adjusting the volume on your
phone so whenever I power the kilburn to
on I just cranked the volume all the way
up to 10 easy fix no problem but what
drives me mad about this speaker is that
it doesn't have a multi-function button
to player positive music or to skip a
track when I first got the speaker I
assumed this button was a multi-function
button but it's not you can only press
and hold it to put the speaker into
pairing mode I don't get why Marshall
just did an atom multifunction button on
the speaker when all of their other
speakers have them like I've said in the
past I absolutely hate when magnified
limit physical controls on the devices
not having all multifunction button on
the speaker isn't just an inconvenience
it's stupid okay now that I got that out
of my system let's talk about speaker
setup the kilburn 2 is a 36 watt speaker
with a single front motor firing woofer
and dual tweeters now there's a base
reflector that shoots a good amount of
that delicious bass out the back of the
speaker so you are going to notice a
good amount of performance improvement
if you use this speaker up against the
wall now we're about to jump into a
Santas I'm going to be using the older
JBL extreme one because it has JBL 2
older brighter sound signature and I'm
going to be using the JBL boom box in
indoors mode because it was heavily
requested and the kilburn 2 is going to
be playing with its volume knob set to
10 based at the 5 and the trouble set to
7
crazy
- you feel
you do
see you around
like I said earlier the kilburn - sounds
very impressive for its size distortion
is basically amount exists in a max
volume and if you wanted to it can have
almost as much bass that's a JBL boombox
if you crank the bass up higher but I
can't help but feel that it's instrument
separation and soundstage could be
better bass is not a problem on the
Kilburn atchoo but everything just
sounds very close together compared to
Jamie also older and newer speakers the
k√∂ppen 2 by no means sounds muddy but
when instruments will really get going
everything just tends to blend together
but overall the marsh Kilburn - is a
decent sounding speaker that gets more
than loud enough and max volume and
that's pretty much it when it comes to
the marshall children - unlike most
other speakers out there these days
the kilburn - doesn't have any sort of
companion app and you can pair it up to
any other Marshall speakers so you can
get them to play and sink or in stereo
mode the kilburn - has zero gimmick it's
all about enjoying music and for that
reason I think the Marshall Colburn 2 is
another great speaker if you just want
one speaker I really like the kilburn -
is classic design and it's a really nice
departure from all of the other fabric
mesh speakers I've reviewed so far it
has a very long battery life at just as
long as you have two bass not turned
down and I really like that it has fast
charging something that I hope starts to
catch on and the bass on the speaker is
very impressive given its size but I
just wish instrument separation was
better but we're really sets the speaker
back for me it's its lack of a
multi-function button
it's like Marshall knew they had an
awesome product on their hands but
decided to head to cut themselves by
getting rid of that multifunction button
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
