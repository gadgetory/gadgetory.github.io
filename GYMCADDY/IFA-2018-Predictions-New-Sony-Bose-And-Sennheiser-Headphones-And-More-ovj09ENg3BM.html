until September 5th and for those who
may not know what IFA is IFA is
basically Europe's CES big companies
like Logitech Razer Sennheiser Sony's
Skullcandy Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen DJI and many
more are gonna be there so here are my
little predictions as to what products
were going to see announced ad I have
think this year and hopefully these are
the products we have to look forward to
this holiday season first let's start
off with headphones it's rumored that
Apple is going to be releasing a new
pair of premium headphones that are
going to be sledded above the base do
you freeze and if other companies want
to stay competitive we're probably gonna
see new products from them as well
personally I'm really excited for son
Heiser because I'm willing to bet we're
gonna see I'll follow-up to their PFC
550 headphones cuz those headphones are
a little over two years old now even
though bose isn't listed as going to IFA
this year I'm going to bet they're
probably gonna announce their new buzz
QC 40 or boast you see 45 headphones
independently because their current
opposed to see 35 series 2 headphones or
on sale for like 50 bucks off at most
retailers and if you know anything about
Bose Bose headphones rarely go on sale
the last time I saw the bose qc25 to go
on sale it was shortly before the bose
qc25 series 2 were released and since
the only difference between the bose
qc25 series 2 and the original most QC
35 is the addition of the google
assistant button if bose wants to stay
competitive they're gonna have to
release some substantially new hardware
that performs better than their
headphones do now now even though Sony
is going to on your free this year I
think it's highly unlikely that we're
going to see the new Sony 1000x and
threes cuz the Sony 1000 XM twos are
just when you're all now and if you
didn't know the 1000x m2 is were
actually announced at IFA last year I
personally think is more likely we're
going to see a follow up to the MDR xB
950 n ones and if we do see a new
version of the xB 950 n ones I would
like to see them be a little bit more
low-profile have better battery life and
stay at Google assistant and quick
charging that'll be nice and speaking on
with base have your headphones
Skullcandy is also going to be there and
I'm also willing to bet that we're going
to see a follow-up to their Oh crusher
headphones so if everything plays out
we're gonna see two new bass heavy
headphones the XP 950 everyone's new
version of that and the new school candy
crush of two because the currents
crushers are also a little over two
years old now and says for the topic of
headphones a whole bunch of other small
headphone manufacturers are going to be
at IFA and I think it's a given that
we're going to see a whole bunch of new
Sports Products earbuds get announced
and IFA partially I'm not the biggest
fan of sports wireless earbuds I still
prefer to just use my power beats
because they just work all around better
but if we do see new sports wireless
earbuds featuring cual comes new chip
that's supposed to improve battery life
and bluetooth connectivity then I'll
give these new headphones out of their
tribe okay but now let's move away from
headphones and let's talk about
something a little bit more interesting
DJ hi
if you don't know DJ I actually had to
cancel their event in New York in July
last month because of some rumor problem
with their Matic too and since then
thematic 2 has just been leaked all over
the place and we basically know
everything that there is to know the
only thing that we don't know is a
release date and pricing I think it's
highly unlikely that we're going to see
DJI announced their new Mavic 2 drones
at IFA this year I think they'll
probably address the controversy but the
chances of seeing the new magic pro 2 at
IFA this year is slim to none ok now
moving on to the topic of speakers
companies like sound box and Harman Ora
going to be at IFA this year and if you
didn't know Harman is actually the
parent company of JBL I think the
chances of seeing the new choice for an
IFA this year are 50/50 but if we do see
the new choice for what I want to see is
then add a tweeter to the speaker and
fast-charging I think those are the two
features I would like most under new
charts foreign companies like a 30 sous
la gatech Coursera and razor or all of
us be at IFA and
new gaming peripherals is also a given
but staying on the topic of speakers
does anybody remember the Razer Nomo pro
I mean Razer made a big deal about it se
as last year and they said that it would
be released shortly after their Razer
normal chroma and personally I like the
region on the chroma those are these
speakers I use in my setup right now so
I think it's highly likely that we are
going to see razer announce a ship date
for their waves are no more problem
companies like Fitbit and Garmin are
also going to be an IFA and it's also a
given that we're probably going to see a
new fitness trackers but I think it's
highly plausible that we're going to see
the new Fitbit charge 3 so the Fitbit
Versa has actually been doing pretty
well I would actually like to see them
get the Versa and shrink it down to
something more charge three size I think
we're also going to see a resurgence of
smartwatches in general since Google
reamped they're aware or what I'm
expecting to see the market get flooded
with a whole bunch it's more watches
again like it was flooded two or three
years ago so these are the things I'm
looking forward to from IFA this year
new headphones from sennheiser sony in
Skullcandy maybe new speakers from sound
box and harman and probably new and
better smartwatches from a whole bunch
of different companies and shortly after
IFA apples event is probably going to
take place maybe two or three weeks
after obviously we're gonna see the new
iPhones and I'm finally gonna get an
upgrade for this whole thing but if
Apple is going to be releasing one more
thing at their iPhone event next month
aside from their premium ENC headphones
and the air pods - which have already
been leaked I think it's highly likely
we're going to see them unknowns a
cheaper smart speaker under their beats
brand and if they decide to release the
air power charging that'd be pretty cool
