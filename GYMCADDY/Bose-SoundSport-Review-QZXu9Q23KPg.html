high-quality and amazing sounding
earphones and after using the both QC 35
I can say I've been spoiled with the
amazing sound quality Bose has to offer
so do the bose sound support wireless
earphones hold up to the same standard
let's find out so first you should know
the sound support now come in two
variations you can get your base boat
sounds poor wireless earphones for 149
or you can get the Bose sound support
post wireless headphones for 199 from
Amazon let's get the monitor description
so what's the difference between the
standard version and the Pulitzer
version and nothing much except the
pulse Arjun has a built-in heart rate
monitor full disclaimer here
I'm usually bought to post a version for
review as you can see in the Box in the
video but I got two standard wireless
version instead lucky me okay enough
complaining
inside the box you're going to get your
earphones microUSB cable a total of
three different size ago tips a
traveling case is some documentation
that you can use as tinder to start a
fire in case of emergency their phones
themselves are very lightweight or made
mostly out of plastic and has a soft
touch feel to them all around they're
also water and Stroke resistant so
little water won't do them any harm the
cable itself is thicker than other
headphones I've reviewed but doesn't
transmit sound when you touch it or when
it rubs against your shirt which is good
it also doesn't tangle up which is also
good looking at the earbuds themselves
we can say they're unique to say the
least
they're Donald Trump levelled up huge
the ear tips are extremely soft silicone
and feature your fins the infants do
their best to keep the earphones in
place while you're working out the only
controller on these earphones is also
huge compared to other controllers found
on other wireless earphones the three
buttons on the controller require a good
amount of pressure to press and the
button themselves tend to move while
being pressed honestly it's an odd
sensation and I dislike this controller
compared to other ones found on the J
pad x3 or the powerbase trade the a
light controller does have an NFC chip
built-in and it makes a pairing with
your Android device super easy so what
do they sound like first off you should
note these earphones are not meant to go
inside your ear canal so they allow a
lot of ambient noise to pass through
this is great for people who go running
or cycling but not so much for people
who lift weights at the gym and want to
block out the pop music that's a
commercial Jamis blaring if I have to
hear side to side one more time I'm
gonna lose it the low end made art range
on these earphones sound great but the
bass is not a sprint use the power beats
I did notice the highs were a little
washed out but that's probably done to
avoid discomfort and wringing the
battery life on these earphones depend
on which model you get if you get
ones with the heart rate monitor built
in you should expect about five hours
battery life if you get the ones without
the heart rate monitor built in you
should expect about six hours of battery
life keep in mind your phones don't have
any quick charging feature like other
your phones on the market and they
require two hours to charge up from 0%
to 100% but like other Bose headphones
the sound support will tell you their
battery percentage every time you turn
them on
unlike Jaipur the beats by dre bose
gives you a respectable carrying pouch
it's water resistance really have to
worry about your earphones getting wet
if your band gets splashed on it also
offers some protection from minor bumps
and bruises so what's the verdict on
these headphones honestly I'm
underwhelmed by the Bose sound sport and
here's why first off the earbuds
themselves are huge tend to fall out and
I always find myself having to adjust
and while I'm working out they kept
falling out while I did my morning
cardio on the treadmill also this is the
design and the included ear tips you can
only wear them one way another
shortcoming of the sound sport is the
battery life having a maximum battery
life of six hours means you're going to
have to constantly charge these
headphones and the lack of quick
charging means if you forget to charge
the headphones the night before you're
out of luck if you're on the market for
a pair of $150 earphones I say either
pick up a pair of J Brand X threes or
hold out for the beats X I'll have a
review on those as soon as they come out
if you're on the market for a pair of
$200 headphones then I say check out the
power beats 3
those are my current daily drivers links
