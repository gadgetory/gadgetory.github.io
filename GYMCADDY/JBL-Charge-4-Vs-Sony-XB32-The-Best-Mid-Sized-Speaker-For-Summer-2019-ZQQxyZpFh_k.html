speaker, you’re probably being over whelmed
with options cause there are countless small
or no name speaker brands out there.
But today we’re going to be looking into
2 mid sized speakers from perhaps the 2 biggest
names in this space… and that’s the Sony
XB32 and the JBL Charge 4.
Even though they’re just speakers, they
do have some major differences between them
to take into consideration.
Now both the JBL Charge 4 and Sony XB32 are
brand new for summer 2019 and they both typically
retail for $150.
If you want to pick either of these speakers
up I’ll have them linked down and if you
want to learn more about either of these speakers,
please watch their full reviews.
Design wise, both of these speakers are basically
the same size… but obviously one of the
biggest things the Sony XB32 has going for
it looks wise is its built in light feature.
Its a good looking light feature that flashes
to the beat of your music and through Sony’s
app you can select from a few different lighting
modes.
But unlike the JBL Charge 4 which has a mostly
fabric covered body, the majority of the XB32
is covered in a soft touch plastic and only
the front grill is covered with a fabric mesh.
Now looks are subjective and I don’t mind
how either of these speakers look, but since
the XB32’s body is mostly soft touch plastic…
expect it to show much more wear and tear
than the JBL Charge 4.
But both of these speakers are fully water
proof so you don’t have to worry about either
of them if you drop them in the pool or if
it starts raining.
Now tech spec wise, the Sony XB32 has an advertised
battery life of 24 hours and the JBL Charge
4 has an advertised battery life of 20 hours.
But realistically, with the volume on both
of these speakers set to 80% the JBL Charge
4 managed to last for 11 hours where as the
XB32 only managed to last for 8 hours.
But keep in mind if you were to turn off the
Extra Bass mode and the light feature on the
XB32 you should be able to stretch out the
battery life on the XB32.
But what I’m trying to get at here is that
even though on paper the XB32 seems like it
has a longer battery life than the Charge
4, in reality they’re evenly matched.
But one of my biggest pet peeves about the
Sony XB32 and sony speakers in general that
I think is super important to point out is
that when Sony speakers get down to 20% battery
they’ll drastically lower their volume,
say please charge every few minutes and they
won’t let you raise their volume past 50%
until you put them back on the charger.
I find this to be super annoying, and you
can’t turn this feature off.
But when it comes to charging these speakers
there is a huge difference.
The JBL Charge 4 charges via a USB-C port
which I think is great especially if you’re
an android user… and it also comes included
with a decently long cable.
Where as the Sony XB32 is still using a micro
USB port for charging which kind of sucks
if you’re an android user cause you can’t
charge your phone and speaker with the same
cable.
And while we’re here I thought I’d also
mention that both of these speakers have a
USB A out port so you can charge your own
devices and they both still have an audio
jack.
Both of these speakers are also still using
Bluetooth 4.2, but they have some very different
performance differences to take into consideration.
I found the wireless range on the XB32 is
a hard stop at 30 feet, where as the wireless
range on the Charge 4 is a little over double
than the XB32’s.
Now I know wireless range isn’t a big deal
for some people, but I think it is something
to take into consideration when you’re looking
into a wireless portable bluetooth speaker
that you’ll might want to use at the basket
ball court or in your back yard.
Also, whether you use an Android or apple
device with the Charge 4 there’s going to
be a considerable amount of latency making
the charge 4 not suitable for watching videos
on your phone.
Where as if you use the Sony XB32 with an
android device you’re going to get extra
benefits like NFC paring, LDAC support, and
zero latency across the board.
And if you use the XB32 with an apple device
you’re going to see much less latency compared
to the Charge 4.
Theres still a little bit of latency, but
its nowhere near as bad as the charge 4.
But when it comes to speaker set ups these
speakers are very different.
The Sony XB32 has dual 48 millimeter frontward
firing transducers and dual passive radiators
that shoot out the front and out the back
of the speaker.
Where as the JBL Charge 4 has a single frontward
firing oval transducer and its dual passive
radiators shoot out its sides.
Now JBL’s switch to a single transducer
set up has proven to be rather controversial
over the last few months, but I feel it has
no problem keeping up with other speakers
out there.
But just so that you can see for yourself
we’re about to jump into a sound test.
Both of these speakers are playing at the
same loudness and the Sony XB32 is playing
with Extra Bass mode turned on.
Sony has obviously taken steps to improve
how their speakers sound with Extra bass mode
turned on.
In the past people have complained that mids
and vocals on Sony speakers always sounded
very muddy.
But on the XB32, the mids and vocals are much
more pronounced than before which is a good
thing.
But still, the mids and vocals on the Charge
4 are a little more pronounced than on the
XB32.
But the thing about the XB32 is that through
Sony’s app you can go in and easily change
the XB32’s EQ settings so you can make it
sound how ever you want.
Where as with the Charge 4, JBL doesn’t
let you change its EQ setting as easily.
But in general both of these speakers are
good sounding speakers cause they both have
a decent amount of bass even though the XB32
does have a little more bass than the Charge
4 and distortion isn’t a problem at higher
volumes on either of these speakers.
But when it comes to max volume, the charge
4 does manage to get slightly louder than
the XB32.
But finally, one of the biggest things to
take into consideration when choosing between
the JBL charge 4 and Sony XB32 is their speaker
pairing protocol.
Both Sony and JBL let you pair up to 100 speakers
together so that they can all play in sync.
But to be frank, Sony’s wireless party chain
isn’t the most reliable or easiest to set
up.
First you gotta go to all of your Sony speakers
and press the WPC button and then you gotta
go into your phone, open up Sony’s music
center app, press on the party chain tab and
hope that all of your speakers connect.
And even if your sony speakers do manage to
all pair together sometimes they’ll get
out of sync when you’re playing music.
Which means you’ll have to turn off all
of your sony speakers and pair them all up
again.
Where as JBL’s JBL connect plus is much
easier and much more reliable than Sony’s
Wireless Party chain.
All you gotta do is press the JBL connect
plus button on all of your speakers and the
speakers will figure the rest out all by themselves.
You don’t have to open up any other apps
and they never get out of sync.
So from my experience if you plan on pairing
multiple speakers together on a regular basis
I highly advise you invest into JBL’s eco
system cause Sony’s Wireless party chain
can be a headache.
So over all, if you just want one speaker
I suggest you go with one of Sony’s speakers…
but instead of getting the Sony XB32 I highly
advise you save yourself some money and get
yourself the Sony XB31.
The Sony XB31 is currently going for $100
and in many ways I feel its superior to the
newer Sony XB32.
And if you want to see exactly what I’m
talking about please watch the XB32’s full
review.
But if you plan on picking up multiple speakers
in the future then I think you’re better
off with the JBL Charge 4.
JBL Connect plus is in my opinion the best
speaker pairing protocol out there, and keep
in mind the JBL charge 4 has a much farther
wireless range than the XB32 and its still
slightly longer than the XB31.
And finally the JBL Charge 4 also has USB
C charging which in 2019 I think its a must
have.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
