watch I really did the run AQ was
supposed to be the smart ones made by
runners for runners but sadly there are
so many software bugs playing the run IQ
right now that it makes it hard to
recommend right now
although the 1aq is a partnership
between you balance and intel should be
both share the blame or is one word for
more than the other the unboxing
experience from the run IQ is very
similar to the new Fitbit inside the box
you're greeted by the 1xq watch face and
context outlining its capability love to
tab and you'll find a Quick Start Guide
in some warranty documentation and under
that you'll find the charging cradle and
USB cable new balance set out to make a
SmartWatch that was perfect for runners
a SmartWatch that could stand on its own
track your runs with its integrated GPS
have built-in storage so you can play
music directly off of it and have a much
more accurate heart rate sensor than any
other SmartWatch on the market they even
designed the UI and you like so that you
don't even have to touch the screen to
log laps while running and it did a
great job when it comes to the design of
the watch you get a fully circular
screen that's easy to see in those
conditions to watch band stainless steel
and is super rugged its water resistant
down to 5 atmospheres of pressure and it
has wristbands that are very easy to
swap out but it's huge and heavy and I
find it really hard for women wanting to
wear this watch this little Dwarfs or
smaller wrist and the respect that comes
with the run IQ feels pretty cheap as
well compared to other smartwatches on
review one of the biggest issues
plaguing the 190 right now is the
battery life the run IQ is advertised as
having a 24 hour battery life with
typical use or five hour battery life
with continuous GPS and heart rate
monitoring turned on but even with light
use I was lucky if I was able to get
through half the day without needing to
put the run IQ on a charger actually the
run IQ has an even worse battery life
than the Apple watch used to what's
supposed to make the 1 IQ stand out
above the competition is the inclusion
of the built-in Strava support and the
run IQ app the run IQ app is very well
designed and is a pleasure to use at a
glance you can fuse distance heartrate
cadence and time and you simply have to
press the side button to log elapsed the
Straubel app on the other hand is pretty
much useless all it really does is just
send your data to its mobile app but
neither app really matters since the
watch's GPS connection is spotty at best
and a spotty GPS connection isn't the
only problem
the one acute consulate is going to
alone forcing you to routinely
restarting watch so that I can reconnect
your phone one thing I did notice was
that if you have either one IQ or
struggle running in the background of
the watch expected to language scrolling
through other cards in Android wear like
a lock the running cue is currently
running android 1.0 but should be
upgraded to Android 2.0 sometime in the
future although the 1aq is best one pair
with an Android phone you can still
connect with an iPhone you just lose a
lot of the functionality and you really
just end up getting notifications on
your wrist overall it's hard to
recommend the running key to anyone
right the second battery life is very
poor the watch constantly disconnects
from your smart phone GPS connection is
body and the watch needs to be restarted
regularly perhaps most of these issues
can be solved through software patches
or when the running queue gets upgraded
to Android 2.0 we might need to revisit
this product once they get to Android
2.0 because right now it feels like it
was rushed out the door hey if you made
it this far I hope you enjoyed the video
