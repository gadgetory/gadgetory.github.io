it's a good sounding midsize speaker for
somebody who really likes bass heavy
music it has a built-in light feature on
the front and it's very reasonably
priced and now there's a sony xba-1
it's not entirely new but it's much more
refined so here are the improvements on
the sony xba-40 one here's what I like
what I don't like and you really have to
run on an upgrade if you already have
the Sony X be the sony xba-1 sits right
in the middle of Sony's new portable
speaker line up in a retails for one
$49.99 and the XPS 31 comes in 4
colorways black blue red or white the
outgoing XP 30 is now going for 90 bucks
if you want to pick up either of these
speakers I'll have a link of description
below and if you use the link really
helps out the channel personally I think
90 bucks for the XP 30 is a very good
deal and I highly suggest you check out
the XP 31 because so many speakers
routinely go on sale so you might get
lucky at a glance the Sony XP 31 is just
a reskin Sony XP 30 they have a tentacle
speaker setups
they're both rocking 1.8 9 inch diameter
transducers and dual passive radiators
that fire out the front and out the back
and you'll get a better visualization of
the speakers at work when we get over to
the water portion of the video both of
these speakers also have identical light
feature setups elationship on the front
and strobe lights on the sides the
biggest difference from the XP 30 to the
XP 31 is design the XP 31 has a much
more sophisticated yet futuristic look
to it with the fabric mesh covering the
whole body and a light strip that wraps
the front and the size of the speaker
whereas the XP 30 has a much more
industrial look to it with it's exposed
speaker pizza middle grill and stuff
those material covering its body
partially I prefer the new design
language of the sony xba-40 one it's
much sleeker than you control buttons or
small but they are very easy to tell
apart
they have great tactile feedback and
they do their job just fine I like how
the light feature extends to the sides
and in general the light feature on the
sony xba-40 one looks much better than
the one on the XP 30 the light feature
on the XP 31 is much more vibrant and
easier to see in brighter environments
and I read
like the new vertical pattern built into
the light strip whereas on the XP 30
it's really only worth using the light
feature if you're in a dimly lit room or
at night and regarding size the XP 31 is
just slightly longer and slightly
thinner than the XP 30 and for those
wondering both the XP 31 and XP 30 can
either be laid flat or on their sides
and surprisingly the XP 31 does a better
job of staying upright than the XP 30 if
the XP 30 gets hit by the slightest tab
it'll topple over but the XP 31 is much
more resilient another improvement the
XP 31 has over the XP 30 is just its
overall durability the XP 30 is IP x5
Raiders so a splash of water here in
there won't harm it but personally I'm
gonna submerge it just to be safe and
since the speakers are so exposed I
would really try to be extra careful not
to get sand in it if I were to take the
XP 30 to the beach the XP 41 on the
other hand is ip67 rated and that means
two things
it's dustproof thanks to the fabric mesh
on the front so dirt or sand isn't going
to be a problem and it's waterproof so
submerging it isn't going to be a
problem either and I also found that it
floats which makes retrieving it much
easier if it falls into a pool or a lake
another improvement the XP 31 has over
the XP 30 is the way you charge it the
XP 30 uses a 5 volt DC input so if
you're going to be taking the XP 30 with
you somewhere you have to bring the
charging cable along and you better not
lose it but the XP 31 now charges
through a mic USB port and this is great
you can use any micro USB cable you have
lying around the XP 31 does come with
its own short mic USB cable but
unfortunately it doesn't bring a wall
adaptor so you're gonna have to use your
own one of these speakers also have a
USB out we can charge your own devices
and they both have an ask Jack if you
want to use a wired connection all of
these speakers advertise a battery life
of 24 hours and they perform pretty much
the same but advertised battery life is
very different from actual battery life
I can hit 24 hours to play that time on
these speakers with the leg feature
turned off and with the volume set at
50% but that's no fun what the life
feature turned on and what the volume
set at 80% I a bridge eight hours of
playback time which is still pretty good
and when I say eight hours of playback
time I mean eight hours until either
these speakers get to twin
some battery because unfortunately they
actually 31 still does that thing that
when it's battery gets to 20% it will
stop the music say please charge and
then we'll continue playing music but no
louder than 50% volume you need a charge
personally I hate this feature but I
guess it's there to help you prolong the
life of your battery and like I
mentioned earlier both of these speakers
have identical speaker setups and they
sound exactly the same the only
difference I managed to notice between
these two speakers is that the xB 31
manages to get a little louder than the
xB 30
we'll win
like I said at the beginning of this
video these speakers are a great option
for people who listen to a lot of bass
heavy music rap hip-hop EDM and so on
but if you listen to rock or to
something with a lot of emphasis on
vocalists then you're going to think
these speakers sound a little money in
their default setting these speakers are
going to put an emphasis on the bass and
they're going to push the mix back a
little bit the bass on the speaker isn't
going to punch you in the chest like to
go go home max does but the lows do get
pretty deep and these speakers do a very
good job of preventing major sound
distortion with clear Audio plus enabled
but if you go into Sony's music center
app and go through the settings you'll
find a preset mode called a live sound
and I like to call this the JBL button
when live sound is turned on the bass on
the HP 31 is tamed down a little bit
maids in vocals or broad front and
center and the trouble gets dialed up a
little bit as well this mode is good for
rocking vocals but I do find you're a
little more prone to sound distortion at
higher volumes but it's nice to have
options but unfortunately the XP sorry
doesn't have this setting but you can go
and adjust the equalizer on either of
these speakers directly from the app as
well even though I love bass in my music
there are times where the bass on these
speakers can get a little overwhelming
and for those situations I would just
turn off the extra bass feature on the
XP 30 with a single tap the HP 31
doesn't have a dedicated extra bass
button anymore but you can turn off the
extra bass feature by pressing and
holding the play and minus button
simultaneously for a few seconds until
the power indicator light turns green I
usually turn off the extra bass feature
when I'm going to watch just getting
news or listen to your H 3 H 3 podcast
in the background Sony's app also allows
you to choose from a few different
lighting modes and both of these
speakers shared the same light settings
as well there's rave mode where the
light strip and strobe lights will flash
to the beat of your music
there's chill which is my favorite where
the light strip will gradually change
colors there's a rave mode without the
annoying strobe lights off to the sides
and their strobe which looks much better
on the XP 31 then it does on the XP 30
and there are a few other color settings
to choose from as well but even though
the light feature on the xB 31 is much
better than the one on the SP 30 Sony
doesn't allow you to customize it you
can't then the light feature and you can
choose your own colors so
Fiesta Bowl AB which used to connect to
the XP 30 and gave you some
customization options now when can I
take either these speakers and it's a
shame because there's so much potential
here regarding connectivity and both of
these speakers are using bluetooth 4.2
and they both have a range of about 50
feet with direct line of sight before
the signal starts to stutter and at
closer range I really don't have any
connection issues at all but in my
testing I did notice the xB 31 has
slightly less latency when watching
video compared to the xB 30 there's
still a little bit of latency but is not
as bad as the xB 30 since we're on the
topic of connectivity you can pair up to
a 100 Stoney speakers together
anything from the xB 20 all the way up
to the xB 90 and the newer xB 31 does
pair up with the older xB 30 and they'll
play in sync but unfortunately the xB 31
and xB 30 won't play in left and right
stereo mode in order to get that going
you need to have two of the same
speakers if you want to learn how to get
party chain going on these speakers
check out my tutorial
both of these speakers also have an NFC
touch points so pairing is a little
easier if you have an Android device and
you can be connected up to three devices
at the same time on something else on
the xB 30 doesn't have this party
booster maybe some thing I guess you can
make your own beat even though I really
do like the new Sony XP 31 I think there
is still room for improvement first up
let's talk about ads because if Sony
wanted to they could fix that with a
software update Sony's Music Center app
can be a pain in the butt sometimes due
to connectivity issues so nice - ballade
is an eyesore and a nightmare to use but
I really do want to have more
customization options regarding the
light feature on both of these speakers
I also think it's ridiculous I can't get
stereo sound going with the XP 30 + XP
31 given that these sound exactly the
same and I think all of these issues can
be fixed over a software update and here
are the
hardware improvements I would like to
see on the sony xba-40 one first up I
would like to be able to cycle through
the four main light settings directly
from the speaker like a can on the JBL
pull three rather than having to open up
the app every single time right now you
can only turn the light feature on or
off by pressing and holding the battery
button I would have also liked if the
speaker used a USB C port instead of a
microUSB port but still kept to you as
the a port as well I would like to be
able to charge the speaker through the
USB C port but also be able to use the
same port to charge my pixel to excel or
get a wired connection going with it as
well and I would like to have the USB a
port just in case I need it but still I
really like the new Sony XP 31 they got
the Sony expedient it up and refined the
overall look if you already have the XP
30 you don't really have to go and
upgrade unless you're constantly taking
it on the go with you
the xp for the ones added durability and
ability to charge via on mic USB cable
should make life a whole lot easier if
you're looking for a bargain and you're
only interested in sound I would still
pick up the XP 30 before they're gone
but I think the Sony XP 41 is the whole
package whether you like bass or one an
emphasis on vocals the XP 31 can do both
it's super adorable and it has a much
better life feature if you made it this
far I guess you enjoyed the video so hit
