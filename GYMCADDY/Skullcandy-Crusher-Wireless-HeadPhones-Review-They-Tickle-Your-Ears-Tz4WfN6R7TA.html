basic and some people have said that I
should review the school candy crush or
wireless headphones so that's what I'm
about to do and if you're also a
basehead or those school candy crush or
Wireless right for you we're about to
find out don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe and you can watch some of
my other videos here after you're done
watching this video the skull candy
crush or wireless headphones have been
on the market for a while now and at
first they used to retail for one $99.99
but now you can get them for around $150
or a little less from those places and
they come in two colorways black or
green 10 but I think the black ones look
way better if you want to pick these
headphones up I'll have links in the
description below and I'll keep it
updated so you can get the best view
possible first I have to give credit
where credit is due the build quality of
the Skjold candy crusher for the price
point is amazing the majority of the
body is covered in soft touch rubber
there's a sturdy stainless steel
headband and there's absolutely no
shifting or squeaking of the surface
panels when bending flexing or folding
these headphones the build quality of
these headphones is better than some
headphones that retail for $300 like
this JBL Everest elite 750 NC but I
think the school candy crusher falls
short when it comes to the padding and
breathability of the ear cups and
headbands sure the padding of the ear
cups is plush but I feel the full
leather surrounding the memory phone
traps too much heat like a lot of other
headphones these fold up for storage but
they cannot lay down flat the ear cups
themselves can't pivot back and forth
very little but they do not swivel and
there are exposed wires on either side
but personally I like the industrial
look of it there are only three buttons
on the right ear cup to control your
music playback in activate Siri and on
the bottom of the left ear cup there's
an on second USB port for charging and
unique to the school candy crush sure
this is a slider on the left ear cup to
adjust how much base these headphones
have the school candy crushers also come
included with some good quality cables
but I want to bring some attention to a
soft shell carrying case again at this
price point the included carrying case
is amazing it reminds me of one North
Face jacket it's rough polyester outer
shell but the inside is so furry and
plush I just love
my hand in there there's also pockets on
the inside so you can keep your cables
organized the south shell carrying case
included what the Crushers is way better
than the one including them they're
slightly more expensive Sony xb9 50 n 1
now when it comes to tech specs these
headphones have an amazing battery life
they advertise a battery life of 40
hours but on slim I've managed to get
more than that at lower volumes
nonetheless a 40 hour battery life is
impressive unfortunately there is no
quick charging and when it comes to
range I've managed to keep a clear
connection with my phone up to 35 feet
away that's pretty standard there is an
onboard microphone for calls but your
voice might get a little too echoey at
times and you really have to speak up so
people on the phone can hear you when it
comes to comfort I don't think these
headphones will shoot everyone these
headphones have a lot of clamping force
and it causes some discomfort in the jaw
line after some time I did hope these
headphones would break in after a while
but even after testing them for two
weeks there's still some discomfort and
since that your cuffs don't swivel or
give it too much that your comes on
what's on my head like they should and
not to mention that your comes to warm
up very fast I can't wear these
headphones for a long periods of time
when it comes to sound quality these
headphones are called the school candy
crusher because they will crush your
head with all debt-based but too much
space can be a bad thing if the slider
is all the way up the basis is going to
muddle the overall sound but it does
tickle your ears but the mids and highs
are also still too forward in the highs
new cost constant discomfort I think
these headphones sound best at around
70% volume with the slider at around a
little below the halfway mark but
something I've really don't like about
these headphones are the controls in
order to skip a track or go back a track
you have to press and hold the plus or
minus button for three seconds I hate
what headphones do that cause it takes
too long I would have much rather double
pressure or triple press the center
button it's much faster and is much more
efficient and even though these
headphones claim to be noise isolating
the passive noise isolation on these
headphones do not do a great job of
blocking out
the outside sounds they even allow a lot
of sound leaking so much so that when I
was on the bus in New York people
repeatedly asked me to turn down the
music so that might be a problem for you
if you plan on commuting with these
headphones or use them at school or at
the office and as a side note even
though you can't remove the ear patch
off of these headphones for cleaning it
takes a lot of finesse and patience to
put them back on so just be warned in
conclusion I feel school candy is on the
right track to something amazing I
cannot say enough good things about the
build quality of the school candy
crusher and it's included carrying case
but school candy needs to go in and
rework the headband and they need to add
some range of motion to those ear cups
so they sit correctly on people's heads
they also need to improve the sound
quality on the crusher like Sony did
from the XP 950 bTW to the XP 950 and
one they cleaned up the bass in the
overall sound quality battery life on
the crusher is amazing I'll give them
that and bass heavy headphones really
don't need active noise cancellation
skull Kennedy just needs to make some
minor changes through the crushers to
have some spot-on bass focus headphones
and I wouldn't mind if they also change
to buy new layout but who knows with
info going on in Europe and CES and a
few months Skullcandy might announce an
updated version of the skull candy
crusher and third time might be the
charm but right now I wouldn't recommend
these to someone look for headphones hey
