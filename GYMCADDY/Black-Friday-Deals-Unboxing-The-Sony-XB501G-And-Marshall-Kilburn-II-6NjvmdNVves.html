to another live unboxing if you're new
here this is a series where I unbox a
product live because there have been
times where I've been completely blown
away or disappointed on the first time I
unboxed a product case in point the
Skullcandy venues when I first some
boxes products those headphones I like
them at all but vice versa when I
unboxed eSchool candy crush or 360s I
love these things these things are my
favorites base head headphones right now
so today oh and again since we're doing
it live you guys are going to get my
real first impressions and raw reactions
answers were doing it live you guys can
interact for me through the chat so you
can ask me questions about these
products or some other products and also
since Black Friday is almost upon us I
thought would give you guys on a heads
up as to what to look for coming this
Black Friday so today we're gonna be
unboxing oh actually do me a favor
pass me that black speaker right there
that's standing off the JBL one next to
a red one next to the red one that one
there you go thank you okay so actually
last week I released the JBL charge for
reviewing that been actually doing
pretty well and then I also released the
vs. video of the best mid-sized speakers
for 2018 and that lineup was the JBL
charge for the sony xba-40 one ue boom 3
and who else was there's upholstery so
now we're going to be unboxing the
Kilburn r2 and the actually surprise
announcement from
back into that a few months ago is this
guy the sony srs XB 501 Gina this is a
Google assistant enabled smart speaker
and honestly I did not see this coming
because you know it's a kind of odd
product given that it's 50 dollars more
than the xB 41 so all three of these be
um both of these speakers or $300
speakers that could potentially be
thrown the JBL extreme - were my
favourite portable large speaker now I
categorize the extreme two differently
then the boombox chasm just because of
its sheer size so so yeah um you know
pretty interested to see how Z you a
Marshall Kilbourne to does against the
extreme - and I also want to see what
Sony's new speaker is all about this is
like a um it's it's bigger than the xB
41 smaller than the Sony XP 64-bit
that's what she said I just lucked into
that okay let's get these things out of
the box
Wow actually let's do a poll do you guys
want to see the kilburn to come out
first or the sony what is this a Sony XP
501 G come out cameraman what are we
getting here in the comments um Kabam
killer yeah I'm a little killer
alright so while we've unboxed get this
guy out of the box I actually want to
answer a really good question that I got
on the way my post today the question
was do I think the the bose qc25 series
- or the Sonia 1000 XM 3 are going to be
going on sale this Black Friday honestly
I think it's very possible or very
likely that the Bose headphones are
going to be going on sale actually oh
wow oh man this little bag is like super
nice it's not that big either
people I just walked into that one
so this it's a lot lighter than I
expected it's actually it's lighter than
the extreme two and I love these knobs
this is pretty nice but um yeah get him
back to to thee oh look at that strep Oh
the strap is built-in I was like a like
a big man purse so and we got him back
to the headphones I think it's very
likely that the bose qc25 sore going to
be going on sale maybe because they went
on sale back in August or back to school
and since Boas is doing like all of this
marketing for their Bose headphones on
TV with these commercials I don't think
we're gonna be seeing the post QC 45s
anytime soon so I think it's very likely
that the both species and father would
go on sale on Black Friday maybe for
$300
which was and sends Bose and Amazon have
like this same kind of relationship
where Bose really promotes really
advertisers are there Alexa and echo
dots with their with their speakers I
think I think we are gonna see the what
is this oh okay okay all right good good
you got you got a plug for the state and
you got a plug for Europe I did not I
thought I thought they sent me the wrong
speaker for us so so yeah
if you see 35 so we're going to be going
on about $300 Black Friday and you know
I didn't expect a new pair of Bose
iPhones to come out for like another six
months maybe who knows it might get
announced that see us 2019 that's
another possibility as for the Sony
headphones to go on sale I think it's
very if marry 50/50 the 1000x and threes
are just so good I think Sony knows that
they don't that they don't need to put
those headphones on sale and just cuz
they're that good and I don't think
sales are really suffering pretty apart
to get but given that it is Sony they
could go on sale just so that they can
take advantage of the Black Friday
madness and and I actually says I'm
talking about selling so much it is I I
fully expect how do you turn this thing
on
do you check the back just like
completely dead oh yes the dead up no
bake notice okay that's cool look at
there's a battery gauge volume bass knob
trouble and actually what if it closed
turn that down yeah yeah this thing is
like just completely then the box but
yes and Sony's since I will do you
expect the XP 31 and xB 41 to go on sale
this Black Friday
I think these this was probably gonna go
for like a hundred bucks
this is probably go for a 150 because
this the xB 41 / - he goes on sale for
like 150 so Black Friday if those were
on sale though so Nizar
if you just want a single speaker but
definitely definitely I do expect to
know what shows someone who tends to go
on sale this Black Friday so I would
definitely pick up these guys cuz for
prime day these guys went on sale for
$100 that's 50% off so I would
definitely scoop these up if they go for
that type of price again cuz that's
Pandey they haven't been on sale for
hundred bucks they been on sale for like
150 sometimes 120 but as for like $100 I
haven't seen him something I'm using the
boombox will go on sale um actually yes
if you extreme tuned for the for a few
for a few days now it was was on sale
for like 200 to 60 SEC SEC SEC that was
on both on JBL JBL site and Amazon and
the boombox even though it retails for
450 sometimes it goes on sale for 370 so
so I do expect the boombox to go as well
okay so first off in Stoney fashion this
packaging is not as nice as Marshalls
again the Harman Kardon onyx studio 5
I haven't even looked into that one but
I know I should get it a little bit more
oh cool I know I should get a little bit
more into Harmon given that on JBL and
Harmon or basically the same thing JB I
was like the funner brand and Harmon
it's like the more professional brand so
I know I should definitely get into
those a little bit
but I also expect the Sennheiser 44.50
BT and C's to go on sale those are
another really good pair of two homes
are all the headphones and you know I
kind of hate myself for taking almost a
year to get to those headphones cause
like I didn't review them because in the
product pictures I thought they were
ugly but when I actually got them on
hand and like wore them there they're a
really good pair there they're a really
good pair of sounding headphones and a
really good-looking pair of headphones
and plus their build quality like I said
it's it's Freddie spectacular for 200
all headphones compared to the watch
watch a 700 these these perform good
these have a lot of good features but
their build quality
you know it's give and take if the
extreme tube goes on sale how much new
thing will be for for about 260 260 260
cuz they were he was going on sale for
260 260 and that was they wrecked from -
sexy woody what are your favorite
headphones my favorite headphones for
commuting traveling 1000x and threes but
for like just having a good time
the crusher 360s I love these things
they're like their build quality
they look like beat the like D beat
studio sessions but they're built a lot
better they fit a lot better the only
thing is is that they don't get too loud
but but if you just want bass and you
want to have a good time
these are great for a good time this is
great to like black the whole world out
I can see I want to see what this looks
like
power on
so one thing I just noticed is you gotta
try this guy through an AC port and some
well actually the AC port for the X
before you want to fill in the box I
don't took it off this is just use a
micro USB actually can we charge this
with the USB C port yeah because this
thing has now this is 12 volts this
isn't going to do it cuz this has the
USB C port and an AC port with the X
beef what do you on one of the things I
really like about it oh okay
DSP 401 one thing honey I'm your Google
assistant oh you can ask me questions
and tell me to do things and get started
download the Google home Mac all right
I'm gonna need you to shut up I mean
like I was saying if I was really
interrupted all the reason I like the ex
before he wants so much is because you
can charge it with an AC through the AC
port or you can charge it through the
micro USB port and this thing I all
exclusively charge through the micro USB
point and let's see what you see that
orange cube thank you let's see let's
see if we can charge okay because one of
the things with the charts for the
charts form is not all that different
from the charge three if you have to
charge the way you don't have to upgrade
but the one of the biggest differences
on the torch for is that it charges with
a USB C and like I said in the full
video you can only use that USB C port
to charge you can't I mean yeah to
charge you can't use it
of that report you can't use it to
charge your own devices I'm gonna see is
this charge oh it's charging it's
charging it's probably gonna take
forever you're gonna give me a zoom in
right there it's probably gonna take
forever and a half but you can charge it
I wonder if okay so you can't use that
port to charge this guy it's probably
gonna take forever but there is no USB a
out sure if you want to charge your own
devices you're gonna have to use an USB
C - USB C so it's whatever it would have
been great if it had a USB C port and a
USB a port but can't be beggars here
what is that C would you recommend more
the boombox - extreme - uh boombox if
you just want to use it at home and like
rarely ever take it home and obviously
if you have the room the extreme - it's
good like I would get the extreme - if
you're gonna use it half at home and
have take care on the go
but again just room is a really big
thing to take into consideration because
the boombox I just don't have room for
right in my room so so I actually like
using smaller speakers like to charge
three or the mega boom three those were
smaller those are smaller speakers are
gonna take up less space so obviously
space is a big thing to take into
consideration but actually took this guy
out you see it's not it's not - it's not
much it's actually it's narrower than
the
to that the footprint is bigger and it's
a little taller but you know I I think
if you have room for the extreme to in
your room you should have room for a G
what is this thing D 501 gene for the
501 G I actually want to see if we can
play around with the lights up here this
okay so that's on that's because we're
gonna have to use the app to to like
change its things but yeah guys so the
501 G is basically a shrunken down X to
be 16 it's a plastic case metal frame
very similar to the older sony xba-40
except the XP 40 XP 30x be 20 those were
soft on a soft touch shells
this is just straight plastic so
definitely you want to be careful
whenever you're transporting this like
let's say in your car you throw it in
your car you want to be careful it's not
like rolling around cuz this this could
possibly scratch but um that's one of
the reasons why I like these fabric
shells more cuz I no matter what you do
these things can take a beating this
thing it can't it looks like it's pretty
tough but it's not gonna be as tough as
a fabric shell and obviously Sony went
with a plastic shell to save on costs
now I'm not sure if the these are these
are too big to be tweeters no right I
think these are too big to be tweeters
those are probably just more nothing
could be tweeters I gotta look into
exactly what that is we got a war on the
bottom and then those are those are
standard transducers but yeah yeah
okay any other questions going on there
or what nah nah going on here make this
fun actually go ahead and use see I
don't think so okay it seems like fully
charged the only thing that drives me
completely crazy about these sony
speakers is that like you can be playing
music and then whatever they get to like
twenty percent volume huh what's that
called I think I have to use the Google
app to like pair it up no no is it that
like Sony that way this RS XP yep got it
so again one of the things that drives
me crazy about Sony speakers is that you
could be playing music with them and
then when when it hits like 20 percent
volume it's just gonna like stop your
music go say say please charge and then
put your music at 50% volume and then
it's gonna start saying please charge
like every minute or so so so like you
have no other option than to put it on
the charger so that's one of the things
I hate oh so many speakers I haven't
been able to turn it off have you been
able to hook this up there's four
versions of it now there's four versions
of it you know what I think we have to
use the Google home app to
but um actually let's go ahead line this
up real quick so here's what you guys
can expect in the next few in the next
coming days so there's gonna be a proper
kilburn to review followed by a sony XP
501 G review there's definitely a lot of
questions going on regarding this Sony
speaker and then there's going to be a
vs. video of these three guys see which
$300 speaker is the best $300 speaker
because like the Killebrew tune has
design and design build quality here
might be objective
no no subjective here we're gonna have
to see how the features already are here
on the XP 501 gene and you know see
which one of these 300 other speakers is
the better speaker now because for the
last few months
JBL extreme 2 has been the one to get
cuz I remember when I reviewed the LG
pk7 that speaker was a disaster it was a
disappointment it had a similar set up
to the extreme - but it just didn't
perform anywhere near as good as the
extreme - and then after this video is
out these three these three videos are
out we're going to be getting the
windows surface headphones so I'm
actually pretty excited to see what
those are all about see how they compare
up against these guys oh what's up I'm
in your that Hecker voice I'm in you
just hacked it uh yeah what do you want
it was like asking this like a whole SAT
question
you are you this is just too much
are you gonna compare the GBO boombox
and Marshall Kilburn to you know the box
is this big the Kilburn to is this big
but if you guys want i'll put I'll put
the sound test lineup I'll throw the
boom box in so you guys can like get an
idea of like the sound test going on
there because I think there's the stand
more to and to stand more to fun
corrected if I'm correct would be better
also you gotta be fair you can't be
throwing in of this huge speaker with
the tiny speaker but but yeah so we got
any more questions where we're gonna
call it a night
let's call a night tonight let's call it
a night
all right guys um so cameraman has
homework to do so we're just gonna leave
it there thank you guys so much for
joining us on these uh first impressions
on these news speakers you guys got an
idea of what's coming up remember Black
Friday definitely if the 107 interns go
on sale for a hundred bucks
or the Sun has a 4.5 ob TNCs pick those
up I fully expect the xB 31 to go on
sale if you just want one speaker pick
that up if the extreme two goes on sale
for like 260 pick that up but on other
than that guys thanks for watching I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
