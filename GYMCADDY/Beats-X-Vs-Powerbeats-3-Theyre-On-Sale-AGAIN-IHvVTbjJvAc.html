feet long cable but hey that's just an
estimate it's so fashionably late beats
act and in the other corner with the
battery life that just won't quit
it's the tried-and-true power beats 3
now that the beats X are finally
available everybody under shadow is
asking if they should get the new Karam
of black beat X or just goes to power
beats 3 and the answer is follow your
heart okay in the video bye hey if you
made it this far I hope you enjoyed the
video if you couldn't no no I'm kidding
it really comes down to what you're
planning on using them for but for a lot
of people prices the ultimate design
factor the beat decks currently retail
for 149 95 and they come in 4 different
colors on the other hand you can pick up
the Black Power beats 3 for 1 $49.99
with free shipping from amazon link for
that is in the description below but if
you want the multicolor power b3 then
those will cost you $200 these earphones
do have some similarities between them
the most important one is that they both
have apples and UW wants it then eww one
chip helps with battle performance and
allows for extremely easy pairing with
Apple devices once your phone pairs with
the iPhone they'll automatically pair
with all other devices associated to
your iCloud account which means you can
easily switch from your iPhone to your
Mac without having to constantly very
fearful
another feature they share is fast fuel
you can get to our two playback time
from just 5 minutes of charging on the
beat X or you can get one hour of
playback time from just 5 minutes of
charging on the power beats 3 the
biggest difference between the power
beats 3 and the beats X is the form
factor to be checked or long and wrap
around your neck your lightweight and
flexible so wearing them isn't an issue
the beats X are grateful wearing almost
anywhere whether you're out and about at
the office or at the gym they also
include someone slips for a more secure
fit if you need them the power beats 3
on the other hand have a completely
different form factor and have ear hooks
no matter what you're doing or how
intense your workout is the power base 3
will not fall out of your ear although
both earphones are considered in-ear
earphones they do fit differently the
beat X go in a little deeper into your
ear canal and create a much better feel
which results in far superior passive
noise isolation which might interest you
if you plan on wearing these on your
morning commute to work the smaller form
factor and the power base 3 on the other
hand make them much more comfortable to
work out it also keep in mind the power
of ik 3 or water and dust resistant
while the beats X or not although both
of these earphones are beats by dre
products they don't sound
saying after listening to the same songs
from the same source back to back I have
to say I prefer the sound quality from
the beat sax over the power of these
three they aren't flat but the Orion has
based heaviest apparently three so sound
qualities which are interested in then
go for the B Tech battery length is also
a factor when deciding between the beats
X and the power B 3 as mentioned earlier
both your phones feature FAFSA which is
a great feature if you constantly forget
to charge your earphones like I do but
on a full charge of power beats we can
get you a full 12 hours whereas the B's
X have a maximum battery lines of it out
also the way you charge these earphones
is different - since Apple engineers
designed the B start from the ground up
to be textured via a lightning port
which means you can use the same cable
to charge your iPhone and your earphones
on the other hand the power beats 3
charge of your micro USB cable which
means you have to keep track of another
cable so which is you get if you're
looking for some things to exclusively
work out it not have to worry about your
earbuds falling out under any
circumstance something water-resistant
or you want something with some long
battery life then get the power be free
but if you want something you can wear
casually at the office at home or
something that sounds pretty good then
get the beatstep
just remember no matter which one you
choose Apple still win hey if you made
