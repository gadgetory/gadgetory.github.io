powerbeats 3 they have a long battery
life they sound peace then and they have
Apple's new w1 check which make using
them with other Apple products seamless
and they have quick charging but after
using and reviewing the you a sport
wireless heart rate earphones I can't
decide which earphones I'd rather work
out with so today I'm going to put the
power base 3 up against the underarms
sport waters heart rate earphones for
starters 2 power beats 3 come in a few
colorways but the black ones usually
retail for one $49.99 alright Amazon and
Amazon randomly puts all the other
colorways on sale from time to time did
you play sport while is heart rate on
the other hand only come in two
colorways black or white but also retail
for 149 ninety-three if you want to pick
either one of these up I'll have links
in the description below with the best
deals the Sun wise these earphones are
pretty similar they both have ear hooks
which I really like and prefer over fin
if stay in place in most circumstances
and are highly adjustable they both have
a wire connecting the two earphones and
they both have inline controllers with
very tactile buyers and that's pretty
much where the similarities end
first let's talk about their fit the
power of these three are in your
earphones while the ear tips on the JBL
are meant to simply rest on the ball of
your ear which results in a lot of
ambient noise getting in don't get me
wrong the power beats also don't have
good noise isolation but it's a lot
better than the JBL and the sound
quality between these two earphones are
also very different the power beats
three sound way better than the you a
sport wireless heart rate and like I
said in my initial review the JBL sounds
very tinny
and have no bass so if you're looking
for sound quality get to power b3 these
earphones also have very different value
lies the power beats three have a 12
hour battery life which can get you
through multiple workout sessions for me
it's usually around 3 or 4 depending if
I do cardio or not and they have fast
fuel which will get you an hour playback
from 5 minutes of charging the UI sport
Wireless on the other hand only has a
five hour battery life which is usually
only good for about two workouts but
that battery has to power much more than
your average ones earphones be JBL
earphones also have a built-in heart
rate monitor which I'm a huge fan
sure they're not the only earphones with
a built a heart rate monitor but they
execute on the feature better than most
combined with Under Armour's record apps
these earphones manage to
one side the data they collect and give
you very insightful information about
your workout and performance and as a
lifter I'd rather have my HRM in my ear
than my wrist when I work out I want to
be surprised if Apple incorporates a
heart rate sensor into the next
generation hobby
rumor has that they are also trying to
add that feature into the next
generation of the airplane and having a
heart rate monitor built into the car
before will be a good selling point to
upgrade from the targets three
connection-wise the Under Armor sport
wireless heart rate connects your phone
with bluetooth for that too and they
have a 30-foot range with direct
line-of-sight to your device the power
piece we on the other hand have Apple's
w1 chip which allows for very simple
pairing and seamless use between your
other Apple devices like laptop
Apple watch or iPad using Apple's w1
chip just makes using your headphones on
multiple devices pain free and finally
we've got the caring cases if you've
been following the channel you know how
much I dislike the included cases you
get with the power these three and the
beat sack I just think they're so cheap
and they will do much the JBL earphones
also come with a silicone case that's
very similar to the power beats but they
actually zip up so let's wrap this video
up shall we
the you a sport wireless hard way don't
sound good and they have a crappy
battery life and they don't have quick
charging but the reason I really like
them is because of their built-in heart
rate monitor and comfortable fill and
Under Armour's app does a really great
job of displaying that information to
you unlike any other companies that have
earphones with built-in heart rate
monitors but I know that for the general
user the power beats 3 is a better match
especially if you have an iPhone the
power beats 3 sound better than these
JBL have a 12 hour battery life have
fast feel and they had that w1 chip but
just keep in mind the power of these 3
aren't the best sounding sports your
phones out there if you're looking for
amazing sound quality you're gonna want
to look into the J Brand X 3 I'll have a
link in the description below for that
