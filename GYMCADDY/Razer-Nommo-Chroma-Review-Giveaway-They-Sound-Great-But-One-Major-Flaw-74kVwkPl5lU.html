most speaker line-up and although I
don't have time to play video games
I can appreciate their design and
aesthetics although they do perform
pretty well they do have one major
Achilles heel but I still like them so
much I'm gonna do a giveaway just like
the video be subscribe and comment down
below with what's your all-time favorite
video game and as soon as this video
hits 2,000 likes I'll take a letter
razors no more speaker line-up consists
of three models there's your base razor
Nomo speaker for $99.99 there's the
razor Nomo chroma which is the speaker I
have here for one $49.99 and then
there's the razor Nomo Pro for $499.99
now there are some key differences
between the base Nomo speaker and the
Nomo chroma aside from the RGB base
which I will go into in a minute but
these first two speakers too are
currently available for sale if you
wanna pick either of them up I'll have a
link in description below and if you use
the link it really helps out the channel
and they'll release a for the Nomo Pro
is still to be announced the razor
normal coma comes included with two
cables the power cable and an audio
cable the other two cables on the Numa
chroma are not removable and personally
I would prefer if they were braided now
the main difference between the base
hundred-dollar normal speaker and the
$150 Nomo chroma aside from the RGB
goodness is that the Nomo chroma
connects to your computer via our USB
port and has a built-in DAC whereas the
base normal speaker connects your
computer via a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
but everything else is still the same
they both have three inch custom moving
glass fiber drivers and they both have
your firing bass poised but to be honest
if you're looking into these speakers
you're probably just going to end up
going with the razor normal chroma cause
I mean come on just look at that base on
the base of the Razer chroma you have
two knobs one for volume and one for
base when you power them on the right
base shows you the current volume
setting in green and the left base shows
you the current base setting in blue and
when their speakers are muted both bases
shine right through Razer synapse you
can choose from four different light
settings there's breathing spectrum
cycling static and wave you can also
adjust the brightness of the effects but
customization here is a little limited
if you want even more customization
options then you'll want to fire up
synapse 3 on a PC but I'm personally
very pleased by the RGB lighting
very vibrant and you can even see the
RGB effect in almost every lighting
condition now let's talk about sound as
mentioned before you have dual three
inch diameter woven glass fiber drivers
and for their price they sound pretty
good
and through Razer synapse you can also
choose from four EQ presets default game
movie and music but obviously you can
also just make your own but plainly said
the default settings sounds awful the
game preset pushes the mids back and
puts an emphasis on the lows so that
when there are explosions or shots
on-screen you feel that extra dimension
and with the base setting cranked all
the way up the normal chroma can really
start rattling things around and the
music preset isn't half bad either the
mids and vocals are brought to the front
and there's a good kick in the bass with
very minimal tuning in the highs
and like I said the normal chromosome
did better than I expected especially in
the minim 8 they have a lot of punch in
their base but don't expect any reverb
in the lows their sound stages obviously
good because of their left and right
channels but as soon as separation does
take a hit more nuanced sounds like
let's say an enemy reloading can easily
get lost or overwhelmed but bass a max
volume the nomic roma gets almost as
loud as this jbo boom box and at that
max volume distortion is minimal but
everything just starts to get
overpowered by the bass and for those
wondering there's almost no hissing when
the nomic roma is just sitting on your
desk but the following all the way up
but now let's talk about the major
design flaw found on anomic roma and
maybe even under much more expensive no
more Pro and that's between the base and
the neck of the speaker obviously due to
its design these speakers are very
top-heavy and unfortunately the
construction between the neck and the
bass is very weak my speaker fell a
distance of about 3 inches onto the top
of the desk and landed squarely on its
base but due to the torque applied to
the joint between the base and the neck
it just snapped and I'm pawned further
inspection you can see that the screws
used are just way too short and razor
used longer screws or more robust
marriage between the neck and the base
then I feel like weird enough snapped as
easily and I'm pointing this design
weakness out for a few reasons if you're
in college and if you're moving in or
out of your dorm you have to be very
careful about transporting these
speakers if you somehow topple either of
these speakers are off of your desk I
doubt they will survive the fall but
more importantly if the Noma Pro has a
similar construction then a few this
joynton will be even less effective
because the top of the normal pro will
be even heavier because of the addition
of the tweeters on the top I'm just
saying
razor needs to fix this issue cuz the
minimal effort it took to snap this
joint is just disheartening and not a
good look for overall build quality I
was very impressed with the build
quality on the razor styrene X but
personally I'm a little disappointed in
the build quality on the Razer Nomo
chroma but still I do like the razor
normal chroma they look like jet engines
on your desk but they are a fingerprint
magnet
their mid-range sounded better than I
expected and they're punchy bass gives
games that extra
mentioned that immerses you even more
and come on that our GP base is just
super cool and will be even better when
used with the synapse 3 but like I just
said they are more fragile than I would
like that neck is just such a weak point
and it makes transporting these speakers
a nightmare but let my misfortune be a
lesson for you hey if you enjoyed the
