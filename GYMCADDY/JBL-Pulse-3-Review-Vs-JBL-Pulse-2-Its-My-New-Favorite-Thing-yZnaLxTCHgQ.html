announced back at CES 2017 a lot of
people have been waiting for this thing
to drop well at least I had especially
some sense to impress when I reviewed
the foot for a few weeks ago so the day
bill told me Bluetooth speaker what the
money or is it an oversized lava lamp
let's find out don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and I'm going to
be doing a whole bunch of vs. video so
subscribe so you know when I upload
those I'm also going to be doing a sound
test at the end of this video so stick
around to that as the name implies the
debut upholstery is the third version of
GTOs post lineup a bluetooth speaker
with a built-in LED is that flash
therapy a few music the JBL poster we
went through a drastic redesign that I
personally really like you can get it in
two colors black or white and personally
I prefer the black version because I
feel I give the illusion of the light
show just floating in mid-air but the
white version won't be available until
September the speaker currently retails
for 199 95 and if you want to pick the
speaker up I'll have links in the
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deals
possible like I said earlier the jb
upholstery has a very different design
from his predecessors the pulse 2 and og
poles the JBL post to in OG poles were
basically a bigger flip 3 that just so
happened to have LEDs underneath the new
pole story still has a familiar
cylindrical design and passive base
radiators on the top and bottom and soft
touch and caster with conflicts but from
JBL but it now has in the collect top
that makes up 75% of the speaker and
hazard LEDs the lower portion now has
that tight weave mesh that also houses
two drivers on the back of the device
you'll find the power button and volume
buttons underneath the power button door
a few LEDs that act as a battery gauge
the triangle serves as a multi-purpose
button so you can control your music but
you can't go back a track you can
activate Siri by pressing and holding
the triangle blind and you can answer or
end calls there's also a button so you
can control the light show you can turn
it off or cycle through different light
patterns and JBL's connect plus button
so you can pair 101 JBL connect plus
enabled devices which sucks because I
wanted to pair 101 JBL speakers together
and under the rubber
you'll find a microUSB port for charging
in an auxiliary jack seems like JBL
doesn't have the courage to remove the
odds Jack's from his devices like Apple
did is that drug played out I don't know
tom in the comms book but all jokes
aside I appreciate the odds jack so GB
I'll keep doing to do it
concerning specs the JBL post 3 is using
bluetooth for that - and can connect the
two devices simultaneously wireless
range and upholstery is pretty good as
well it has no problem keeping a clear
connection through multiple wards and
it's good for around 70 feet with direct
line-of-sight
and nothing in the way between the
speaker and your phone and during my
testing I didn't experience any
choppiness just like the JBL flip ford
upholstery is now ipx7 certified which
means it's waterproof you can splash it
submerged under water dance at 3 feet
and will be fine
while the JBL post 2 was only splash
proof and unlike the JBL flip for the
post 3 floats which makes getting it out
of water a lot easier I do want to point
out that when I first saw pictures of
the pole story online
I thought the top portion was going to
be fragile because I assumed it was made
at a glass what it's actually a really
hard plastic and I've dropped it a few
times accidentally and it's had no
problems
overall this speaker is durable and you
can take it with you almost anywhere but
keep in mind the plastic top will get
scratched if you're too rough on it
when it comes to the JBL pulls three
versus a chaebol pulls too I really like
how they updated and streamlined the
design it generally looks better and the
light feature looks much more fluid on
the post 3 now on the pulse 2 the JBL
upholstery is now significantly bigger
than the post - and it's even a little
bigger than the charge 3 the JBL pulls 3
no longer has the color matching sensor
like the post - but it still has the
same color matching feature you just
have to go into the JBL app and you can
copy the color of anything you like with
your phone's camera it's fun to play
with but this isn't a feature I really
used love with my post - one of the
biggest issues I had with the post - is
that it was always hard to know which
button you were pressing on the back
unless you were actually looking at them
because all of the buttons are flush and
in a straight line the day bill
upholstery buttons are also flushed but
its new layout makes it much easier to
know which button you're pressing just
by touch but I still wish the post 3 had
texture blinds like the flip for battery
life all the posts 3 has been improved
from the poles to the J be opposed to
was usually
only good for around eight or nine hours
play about time what the life feature
turned on not bad from the advertised
ten hours
JBL claimed the JBL pulls three on the
other hand has an advertised bag light
for 12 hours
but in my testing I got around 13 hours
of playback time what the light feature
turned on if you play music on the JBL
post 3 with the light feature turned off
you should be able to get around 15
hours of playback time and you can
charge the post 3 your micro USB cable
and wall adapter JBL has included the
cell quality has been vastly improved on
the post 3 from the post to the gym you
opposed to only should that sound in one
direction the JBL post 3 is now 360
degree speaker and it sounds really good
for starters this thing has a lot of
bass and the soundstage is much wider
than the post to the mids and highs with
crisp and I haven't noticed any turning
in the highs and there's very little
sound distortion or rasping it's when
the volume is set all the way up in
general this is a really good sounding
speaker the pole story has no problems
on the bedroom and it covers a good
amount of area if listening to it
outdoors but for the best sound I would
put the post 3 in a corner like I
mentioned earlier the JBL post 3 now
also has JBL connect plus aside from
being able to pair up to 100 JBL
speakers together you can also pair too
JBL police because together and have
them play music in stereo mode and even
have light features sync up having JBL
connect plus means you'll be able to
pair our other JBL connect plus enable
devices like the foot 4 and future JBL
speakers together and have them play
music from the same device
simultaneously it's good if you want to
fill a larger area with music but as
right now you can't pair the post 3 or 4
to older speakers using JBL connect I've
heard about an update that's supposed to
come out but I haven't been able to pair
my post 3 to my post 2 or might charge 3
if I'm doing it wrong please comment
down below JBL is mobile app for their
speakers is among the best set up is
easy and you can do things like many
settings check your battery status and
manage multiple speakers if you have
them paired together you don't really
have to use it often but J builds app is
a little different for the post 3 in the
pulse 2j bills connect app allows you to
play with the life feature of your pull
story
for starters you can adjust the
brightness and obviously the brightness
of the lights feature will play overall
in the speaker's battery life you can
also cycle through different light
settings they all flash to the beat of
your music but they all do so a little
differently there's wave jet explosion
equalizer rave rainbow fire and you can
even make your own and you can change
the color of each setting either through
color matching with your camera or you
can use the color wheel and if you flip
the post three upside down the light
feature will orient itself personally my
favorite light setting is either jet or
explosion but comment down below and
tell me which light setting you like
best the microphones debut upholstery is
also decent you can take a phone call
and talk normally if you're within a 5
or 7 foot radius of the device I have to
get a few phone calls using the jb
upholstery and nobody has really even
noticed I was talking to them through a
speaker which is pretty good overall the
wait was worth it for the table pulls 3
if you're considering upgrading from the
pulse 2 to the JBL post 3 I think you
should
aside from now being a 360-degree
speaker the upholstery sounds much
better overall it sounds clear there's
very little distortion and there's a
whole lot more bass the battery life has
also been improved and still ipx7
certified and not to mention the lecture
looks way better but like I said earlier
I do wish it had ways bind so it's
easier to know what you're pressing and
I wish there was a USB out so I could
charge my phone if I had you like on the
JBL charge 3 but in general I think
you'll be really happy if you decide to
pick up the JBL pulse 3 regardless and
for your listening enjoyment here's a
sound test for the JBL pulse 3 I'll be
going through some different genres and
switching between light features
obviously you're now going to get the
whole listing the experience of the JBL
post 3 through your speakers but I hope
this helps
