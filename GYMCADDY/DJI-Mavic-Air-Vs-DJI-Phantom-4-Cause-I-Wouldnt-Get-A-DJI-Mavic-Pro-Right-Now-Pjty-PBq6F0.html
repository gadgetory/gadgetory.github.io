be care vs. Matic pro video cuz
everybody's done that and I think the
Matt McGarry is better than the current
Matic pro and I don't think it's a good
idea to get a Matic pro right now cuz I
think the second generation maverick Pro
is gonna get released in the next six to
eight months what I'm interested in is
Mavic error versus the DJI phantom4 cuz
if you know what it look you can get
these two for almost the same price
remember this isn't a full review on
either of these drones I'm just trying
to point out the most important
differences between them so I can help
you with your purchase decision if you
want to learn more about these drones
then watch their full reviews now to be
clear this is the DJI phantom 4 not the
Phantom 4 advanced with the upgraded
camera or the phantom 4 pro with the
extra sensors on the sides and rear the
base DJI phantom 4 usually retails for
1119 dollars but I actually got this
phantom 4 for seven hundred thirty five
dollars brand-new and the brand-new DJI
Mavic era is currently retailing for
seven hundred ninety nine dollars if you
get the base package if you want to pick
either of these drones up I'll have a
link to the description below and if you
use the links it really helps out the
channel check them out cuz DJI Jones
sometimes go on sale so you might get
lucky okay so let's talk about what's in
the box were both of these drones both
drones come with one battery or
controller two full sets of propellers a
power brick and cables to charge the
batteries and controllers and they both
come with accessories like gamble
protectors other cables and a carrying
case only the Phantom 4 comes included
with an SD card but it's only a 16 gig
SD card so it's not gonna do you much
personally I think you need at least a
32 gig SD card for either of these
drones and just putting it out there the
Mavic air does have eight gigs of
internal storage but if you're shooting
in 4k is not really gonna do you much
now let's get the obvious stuff out of
the way the Mavic air is tiny compared
to the phantom 4 in its folded state
thematic air is smaller than the phantom
force controller it is super easy to
travel around with the DJI Medicare if
you're going somewhere even if you're
not sure if you're going to need a drone
or not you're now going to mind to bring
the Medicare along with you because it
just takes up so little space you can
in your jacket pocket or just drop it in
your backpack with the DJI phantom4 you
kind of have to plan your day around it
it's a big piece of equipment to lug
around and it's carrying case does not
help the cause and since we're talking
about the case the phantom force case is
made out of horse styrofoam just like
the sparks case it'll protect your drone
just fine and it's still very
lightweight but in order to put the
Phantom 4 inside its case you do have to
take the propellers of what the Mavic
garrett you just fold it up drop it in
zip it up and you're good to go and when
you're going to fly all you have to do
is unfold it and take off but now let's
talk about the most important thing on
these drones and that's the camera both
of these cameras or house in the 3 axis
gimbal system the DJI Mavic air is
rocking a 1 over 2.3 and CMOS 12
megapixel sensor while the DJI phantom 4
is rocking a very similar one over 2.3
in CMOS 12.4 megapixel sensor both of
these cameras have a 2.8 aperture and
they both have an electronic shutter but
the DJI Mavic era has a field of view of
85 degrees and the Phantom 4 has a
slightly wider field of view of 94
degrees but image quality is much better
on the smaller mafic air colors are much
richer on the medicare or where as the
colors on the phantom 4 is much cooler
you're really going to have to play
around with the settings and in post
with the video captured on the phantom 4
and just putting it out there the camera
sensors on the Mavic Pro and Matic pro
Platinum are very similar to theirs in
phantom but if you were to go for the
phantom for advanced then you'll get an
upgraded camera with a one-inch CMOS 20
megapixel sensor with adjustable
aperture and a mechanical shutter which
means more detailed better low-light
performance and sharper and less
distorted video when flying at high
speeds
concerning video resolution both of
these drones can shoot in 4k 30 frames
per second 1080p 60 frames per second
1080p 30 frames per second and they can
both capture slow-motion video at 1080p
120 frames per second but to phantom 4:1
ups to Matic error by being able to
shoot cinematic 4k video up to 25 frames
per second and basically cinematic 4k is
just a little wider than normal 4k but
since I posted 16 by 9 I don't really
use it now both of these cameras do have
other video resolutions
to choose from but these are the ones
that matter the most me capturing 4k
video is especially useful on the zone
because you'll be able to zoom in on
certain subjects in post without losing
too much detail but personally I really
like shooting in 1080p 60 frames per
second because it means smoother video
now when it comes to photo the Mavic air
wins again just like before colors on
the MAV acara are much richer than the
colors and the Phantom 4 but something
the DJI phantom 4 completely lacks it I
feel every drone should have or panorama
modes the DJ automatic air can shoot
vertical panoramas horizontal panoramas
180 degree panorama and my personal
favorite spherical panoramas and the DJI
Medicare is able to take the necessary
pictures for these panoramas Zen system
together in a matter of seconds so
there's not much waiting around and even
though they're high winds thematic air
is able to keep itself steady and
produce some stunning images being able
to take horizontal or spherical
panoramas at a moment's notice is one of
the main reasons why I always carry
around my Medicare just to make things
simple if a camera on the MAV acara is
better than the camera on the Phantom 4
right out of the box but when it comes
to the gimbal system the Phantom 4 is is
still superior the first thing is is
that if you're flying in normal mode
with automatic air and then switch to
sport mode you're going to get this jerk
that's going to ruin your shot whereas
with the Phantom 4 it has no problem
switching from one mode to the other but
while in sport mode the props on the
Phantom 4 will show up if your camera is
pointed too high up and if you're flying
very aggressively then the gimbal on the
Phantom 4 does a better job of keeping
your video smoother than the magic air
now when it comes to comparing battery
life range and flying dynamics this is
where things start to get very
interesting and it's why you should take
into consideration when choosing between
the DJI Medicare and the DJI phantom 4
DJI medicare has an advertised battery
life of 21 minutes and like I've said in
past videos my Medicare average is about
18 minutes of flight time while in the
NYC winter where temperatures are
between 20 and 40 degrees and the DJI
phantom 4 has an advertised by relief of
28 minutes but again in the NYC winter
I've been averaging about 23 minutes the
greater performance is normal for
batteries in cold environments so
hopefully I'll get that 21 minute flight
time on my Medicare in the spring and
some
when it comes to charging these drones
both batteries require a proprietary
cables and you have to remove them from
their respective drones to charge them
but the 2375 milliamp battery on the
Maverick era takes about 50 minutes to
fully charge while the phantom 4 is five
thousand three hundred fifty milliamp
battery takes about an hour and 20
minutes to charge having the slightly
longer flight time on the phantom 4 is
nice but the answer 7 minutes isn't
really that important to me before I
take off with either of my drones I
usually have a flight path planned out
for what I want to shoot I feel that
longer flight times are really only
beneficial if you're flying far out and
just getting b-roll range in
connectivity is another very important
thing to take into consideration but
these are I'm AdvoCare has an advertised
range of 4,000 meters or 2.5 miles when
used with the controller but that's on
their ideal conditions with minimal
signal interference and with direct
line-of-sight but in highly populated
areas with lots of radio signal
interference as with a lot of tall metal
structures I've been averaging about
1200 meters on my Medicare before my
video feed gets too choppy and I don't
know what I'm doing but DJI phantom4 has
an advertised range of 5000 meters or
3.1 miles or under ideal conditions and
it does a much better job of keeping a
consistent connection at a longer range
the video feed might stutter for a
second or two but it comes right back
but if you're a content creator shooting
yourself or tracking the car while it
drives down a canyon road or if you're
shooting a building I don't really think
having multi mile range is that
important unless you're going for an
epic landscape shots or again getting
b-roll flying dynamics is also very
different on these drums the Maverick
error is tight and precise but the
phantom 4 is like trying to direct the
boulder that's sliding on ice while in
their normal flight modes both of these
drones have a very similar limiter speed
of about 80 miles per hour or 8 meters
per second and in sport mode the MAV
acara tops out at a speed of 42 miles
per hour or 18 point 8 meters per second
while the Phantom 4 acute su top speed
of 45 miles per hour or 20 meters per
second but at these higher speeds the
Phantom flora is much harder to control
because of all of its mass whereas the
Mavic air is much more nimble things
with smaller size but the Phantom 4 is
able to gain and lose altitude much
then the manicure which is again great
if you're trying to capture landscape
shucks into it makes it a little easier
because it takes some advocare a long
time to get up and down both of these
drones are also have built-in sensors
that help prevent you from crashing the
phantom 4 hands forward and downward
facing sensors that will prevent it from
crashing into something directly in
front of it or below it but if you're
flying from side to side or backwards
you're on your own
the Mavic air on the other hand has
sensors on its front belly and rear so
we can detect obstacles in front of it
below it and behind it having these
sensors on the way of thematic means you
won't crash into stuff when flying
backwards but you're still prone to
crashing if you fly from side to side
something that I do on a regular basis
to get panning shots the Mavic arrow
also has a new feature called advanced
pilot assistance systems or AAPIs for
short and when this features turned on
the Medicare will automatically avoid
obstacles all you have to do is tell us
a fly forwards and it also works when
flying backwards granted the Medicare
will drastically slow down when it's
automatically avoiding these obstacles
but it's still impressively nonetheless
whereas with the Phantom 4 you don't
have this feature and just as sheer size
makes it very hard to fly in tighter
spaces and finally let's talk about the
controllers the controller on the
Phantom 4 is larger than the Medicare
and it's controller combined but you do
get for a better signal range and
stability with it than the Medicare and
if you wanted to you could also mount a
tablet so you can better position your
shots but with the Phantom 4 you can
only fly it with a set controller
whereas if the Mavic air you can fly
with the controller or with gestures oh
something that makes life much easier if
you just want to take a quick picture or
if you just don't want to carry the
controller around when you're avid about
with thematic air so if you're in the
market for a drone and you have $800 to
spend you can either choose between
thematic error or the Phantom 4 and in
most cases the DJI Navigator is far
superior to the Phantom 4 it has better
image quality it's much more compact
it's much easier to fly and it has those
all-important panorama modes but I still
think there are some people who might
benefit from the phantom 4 thanks to its
longer flight time farther arrange and
more stable connection if you plan on
getting a lot of landscape shots or if
you just need a longer flight time then
I would consider
though phantom4 but for everything else
the Medicare is the way to go it just
comes to show how amazing this little
guy actually is
