designed active noise-cancelling
headphones but let's see how they
compare against what I fuel or the best
ANC headphones on the market right now
for 2017 and 2018 the sony 1000 XM twos
well the PX take the title from the 1000
X M 2 s let's find out don't forget to
like comment and subscribe and you can
watch either these headphones individual
reviews here after you don't listen this
video remember this isn't a full review
on either of these headphones I'm just
trying to point out the most important
differences between them so I can help
you with your purchase decision
regarding price the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px
are slightly more expensive than the
Sony 1000 XM 2 retelling for $400
whereas the Sony 1000 XM 2 currently
retail for $350 but Sony routinely put
their products on sale so who knows
maybe they'll randomly go on sale for
$300 sometimes so if you want to pick
ease of these headphones up I'll have
links in the description below and I'll
keep them updated so you can get the
best deal possible check them out
because you might get lucky
first off let's go over build quality
and design obviously these headphones
are very different from one another and
I feel the BMW px are the best looking
headphones I've reviewed on the channel
so far the PX have a stainless steel
body ballistic nylon around the ear
comes in headband love it that feels
very smooth and soft after it's been
broken in and there's a pretty cable
that runs down the sides of the
headphones the air comes swivel and
pivot very smoothly and there's no
cracking or squeaking when flexing the
headband there are a pair of very
well-built headphones that are just as
much a fashion statement as they are
audio equipment whereas the Sony 1000 XM
2 or more about functionality the
premium materials used on the PX does
make them a little heavier
weighing in at 335 grams whereas the
sony 1000 XM to weigh in at 277 grams
it's not a big deal but it is noticeable
the 1000 XM choose are mostly made out
of plastic have a thin stainless steel
headband and they have synthetic leather
on the ear pads headband and outer
portion of the ear cups the ear cuffs
also pivot swivel and fold up very
smoothly and there's no cracking or
squeaking wind flexing the headband but
the build quality on the Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins px is just on a whole other
level now regarding the headband
cracking issue on the Sony's I know some
people might be wondering about after
two months of heavy usage I'm happy to
report there's still no cracking on the
1000x m2s
now when it comes
to comfort the Bowers and Wilkins px or
not for the cranially gifted as an if
you have a big head like me they're not
for you the PX have a good amount of
clamping force and even after they've
been broken in they do cause me some
discomfort in the jaw area after a while
they're wearing them but if you have a
smaller head you'll be just fine whereas
the 1000x and chews will fit basically
everyone but the ear cup designs are
very different they both go around your
ears but the 1000x and chews feel more
cramped with a whole bunch of padding
pressing against your head whereas the
PX does a much better job of encasing
your ears now in case design of the PX
give your ears a lot more room and the
padding doesn't overheat as much and
just putting it out there the bose qc25
to are still more comfortable than both
of these headphones the ear cups have a
similar in case design as the Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins px but they have much less
clamping force than both the Sony and
the BMW okay let's get into tech specs
both of these headphones are all using
bluetooth for that one and they both
have aptX HD audio which really only
matters if you have an Android device
but the powers of Wilkins px have a USB
type-c port whereas distorting 1000 X
and twos are still using a micro USB
port also the B&amp;amp;W px can be connected to
two devices at the same time whereas the
Sony's can only be connected to one
device at a time and for premium
headphones in 2017 and 2018 being able
to be paired to multiple devices at one
time should be a no-brainer and Sony
should have thrown in a USB type-c port
instead of using the older port but the
Sony 1000 X and tools can be used
passively with the wired connection
whereas the px have to be powered on
even if you want to use a wide
connection also the 1000 X M twos have
NFC whereas the PX is don't but since
google just announced fast pairing I
don't think it's that big of an issue
now when it comes to battery life the
Saudi 1000 X n2 is the winner when noise
cancellation turned on I typically
average about 32 hours of playback time
and with noise cancellation turned off I
averaged about 38 hours whereas the BMW
px has an average battery life compared
to other headphones on the market when
noise cancellation turned on I typically
average about 24 hours of playback time
and with my lease cancellation turned
off I averaged about 30 hours and
unfortunately the biodome Wilkins px
doesn't have quick charging which could
be a problem if you find yourself with a
dead battery while traveling
whereas the Sony 1000 ex
- does have quick charging but it's not
the best out there if you plug them in
for 10 minutes you'll get about 70
minutes of playback time I mean it's
better than nothing right regarding
noise cancellation I like them both very
much for two very important reasons they
both have very little to no cabin
pressure and they don't have any hissing
when you're not playing music they pick
up very little wind noise as well but
the baritone welkins px does pick up
less wind noise than the 1000 X M -
actually the px pick up the least amount
of wind noise of all the ANC headphones
I've tested so far you can also adjust
how strong you were like the noise
cancellation to be on both of these
headphones through their apps and you
can also adjust the amount of ambient
sound you would like to let in which is
good for safety reasons if you're
walking around in the city or so people
can still get your attention if you're
working at the office or at school but
overall the noise cancellation on the
sony 1000 XM - does outperform the noise
cancellation on the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px
although the px do a really good job of
blocking out constant low-frequency
sounds it's not as good at blocking out
chatter like the Sony 1000 x &amp;amp; 2
also if you want the 1000 x &amp;amp; 2 can
automatically adjust the noise
cancellation depending on what you're
doing which is something the PX can't do
right now
even though the Saudi 1000 xn2 does have
the better noise cancellation the Bowers
&amp;amp; Wilkins px does have the better sound
quality in general the PX having even
sound signature which is what how do you
fellas prefer even though you can adjust
the EQ of the Sony 1000 accent 2
directly from its app something you
can't do with the px unless you use a
third-party have the definition clarity
and soundstage on the Sony isn't as good
as the BMW px going back to the design
of the ear comes on the PX they do a
better job of in case in your ears and
provide an overall better listening
experience the lows get much deeper and
the highs are much more precise but this
is what noise cancellation turn off on
both headphones if you turn noise
cancellation on then the sound quality
of the px does stick Tyrian of it the
soundstage narrows up a bit in the lows
don't get as deep or as the 1000 XM to
sound equally as good with noise
cancellation turn on or off so both
headphones with noise cancellation
turned on are pretty evenly matched the
PX only noticeably sound better than the
1000 x m2
when noise cancellation is turned off
but nonetheless both headphones sound
good I'm just trying to be hypercritical
both of these headphones will also have
some unique features to consider the
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px have wear sensors
and they're basically proximity sensors
in the middle of each ear cup the idea
is that when you put them on they'll
automatically turn on and played music
and they'll automatically go
to a low-power mode when you place them
around your neck or place them on the
table and if you have them on and you
take a one ear cup off to listen to
someone talking to you they'll
automatically pause your music so you
can hear your surroundings and they'll
resume playing when you put them back on
although in theory this is cool it's not
perfect just yet sometimes I'll
headphones will start pausing and
playing your music randomly but
hopefully Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins will fix this
issue with a software update soon but
personally I prefer to use the
headphones with the wear sensors turned
off in the Sony 1000 XM to have quick
attention and this is my favorite
feature by far if you have your
headphones on and someone is talking to
you all you have to do is cover the
right ear cup and the headphones will
lower the volume of whatever you're
listening to and let all of the ambient
sound in so you can talk to someone
without having to remove your headphones
and when you uncover the right ear cup
everything goes back to normal like I
said I love this feature and it's much
sleeker than Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins solution
also real quick when it comes to the
microphone on either these headphones
but 1000x time to you sound better but
if you want to hear microphone test on
either of these headphones check out
their full reviews picking a winning
here is going to be harder than usual
because I really like both of these
headphones but if I had to pick just one
I would go with the Sony 1000 XM 2
excluding comfort cause like I said
earlier the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px aren't
the best for people with bigger heads
the Sony 1000 XM to have the better
battery life they give you more
customization options through their app
and the noise cancellation is slightly
better I feel the 1000 X and 2 is the
safe option for most people but the
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px are still a great
pair of anc headphones for people whose
main concern is sound quality like I
said earlier the px sound better than
the Sony's but only with noise
cancellation turned off and the px are
the best looking headphones I've
reviewed so far
comes to my ANC headphone standings it
would have to go first place Sony 1000
XM to a really close second place goes
to the BMW px and third goes through the
both QC 35 to is cuz they have amazing
comfort but again this isn't a full
review on either these headphones I'm

important differences between them so I
