refinement and durability I really like
the new Sony XP 31 and sony xba-40 one
but I think the new Sony NEX b21 is just
okay personally I still very much prefer
the older so many XP 20 or regardless
let's see how the new Sony has to be 21
stacks up against everybody's favorite
JBL flip for the answer will actually
surprise you keep in mind this isn't a
full review on either of these speakers
I'm just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with your purchase decision
if you want to learn more about either
of these speakers then watch their full
reviews the Sony XP 21 is the newest
speaker here and it currently retails
for $99.99 the JBL flip 4 was released
in the spring of 2017 and retails for
$99.99 as well but can usually be found
on sale now and the outgoing Sony XP 20
can be had for about 70 bucks if you
want to pick either of these speakers up
I'll have a link the description below
and if you use the link it really helps
out the channel check them out cos Sony
and JBL speakers routinely go on sale
one of the reasons the JBL 54 has been
so popular is because of its durability
its fabric mesh body does a great job of
standing up to everything you throw at
it it is ipx7 radius so the flip for it
isn't afraid of a lot of water on the
other hand last year's XP 20 is the most
fragile speaker here it's soft rubber
body is very easy to scratch up and it's
only IP x5 rated so a little splash of
water here and there isn't going to be a
problem but I wouldn't submerge it and
due to its exposed because designed sand
and dirt can easily get trapped behind a
metal grill but now technically the sony
xba-1 is more durable than the flat for
its ip67 rated so it can be submerged in
water just like the floor and thanks to
the new fabric mesh the XP 21 can take a
beating just like the flip 4
personally I don't think the flip 4 has
an official dust and dirt reading like
the xB 21 because if it's exposed
passive radiators on the sides but sand
isn't really going to be a problem if
you take the flip forward to the beach
Sony's attempt at adding extra
durability to their new speakers
resulted in them making the XP 21 looked
very similar to the flip floor but like
I said on the full review I don't think
the XP 21 looks all that great
I think the flip floor looks much better
than the XP 21 and I still think the xB
twice
is the best-looking speaker here with
this built-in life feature but one tiny
little feature that I flip for has that
the other two speakers don't is this
little rope you can be surprised at how
handy this rope can be sometimes all
three of these speakers also have the
same ports on the back and our Shack for
a wired connection and a microUSB port
for charging the foot for also has the
advantage regarding battery life what
are the world use with the volume set at
80% the floor will average about 700 to
play that time under the same conditions
the xB xx and xB 21 will average about 6
hours of playback time but keep in mind
that's what the live feature turned on
if you use these speakers with the light
feature turned off and have a lower
volume then you'll be able to get
significantly longer battery life when
it comes to speaker setups both the xB
xx and xB 21 have 1.65 inch diameter
transducers and dual passive radiators
that shoot out the front and at the back
the JBL flip 4 is also rocking very
similar 1.5 7 inch diameter transducers
but it's dual passive radiators shoot
out the sides
so fast
please
personally I still think the ex b20 is
the best sound speaker here for the type
of music I listen to the JBL flip for it
sounds clearer because it puts an
emphasis on the mids and has more
trouble but I like to be something xB 20
now Jamie offered for also has good I'm
gonna base the xB 20 has more of it and
even though the xB 21 has as much base
as the xB 20 the xB 21 frequently likes
to get most out but if you open up
Sony's music center up then you can
adjust the equalizer settings on both
the XP 20 and xB 21 but when you use
your own EQ settings you do give up
clear Audio plus so when I use the xB 20
or xv-21
to listen to your culture too with the
extra base feature turned on and with
clear Audio plus turned on I don't get
too much distortion at higher volumes
now you can activate low frequency mode
on the floor for added bass but I hope
forward using that setting because
there's a lot of distortion at higher
volumes and regarding which speaker gets
the loudest and max volume first place
goes to the xB 22nd goes sort of the
four and the ax B 21 comes into the last
if I were going to choose just one of
these speakers I would actually go with
the xB 20 I really do like the
industrial exposed speaker design and
the light feature is an added bonus and
for the type of music I listen to I
prefer the xB 20 but I would only get
the xB 20 if I didn't plan on taking it
on the go with me to places if you plan
on traveling a lot with these speaker
then I still think you're better off
with the JBL flip for you can't go wrong
with the flip for if you're looking for
a small portable bluetooth speaker
somehow sony took a step backwards with
their ex be 21 but for the JBL 4-5 I
would really like to see a USBC port and
maybe quick Georgian I think JBL can set
themselves apart from Sony's new speaker
lineup if they introduce quick charging
to their lineup if you made it this far
