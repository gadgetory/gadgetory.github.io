companies are trying to cram in as many new
features as possible into their latest Premium
ANC headphones.
The latest ANC headphones do more than just
play music and block out noise.
And since these companies are constantly competing
against each other for your money… the bar
for what to look for in a pair of premium
ANC headphones has been raised for 2019, which
is great for us consumers.
So today we’re going to be looking at the
Sony 1000XM3, the Microsoft Surface Headphones,
and Jabra Elite 85H’s cause I feel these
headphones meet the bar for new headphones
being released here on out.
Now before everybody starts asking where’s
the Bose QC35, Sennheiser PXC550, or Beats
Studio 3’s I feel it would be unfair to
include them in this video cause they don’t
have all of the features that meet the bar
for ANC Headphones in 2019.
Im not saying you shouldn’t get them, but
its safe to assume Bose, Sennheiser, and Beats
Slash Apple might have new headphones in the
pipe line.
So if you want to pick any of the newer headphones
mentioned in this video those will be linked
down below.
And if you want to learn more about any of
these 3 headphones please watch their full
reviews.
Now obviously the first most basic thing that
new ANC headphones being released in 2019
should have is USB C charging…
USB C charging is a big deal cause if you
have an android device you can charge your
phone and headphones with the same cable.
But more importantly, USB C usually means
better fast charging performance.
The Sony 1000XM3’s have fast charging where
if you charge them up from a dead battery
for 10 minutes they’ll get you 5 hours of
playback time.
The Jabra Elite 85H’s also have similar
fast charging where they’ll get you the
5 hours of playback time, but instead of in
10 minutes, they’ll do it in 15.
But unfortunately the fast charging on the
surface headphones just doesn’t compare
to these other 2 headphones.
The surface headphones can only get you about
an hour of playback time from a 5 minute charge.
But in general, the battery life on the surface
headphones is very weak compared to the majority
of headphones on the market right.
These headphones only have an advertised battery
life of 15 hours… and I feel that if you’re
looking into getting a pair of ANC headphones
these days you wanna be looking for something
around the 25 hour range.
Cause the Sony 1000XM3’s have an advertised
battery life of 30 hours, with ANC turned
on… and the Jabra Elite 85H’s one ups
that by having a 36 hour battery life.
Bluetooth connectivity is also something you
want to take into consideration.
Obviously you want headphones to have a stable
bluetooth connection that doesn’t cut out,
but you also want to make sure they have low
latency so you can use your headphones to
watch videos on your phone.
And thankfully all three of these headphones
meet that criteria.
But I also feel that all premium ANC headphones
here on out should all support simultaneous
multi device connectivity so you can easily
hot swap from your phone to your computer.
And thankfully both the Jabra and Surface
Headphones do this… but unfortunately the
1000XM3’s can only be connected to one device
at a time.
Now its not a huge deal, but it is something
your miss when you don’t have it anymore.
But just like everything else, Active noise
cancelation technology in ANC headphones has
been steadily improving over the years.
Obviously if you’re thinking about getting
ANC Headphones you probably want the ANC headphones
that block out the most noise.
But thanks to the recent improvements in ANC
technology there are a few other things to
take into consideration.
First up, you wanna look for ANC headphones
who’s ANC doesn’t have a lot of cabin
pressure, so it doesn’t feel like you constantly
gotta pop your ears like on some older ANC
headphones.
You also want to look for ANC headphones who
ANC doesn’t really change the way your music
sounds when you have ANC turned on which is
very common on cheaper ANC headphones.
And finally you also want to look for ANC
headphones who’s ANC does a good job of
blocking out wind noise which ultimately boils
down to hardware design and the placement
of their microphone array.
And thankfully, the Active Noise Cancellation
on all three of these ANC headphones meet
this new criteria.
But still, the active noise cancellation on
ANC headphones still varies from headphones
to headphones.
But so that you can see for yourself we’re
about to jump into an ANC test.
All of these headphones are running the latest
firmware updates available as of May 2nd 2019.
Like you may have just seen, the Sony 1000XM3’s
manage to block out the most amount of noise
here across the board.
But regardless, I feel that all three of these
headphones have decent Active Noise Cancellation
cause neither of them have a lot of cabin
pressure, they don’t really change the way
these headphones sound, and they all do a
good job of rejecting wind noise.
Now when it comes to sound quality, since
all three of these headphones have a companion
app where you can change their EQ, you can
make them sound how ever want depending on
the type of music you listen to.
But there are still a few things to take into
consideration when choosing between any of
these headphones.
And that’s clarity, instrument separation,
soundstage, and how good the bass kicks.
In general all three of these headphones sound
good, but if you’re looking for something
with a lot of bass than you’re better off
with the Sony’s or Surface Headphones.
Cause even if you crank the bass all the way
up on the Jabra’s its not going to kick
as hard as these other two headphones.
And when it comes sound stage and instrument
separation… again both the Sony’s and
Surface Headphones sound relatively the same
but unfortunately I do have to say the soundstage
on the Jabra’s is a little narrower and
the instrument separation isn’t as good.
But over all if I had to rank these headphones
from best to worst regarding sound quality
it would have to go Sony, then surface headphones,
and then Jabra.
But another feature that I feel all premium
ANC headphones should have here on out is
an ambient mode.
An ambient mode is super important cause this
way you can still be aware of your soundings
when you’re wearing your headphones out
in public, or so that you can hear when someone
calls your name when you’re at home or working
at your desk.
And again all three of these headphones have
an ambient mode.
But just like ANC, ambient modes from headphones
to headphones preforms a little differently.
Unfortunately, the ambient mode on the Jabra
Elite 85H’s does have a noticeable hiss
to it.
You can’t hear it when you’re listening
to music, but it is very noticeable if youre
watching movies or videos with these headphones.
Where as the ambient modes on both the Sony’s
and Surface headphones don’t have any back
ground hiss to them.
But you also want your ambient mode on any
pair of headphones to be smart enough to block
out random loud noise like a siren or dog
barking so that you don’t go def or have
a sudden jump scare… and so that you can
see what I’m talking about were going to
jump into another demo.
Major headphone warning.
Like you just saw, the ambient mode on the
Jabra’s pick up everything… so if a siren
goes by you’re going to hear it super loudly.
Where as both the Sony’s and surface headphones
actively block out these random and sudden
loud noises saving you from jump scares and
your hearing.
But besides ambient modes, most ANC headphones
these days now come with voice assistant interrogation.
For right now, the Jabra Elite 85H’s only
support Alexa, but I do hope Google Assistant
makes its way to the 85H’s cause personally
I find Google assistant to be more useful.
Cause for comparison, both the Sony 1000XM3’s
and Bose QC35’s support both Alexa and Google
Assistant voice assistant integration.
Now the
Surface Headphones also have voice assistant
integration, but they rely mostly on Cortana.
And since Microsoft is kind of stepping away
from Cortana I do hope one of the other two
voice assistants find their way to the Surface
Headphones.
But the last thing I want to talk about is
microphone sound quality cause I feel headphone
manufactures still have a lot of improving
to do, especially in 2019.
With out a doubt Jabra has the best sounding
microphone in this group.
The microphone on the Surface headphones is
ok, but I feel it still sounds a little echo.
But Sony definitely has the worst sounding
microphone here, it sounds very muffled.
And I think its safe to assume that when you’re
spending upwards of $300 on a pair of headphones
you want a decent microphone for phone calls.
But over all, objectively speaking if you’re
looking into getting a pair of Premium ANC
headphones today you’re better off going
with the Sony 1000XM3’s cause they have
the most affective Active Noise Cancelation
here, their ambient mode doesn’t have any
hissing and blocks out ear piercing random
loud noises, and they have a 30 hour battery
life with impressive fast charging.
Even though the Jabra Elite 85H’s are impressive
in their own right and are $50 less than the
other 2 headphones here.
I don’t think they are as refined as the
1000XM3’s.
And that’s ok, cause both the Elite 85H’s
and Surface headphones are first gen products
for their respective manufactures.
Both of these headphones have room for improvement.
Jabra mainly needs to focus on improving the
ANC and Ambient Mode on their headphones and
Microsoft drastically needs to improve the
battery life and fast charging performance
on theirs.
This video isn’t me comparing my top 3 favorite
ANC headphones, and I understand that for
some people the 1000XM3’s isn’t the best
option for them cause of their fairly cramped
ear cups.
In which case you’ll probably be better
off with the Jabra’s cause of their roomier
ear cups.
Im just trying to show case where the bar
for this new generation of Premium ANC headphones
being released here on out is currently set.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
