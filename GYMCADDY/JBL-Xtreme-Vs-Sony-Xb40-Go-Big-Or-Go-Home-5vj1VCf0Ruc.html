how it misses verses video I'm Veronica
right now
sony xba-40 vs. the JBL Xtreme for the
last few months so sony xba-40 has been
my go-to speaker but that was until I
got the JBL Xtreme and if you're a
little market for a larger portable
Bluetooth speaker you might be wondering
which is right for you so what about to
find out don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe and you can check out some
of my other vs. videos here after you're
done watching this video right now might
be a good a time as any typic of these
speakers up cuz they're both on sale the
sony xba-40 usually retails for $248 but
now you can get it for $198 and you can
get it in three colorways black blue or
red the JBL extreme also comes in black
blue or red and you can get it for as
low as two hundred thirty seven dollars
keep in mind the JBL extreme usually
retails for three hundred dollars if you
want to pick either these speakers up
I'll have links in the description below
and I'll keep them updated so you can
get the best deals possible for starters
these speakers are very different from
one another
the sony xba-40 is a rounded rectangular
box with soft switch rubber on the
majority of its body and a painted
little grill on the front this speaker
comes equipped with duo 61 millimeter
full range speakers and dual passive
radiators in the front it even has a
built in life feature control dials can
be found on the top edges even an NFC
touch point you can control your music
playback I just vol answer and cause and
activate Siri on the back you'll find
all rather difficult to remove plastic
garment but under it you'll find an aux
jack a charging point and one USB out so
you can charge your own devices the JBL
extreme is a little larger than the sony
xba-40 and weighs in at 2.1 kilos or a
little more than 4.5 pounds while the
sony xba-40
weighs three point three pounds or 1.5
kilos just like other JBL products the
JBL Xtreme has the same cylindrical
design it has dual passive radiators on
either side with a diameter of 63
millimeters it's also wrapped in tight
nylon mesh weave and under it or dual 35
millimeter tweeters and dual 53
millimeter transducers on the top of the
device will find your control buttons
you can do everything the sony
what he can do except you can't go back
a track like our seven past videos not
being able to go back to track by triple
pressing the play button on JBL speakers
is a pet peeve of mine it's also a very
big horrible problem on the back of the
extreme you'll find a zipper and under
the zipper you'll find three USB ports
an ox jack and a power port one of these
USB ports is used for servicing the
extreme and the other two can be used to
charge your own devices like the sony
xba-40 both of these speakers give you
the option to lay the flat or stand them
on their side but honestly I think
you're better off laying these speakers
flat for a few reasons the sony xba-40
is really easy to topple over and i find
if you stand the JBL extreme on its side
the passive radiator will hit the table
if you listen to something with a lot of
bass and causing a lot of rattling due
to the size then weight these speakers
are a little hard to take with you on
the go compared to smaller options on
the market but JBL made it a little
easier by adding hooks on the extreme so
you can attach a strap and carry the
extreme on your shoulder personally if I
were getting either these speakers I
would just use them in my room or use
them around the house when I have guests
over but if you're going to be taking
either these speakers with you to the
beach pool or lake just know the JBL
extreme is just splash proof while the
sony xba-40 is IP x5 certified you can
get either of these a little wet but
whatever you do do not submerge them I
do believe the sony xba-40 is a little
more resistant to water than to Jay bill
extreme because if you pour too much
water under extreme it's going to sound
a little drowned out until it gets
completely dry again
I'm guessing water gets trapped inside
or something concerning battery life the
JBL extreme has a 10,000 milliamp
battery and advertises about a life of
15 hours but I've managed to squeeze out
17 hours of battery life with the volume
set at 50% and asking very nicely on the
other hand I found the sony xba-40 has a
battery life of around 20 hours with the
volume set at 50% and the light features
turned on I suppose if you use the sony
xba-40 with the light feature turned off
you could get closer to the advertised
battery life for 24 hours but the JBL
extreme makes it really easy to know how
much
you've got left thanks to the battery
gauge on the front on the other hand you
have to press and hold the phone line on
the sony xba-40 and wait for it to give
you a verbal readout of its current
battery stable nonetheless if battery
life is your main concern you might be
better off with the sony xba-40 but
there is a catch if the battery on the
sony xba-40 gets below 20% it will
abruptly stop the music
say please charge and you'll have no
other option than to put the speaker
back on the charger because the volume
won't go past 30% this is a feature I'm
still trying to figure out how to turn
off I hate it but speaking of charging
these speakers both of these speakers
come included with their own power cords
if you're going to take either these
speakers with you somewhere you have to
remember to bring the charging cable
because they will charge via micro USB
cable like other portable speakers on
the market when it comes to connectivity
the JBL extreme is using bluetooth 4.1
while the sony xba-40 is using bluetooth
4.2
they can both connect to multiple
devices at the same time but the JBL
extreme does have a range of around 50
feet with the right website whereas the
sony xba-40 has a slightly shorter range
over around 40 feet with direct
line-of-sight when I did notice the Sony
NEX before t den managed to keep a clear
connection through more walls than just
JBL extreme but more importantly I did
know the sony xba-40 had a little more
lean seat than two JBL extreme this
means when watching videos with the sony
xba-40 lips and audio didn't sync up
when people are talking on screen like
right now
whereas the JBL extreme has a little
less latency and is not as noticeable
now for the moment you've all been
waiting for sound quality both of these
in my opinion or good sounding speakers
but hands-down the JBL extreme is the
better sounding of the two it has a lot
more bass in the sony xba-40 and
Amanda's to get much louder both of
these speakers have a good amount of
depth to them but the JBL extreme sounds
a little clearer than the sony xba-40 if
sound quality is your number one
priority you're better off with the JBL
extreme and I'll include a sound
comparison at the end of this video what
really sets the sony xba-40 apart from
the JBL extreme is its light feature on
the front you can control you
Sony's mobile app but keep in mind it's
not the best house out there but you've
got a few light settings like rave
chills drove right without the strobe
lights on the sides and or a few calm
options if you want to speaker with a
little flair or if you want to pimp your
dorm room out then the sony xba-40 might
be what you're looking for it's a decent
light feature but personally I think the
JBL pulls three has the best light
feature on the market right now but to
wrap things up if you want something
with a little flare slightly more
adorable slightly smaller and a slightly
better battery life then go with the
sony xba-40 but its sound quality and
loudness is all that matters to you then
you'll be better off with the JBL
extreme it's even grateful ascending
outdoors if I had to pick one I would go
to JBL extreme but I'm willing to bet
JBL will be announcing the new JBL
extreme two at CES 2018 I wouldn't be
surprised if it came with JBL connect
plus because right now it only has the
older JBL connect and can't pair with
newer JBL speakers like the foot 4 or
pole story a longer battery life ipx7
certification in sound quality
improvements but comment below and tell
me which one you have or plan on getting
okay now here's the sound test between
the JBL extreme and sony xba-40 i tried
to introduce as many constant variables
as possible
so hopefully the only independent
variable here is sound quality enjoy
are you

Wow
