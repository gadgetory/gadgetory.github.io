there Alexa compatible smart speakers
the blasted megablast JBL released their
own smart speakers under their link
series lineup but the major difference
here is these JBL speakers work with
Google assistant instead but although
the JBL link 10 and link 20 sound much
better than you easy new speakers
JBO still didn't quite stick a landing
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe
and you can watch some of my other
videos here after know what's in this
video right now there are three jpo link
speakers to choose from and they all
either come in black or white the
smallest speaker is called the JBL link
10 and a retails for 149 95 then there's
a slightly larger JBL link 20 which
retails for 199 95 and then the largest
speaker in JBL's link Series line-up is
the JBL link 300 which retails for 249
95 but it doesn't have a built in
battery and for comparison your standard
Google home typically Rito's for 130
dollars but usually goes on sale if you
want to pick either of these speakers up
I'll have links in the description below
and I'll keep them updated so you can
get the best deal possible and it also
helps with the channel the JBL link 10
and link 20 are pretty typical JBL
speakers you get the same bright orange
USB charging cable and the same wall
adapter well except with the JBL link 10
you don't get a wall adapter with that
one and I'll go into detail on why
that's a huge mistake on JBL sparked in
a few but both the link 10 and link 20
are ipx7 certified just like most other
JBL speakers which means they can get
wet without any issues they also have
the same fabric outer shells on the
front of the speaker there's some LEDs
that light up when Google starts
listening to you when you say hey Google
or ok Google on the top you've got your
control buttons to adjust your musics
volume you can toggle Bluetooth on or
off you have a dedicated button to
summon your Google assistant and you've
got a play/pause button as well
obviously if you press it it'll play or
pause your music and if you double press
it'll skip a track but unfortunately
triple pressing won't go back a track
and having these manual controls are a
very welcome addition over the Google
home with the Google home you can only
adjust the volume or play or pause your
music by using the trackpad controls but
you can't skip or go back a track you
can only do that by voice if your phone
isn't around and I just find it weird
because I feel Google
just add a swipe left or swipe right
gesture on the back you've got your
power button with the fuel gauge on top
and below that you also have a mic mute
button which will shine orange on both
the front and back of the speaker and on
the bottom you've got a rubber grommet
that houses the microUSB port for
charging but unfortunately these
speakers don't have an ox jack you can
only stream music with them over Wi-Fi
or Bluetooth but at least switching
between the two sources is pretty
seamless unlike the UE blast and mega
blast well makes the link 10 and link 20
stand out is their Google assistant
integration and it's super easy to set
up all you have to do is open the Google
home app on your phone and setup takes a
few minutes and using Google assistant
on the JBL link speakers is identical to
using it on an actual Google home
response and processing times are the
same and for those who are new to Google
assistant you can ask it questions give
it commands or control your smart home
just by asking just to name a few and
Google assistant is constantly gaining
new abilities ok Google what's the
current price of Bitcoin 1 BTC is
approximately nine thousand four hundred
thirty-one United States dollars and
thirty nine cents
okay Google Play that new gez solar sure
summer in December by gez here it is on
google play music
hey Google set the volume to 75% hey
Google stop hey Google turn on Bluetooth
alright looking for parent devices
bluetooth is connected to I phone ok
Google what's the current price of Tesla
stock Tesla stock is trading at three
hundred seven dollars and eighty four
cents per share on NASDAQ as of 12:30
1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today of
0.1 percent from yesterday and the range
of these speakers is just as good as it
is on the Google home you never really
have to shout or enunciate your words so
Google assistant can hear you hey bull
can you hear it loud and clear
hey loud and clear loud and clear
but although JBL classifies these
speakers as voice-activated portable
speakers
I wouldn't use them in the same way I
would that I use either the flip for JBL
extreme jb upholstery or so on
first off battery life on these speakers
is super weak the link 20 advertises a
battery life of 10 hours while the link
10 advertises about a life of 5 hours
and I routinely got less on both
speakers whereas the flip 4 is good for
about 14 hours the JBL extreme is good
for about 16 hours and the post 3 is
good for about 12 hours depending on how
you use it also the link 10 and link 20
don't have JBL connect plus so they
can't be paired to other JBL speakers
and keep in mind if the JBL link
speakers aren't connected to Wi-Fi then
google assistant won't work without
Wi-Fi or access to google assistant they
instantly become overpriced flip phones
that have a very bad battery life and
don't have JBL connect plus I like to
look at the JBL link Siri speakers as an
alternative to a Google home that have
much better sound quality and happen to
have a built-in battery that will last
you or short listening session cuz the
Google home doesn't have a built in
battery and not to mention these
speakers do take a good amount of
to beat up and as smart speakers are
starting to get more and more popular
manufacturers are really sorting to
focus on sound quality something Google
said that we're focusing on when they
announced their soon-to-be released
Google home acts and something Apple
said was their main priority with the
recently delayed Apple home pod and
without a doubt either of these two JBL
speakers sound way better than the
Google home
first let's talk about the Google home
if you're building out of smart home and
you plan on listening through a lot of
music then you're better off with any
other smart speaker the Google home just
isn't good for listening to music it
gets overpowered by its own bass and
vocalist sound like they're at the
bottom of well now when it comes to
sound quality between the linked
speakers and the JBL set for the next
speakers perform much better than the
JBL flip floor for sorters they don't
have as much trouble as the flip floor
and they have a much more even sound
signature they also have a wider sales
stage and more bass the highs above the
floor are also a little brighter than
both billing speakers and off before
those managed to get louder than both of
these linked speakers but at the expense
of sound quality now when it comes to
comparing the link 10 versus the link 20
the biggest difference is the sound
stage the sound stage is just much wider
and the link 20 has a little more bass
but it doesn't get all that much louder
the link 20 just has a slightly better
sound quality and deep lows in the link
10 now let's talk about issues found on
the JBL link speakers first they're
using bluetooth 4.2 which is good
they're good for about a range of 70
feet but the problem is if you're going
to watch a video using either of these
two speakers and streaming over
Bluetooth there's a significant delay to
the point that it's unwatchable whereas
with the Flipboard there's still a delay
but it's not as bad as the linked
speakers another problem I have with
these link speakers are the constant of
Wi-Fi indicator lights on the front you
can't turn them off and you can't even
them them if you plan on placing one of
these smart speakers in your bedroom
then the light can get pretty annoying
for light sleepers like me I personally
feel the Wi-Fi indicator lights should
only turn on if there's a problem with
the Wi-Fi connection because even
Google's own Google home doesn't have a
constantly on Wi-Fi indicator light but
my biggest problem or the included wall
adapter and USB charging cable for these
speakers like I said I feel these
speakers should be looked as Google home
smart speaker alternatives if you buy a
smart speaker you want it to be
listening for a hot word at all time so
when you need it it's ready to go right
then in there
and in order for the JBL link 10 or link
20 to always be listening they have to
always be turned on so obviously they
will
constantly needs to be plugged in
because their battery lives won't last
too long and also if they're inactive
for a while they'll automatically shut
off if they're not plugged in but the
included USB cables are way shorter than
the cable to Google Home has and it's an
obnoxiously bright orange it's not going
to look good if you place it in a living
room
and like I mentioned in the beginning of
this video the link 10 doesn't come
included with a wall adapter and for
$150 speaker
that's ridiculous personally I feel both
of these speakers should come included
with wall adapters but more importantly
they should come with longer black or
white cables because if you want to use
either of these speakers to their
fullest potential they need to
constantly be on and plugged in but
something else I've noticed with the JBL
link speakers is that there are some
features missing there are found on the
Google home for starters if you try to
place a phone call by using Google
assistant the JBL speakers won't work
whereas the google home will place a
phone call with no problem I also
noticed a new broadcast feature doesn't
fully work with the JBL speakers if you
tell the JBL speakers to broadcast
something only the Google home will
broadcast a message and if you tell the
Google home to broadcast something the
JBL speakers won't do anything all I'm
saying is that if you decide to get
either of these JBL speakers as a
replacement for a Google home then it
might take a little longer for you to
get the latest features sort of like how
Google's Pixel phones get the newest OS
updates right away we're a third party
manufacturer Android phones might get
the newest OS a few weeks later so could
this mean there might be some
fragmentation in the future I don't know
you told me like I've said in past
videos I think it's great third-party
manufacturers are embracing voice
assistance and JBL did an okay job with
the jpo link series it's a really good
option for people who prefer to use
Google assistant and were pretty
invested into Google ecosystem the link
10 and link 20 performed just as well as
a Google home but sounded much better
signing them up and using them is a
breeze and they have no problem
switching from Wi-Fi to bluetooth
streaming something to UE blast and mega
blasts were really struggled with but
they do have to design quirks like
needlessly constant on indicator lights
and cables that are too short the link
10 in link 20 don't really compete with
the JBL foot 4 or JBL charge 3
smart speakers that I feel predominantly
should live in your home because they're
best winter connected to Wi-Fi and they
don't have the longest battery lives the
flip for in charge three are the ones I
would take on a camping trip to the
beach or on a hike
I like the jbo link 20 and link 10 but
they do have room for improvement
