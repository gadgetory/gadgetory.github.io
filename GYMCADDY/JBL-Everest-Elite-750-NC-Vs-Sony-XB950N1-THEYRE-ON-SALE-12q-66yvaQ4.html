cancelling headphones but don't want to
drop the big bucks for the both QC 35 or
does Sony 1000x the JBL Everest elite
750 and siendo Sony xb9 50 and 1 are
some good options well which is better
the JBL every silly 1050 NC or just sony
xb9 50 and one that's fine now don't
forget to Like comment and subscribe
oh man that intro has members the JBL
Everest elite 750 NC is the newest of
these 2 headphones it comes in three
colorways blue gunmetal and silver they
also currently retail for $299.99 the
Sony xb9 50 n1 released back in March or
April of 2017 and still only comes in
two colorways black or green I'm still a
big fan of the green version they retail
for 248 over at Amazon and they go on
sale from time to time if you want to
pick either one of these up I'll have a
link in the description below and I'll
keep them updated so you can get the
best deals possible so first let's go
over what comes in each box because
there is a big difference the sony MDR
XP 950 n1 come included with the
carrying pouch and audio cable and a
micro USB cable for charging the JBL
Everest elite sounds like the NC on the
other hand come included with the hard
shell carrying case and audio cable with
inline controller a better quality micro
USB cable for charging and a 2 prong
plain adapter JBL did a great job of
taking the little things into
consideration but remember the JBL do
cost $50 more style and cover points
they goes into JBL ever sleep I have no
problem with the design of the Sony xb9
50 n1 but they are so big you can see
them in your peripheral vision when you
put them on and some people have said
they are not fans of the circular here
comes the JBL every silly sense if the
NC on the other hand are much more
low-profile and the larger ear cups do a
better job of encasing your ears unlike
the ear cups on the sony which still
rests on your ear lows and top of your
ear don't get me wrong the sony XP 950
n1 are still comfortable to wear but I'm
just being hypercritical objectively the
JBL ever sell a 1050 NC are more
comfortable than the Sony XP 950 n1 when
it comes to controls the Sony xb9 50 n1
are much easier to use than JBL Everest
elite does the dedicated playback
control worker and a dedicated volume
rocker on
onie and it's much easier to tell which
biome you're pressing just by touch
unlike the JBL where you never know
which blind you're really pressing and
controlling your music playback is way
harder than it needs to be considering
noise cancellation both of these
headphones perform well but the JBL
Everett the late 1050 NC does a better
job of isolating you from the outside
well but the difference is so little
between the JBL and the sony that you
wouldn't know unless you wore them
back-to-back like I can but sound
quality is a whole different story
like I said I managed to review the
sound quality on the Jamiel average
daily census the NC is decent and modern
listening levels what if you're
listening to something with a lot of
bass or really high highs the JBL will
start rattling like soda gear the Sony
xb9 50 and one on the other hand sound
great across the board instrument
separation and soundstage are way better
and the extra bass feature adds another
dimension to the listening experience
that relays and Bluetooth connectivity
are also two big factors to consider
between these two headphones the Sony
have a battery life of 22 hours and if
you listen to them at a low volume and
with noise cancellation off I've managed
to squeeze out a few more hours out of
them whereas I found the JBL ever silly
to only have a better life of 12 hours
with noise cancellation on and at a
playback volume of 75 percent also JBL
decided to use bluetooth for that all on
these headphones which means you can
only be connected to one device at a
time and if you're going to switch
between devices you need to go through
the setup process every single time
thankfully the 950 and 1 use bluetooth
for that one and you can pair to two
devices at the same time so switching
between your phone and laptop like I do
is super easy but these two headphones
do have very different features that
help set them apart from the rest for
starters the Sony xb9 50 and one don't
to sound great they also had an extra
base feature
it's what the XP mi name stands for at a
press of a button you can kick the bass
up to an 11 on the Sony and they still
Mantz it sound great like I said on my
name is review of the 950 n1 having the
extra bass feature on while watching an
actual moving adds another dimension
when explosions hat on our screen
the Sony xpn 50 n1 are made specifically
for baseheads
the JBL Everest elite 750 NC on the
other hand let you control your noise
cancellation setting straight from the
headphones
or the app the JBL let you set an
awareness level so if you're walking in
the city and still want to be able to
hear some of your surroundings for
safety reasons you can set them to envy
and awareness high if you want to be in
your own little world and don't want to
hear anything you can set them to
ambient awareness low also taking phone
calls on the JBL is crystal clear for
the user on the other side thanks to the
echo canceling microphone and here are a
few minor things I want to point out
between these two headphones first Jay
Bilas apps for their headphones is very
well built responsive intuitive and
useful Sony's app is not I try to avoid
using it as much as I can I really wish
so needed a better job of like the line
here here comes with large letters like
JBL they don't there's because it makes
putting them on correctly much easier
and I like that JBL included better
cables in their packaging so to wrap
things up the Sony xb9 fifty and one has
been and still all my go-to wallets
headphones they sound spectacular the
noise cancellation is good they have a
killer battery life and they're fifty
dollars cheaper it's hard to recommend
or switch to the JBL Everest elite 1050
NC since they don't perform well when
the bass gets really low or the highs
get really high the short battery life
is a bummer and controlling my music
playback on the JBL is mostly
infuriating and I'm still amazed JBL
decided to use bluetooth for that Oh on
a pair of three hundred dollar wireless
headphones in 2017 but being able to
control your noise cancellation is a
really cool feature I wouldn't be
surprised if other companies adopt a
feature in the future and not to mention
they're as comfortable as the bose qc25
