out a new camera so if the image is off
I do apologize but if it looks good
please hit that like button but with
that being said today we're doing a shoe
review and the adidas crazy explosive
low primate recently a lot of people
have been raving about the crazy
explosive low and how great they are for
basketball but in general I just think
they're a dope looking shoe too so I had
to get a pair so let's get right into
the review okay so I've been trying to
get these core black crazy explosive
loads for almost two months this
specific color wave was always out of
stock in adidas excite but it seems like
now adidas is starting to restock them
slowly but surely the adidas create
explosive low also come in a white
colorway with the hint of white or cream
orb√°n into the primers of the other
personally I do prefer the black ones
over the white ones but they both still
look great some people say they even
look like Yeezy is made for the court
their words not mine
these will set you back onto $40 if you
want to pick these up and the non PK
versions will cost you 120 people claim
the crazy explosives or perhaps one of
the best basketball shoes on the market
right now and they might be right the
rubber also provides a lot of traction
so you can stop and turn on a dime they
hold on to your feet for dear life
they're lightweight and they give you
ample amount of lockdown and the boost
gives you the right amount of padding
especially in the heel area concerning
the upper of the shoe it's a one-piece
bootie construction with almost 80% of
it being prime net the primary on the
crazy explosive low is that stretchy as
primary the ultra boost by an MD but
it's not as stiff as easy instead the
pregnant on the crazy explosive is
almost like Nikes climate which is good
because your shoe won't be shifting
around when you're in a game or doing
drills the other 20% of the upper is
made out of padded mesh that give you a
good amount of padding when you tighten
your laces and overall the whole upper
of the shoe is very beautiful the crazy
explosive low also includes rope laces
which look great for casual wear what if
you're going to play in these or workout
in them you're going to either have to
double mount them or swap them out for
flat laces because they will climb down
every 5 minutes or so
but if you do decide to tying your laces
these shoes will give you a good amount
of lock down not as good as a nike
flywire but is still a good amount
inside the shoe there's also a cell heel
counter that give you a lot of lock down
and a lot of padding as well in general
the whole shoe has a lot of panic period
concerning fit these shoes do run a
little narrow and I would suggest you go
up half a size usually I'm a size 10 but
for these I had to go up to ten and a
half the crazy explosive load also
featured a full-length booze mitt so
that gives you the right amount of
padding in the heel area but still give
you good core feel on the forefoot of
the shoe but if you're a heel striker
you'll definitely want to give these
shoes a trot for the most part the boost
missile on the shoe is case except for
the medial portion of the shoe
personally I would have liked up the
whole boost with Caze but a data is that
they're for performance reasons the
outsole of the shoe has this fingerprint
or brain looking traction pattern which
have a good amount of bite to them like
I said earlier they allow you to stop
and turn on a dime but they do have the
slightest of give to them or when it
comes to durability the crazy explosive
have been known to wear out pretty
quickly especially if you play with them
on an outdoor court but even if you
don't play too much the crazy explosive
low also a great looking shoe for casual
wear if you manage to get a pair of the
poor black colorway I feel they go with
almost anything in my opinion overall
the adidas crazy explosive low primate
is a good performing basketball shoe
that holds your foot give you just the
right amount of impact protection and
are very lightweight and breathable but
just remember those real places can be a
pain in the ass sometimes if you are
going to get these I suggest you go up
half the size but for $140 these are
pretty solid shoe even if you're just
going to wear them casually hey if you
