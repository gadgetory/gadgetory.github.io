has already come out the gate swinging
by announcing the new JBL flip 5 now it
looks like the JBL flip 5 is going to be
going through a very similar refresh
cycle found on the JBL charge four as in
really the only technical difference
between the flip 4 and flip 5 is gonna
be the way you charges the flip 5 is
going to charge via a USB C port just
like on the charge for the flip 5 is
also going to be keeping the same 12
hour battery life found on the foot for
JBL however does keep referencing a
racetrack styled drivers so this leads
me to believe that the flip 5 is going
to be doing away with the dual
transducer setup found on the platform
and moving towards a single chancers or
setup similar to the charge for now
personally I don't mind that the flip 5
is going to be moving towards a single
transducer setup because honestly it
doesn't take away from the listening
experience from the charge form but if
you are in the market for a small
portable Bluetooth speaker then you're
pretty much safe going with the foot 4
if you were going to wait for the flip 5
JBL is also expanding their party box
lineup by announcing their new JBL party
box 1000 this $1000 speaker isn't just
bigger and louder the whole front is a
light feature you can probably expect
this monster of a speaker at your next
rave JBL also gave us an update on their
JBL link barn which was first announced
at Google i/o a few months ago and then
delayed the JBL link bar is an Android
TV and Google assistant enabled TV sound
bar featuring four HDMI imports so you
can plug in all of your TV peripherals
and then plug into your TV through one
HDMI port the idea here is that you'll
be able to switch from your blu-ray
player to your gaming console or just
watch TV just by talking to your Google
assistant and the play here is that it's
going to make your Smart TV smarter and
since the majority of Smart TVs these
days come with very crappy built-in
speakers it's always a good idea to look
into a sound barn
period but at $400 and an optional
subwoofer going for $300 the JBL link
bar in cheap JBL also announced a new
lineup of headphones which all feature
google assist
and an integration and like I mentioned
in previous videos
voice assistant integration and
headphones is becoming increasingly
popular but nobody has been able to
implement them correctly out of all of
the headphones JBL announced today I'm
personally really looking forward to the
JBL 6 500 BT and C's which are going to
be retailing for $200
hopefully they've managed to fix the
excessive cabin pressure found in their
a and C but due to their design I think
they're still going to be suffering from
the same fitting issues found on the JBL
65 meaty and C's because they have the
same body JBL is also going all-in on
truly wireless earbuds by announcing not
one not two not three but four different
models of truly wireless earbuds they
have truly wireless earbuds for your
daily commute they have truly Wireless
here but for your athlete just looking
to go why are free while they work out
and they have truly wireless earbuds for
your hardcore athletes that want to cut
the cord but they still want your hooks
prices range from 100 to $170 and
personally I'm gonna leave JBL didn't
announce any super expensive truly
wireless earbuds and we're gonna be
wrapping up our JBL coverage with the
JBL link drive the JBL link drive plugs
into your car cigarette lighter and
brings Google assistant right into your
car and given that voice recognition in
older cars is very hit-or-miss
miss most of the time this $60 accessory
is a good solution if your car doesn't
natively support apple carplay or
Android auto but now let's move on to
Sennheiser cuz even though they are now
some pretty cool stuff they didn't
announce what I expected them to
announce son Heiser is really pushing
towards augmented reality specifically
augmented audio but besides showcasing
their AM Bo earbuds and momentum true
wireless earbuds son Heiser hasn't
announced any new headphones so far
however Sennheiser then announced their
new AM Bo TV sound born which is a 5.1.1
four sound board that's supposed to give
you a 3d listening experience from just
a single sound board but at a $2,500
asking price it's really starting to
make the JBL link bar look very
attractive right now now personally I
was expecting son Heiser to announce an
updated version of their PXE 550's but
they did him but CS just
so maybe there's still time I really do
think son Howser needs to put something
else because the headphone market is
just getting very competitive right now
so if they do put something out I'll
make another video well right now I got
to cut this video together and then go
watch Sony's press conference if you
made it this far
I guess you enjoyed the video so hit
that like button and get subscribed to
how someone didn't you realize if you
want to pick another part except mention
in this video those will be linked in
the description down below any girls
will support the channel by checking out
the merch store but other than that I'll
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
