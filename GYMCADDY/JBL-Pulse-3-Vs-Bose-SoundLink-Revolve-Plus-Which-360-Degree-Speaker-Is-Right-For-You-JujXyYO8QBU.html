degree sound did you go with the
brand-new Jay Bell Tolls 3 adds a
built-in light show or should you go
with the elegant and refined Bose
Soundlink revolt plus well you just want
to know which of these two 360 degree
speakers sound better well we're about
to find out don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe
and you can watch my debut post review
video here after you're done watching
this video the day build pulls 3 is the
newer of these two products in Rito's
for $200 it comes in two colorways black
or white the Bose Soundlink revolves
plus was released back in spring and
retails for $300 it also comes in two
colorways black or silver there's also
the smaller Bowl sound like revolve that
retails for $200 it doesn't get as loud
as the revolve Plus and battery life is
a little shorter but if you want to see
a versus video with that speaker in the
JBL pulse 3 comment down below but if
you want to pick either of these
speakers up I'll have links in the
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deals
possible I was very impressed when I
first reviewed the Bose Soundlink valves
plus it's brushed aluminum body just
gives it this presence and elegance that
can easily make it to sell a piece of
your liberally this design is what I
imagine the Apple home pod would look
like it even has a carrying handle which
makes life a little easier and there's
also a contact catch on the bottom for
both this charging cradle the debut
posts 3 on the other hand uses plastic
and has a nylon mesh weave bottom
portion obviously these two products are
aims are two completely different
demographics though both sound controls
plus is into an older crowd that wants
an elegant look at a speaker while the
JBL pulls 3 is geared towards a younger
crowd that wants to take it with them
everywhere and have a light show with
your music the JBL pull 3 has that
classic cylindrical design you can
expect from JBL and it's portable
speakers the majority of the device is
hard plastic that has the light show and
the bottom portion which has two drivers
is wrapped in a nylon mesh weave and
both end caps are made ourselves with
rubber which gives upholstery a good
amount of grip there are passive
radiators on the top and bottom of the
device and/or controls in the back you
can control your music playback except
go back track adjust the volume answer
and end calls activate Siri by pressing
and holding the triangle and parent of
the JBL connect plus enabled speaker
with the pulse 3 with the tap of one
button there's also a fuel gauge so you
can see your current battery status at a
glance and under the world
gaana you find a microUSB port for
charging in an object if you want a
wired connection the Bose Soundlink
revolt plus also has a cylindrical shape
to it
the bottom portion has milled holes
which just look fantastic and just like
the post three has soft touch rubber on
either end caps which give it a good
amount of grip the controls on the
Selleck revolve can be found on the top
of the device you can do everything that
JBL pulse we can do except you can
actually go back a track by triple
pressing the multifunction button
unfortunately pairing another Bose
speaker with the bose channel convolve
plus isn't as easy as the pulse but I'll
go into that later but the Bose logo on
top does serve as an NFC touch point for
easy pairing if you have an Android
device
but unfortunately the Bose doesn't have
a battery gauge so there's always a
sense of untrained feel when you power
up the device unless you check the
battery status on your phone or if you
have voice prompts turned on and
personally I'm not a fan of the voice
prompts so I always turn them off if you
have watched any of my other JBL pulse 3
videos you might know by now that I
really wish the post we had textured
binds the new button layout on the post
3 is an improvement from the JBL pulse 2
but it's not as easy to know what button
you're pressing without looking like the
bose sound like revolt plus you still
have to memorize the button layout on
the bose but some of the buttons are
indented a little it's easier to know
what you're pressing concern expects the
debut upholstery is using bluetooth for
that too and it can be paired to two
devices at the same time and ranges at
around 70 feet the Bose Soundlink
evolved plus is also using bluetooth for
that too and it can also be paired to
two devices at the same time both range
is much shorter at only 30 feet and the
connection starts to struggle if you
have multiple walls between the bose and
your phone the JBL post 3 on the other
hand is able to keep a strong connection
through more walls than the bose battery
life is also very different between
these two devices both advertises the
battery life of 16 hours on the sound
like revolve plus but really I usually
get a battery life of around 8 to 10
hours the jb upholstery on the other
hand advertises a battery life of 12
hours but in my testing I've managed to
get close to 13 hours of playback time
with the life feature turned on and 15
hours of playback what the life feature
turned off the JBL upholstery has the
battery battery life here but just by a
couple of hours
both of these device
fairly durable but if you are to roughen
either one of them they will get
scratched
but in my testing I've noticed the bows
so scratches are faster than the post
three the bow saligan twelve plus is
ipx4 certified so it'll be fine if it
gets a little splash but the JBL pulls
three is ipx7 certified so the post we
can get splashed or submerged in water
and it'll be just fine
it even floats in water and keeps
playing music without any issues on the
other hand I wouldn't dare submerge the
bows underwater in risk its internals
all right never talked about sound
quality
like I've said in previous videos the
JMU upholstery is a good sound speaker
it has a good amount of depth to it the
mids and highs are very clear it has a
very wide soundstage there's a good
amount of depth to the sound and there's
very little sound distortion at higher
volumes but both sellers revolve Plus on
the other hand does manage to get a
little louder and has more bass than the
post three but the listening experience
isn't as good the problem with the bows
is have two sounds too forward and it
doesn't have as much depth or intimate
separation as the pulse rate the highest
do tend to crash from time to time at
higher volumes and I feel the vocals can
sound a little nasally sometimes I'm
really trying not to play favorites here
but if I had to pick one I would go to
table pools three like I mentioned
earlier the Jay Buell upholstery has JBL
connect plus this means you can pair up
to 100 JBL connect plus enable devices
like upholstery or flip form and have
them play music simultaneously obviously
you're not going to pair 100 JBL
speakers together but you can pair for
example 3 or 5 speakers together and
fill a larger area with music or if you
have to debut upholstery you can pair
them together to play music and stereo
mode and even sync up the light shows
together and you can do all of this with
the press of a single button on each
speaker
both on the other hand is much more
limited you can pair two Bose Soundlink
speakers together and have them play in
party mode or in stereo mode just like
JBL but you can't connect in more
devices to my knowledge but pairing two
Bose devices is easy from the both
connect app but it's not as easy if
you're trying to pair them by just using
the onboard buttons on top you have to
remember certain button press
combinations and hold them down for a
few seconds and
the process on your second boat speaker
it's not a seamless as a JBL debuts
connect app also allows you to play with
the light feature on your pulse three
first started you can adjust the
brightness and obviously the brightness
of the light feature will play a role in
your speaker's battery life you can also
cycle through different light settings
they all flash it'll be able to music
but they each do so a little differently
there's wave jet explosion equalizer
rave rainbow fire and you can even make
your own and you can change the color of
each setting either through color
matching with your camera or you can use
the color wheel Jay Bilas app is very
well laid out and I've never had any
issues with it but one thing I really
like about boses Connect that is that I
can remotely activate my sound like
revolve Plus this this feature is so
convenient I love it and I wish the post
we could do that but I have noticed if I
turn off my bows with a full battery and
come back to your 4 days later and turn
it on the battery is severely depleted
so does having the remote on feature
mean the bhojas isn't a low power mode
when it's supposed to be turned off it's
having a shorter standby time worth
having the remote on which to you come
below well let's wrap this video up if
you're debating between getting either
of these speakers the life feature
obviously isn't the deciding factor when
it comes to the overall design the bose
is elegant while the post 3 is fun but
when it comes to sound quality I have to
get it to the table upholstery like I
said the bose sound the Google Plus has
more bass and gets a little louder but
there isn't as much instrument
separation and everything just sounds
like it's too forward not to mention the
pull 3 has a slightly better battery
life even with the life feature turned
on and is slightly more durable if you
want to learn more about either of these
speakers I'll have links to their
