Fitbit Versa review I realized huh
Fitbit has a lot of wearables to choose
from so instead of just comparing the
Fitbit vs o to the Fitbit ionic I
thought it would also break down Fitbit
to wearable lineup and hopefully help
you choose the right fit for you Fitbit
schwarber lineup currently consists of
the Flex to Alta Alta a chore charts to
Versa and ionic this lineup starts off
at 5995 and goes all the way up to $2.99
95 and Fitbit also has premium leather
and metal wristband options to choose
from for most of these trackers which
are sold separately of course so there
should be a Fitbit for almost everyone's
budget if you want to pick either of
these fitbit's up I'll have links in the
description below and if you use the
link it really helps out to channel
check them out cos fitbit's routinely go
on sale so you might get lucky okay
let's start off with the Fitbit flex 2
what actually does all the tracking is
this little piece here which you slip
into its silicon wristband it's sleek
lightweight and you have multiple ways
to wear it it's waterproof so you can
track your swimming it's going to
automatically start tracking your
workouts it can track your sleep and is
going to track your steps but since
there is no built-in heart rate monitor
the calories burns a report is going to
be a very rough estimate there are also
some LEDs on the front which mostly tell
you how close you are to hitting your
daily step goal but they also flash in
vibrate when you get a phone call or
text message next up is the altar HR and
first things first is this guy is not
waterproof it's sweat and splash proof
but you can't swim with it but for the
most part the altar HR is a souped-up
flex 2 with an O LED screen on the front
that's fairly easy to see in direct
sunlight it can easily show you your
daily baseline stats and incoming phone
notifications directly from your wrist
and as the name implies the Alta HR has
a built-in heart rate monitor so you're
going to be able to track your heart
rate throughout your day and during your
workouts and the amount of calories
burned the Alta HR reports should be a
little more accurate than the Flex 2 and
aside swimming the Alta H aura can track
everything the Flex 2 does okay now
let's move on to the charge 2 which is
very
to the altar HR just like the altar the
charge to has are screwing on the front
heart rate monitor on the back and you
can't swim with it even though the
charge to cost the same as the altar HR
there are some key differences to keep
in mind first the charge too has a
built-in altimeter which can be used to
track your elevation change during your
runs and it can also track how many
floors you've climbed during the day the
charge 2 also supports connected GPS or
if you bring your phone along you'll be
able to map out your runs and get more
accurate stats regarding your speed and
pace and with the charge - you can
manually initiate workout tracking so
you can get or real-time readout from
your wrist during your workout and
you're tracking should be a little more
accurate as well and both the charts -
and all thr are using haptic
touchscreens so instead of swiping
through the menus like you normally
would on your phone you tap or flick
these trackers it's useful if you're
cycling through the menus if the screen
is wet or sweaty but it can be very hit
or miss sometimes next up is Fitbit
scoring crown jewel the Fitbit Versa
and like I mentioned in the full review
I really like it the Versa does
everything - charge - does and then some
most noticeably it has a touchscreen LCD
display it's super low profile in s
SmartWatch capabilities it doesn't look
like a fitness tracker and you can
strongly fit as a fitness tracker the
first attracts everything - charge -
does and it also relies on connected GPS
to map out your runs
obviously thanks to the touchscreen
display it's much easier to navigate
through the menus track your workouts
and see your baseline stats for the day
as a SmartWatch you can download apps
you get full notifications for incoming
calls texts and emails and if you get
the special edition Versa there's an NFC
chip for contactless payments think of
the Versa as a better-looking and more
useful charge - for when you're outside
of the gym and finally there is the
bigger and more expensive
Fitbit ionic just know it's six months
older than the Versa and again the
Fitbit onic does everything the Versa
does but the premium price tag does
bring a few key improvements first up
it's more premium the silicone band is
better and has a cool textured design
it's easier to swap out the wristbands
and I
really like the normally found on the
side buttons onto the hood every Ayana
comes included with an NFC chip in the
ioniq has its own built-in GPS so with
the ioniq you can leave your phone
behind and still not your runs thanks to
the built-in GPS which remember the
versa can't do because it still relies
on your phone's GPS now both the Versa
and ionic are using bluetooth 4.0 so you
can pair your wireless earphones to them
and stream any music you might have
stored locally on the device and both
watches are able to store around 300
songs give or take but what are the
drawbacks of fitbit's in general is that
you can't connect an external heart rate
monitor to them the wrist-mounted heart
rate monitors on these watches is good
but don't expect it to be as accurate as
a chest mounted one when it comes to
touchscreen responsiveness and overall
performance of these smartwatches I
can't help but notice the versa is a
little snappier than the ioniq which
isn't surprising cuz the ioniq is six
months older and when it comes to design
I prefer the Versa over the ioniq mainly
because of the screen to bezel ratio
there's more screen real estate on the
Versa Sedan on the ionic the screen on
the ionic has richer colors and is a
little whiter but the versus Apple like
minimalist design just looks overall
better I feel the Versa and ionic do
just enough to skate by as a SmartWatch
they show you quickly notifications and
you can download certain apps but I
still look at these fitbit's as fitness
trackers first and smartwatches second
since you can't directly reply to your
notifications
aside from pre-made responses if you're
using an Android or talk to your voice
assistant from these watches I don't
think they should be directly compared
to the Apple watch or Android
smartwatches but no matter which Fitbit
you choose to go with the all work with
Fitbit mobile app and Fitbit mobile app
is the best fitness tracking app out
there for your casual gym goer but in
order to get the most out of the Fitbit
app you do need to get the charge to
Versa or ironic since the Flex two
doesn't have a heart rate monitor and
since the Alta HR it doesn't have an
altimeter you're going to be missing out
on pretty important stats but through
fitbit's app you'll be able to get a
better breakdown of your daily activity
and hopefully be able to better program
your exercise or
I plan for better results and through
fitbit's goal-setting and challenges
hopefully you'll actually stay
consistent which is what really matters
most if you're trying to get results at
the gym and for the ladies Fitbit app
can also help you track your cycle but
that feature is only available if you
have a versa or an ionic but now let's
talk about battery life and it's a
little funny cuz each of these trackers
have their own proprietary cables
depending on how much you work out and
what features you actually use all these
battery lives will vary both the Flex 2
and all thr will last about 5 days with
all day and night wear the Fitbit Versa
advertises a battery life of 4 plus days
and both to charge 2 and ionic advertise
the battery life for 5 days but with all
day and night wear and with a Monday to
Saturday workout routine of one hour of
interval training and 30 minutes of
cycling the Versa managed to last 2 days
and 16 hours the ionic lasted 3 days and
6 hours and the charge 2 lasted 3 days
and 12 hours and keep in mind this was
without using the connected GPS on both
diversa and charge 2 without using the
built-in GPS on the ionic and without
streaming music off of the Versa or
ionic so depending on which features you
actually use on either of these trackers
your battery life will definitely vary
but if you just drop them into their
charger for 10 or 20 minutes every night
they should have no problem keeping up
with you and they should have died on
you by mid-afternoon like other
smartwatches out there if you're trying
to choose between either of these
fitbit's I feel that for the best
experience you should either go with the
charge 2 or the Versa because you'll be
able to get the most out of the Fitbit
mobile app since the flex 2 doesn't have
a heart rate monitor and since the Alta
EHR doesn't have an altimeter you're
going to be missing out on some crucial
data the flippin ionic is geared towards
more serious runners with its built-in
GPS but since you can't connect a chest
strap heart rate monitor and since it
doesn't really fully function as a
SmartWatch I feel it's kind of hard to
justify that $300 price tag if you want
a small Watts get the Apple watch and if
you're a serious runner you probably
better off getting something from Garmin
but I feel the Versa for the price does
exactly what it needs to do it helps you
quantify your daily act
you can maximize your results at the gym
but into notifications non fitness
tracker looking design and apps helpful
a life outside of the gym I just wish
there was a larger case size to choose
from if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
