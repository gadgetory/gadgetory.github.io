Galaxy Note 9 they had a promo where if
you pre-ordered the new phone they would
either throw in a free pair of AKG + 60
+ C on headphones which are a $300 value
or you could get 15,000 V bucks and for
those who don't know AKG is the Samsung
like beats is to Apple but now we have
the new AKG and 700 NCS a pair of over
ear a and C headphones that compete
directly against the Beast to do 3 both
QC 35 and the Sony 1000 XM 3 but after
getting to use these new AKG headphones
I would personally prefer to take the V
bugs over these AMC headphones the AKG
and 700 NCS were released at IFA 2018
somehow managed to win a best product
award and retails for $350 and just to
let you know right off the bat these
headphones rank pretty low compared to
all the other $350 agency headphones
I've reviewed so far and I don't want to
come off as some sony fanboy or that I'm
secretly sponsored by Sony but if you're
in the market for a pair of premium ANC
headphones I still highly recommend the
Sony 1000 X and threes over these
headphones link to these will be in the
description down below and if you use
the links he really ups out the channel
first I want to adjust a carrying case
because I never thought I would out
write this like something as simple as a
carrying case it's huge compared to most
other carrying cases you see these days
you can only sell the headphones inside
in a specific way which always takes me
a few tries to get right and I also hate
how the netting inside always lets the
accessories get loose so every time I go
to take these headphones out of their
case the cables fall out now the cables
that come included with these headphones
are pretty decent
they're both braided and you even get an
airplane adapter but AKG decided to use
a 2.5 mm audio jack on their headphones
instead of a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
now this isn't a big problem but what is
a big problem is that AKG decided to use
a microUSB port for charging instead of
a USB C port now like I've said in the
past if your product is coming out in
late 2018 we want to see USBC charging
especially since Samsung owns AKG if I
had a galaxy device but I don't cause of
TouchWiz I would want to be able to
charge my phone and head
phones with the same charging cable this
is one of the reasons why I like my air
pot so much and it's the same criticism
a lot of other people had when the Beats
Studio threes were first released but
now let's talk about something more
important and that's the design and
build quality of these headphones design
wise I think these headphones look very
bad
everybody that's releasing headphones
these days like Sony Skullcandy and
Microsoft are aiming for a thin and low
profile headband in-ear cup design but
AKG decided to do the complete opposite
the headband itself is thick and wide
and when you wear these headphones it
makes your head look huge which overall
just make these headphones look
extremely David compared to his slicker
counterpart now I know design is
subjective and I'm willing to bet
someone watching might actually like the
industrial like these headphones are
rocking but I just find it very weird
that the n700 nc's don't share the same
design language found on the AKG and 60
NCS which were released at the same time
and when it comes to these headphones
build quality I'm not impressed
whatsoever first I want adjust ammeter
controls on the left ear cup now besides
being on the left ear cup their layout
is very good they're very easy to find
and very easy to tell apart the volume
up and center buttons have very good
tactile feedback but for some reason the
volume down button is complete mush but
my quality control issues don't end
there even though these ear cups are
supposed to swivel the left ear cup has
a lot of friction whereas the right ear
cup feels a little loose and if you look
closely you can even see that the body
panels are beginning to shave now when
it comes to adjusting the headband
you'll notice it's also very loose and
there's even a lot of wiggling going on
between the top portion of the headband
and the portion that holds on to the ear
cup the only redeeming qualities I like
about these headphones is that I do like
the hit of Alcantara underneath the
headband the faux leather on the ear
cups feels very nice and overall these
headphones fit very well the ear cups
are more spacious than the Sony 1000x m3
but not as spacious at the Bose QC 35 s
and these headphones also don't have a
lot of clamping force making them big
had approved but the design and build
quality of these headphones alone would
make me consider not getting these
headphones when it comes to tech specs
these headphones I have an advertised
battery life of 23 hours with ANC turned
on and
that's not bad any around 25 hours is
average these days because for
comparison the new Microsoft Surface
headphones only have a 15 hour battery
life but unfortunately these headphones
don't have fast charging which is
quickly becoming a standard and very
important feature on a and C headphones
these days when it comes to Bluetooth
connectivity these headphones are using
bluetooth 4.2 now there's nothing wrong
with that but assuming since AKG is a
Samsung company how would things dancing
would be trying to use Bluetooth 5.0
these headphones but more importantly
these headphones can only be connected
to one device at a time which does suck
if you are a power user and if you're an
iPhone user these headphones do have a
considerable amount of latency just
making them not good for watching
youtube videos on your phone but latency
is only an issue if you're an iPhone
user if you're an Android user you'll be
okay
and now let's talk about the active
noise cancellation on these headphones
in short it does a whole lot of nothing
now there is a calibration process for
the agency on these headphones but
unfortunately I didn't see any
noticeable improvements after doing the
anc calibration now the a and C on these
headphones is the adaptive kind meaning
that you can specify how much ANC you
want they just adjust themselves on the
fly very similar to the B studio threes
[Laughter]
in general the agency on the end 700 and
sees does a very average job blocking
outcasted low-frequency sounds like road
noise and in general anc headphones are
designed to block out constant low
frequency sounds but what separates good
agency headphones from great agency
headphones is how they handle random
high frequency sounds like chatter from
the ANC test you can clearly hear that
the answer 100 MCS have a really hard
time blocking out chatter and when it
comes to the cabin pressure of the ANC
of these headphones it's not as bad as
the post you see thirty fives but it is
noticeable you just never forget us
there like most other anc headphones
these days the AKG and 700 NCS also have
an ambient mode and a method for talking
to people without having to take your
headphones off which you can toggle with
this button found under the power button
the only catch is is that you can only
have one of these features turned on on
these headphones ambient aware will pump
in all of the sound around you while
you're playing music given the
headphones and open-back effect
and this which was good if you're
walking around the city my only problem
with this feature is that it pumps in
everything both the Sony 1000x m3 and
Microsoft Surface headphones have this
type of feature but they're smart enough
so that if one loud random sound happens
like say a police siren rose by a dog
starts barking or a car backfires
they'll turn off the ambient feature and
shield you from that jump scare but not
the EKGs which I feel is kind of sloppy
there's also the talk-through feature
which will lower the volume of your
music and pump in the ambient sound so
you can talk to someone without taking
off your headphones
No
Society
and I like that these headphones has
both of these features I just wish I
don't have to choose between these two
features because depending on your
situation or environment you're gonna
want to use one over the other and like
I mentioned earlier I wish the ambient
mode on the EKGs was implemented better
and there's a chance AKG could address
that in a future software update and
finally let's talk about these
headphones sound quality these
headphones are made for people who
prefer a neutral sound signature if
you're looking for bass and want
something in or out of your head these
ain't it but so the bass does get deep
and sputtering hasn't been an issue with
these headphones which is good the
soundstage and instrument separation on
these headphones is also good and
distortion is almost non-existent and
through the AKG app you can go in and
adjust to EQ on these headphones as well
but just keep in mind even if you raise
the bass on these headphones all the way
up you're not going to get that kick
you're looking for these headphones are
all made for a neutral listening
experience and even after all the
negative things I've said about these
headphones so far I will admit they
sound pretty good and finally here's the
microphone test and it's just not that
good but this outer clip has been
recorded by the microphones found on the
AKG and 700 nc's so you better do that
now overall even though the AKG and 700
NC's do sound pretty good for neutral
sounding headphones I just find them
very hard to recommend in this
increasingly competitive ANC headphone
market from a design and build quality
standpoint they look and feel like
something from 2014 especially since
they're using that my curiosity port
when all of the Galaxy phones AKG
headphones are advertised next to are
using the USB C port even though they do
fit well and I can see myself wearing
them for hours without any problems on a
commute they're active noise
cancellation is on par with other $200
ANC headphones I've tested not the $350
ANC headphones that these headphones are
competing against and personally I have
no idea how these headphones one that is
the best product award if you made it
