weeks from different companies and the
newest fitness tracker to get released
as of now if the garmin vivosmart 3 but
who knows in about a few weeks there
might be a brand new wearable to review
but until then I thought it would be a
good idea to put the brand new garmin
vivosmart 3 up against the now six month
old Fitbit charge - so what should you
get let's find out price-wise both of
these fitness trackers are competitively
priced the Fitbit charge two comes in
six colorways and currently we chose for
one 48 95 or one 7995 depending on the
color Amazon also randomly puts the 5th
charge - on sale from time to time the
government people smart 3 although the
hand currently only comes in two
colorways black or purple and I'm not
sure if more colorways will be released
in the future but both colorways retail
for one $39.99 I have links in the
description below if you want to pick
either one of these up when it comes to
design these fitness trackers are pretty
different the Fitbit charge Q is
slightly more premium which is clean and
steel housing removable wristbands and a
side button that has a very satisfying
click to it
whereas the garmin vivosmart 3 is mostly
made out of silicone and when the screen
is off it just looks like a black lip
strong bracelet 50 gives you the option
to mix and match your wearable with the
outfit if you like with swappable
wristbands or as with Garmin what you
get is what you stuck with but when it
comes to actually wearing these things I
have to say the bummer vivosmart 3 is
more confident it's slightly lighter and
a bit slimmer and sometimes I forget I'm
even wearing the thing compared to the
Fitbit charge to the wristband and we go
smoothly is also slightly more flexible
and stretchy than the charge twos which
also allows it to conform a little
better to your wrist it's just a small
observation of mine when it comes to
features both these fitness trackers has
a built-in heart rate monitor and
contract your heart rate all day they
both have an LED screen that's easy to
read in most environments they both
connect via bluetooth and have a 30-foot
range
they're both rechargeable with the
battery life oval round 5 days depending
on how active you are they both track
your steps taken systems walk flights
clients calories burned they can both
automatically start tracking your
workout they track your sleep quality
and they both can show you basic phone
notifications but these trackers do have
some big differences between them for
starters the garmin vivosmart
a3 is waterproof while the Fitbit charge
2 is not if your swimmer and you're
looking for something to track your
stats and count your laps while you swim
then the Garmin is for you the people
smart 3 can also track your stress
levels but like I said I'm a initial
review tracking my stress levels and
having guided breathing sessions on my
fitness tracker isn't a must-have
feature I honestly feel like it's just
again one cool feature the garmin
vivosmart 3 has that I wish to fit
research to that as well is web counting
capability again like I said in my
initial review it's not 100% accurate
and it's really suited towards full-body
or upper body exercises but it is still
cool to have and probably with future
firmware updates Garmin will improve it
also keep in mind
neither of these fitness trackers has a
built-in GPS so if you're a runner
you're still going to need to bring your
phone along when it comes to accuracy
these fitness trackers perform a
relatively the same first you have to
understand the accuracy and precision of
a wrist mounted hovering monitor is not
as good as a test rep or any medical
grade equipment for that matter so the
readings will be off from time to time
for the most part the heart rate
readings at rest were between two and
three beats of one another when actually
working out I saw the heart rate
differences between the two was as high
as 10 beats per minute at time and I
defined the Garmin was consistently
reporting a similar heart rate reading
to the hallway monitor found on the
treadmill I did my morning cardio but
there were times the Garmin couldn't
pick up a heart rate at all or was
completely wrong while the Fitbit was
fun on and vice versa if you want to get
the best heart we do from the fitness
tracker you have to play around with
I'll tell you where it I found the
garment like the tighter fit while the
Fitbit perform better with the looser
fit
although the screen on these trackers
are similar inside the way you interact
with them and the way they are used is
pretty different
Fitbit updating to use a screen that
isn't a touchscreen but instead reacts
to the force from is happening it's a
good solution so you can still use the
screen even when it strikes some sweat
but it can be a little annoying when the
screen doesn't pick up on the tab so you
sometimes have to try multiple times but
for the most part you scroll through the
different menus and industry workouts
through a series of taps and button
presses government on the other hand
uses a more conventional touch screen
that you navigate through a via of taps
swipes and long presses it's also fairly
accurate when it's wet as well but it
still has a few missteps
it's not perfect but Garmin does take
better advantage of the screen mode but
like I said in my initial review the
scream of the garmin vivosmart 3 can
look a little cloudy at times which is
pretty annoying I just feel like it
lowers your ball quality and just get
excited but these fingers trackers have
their own phone application and like I
said in my garmin vivosmart 3 review
garments connect that is to Windows and
that this app is to Apple both apps will
display the information that's collected
by the respective trackers and give you
better understanding of your physical
activity they both also have social
aspects to them and have medals and
challenges to win to help keep you
motivated they try to make sickness into
a game but if its apps manages to show
you your information in a much more
elegant manner and it's much easier to
navigate garments app on the other hand
managed to go a little more in-depth but
the app isn't as well laid out and the
UI has some room for improvement for
those think about given the vivosmart 3
as a gift to an older non tech-savvy
relative and just be ready to constantly
walk them through the app because I'm
still trying to figure it out if you're
looking for something that's that simple
and looks nice fit this app is the way
to go
so which what I think although I really
like the Garmin slimmer and lighter
design it's more flexible wristband
which helps with comfort it's waterproof
design and its touchscreen user
interface it's foggy screen and the data
is gone and connect that design make me
lean towards the fitness terms - I'm a
fan of the hardware for sure but they
need to update the Garmin Connect that
and maybe they will but I do like to go
to connect that because it lets me input
way more stats about my workout and it
does go deeper into the breakdown but in
general I would still recommend the
Fitbit charge - it's simple to use and
if that shows you more than enough
information and Fitbit is constantly
improving it but if Fitbit is working on
a charge 3 I would like to see it be
waterproof have a slimmer design a more
flexible wristband and maybe a larger
screen with smaller muscles hey if you
made it this far I hope you enjoyed the
