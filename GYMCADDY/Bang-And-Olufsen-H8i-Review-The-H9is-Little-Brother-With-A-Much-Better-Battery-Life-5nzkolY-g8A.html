beautifully designed premium headphones
that worked pretty well but they also
have a little brother the bang and all
of sin h8 eye on your headphones these
two headphones have a lot in common but
they also have some major differences so
let's see what the hundred on the price
difference between these two headphones
gets you for this review I'm going to be
focusing exclusively on the Bang and all
of sin h8i headphones if you want to
learn more about the h9 eyes then click
on the eye icon above the bang and all
of sin h8i come in two colorways you can
get them in a two-tone colorway like I
have them here or you can get them in an
all-black call away like the h9 eyes and
personally I prefer the all-black call
away over the natural colorway the Bang
&amp;amp; Olufsen h8i headphones retails for
$399 that's the same as the Bowers and
Wilkins px which are over ear headphones
when hundred dollars less than the h9
eyes and fifty dollars more than the
Sony 1000 XM 2 which are the top dog
right now when it comes to noise
cancellation technology if you want to
pick these headphones up I'll have links
in description below and if you use the
links really helps out the channel
alright if you watched my bein all h9 I
video then you're going to have a little
bit of deja vu here the h8 eyes come
with the USB C 2 USB a cable for
charging because it has a USB C port and
it also comes with a 3.5 mm audio cable
forward listening and yes they can be
used passively and they also come with
an airplane adapter and the 88 eyes are
also come with the same fleece carrying
pouch that comes included with the h9
eyes and like I said before even though
this pouch does feel like it's good
quality when I'm paying 400 or 500
dollars for a pair of headphones I'm
kind of expecting a hard shell carrying
case ok now let's get to the headphones
just like the h9 eyes the h8 eyes have
Cal hide leather on its headband which
looks very nice and it also has lambskin
leather on his ear pads and the leather
on the ear pads on both the h8i and h9 I
feels much more luxurious than the
synthetic leather you would find on say
the Sony 1000 x m2 and just like the
padding on the h9 eyes depending on the
h8 eyes don't overheat too much after
extended listening sessions and just
like the h9 eyes the h8 eyes also
has a brushed aluminum frame and fabric
and padding underneath the headband but
surprisingly the h8 eyes have more
padding underneath its headband than the
h9 eyes and personally I wouldn't mind a
little more padding under the headband
of the h9 eyes regarding comfort well
keep in mind these are on ear headphones
and as on ear headphones go please feel
pretty good they have a little bit more
clamping force than the h9 eye but they
do a very good job of not shifting
around when you're walking the range of
motion on these ear cups is pretty good
so they'll be able to conform to most
head shapes so they don't apply any
unnecessary pressure
unlike the bestow low 3 whose ear cups
have very little range of motion and do
apply pressure on your jaw these
headphones weigh in at 215 grams and
even though they are fairly comfortable
I do have a bias towards over ear
headphones if you're a guy with a
smaller head or a lady they should fit
you just fine but if you're a guy with
the bigger head like me then over here
is the way to go
as Metzen before and just like the h9
eyes the h8 I also has a USB C port for
charging and a 3.5 mm audio jack for
Wired listening but the first big major
difference between the h9 I and h8i are
the controls the h9 eyes have a touchpad
on the right ear cups of controlling
music playback and other settings and
for the most part it works very well but
the h8i has a switch on his left ear Cup
which powers on the device and toggles
both noise cancellation and transparency
mode on and off and I'll demonstrate
those in a minute
and the right ear cup you have your
traditional volume up and volume down
buttons and a multi-purpose button now
these buttons have a good amount of
tactile feedback but since I touched
these buttons on a regular basis I wish
they were made out of metal not plastic
cause remember these are $400 headphones
the h8i are also using bluetooth for
that too and that's a side note why
don't more headphones have bluetooth 5.0
I mean just comment down below if you
know anyways the h8 I have a range of 40
feet and very little latency watching
videos on these headphones is okay but
there is a little bit of latency which
my bothers some people like myself but
these headphones can be connected to two
devices at the same time so switching
from your phone to your computer on a
regular basis like I do
is much easier just like the h9 I the h8
I also has proximity sensors built-in
and it works pretty well when you take
your headphones off automatically
positive music and when you put their
back on just start playing your music
again although this feature works pretty
well I technically keep it off because I
just don't want my headphones to start
playing music and max volume every time
I put them on now battery life is the
main thing the h8i has over the h9 i
with anc and bluetooth turn on the h9 i
typically average 20 hours of playback
time with the volume set at 50 percent
under the same conditions the h8i lasted
up to 32 hours of playback time and with
anc turned off these little guys lasted
47 hours that's a huge difference given
that the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
h9 I struggles with battery life the h8i
is rocking in 1110 milliamp hour battery
while the h9 I is rocking a 770 milliamp
hour battery but the battery on the h9 I
is removable so if you get to a point
where your battery just won't call to
charge anymore you could just replace
with the battery but on the hii you
don't have that option now personally I
find it weird that the h8i
has a much larger battery than the h9
I'm sound quality on the h8 eye is very
good though but these do have effect
sound signature just like the h9 I so
you're not going to get a lot of thump
in the base but the loads do resonate
quite a bit which is what I look for in
premium headphones both the h9 I and h8i
both have 40 millimeter diameter drivers
and for the most part I really can't
tell a difference when it comes to cell
quality instrument separation sound
stage the lows and highs all performed
nearly identical on both headphones they
performed very well in the lows but they
do struggle a bit to put an emphasis on
the vocals or trouble no matter how much
I play around with their app what really
does change the sound quality between
these two headphones is the padding with
the h9 eyes you have a better seal and
your ears have more room so you get a
better and more relaxed listening
experience with the h8 I since they are
on ear headphones if the padding isn't
perfectly sitting on your ears the sound
quality
drastically change when it comes to
noise cancellation on the h8 I
surprisingly it has less cabin pressure
than the h9 eyes which is weird because
I was expecting them both to have the
same amount of cabin pressure but the
noise cancellation on the h8 eye is not
as good as the noise cancellation on the
h9 I obviously since these are on your
headphones they are in a disadvantage
because they don't create as much of a
seal as the h9 eyes and they don't have
as much passive noise isolation the anc
technology on these headphones does
almost as good of a job of blocking out
road noise like the h9 eye but it
doesn't do nearly as well when it comes
to blocking out voices if noise
cancellation is very important to you
then you have better options out there
at a lower price namely the sony 1000 XM
2
the h8 eyes also features transparency
mode and I love it when headphones have
this type of feature it allows you to
talk to people without having to take
your headphones off when you press down
on the left switch the headphones will
pause your music and pump in all of the
ambient sounds so you can hear what's
going on around you and then when you
press down on the switch again the
headphones will go back to normal and
start playing your music again the h8
eyes app is also very similar to the h9
eyes app and all you can really do is
controlling music playback or just a
volume and play around with the h8 ICQ
settings like I mentioned before the app
is very nice but I wish it gave you more
control over the headphones most
noticeably the EQ settings I like how
the h8i and h9 i sound when I have them
set to excited but I wish I could also
make the lows resonate a bit more like I
mentioned in my h9 I review I also wish
you could control how much noise
cancellation these headphones have
recently B&amp;amp;O added a new toggle to turn
a and C on or off on the h9 I from the
app but I still can't specify how much a
and C I want and for some strange reason
the h8 I didn't get this button again
being always app is pretty but I wish it
was more useful and here's the
microphone test for the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
h8i on your headphones and it sounds as
good as the microphone on the h9 I
headphones there might be a little bit
of static here and there but other than
that it's passable but this audio clip
is being recorded by the microphone on
the obey and Olufsen h8i on your
headphones so you can be nicer to that
so banging all of Sims new h8i and h9 i
headphones are v
good elegant they are very comfortable
and they sound great the noise
cancellation on the h9 I is better than
the noise cancellation on the h8i but
the h8 I completely outclasses the h99
regarding battery life but still $400
for a pair of on your headphones is a
hard sell unless you're a guy with a
small head or a woman and you really
like the design and I mean really like
the design then you can justify getting
these headphones but in almost every
other case I would say just spend the
extra hundred bucks and get the age of
nine I sure you're going to take a huge
hit in the battery life Department but I
think comfort is almost as important as
sound quality when it comes to
headphones the h9 I are so comfortable
they basically melt around your head
whereas the h8 I you never forget
they're there but if you strictly have a
400 dollar budget for headphones that I
suggest you just get the Bowers and
Wilkins px contingent on you not having
a big head if your snapback looks like
it's holding on for dear life
then the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px ain't for
you just be safe get the 1000 xm2 and go
get some chick-fil-a with the change hey
