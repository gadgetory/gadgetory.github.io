a few things you're looking for
something comfortable lightweight and
supportive for when you work out but
then you have these huge companies that
keep innovating to create a far superior
product these days Nike has Lunarlon
while adidas has boots is one better
than the other how are they similar and
most importantly how are they different
first up we got the old of the - Thank
You Luna nonce technology they viewed it
in two new shoes in time for the Summer
Olympics of 2008 in Beijing the Nike
Luna racer for the marathon and the nike
hyper done for basketball after athletes
of all levels love the way Lunarlon
minimised impact while providing both
spring and support Nikes designers began
exploring how the new technology could
benefit athletes and other sports by
adapting it for sports specific meet
lunar along itself is the fusion of
lightweight ethylene vinyl acetate PVA
what's the bouncy ball like spring of
natural rubber the result is a light
foam that we do this is the amount of
impact each time your foot hits the
pavement by evenly distributing the
force throughout the middle of the shoe
on the other hand we have a diva since
boost technology which is much younger
than Lunarlon
adidas is Boost technology is a highly
elastic thermoplastic urethane that is
formed into individual foam pillars
these poets are super soft yet very
springy which are characteristics that
are usually never found together the
pellets are then molded into the shape
of the Mitchell through the use of steam
the substance bringing character
exclusive boost results in a material
that has far superior energy return than
anything else on the market when it
comes to being used in the final
products each company's approach is very
different in the case of the lunar epic
loss climate one and two the Lunarlon is
encased in an outer foam layer with Flex
is built into the lunar log this gives
the shoe a very distinct feel and makes
them extremely supportive Adidas on the
other hand uses boost as the main
component of the midsole throws in a
torsion system for arch support and rats
the boots in a continental rubber
outsole the result is a very soft ride
with a lot of traction but if you're
trying to decide between getting the
adidas ultra boost or to make a lunar
epics there are some key differences to
consider aside from the missile
technology although both shoes have made
upwards they also have very different
characteristics shirts are both
breathable but the primeknit is far more
elastic and comfortable to wear the soft
prime that operate and the comfortable
cushioning of the ultra boost is why
it's also a popular casual
slash lifestyle show on the other hand
Nikes lunar epic climate - is a better
training shoe dandy eligible for key
reason just align it on the lunar epic
isn't as elastic that means your foot
stays in place better inside the shoe
when working out the lunar epic also has
a firmer feeling missile and finally the
lunar epic also uses nike flywire system
the fly wire system really helps to lock
down when you tighten your shoes and
when you tie in your laces it feels like
your whole foot is being compressed
while adidas is cage doesn't really do
much when you tighten your laces all you
get is some compression near the instep
of your foot overall both shoes have
some cool technology in them that have
helped drive innovation like he has been
working with Lunarlon for years and they
have developed many different techniques
to utilize the material they tweak their
missile design depending on different
sports to meet four specific needs yet
adidas is Boost technology is fairly
younger and has been growing up to do
boots is an amazing material that I'm
sure will evolve as time goes on
neither shoe or technology is better per
se they just have different
characteristics that are having pages in
different scenarios personally if I was
looking for a training shoe I pick up
the Nike lunar epic but for all other
situations or long-distance running I'm
definitely going with boots
