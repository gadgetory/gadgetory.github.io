for a little over a month now and even
though I do like the extreme - overall a
lot of people complain that it just
doesn't get loud enough but now JBL has
released a new firmware update that does
considerably improve the extreme choose
performance if you've been on the fence
about getting the extreme - or if you
really have one let's see what this new
firmware updates all about just so we're
clear this isn't a full review on the
JBL extreme - I'm just addressing the
new firmware update if you want to learn
more about the extreme - now watch its
full review but if you want to pick up
the JBL extreme - i'll have links to
description below and if you use the
links you really helps out the channel
and also check out the new merch shop
down below I actually didn't hear about
the new firmware update for the extreme
- until I actually saw comments
mentioning it in other videos
unlike the post 3 there's really no need
to even open up the JBL connect app with
the extreme - but when you do open up
the app you'll see a little notification
and you can start downloading the
firmware update right over-the-air the
only thing you really need to do is just
have the extreme 2 plugged in and wait
for about 10 minutes or so now we're
quickly going to jump into the sound
test which is going to be featuring the
original JBL extreme the extreme 2
before the updates and the extreme 2
after the update
under spotlight
like I said in the in this review the
extreme to hands-on nature sound
signature that overall sounds better
than the original extreme and after the
firmware update the extreme to still has
the same sound signature but I have
noticed there is considerably more bass
overall there's more bass at lower
volumes and more bass at higher volumes
but the biggest changes is new from our
update brings is how loud the extreme to
actually gets now these next clips have
each of the speakers playing the same
section of a song and next volume on
battery power alone you can clearly see
the original extreme struggles to get
over the hundred DB mark but it has an
easier time when it's actually plugged
in whereas the extreme two has no
problem staying over the 100 DB mark
after the new former update on battery
power alone the extreme two is now
clearly louder than the original extreme
even when it's plugged in and for
comparison before the firmware update
the extreme to perform pretty similarly
to the original extreme it only
occasionally managed to break through
that hundred DB mark but even at these
how our volumes the extreme two still
manages to keep distortion to a minimum
when the original extreme is playing a
max volume it does start to sound bright
and the space starts to sound muddy
whereas the bass on the extreme two is
cleaner and resonates much smoother but
even though this former L theatres great
at all there is some give-and-take
regarding battery life at 80% volume the
extreme two is now averaging nine hours
of playback time or as before it was
getting ten hours but all things
considered I don't think it's that big
of a deal even that you're getting more
bass and however volume out of the
extreme to even after this new firmware
update the extreme two is still gonna
have no problem keeping up with you if
you plan on taking it on the go but
everything I said in the initial review
still stands I like the JBL extreme -
it's a good speaker it sounds good it's
durable and it has
good battery life the extreme to got
more than loud enough for me even before
the firmware updates but with this new
update I can't deny that I'm really
enjoying me at the base if you already
have the extreme suit then I highly
recommend you going download that new
firmware update and if you've been on
the fence about getting the extreme -
then the extremes you just got a little
better if you made it this far I guess
you enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
