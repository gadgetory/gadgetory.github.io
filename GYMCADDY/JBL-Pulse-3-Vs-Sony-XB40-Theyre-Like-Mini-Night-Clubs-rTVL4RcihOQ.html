light show that flashes to the beat of
your music well right now your best
option is a brand new JBL pull story or
when I consider a bleeper hit the sony
xba-40 both of these speakers have an
impressive light shield feature built in
but they are very different from one
another this versus video is going to be
extra double because I genuinely really
like both of these speakers so let's get
into it which speakers right for you or
about to find out don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and you can watch
my debut upholstery video here after
you're done watching this video the JBL
pulse 3 is the new of these two speakers
and currently only comes in black the
white version should be released
sometime in September the post 3 also
currently retails for 199 95 the sony
xba-40 was released in the spring of
2017 and comes in a few colorways black
blue or red the XP 40 usually retails
for two hundred forty eight dollars over
at Amazon but I have seen a go on sale
for 198 from time to time if you want to
pick either these speakers up I'll have
links in description below and I'll keep
them updated so you can get the best
deals possible
first let's just form factor in material
the jb upholstery is a vertical style
speaker that has a hard plastic top an
island mesh fabric bottom soft touch
rubber padding on both end caps that
give it a good amount of grip passive
radiators on both side up and out base
are 360 degree light feature and control
buttons on the back the sony SP 40 is a
horizontal style speaker that's supposed
to be laid flat but you do have the
option to stain it on its side the
majority of the body is covered in the
soft stretchy rubber there's a metal
painted grill on the front on the front
you'll also climb a multicolored light
strip strobe lights on either side of
the speaker and the control buttons can
be found on the top the debut post three
charges via a micro USB cable while the
sony xba-40 uses a 9.5 volt DC in which
means if you're going to take the
speaker with you somewhere you have to
remember to take the charging cable both
speakers have an aux check if you want
to have a wired connection but the sony
xba-40 does have an extra USB port so
you can charge your phone I'll feature
that the JBL post 3 does not have but
something that sony xba-40 doesn't have
is a fuel gauge you
can't just check your battery at a
glance you have to press and hold the
phone Blaine and wait for the XP 40 to
verbally tell you our battery percentage
all you have to go digging through
Sony's music Center app to see your
battery percentage and that's if Sony's
muted Center app isn't acting up like it
does at the time the debut polls 3 has a
fuel gauge under its power button making
it very easy to know how much juice
you've got left which is very important
now the control lines on either speakers
are well laid out have great tact I'll
feedback and you do relatively the same
thing you can adjust your volume play or
pause your music skip a track answer or
in calls or activate Siri but one thing
the post we can't do is go back a track
which can get a little annoying at times
but the post story also allows you to
cycle through different life features
while on the sony xba-40 you have to do
that through the phone app but like I've
said in past videos I really wished
upholstery had textured biomes the
button layout on the post 3 is an
improvement from the pulse 2 but it's
still a little harder to know what
button you're pressing then under stone
exp for you personally I would have a
problem with either of these two designs
but if space is a big concern for you
then you'll be better off with the JBL
pulse 3 it has a much smaller footprint
than the sony xba-40 anyways half as
much the post 3 is around 2 pounds while
the XD 40 is around 4 pounds also the
post 3 is much easier to take with you
on the go then the XP for you and like I
mentioned earlier it charges via a micro
USB cable if you take this speaker to a
friend's house chances are you'll be
able to charge the post 3 while with the
sony xba-40 you have to remember to take
that charging cable with you but if
you're looking for something durable
you're also better off with the JBL pull
story because it's IPS 7 certified you
can splash it and even submerged
underwater and not have any problems it
even float so if it falls off your yacht
it's super easy to fish out the sony
xba-40 under the hand is only IP x5
certified you can still get it wet but I
would take it easy with the speaker just
to be safe but for sure don't simmer
down on the water get just a real easy
way to lose $250 but keep in mind even
though the post 3 isn't afraid of water
you do risk ranching the plastic top if
you're too rough on it now something
suspects both of these speakers are
using bluetooth for that
- and they can each pair to multiple
devices at the same time the range on
these speakers is very different the
sony xba-40 has reigned over around 40
feet with the right line of sight to
your phone but the JBL pulls 3 has a
range of around 70 feet but the both can
keep a solid connection through multiple
walls which is good if you want to walk
around the house and have uninterrupted
music these speakers can also be paired
to other speakers of the same make you
can pair up the tents only speakers
together and have them all play in sync
or you can get another XP 40 and pair
them together and have them play music
in stereo mode the post 3 is using JBL
connect plus and can chain up to 100 JBL
speakers together or you can get a
second JB upholstery and also have them
play in stereo mode and initiating the
pairing process on either of these two
speakers is really easy you just press
the add or JBL connect plus button and
you're done just keep in mind the post
we can only pair to other JBL connect
button label speakers like another pulse
3 or a flip for if you have a debut low
speaker that's using JBL connect you're
out of luck I don't want to point out
the sony xba-40 does have a little bit
more latency than the JBL pulse 3 if
you're going to watch the videos with
the sony xba-40 you're going to notice
lips so sync up like right now because I
just added some latency to the video to
me a latency just takes away from the
human experience battery life is very
different between these two speakers the
JBL pulls 3 advertisers or 12 hour
battery life but in my testing I've
managed to squeeze out 13 hours with the
life feature turned on at 25 percent
brightness and the volume set at 50
percent and I've managed to squeeze out
15 hours with the life feature turned
off Shoni on the other hand advertisers
or 24 hour battery life on the XP 40 but
with the strobe lights turned on and the
volume set at 50 percent I usually get
around 20 hours I guess if you use the
XP 40 with the life feature turned off
and at a lower volume you could
potentially get closer to them
advertised 24 hour battery life but keep
in mind the XP 40 is an advantage
because it's much larger now let's talk
about what really matters sound quality
like I set in past videos the JBL pull
story is a good sounding speaker it
metal-based with the mids and highs are
very clear
it has a wide soundstage that also has a
good amount of death there's good
instrument separation and there's very
little distortion at higher volumes but
keep in mind the JB upholstery is now a
360 degree speaker and it does a great
job of evenly blanketing an area thanks
to its 340 millimeter transducers the
sony xba-40 only should tell them to the
front the xba-40 also has a wide
soundstage with a good amount of death
but it does have much more bass which
isn't surprising because that's what the
xB and xB 40 stands for it also manages
to get significantly louder and that's
because it has 261 millimetre full range
speakers and dual passive radiators I
would be shocked if the xba-40 dedicated
in the post
3 and if I had to pick one of these
speakers purely on sound quality I would
go with the XP 40 these two speakers are
also special because they have built-in
light features but hands-down the life
feature on the post 3 is way better than
the one on the XP 40 the post story
gives you way more options and it's much
easier and enjoyable to control there
are multiple light settings in each of
them flash little bit of your music but
they each do so a little differently
there's ways jet explosion equalizer
rave rainbow fire and you can even make
you own and you can change the color of
the light feature by color matching with
your phone's camera or you can just use
the color wheel I've never had any
issues with JBL's connect up Sony's app
is a different story
it's gotten slightly better with each
update but it still isn't reliable
through Sony's Music Center app you have
a few like most to choose from
there's rave chill strobe and a few
different calm options if you use Sony's
feasible app you can also adjust a color
but personally I just leave the light
mode on the xB for you on chill or I
just keep it turned off most at a time
long story short if the light feature is
what's important to you then the post 3
won't disappoint now there's one more
thing I want to point out before
wrapping up this video even though I
love the sony xba-40 and it's been my
go-to speaker for a few months now
there's a major problem that I have yet
been able to fix if the battery on the
XP
40 gets below a certain threshold while
playing music the speaker will go mute
and say please charge but then the
volume won't go past 30 percent this is
infuriating especially if you're jamming
up to music and all of a sudden the
music just stops you have no other
option than to go and put the xba-40 on
the charger because if you turn it off
and turn it back on it's going to do the
same thing in a few minutes I have tried
and tried to turn this feature off but I
can't if I'm doing it wrong
please comment down below right over
okay now we can wrap this video up there
are a few things I did skip over but
here's the main takeaway if you're
trying to decide between these two
speakers and sound quality loudness and
bass or you mean priorities then you're
better off with the Sony X before you if
you're looking for something fun that
looks great and still sounds good then
the JBL pull 3 is the way to go the sony
xba-40 is great if you're looking for a
speaker that's just going to live in
your bedroom and you're now going to be
moving it a lot because remember you
have to carry around a charging cable
and it's bigger
the JBL pole story is the better option
if you want something a little smaller
with a great light show and that's a
little more portable if you want to
