least here in New York because it's a
hundred degrees right now and that means
vacation and cookouts and you're gonna
need some music I've recently reviewed
the JBL 54 and the ue one the boom and I
think it's time to put them up against
one another so which recently released
hundred dollars speaker should you pick
up let's find out the UE when the boom
curly comes in six colorways n retails
for $99.99 over at Amazon if you're
looking for a small wireless speaker
with Styles then the one the boom might
be for you the JBL for the four on the
other hand comes in seven colorways and
retails for ninety nine ninety five over
at Amazon as well but knowing Amazon
will randomly put either one of these
speakers on sale from time to time if
you want to pick either one of these up
I'll have links in the description below
and I'll keep them updated as best I can
so you can get the best view okay so
let's get the obvious stuff out of the
way both of these products are Bluetooth
wireless speakers that towards you your
micro USB cable they're both fairly
rugged any both have plastic and weaved
exteriors and they're both fairly
compact and are meant to go with you
almost anywhere and they both have
built-in buttons so you can control your
music playback and they're both ipx7 and
waterproof and that's really well the
similarities end for starters the JBL
flip for in the UE one boom have very
different battery life the JBL flip 4
has a 14 hour battery life and has no
problem lasting a little longer
depending on how you're playing your
music the UA one the boom on the other
hand has a max battery life of 10 hours
and if you play your music at a higher
volume then your battery life will
suffer when I play my music and max
volume my wonderful only lasted 3 hours
which could be a problem for some
so battery life goes to the JBL flip for
both of these speakers also have the
ability to pair up with other speakers
so they can play music simultaneously
but the way they do it is very different
the JBL flip 4 features JBL connect plus
another allows you to pair up to 100 JBL
connect plus enabled devices and if you
have two JBL flip fours you can pair
them up together and have them play
music in a stereo mode the ua when the
boom is a little more limited only
allowing you to pair a maxim to
wonderbook together and when those two
when the booms are paired they only play
music simultaneously and don't create
that stereo
connectivity points also goes to the JBL
flip for christening sound quality I
prefer the JBL flip for over the Ewing
wonderful in general the JBL flip force
sounds better has a wider soundstage and
has a cleaner resolution than do you
weigh wonderbook whereas the ue wonder
boom tends to sound rather shallow
compared to the JBL flip 4 and the mids
and highs tend to crash a little harsher
at higher volume but the ua wonder boom
does shoot sound in all 360 degrees
while the JBL foot 4 only shoots music
out through the front of the device
don't get me wrong
neither one of these devices sound
incredible at higher volume and they
shouldn't because they are small
speakers but the JBL flip for is
superior over the ewing wonderbook the j
beautiful 4 also has an auxiliary jack
while the one of them doesn't so you can
enjoy the benefits of better sound
quality through a wired connection or
say some battery on your phone if you
want to use glue to JBL it takes of
sound quality points to while I
commented earlier both of these speakers
are ipx7 rated which means there are
waterproof
both of these speakers have no problem
being swimmers in water but one big
difference between the two is that the
one that boom flows so for some reason
either one of these speakers were to
fall into a pool or lake the one the
boom would be easier to save the flip
floor would just sink to the bottom and
if the first four sinks to the bottom of
the lake then you could just say goodbye
also in general the UE one boom is a lot
more rugged than the JBL flip 4 and
since there are no moving parts you
don't have to worry about the one two
boom getting damaged if it's packed in a
cramped bag or something
so the ue wonder boom gets a tough
mudder wood here ok and here are a few
arbitrary things I want to point out
before I wrap things up although both of
these speakers are using bluetooth for
that too and can be up to two devices at
the same time the UE wonder boom does
have a slightly longer range than the
JBL flip for the debut flip floor also
has a built in microphone so you can
take phone calls and talk to Siri and
the blinds on the GBO before also have a
better tactile feedback than the UE
wonderful also the jbo v 4 also has a
built in battery gauge that allows you
to see your estimated battery on the
table for four
unlike the UE wonderful which plays a
tone when you press the plus and minus
one
at the same time so if you're looking
for a small Bluetooth speaker that
sounds good has a long battery life and
you're going to take it with you from
time to time and you have 100 I'll
suspend then I say get the JBL flip for
if you need something more rugged and
durable then go with the wonderful like
I said on my miserable view the Wonder
boom is a great second speaker if you
already have a decent speaker at home
the Wonder boom is a good speaker to
have dedicated for camping trips pool
parties or cookout what I wouldn't get
the one boom if this is going to be my
one and only speaker check out my full
JBL flip four and you lean wonderful
