to be a little raspy er than usual cific
kind of has a special place in my heart
because the super flex 2 is the first
product I reviewed on this channel it's
a pretty bad video so don't watch it but
today I have to submit out to HR in the
mail and the biggest upgrade to the new
Alta is the heart rate monitor on the
back so should you go with the Fitbit
Alta HR or just pick up the Fitbit
charge - first I want to talk about the
price because it's a little strange at
the time of this recording the original
script that also without the heart rate
monitor currently retails for the same
one 2995 the Fitbit Alta HR is currently
selling for one forty nine ninety five
or one 7995 depending on the color the
Ultra HR also comes in a total of six
colorways the Fitbit charge two
currently also retails for one forty
nine ninety five or one 7995 depending
on the color as well
why would Fitbit price the new alter HR
as the same as a Fitbit charge - when
the charge - is all around better than
the alter HR I can see fit they're
cutting the price of the Ultra HR to one
twenty nine ninety five and just
continuing the original Auto once the
stock went down in the coming month if
you're interested in picking up either
one of these variables I have a link in
the description with the best deal on
either one of these Amazon routinely
puts the Fitbit charge two on sale now
let's jump into the unboxing Packaging
is practically identical to the Fitbit
also in true fitbit fashion the
packaging feels very premium when you
open the letter you'll see the alter HR
itself
you only get one wristband so make sure
you select the right size when ordering
yours inside the box you will also find
a QuickStart guide that tells you to
download the Fitbit app to your phone
and warranty information below that
you'll find the charging cradle for the
Fitbit Alta HR the also HR is very
similar to the original also but there
are two major differences that stand out
first up is the heart rate monitor and
die that's why it's called the Alta HR
but the other difference here is the
class the original alter has the stupid
setup that's always a pain with a butt
to put on but this new also has a proper
clasp on it something I am very happy to
see the addition of the heart rate
monitor did increase the thickness of
the alter h or slightly but it's not
that noticeable
just like other fitbit products the
fitbit alta HR feels very premium the
spam is made out of that soft touch
silicone material that we've come to
know and love from flippin the casing
itself is made out of stainless steel
I'm not entirely sure what comes the
screen I don't know if it's a hard
plastic or Gorilla Glass
but overall the main unit is very well
put together the Alta HR also has the
same interchangeable voice fans as your
original with the same quick release
mechanism and if you want to buy extra
wrist bands you can get them directly
from Fitbit or from some third parties
McCune under Fitbit Alta HR is not a
traditional touch screen instead it
responds to the force from your tap
which is good because this type of
screen responds actually when you try to
use it when you're sweaty you can change
the style and layout of your watch face
in Fitbit mobile app but for the most
part the auto HR will show you the time
your steps taken calories burned
distance walks heart rate and your
active minutes the rippen also HR is a
really simple yet elegant finished
tracker that will show you your stats in
a very simple and streamlined manner
spec wise the Alta HR connects your
phone via bluetooth it has a seven day
battery life with normal use but it's
really molecule five-day battery life
you charge the alta HR by placing it in
its cradle that really reminds me of a
predator the Alta HR is splash proof but
not waterproof which means you better
not try swimming with it also the Alta
HR will show you notification for
incoming calls and text messages you
can't really do much like respond to a
text or an Android code all the auto HR
does is notify you that someone is
trying to reach you I've said it before
but when buying a fitness tracker you're
not just buying the hardware you're also
buying into the software and sip it
hands down still has the best fitness
tracking app on the market it's super
easy to use but still very in-depth
inside the app you can get detailed
views of your calories burn steps taken
distance walk active minutes floors
climb track your exercise track your
sleep quality track your completed
remove reminders and now you can also
check your heart rate readings with the
alter a charm sip it also has challenges
you can complete and medals you can earn
to help you stay motivated if it also
now has guided workout routines through
their new fit star apps overall the new
Fitbit ultra HR is what the original
Fitbit alter from last year should have
been the heart rate sensor is a very
welcome feature that finally makes
alcohol as a product the design is
elegant but skews more towards women but
at 149.95 it's a little hard to
recommend over the equally price and
superior Fitbit charge - if Fitbit ends
up selling we alter HR for one 29.95 and
manages to make it swim proof then it's
a knockout hey if you made it this far I
