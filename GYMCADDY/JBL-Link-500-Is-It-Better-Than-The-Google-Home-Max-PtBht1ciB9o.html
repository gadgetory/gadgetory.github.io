quietly released their JBL link 500
smart speaker and basically the lead 500
does the same thing as the bow behold
max it's a smart speaker that's all
about sound so if you're considering a
smart speaker for your home or you're
better off with the googles offering or
something from a third party let's find
out JBL is link series line up now
consists of four different speakers
there's the link 10 in the link 20 which
are kind of like voice assistant enables
JBL flip fours which also have built-in
batteries and then there's the link 300
in the link 500 which don't have
built-in batteries and just like the
Google home max the link 500 currently
cost $400 but I want to be surprised if
it goes on sale here and there
design-wise de JBL link 500 is slightly
larger than the Google home max it also
has the same fabric outer shell that's
pretty synonymous with other JBL
speakers and it comes in two colors
black or white unlike the Google home
max which has a touch sensitive touch
bar on the top which only allows you to
adjust your volume and player positive
music the length 500 has a few more
buttons on the top that allow you to do
a little more than the max more
importantly it has a dedicated button so
you can activate Google assistant
something that I don't understand why
the max does in half and if you double
press the play pause button you can skip
a track directly from the speaker
something that again the max can do even
though it's pretty simple the length 500
also has a dedicated bluetooth pairing
button which does come in handy if the
link 500 isn't connected to Wi-Fi and if
you just want to use a Bluetooth
connection instead and finally there's a
mic mute button mic is muted on the
front of the speaker you'll also find a
white LED notification lights that light
up when Google is listening to you just
like the max and on the bottom you'll
also find our Wi-Fi indicator light and
like I mentioned in my link 10 in like
20 video I feel this light is completely
unnecessary unless there's a problem
with the Wi-Fi connection there's no
need to constantly keep this light on
even though Google home max doesn't have
this useless and annoying like another
thing I don't like about the link 500 is
the lack of ports there's no aux jack
and there's no USB type-c port like the
Mac's for me it would have been a
no-brainer to include these ports on the
link
hundred and something I really want to
point out is the weight difference the
length 500 weighs in at 7.7 pounds while
the Google home max weighs in at a hefty
12 pounds but aside that Google
assistant performance on the link 500 is
just as accurate and just as fast as any
another Google home speaker the link 500
pixel in various distances just as well
and in queries or process just as fast
hey what's the current temperature in
New York City in New York City right now
it's 21 hey what's the current price of
Bitcoin 1 BTC is approximately fourteen
thousand seven hundred twenty United
States dollars and fifteen cents okay
now let's talk about what really matters
sound you may know by now that the
Google home acts is rocking dual 4.5
inch woofers and dual point seven inch
tweeters whereas the jbo Ling 500 has
dual 3.5 inch woofers dual point eight
inch tweeters and it has an exposed
passive radiator on the back that really
moves when the basement really gets
going
Oh
okay first off the Google home max gets
slightly louder than the JBL in five
hundred and max volume but only by a few
decibels and max volume both of these
speakers live in the low eighties
decibel range and they both suffer a
relatively the same amount of sound
distortion so if loudness is your main
priority that both of these speakers
perform relatively the same
like I've said in past videos the Google
home max has a v-shaped sound signature
there's a lot of emphasis on the bass
and on the highs but the vocals in major
are a little push back whereas the JBL
in 500 has a more even sound signature
but with an emphasis on the vocals it
also has a good amount of bass but the
bass is not as punchy as to Google home
max and the lows don't resonate as much
as the max either although both of these
speakers do sound really good the sound
of the max is much fuller you can
literally feel the music with the max
and as a result it's more fun to listen
to
but the Google home max is definitely
geared towards people who listen to pop
hip-hop dance R&amp;amp;B or rap with the strong
emphasis on the bass if you're somebody
who loves bass then the Google home max
is great but if you prefer of flatter
sound signature and you'll be better off
with the J billing 500 but if you're
building out a smart home with Google
assistant in mind it is a great thing to
have options when it comes to hardware
but keep in mind third party hardware
might mean delays when it comes to the
newest features first off with the JBL
smart speakers you can't make phone
calls like you would with either of the
Google home smart speakers hey go Paul
GameStop sorry I can't make calls yet
hey Paul gangsta
calling game stuff thank you for calling
Game Stop well we have the best
selection and deals and video game
console and collectors will hang up you
also can't use the broadcast feature and
the JB Lang 500 doesn't allow you to
adjust an eq like you can on the max
hopefully Jay Bilas more speakers and
all other third-party Google assistants
of our speakers will add new Google home
features shortly after Google releases
them because I would hate to see the
same type of fragmentation Andrew
suffered when it was first released
although I do like to JBL link 10 and
the link 20 because they sound much
better than the Google home if you're
trying to decide between the Google home
max and the Jay building 500 I think
you're much better off with the Google
home max unless you're not a fan of the
v-shaped sound signature it has to offer
I personally think it looks better than
the j building 500 and using google's
own hardware means you'll have access to
the newest features as soon as they drop
but like i said i'm an initial review i
would like to see google add some extra
tap functionality to the max so you can
control your music playback and tab to
activate Google assistant is that too
much to ask for
