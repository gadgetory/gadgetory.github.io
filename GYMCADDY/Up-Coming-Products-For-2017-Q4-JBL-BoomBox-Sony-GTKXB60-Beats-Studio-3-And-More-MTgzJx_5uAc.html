new alpha products are about to drop in
the next few days but I thought it'd be
a good idea to give you guys a quick
rundown of what else to expect from
other companies like Sony JBL Samsung
Fitbit and so on so if you're in the
market for a pair of new headphones
speakers wearables or drone keep
watching don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe and you can watch some of
my other videos here after you're done
watching this video so you may or may
not note that beach will be releasing
their new beats studio 3 wireless
headphones in mid-october cosmetically
they look identical to the studio - but
they were supposed to have brand new
internals which will supposedly improve
their overall sound active noise
cancellation include Apple's new W 2
chip a longer battery life and facil but
Sony will also be dropping their WH
1000x and 2 wireless headphones the Sony
WH 1000 X and 2 are the updated version
of their already amazing premium
consumer active noise-cancelling
headphones they're going to retail for
$350 and have improved active noise
cancellation in the longer battery life
of 30 hours over the previous versions
20 hours sadly they did not improve the
overall design Sony will also be
dropping a ton of other products in the
back half of September to start they've
got their WI 1000x neck band which are
noise canceling in-ear earbuds with a
battery life of 10 hours and if you want
truly wireless earbuds they are also be
dropping their WF 1000x
which are Wire free in your earbuds that
also have active noise canceling with
the total battery life of 9 hours but
between charges that your buds are only
good for 3 hours
these earbuds will be going on sale for
$299.99 and $199.99 respectively and
sony isn't done there they're also going
to be releasing their GT kxb 60 and GT
kxb 90 which are sony's larger portable
bluetooth speakers with built-in light
features those are going to be selling
for $350 and $450 and JBL is also going
to be shipping their hotly anticipated
JBL boombox
at the beginning of October for $450 as
well look out for a JBL boombox vs. Sony
GT kxb 90 video in mid-october and JBL
also has a few products they're set to
drop in the coming
first of the JBL reflect fit a neck band
with a built-in heart rate monitor and
in-ear earbuds I'm assuming the heart
rate monitor is built into the neck
portion of the neck band because the
earbuds will look fairly standard and
JBL is also going to jump into the
wireless earbuds game with their JBL
free in-ear earphones they look more
rugged and are set to have a longer
battery life than the Sony UWF 1000x but
no active noise cancellation both of
these products should be released this
coming October in the States and then
there's the JBL link series without a
set release date the JBL link series are
JBL's first have voice-activated
speakers with integrated google
assistant and they will come in three
different sizes it's not bad to have
options if you're interested in picking
up a smart speaker and everyone is
jumping on the smart speaker praise
we've known about the Apple home pod
since June and Sony will be releasing
their own smart speaker that looks very
similar to the whole pod except there's
more functionality like LED lights on
the front and gesture control is on the
top but honestly I feel the gesture
controls are a bit of a gimmick but Sony
smart speaker dub the LFS 50 G should be
released in mid-october and then there's
the Panasonic s CGA 10 also a smart
speaker with audio quality first
just like Sony's and Apple's smart
speakers Panasonic's smart speaker is
slated to be released around the time
the Apple home pot is but there is still
no set price and honestly I like the
design of the Panasonic's smart speaker
better than Apple's and Sony's but we'll
have to see how that's more speaker does
once it's released and then there's
Samsung who also has a few products in
the pipeline first up is their updated
gear fit 2 pro the biggest noticeable
update of the gear fit 2 Pro is that
it's now waterproof and you can swim
with it and you can also stream music
with it offline and it also has two
built-in GPS the gear fit 2 pro is
supposed to be released on September 15
Samsung is also set to release their
updated gear iconic shoreless earbuds
with Bigsby integration since the
original gear ikonics wasn't so good
hopefully their second try is better
and then you've got Samsung's gear Sport
which is yet another SmartWatch from
Samsung and there's also Fitbit with its
highly anticipated ionic SmartWatch and
flower headphones
although the Fitbit Flyer headphones
don't look like anything revolutionary
the ionic SmartWatch
look interesting for starters the Fitbit
ionic is supposed to work nicely with
both Apple and Android devices which
isn't the case for Samsung's wearables
and since the ionic is in the vapid
ecosystem it could possibly be the best
SmartWatch for fitness focused people
but since Apple announced their Apple
watch TV stream and watch always for
overall improving the Apple watch is
Fitbit too late and there are a few
things you can expect from Google this
October first there is the pixel two
which is a given it's supposed to have
64 gigs of storage as entry level just
like the new iPhones and you can say
goodbye to the headphone jack but
hopefully they will reduce those bezels
and it's rumored that Google isn't just
working on one pair of wireless earbuds
but two rumors are swirling around
saying that Google will be releasing a
pair of wireless earbuds just like
apples and a pair of wireless headphones
which will also have Google assistant
integration and here's my home
prediction since the Google home is
about to be a one-year old and since
there's so much competition growing in
that space I wouldn't be surprised if
Google announced an updated Google home
with better audio capabilities so we can
go toe-to-toe with the home pod and
Amazon's Alexa show which surprisingly
sounds very good and if you're still
looking into drones then you should know
DJI just announced the DJI Matic pro
platinum and the phantom 4 pro these
aren't brand new models just slightly
updated the DJI Matic pro platinum will
be selling for $1100 and has a slightly
longer battery life of 30 minutes and we
designed props so we can fly a little
quieter but if you already have a DJI
Matic Pro you can buy the new props
separately and enjoy some quiet flight
and then there's the phantom 4 probe
which will be selling for $1,500
although it still comes with the same
camera and gimbal setup as the Phantom 4
advanced the pro variant has a whole
bunch more obstacle avoidance sensors so
hopefully this drone will never crash
either when autonomously flying or if
you're piloting it hey if you enjoyed
