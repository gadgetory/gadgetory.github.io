new Bose noise canceling headphones 700’s
aka the NC 700’s are finally here.
Now even though there is a lot of hype around
these headphones they aren’t replacing the
Bose QC35’s… they’re more of a higher
tier variant.
Kind of like how there’s the iPhone XR and
the iPhone XS, the Mercedes E Class and the
Merceds S Class, or your standard 3D movie
and then there’s IMAX 3D.
Now over all these are a decent pair of ANC
headphones, but there are somethings I would
have done differently.
Now for starters the new Bose NC 700’s are
retailing for $400 dollars which is $50 more
than the Bose QC35’s and the majority of
their competition.
And just knowing Bose, I doubt these headphones
will be going on sale any time soon.
But if you want to pick any of the headphones
up mentioned in this video they’ll be linked
down below.
Now first let's talk about these headphone’s
design cause its proven to be rather polarizing.
Personally I don’t hate it but I also don’t
love it.
From a materials standpoint you’ve got this
mostly exposed stainless steel headband with
silicon on the top and underside of the headband
and the leatherette on the ear pads feels
just as great as the leatherette on the Bose
QC35’s.
These headphones definitely feel premium,
but not as durable as their counterpart the
Bose QC35’s.
But from a ports standpoint, thankfully the
NC 700’s have been upgraded to USB C Charging.
But unfortunately these headphones are still
using a 2.5 millimeter audio jack, and it
also doesn’t help that Bose decided to throw
in a super cheap audio cable with their $400
headphones.
And personally I do think this is a big deal
especially if you’re a content creator or
if you plan on using these headphones a lot
on flights.
Now over all looks are subjective, but the
main reason why I’m not the biggest fan
of these new headphones design is cause their
headband isn’t all that low profile.
These headphones actually have more of a rounding
affect than the Bose QC 35’s.
But objectively I’m also not a fan of this
design because these headphones can only be
laid down flat.
Which means the carrying case that comes included
with these headphones is pretty big.
Now its not as big as the surface headphones,
but it is slightly bigger than the Bose QC35’s
or Sony 1000XM3’s carrying cases.
But I do want to point out that this carrying
case does have a cool little storage compartment
to store your cables.
But still, if I’m looking for a pair of
ANC headphones to mostly travel or commute
with I want their carrying case to be as small
as possible so I can cram them in more easily
into my already over stuffed bag.
But when it comes to fit, unfortunately the
Bose NC 700’s just aren’t as comfortable
as the Bose QC35’s.
The NC 700’s still have those super spacious
ear cups just like on the QC35’s… but
unfortunately the headband on the NC 700’s
does have more clamping force than the QC35’s.
Now personally I can wear these headphones
for hours on end, but I do have to constantly
readjust them every 20 minutes or so.
You just don’t forget they’re there like
the Bose QC35’s.
So to be on the safe side, I gotta say the
Bose NC 700’s are not big head approved.
And just so that you can get an idea of how
these headphones rank comfort wise for me,
I gotta say a solid first place goes to the
Bose QC35’s, followed by the Sony XB900N,
then the Sony 1000XM3’s, Bose NC 700’s
come in fourth, and then there’s the Surface
Headphones.
But now lets get into tech specs and features.
When it comes to battery life, these headphones
have an advertised battery life of 20 hours
which is the same as the Bose QC35’s.
Now a 20 hour battery life is nothing to scuff
at, but most ANC headphones these days are
aiming for a 30 plus hour battery life now.
But at least the fast charging on these headphones
has been upgraded from the Bose QC35’s cause
a 15 minute charge from a dead battery will
get you 3 and half hours of playback time.
Now when it comes to bluetooth connectivity
thankfully these headphones can be connected
to two devices at the same time, which means
if you’re a power user you can easily hot
swap from one device to another.
Now this is a big deal cause simultaneous
multi device connectivity still isn’t a
standard feature on all headphones.
The NC 700’s are also great for watching
videos on your phone cause they have zero
latency across the board whether you’re
using an apple or android device.
But unfortunately for my android users these
headphones don’t have any APTX support,
just AAC.
Ultimately this isn’t a big deal but I did
want to point that out.
I also want to quickly address Bose AR, long
story short, as of summer 2019 Bose AR is
still very much in its infancy.
Its one of those features that you’ll maybe
play around with for 20 minutes and then forget
its even there.
But if you want to see Bose AR in action you
can click to tap here.
But I also want to point out that Bose AR
still isn’t available for android users,
but still you don’t gotta worry about FOMO
cause you’re not missing out on much.
But now lets talk about the active noise cancellation
on the NC 700’s.
Over all it is slightly better than the active
noise cancelation on the Bose QC35’s.
For starts the Bose NC 700’s do a better
job of rejecting wind noise than the QC35’s
when used out doors.
And like I’ve mentioned in the past, one
of my biggest issues with the Bose QC35’s
is that their ANC has a lot of cabin pressure.
Now I know this may not be the case for everyone
but it is the case for me and a good chunk
of other people.
Even though the NC 700’s does still have
some cabin pressure its definitely much more
manageable.
And performance wise the ANC on the NC 700’s
is also a touch better than the QC35’s.
But so you can hear for yourself we’re going
to jump into an ANC test.
Like you may have just heard, the ANC on both
of these headphones perform relatively the
same.
But if you listen closely the NC 700’s do
manage to block out slightly more road noise
than the QC 35’s and they do manage to block
out slightly more chatter as well.
But for all intents and purposes the major
differentiating factor between the ANC on
both of these headphones is the reduction
of the cabin pressure on the Bose NC 700’s.
But one of the biggest new features on the
NC 700’s which has been sorely lacking on
the Bose QC35’s is the addition of an ambient
mode.
Now an ambient mode has been pretty standard
on most premium and mid range ANC headphones
now, so its great to see Bose finally catch
up.
Now through Bose’s app you can go in and
select how much ambient sound you would like
to let in.
And having an ambient mode on your headphones
is great cause this way you can still be aware
of your surroundings when you're walking around
the city when you're commuting to or from
work.
And for the most part the ambient mode on
the NC 700’s has been properly implemented
in the sense that is sounds natural and there
isn’t any hissing going on in the background.
Which is something you don’t want to hear
if you're watching a movie with these headphones
with their ambient mode turned on at home
like I do.
But unfortunately the ambient mode on these
headphones pump in everything, they don’t
actively block out random loud noises like
the Sony 1000XM3’s.
Now this small, but very important detail
means that if your dog starts barking while
youre wearing these headphones at home or
if a siren passes by when youre walking out
out side youre going to hear all of those
loud noises through your headphones.
And just so that you can see what I’m talking
about, here’s what I call the clap test
So yeah, even though I’m very glad the Bose
NC 700’s have an ambient mode I do wish
it was smart enough to watch out for those
random loud noises.
But who knows, maybe they can fix that through
a software update.
But I’m also glad to see that these headphones
now have a dedicated ANC button which you
can use to toggle between your ANC settings.
Through Bose’s app you can select 3 presets
and you can just quickly cycle between them
depending on your current situation.
And also if you press and hold the ANC button
on these headphones you’ll activate conversation
mode where the headphones will pause your
music and pump in all of the ambient sound
around you so you can quickly talk to someone
without having to take your headphones off
like this.
And then if you press the ANC button again
or press on the touch pad the headphones will
go back to their initial ANC settings and
start playing your music again.
And personally I like Bose’s conversation
mode cause you don’t have to keep pressing
down on the ANC button.
You just activate it and then your hands free.
But on the other ear cup there’s a dedicated
Voice assistant button.
Now the Bose QC 35 series II were the first
ANC headphones with google assistant integration.
But if you wanted to have google assistant
on your headphones you would also have to
choose between being able to manually toggle
your ANC settings or voice assistant integration.
But thankfully that’s not the case with
the Bose NC 700’s and these days you can
choose between which voice assistant you want
to use on your headphones.
Personally I prefer google assistant and it
works a little like this.
But
now lets talk about how these headphones sound.
For starters, the Bose NC 700’s sound pretty
much the same as the Bose QC35’s.
Which means if you love or hate how the Bose
QC35’s sound then the same is going to go
for the NC 700’s.
Now the NC 700’s aim for a clear and neutral
sound signature.
Vocalists are very prominent on these headphones
and even though the bass does resonate quite
a bit on both of these headphones its not
really going to thump your head.
Which means youre not really going to be able
to feel your music.
And just like before you still can’t adjust
the EQ on these headphones through Bose’s
app.
Over all these are good sounding headphones
but they’re aimed to please people who prefer
a neutral sound signature.
But I do want to point out that the NC 700’s
preform better than the QC35’s when ANC
is turned on.
When the ANC on the QC35’s is turned on
the sound stage is narrowed a little bit and
the bass slightly reduced as well… so if
you want to get the best sound quality out
of the QC35’s you should use them with their
ANC turned off.
Where as the NC 700’s sound pretty much
identical with ANC turned on or off which
is a great thing to see.
But besides the NC 700’s rather polarizing
design another controversial decision Bose
has made is adding a touch pad to their new
headphones.
Now the touch sensitive surface on these headphones
is located in this half circle, and after
a few days of using these headphones I’ve
gotten used to using this very small touch
pad.
Over all it is rather accurate and easy to
use.
Double tap to play or pause, swipe front or
back to skip through your music and you swipe
up or down to adjust the volume.
The only thing I don’t like about this touch
pad is that you have to do a swipe for every
step in volume you want to go up or down.
You can’t just press and hold to change
your volume quickly.
Over all this is a small nit pick but after
a few days you get used to this touchpad.
But I know some people just prefer physical
buttons and I don’t blame you.
But finally lets talk about the microphones
on these headphones.
For starters the Bose QC35’s have always
had one of the best microphones for phone
calls when it came to headphones.
But Bose has simply out done them selves with
the call quality on the NC 700’s.
And it makes sense since these headphones
are mostly marketed towards working professionals.
Now this is an audio sample of what it would
sound like if you were taking a phone while
youre walking to or from work.
And here’s an audio sample if you were taking
a phone call in a quite office or at home.
And I also want to quickly point out that
through Bose’s app you can even adjust how
much you can hear your own voice while on
phone calls.
But for comparison, here’s an indoors audio
sample of the Bose QC35’s… it still sounds
good, but not as good as the Bose NC 700’s.
But over all Bose has definitely taken steps
to improve the technology and features found
in their newest ANC headphones.
The Active Noise Cancelation on the NC 700’s
performs over all better than the QC35’s
cause they have less cabin pressure, they
do a better job of rejecting wind noise, and
it doesn’t change how these headphones sound
when turned on.
The inclusion of an ambient mode has been
a long time coming and for the most part it
works very well.
Now sound quality wise these headphones aren’t
going to please everyone, but they have a
great neutral sound signature.
Now a 20 hour battery life is a little disappointing
on these headphones given their competition…
But I’m not really going to hold it against
them given their super minimalist design.
It's a sacrifice you're going to have to decide
to make or not.
Now when it comes to these headphone’s design…
that’s all subjective but personally I don’t
like the not so low profile headband, and
only being able to fold these headphones flat
means the carrying case is going to be a little
bigger.
But fit wise, again these headphones do have
those great super spacious ear cups but I
don’t think they’re as comfortable as
the QC35’s cause of their added clamping
force.
So to be on the safe side I don’t think
these are big head approved.
But over all, the new Bose NC 700’s are
a very decent pair of
ANC headphones.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
