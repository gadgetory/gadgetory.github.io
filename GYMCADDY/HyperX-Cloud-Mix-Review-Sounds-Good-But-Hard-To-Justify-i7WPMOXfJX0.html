fan of HyperX and their HyperX cloud
alpha gaming headset for $100 gaming
headset I honestly couldn't ask for more
ice and so so lightweight and
comfortable you forget you have them on
when you're gaming as they bring extra
little touches like a braided cable and
a minimal design overall they're a great
value
so when HyperX announced their new cloud
mix a gaming headset you can also use as
Bluetooth headphones I had to check them
out and even though they do sound pretty
good I think they're pretty hard to
justify the HyperX cloud mix currently
only comes in an all-black colorway and
retails for $200 making these hyper X's
most expensive headphones in a slide up
whereas the cloud offers go for $100 if
you want to pick either of these
headphones up I'll have links in
description below and if you use the
links really upset the channel and also
check up at my shelf down below first up
there's a lot to like about the HyperX
cloud mix they come included with a very
nice feeling carrying pouch but if you
plan on traveling with these headphones
I do suggest you get a hard shell
carrying case just like hyper access
other headphones these headphones come
included with a removable boom mic and
all of the included cables or braided
you got a one point three meter long 3.5
mm audio cable dee can plug it to your
controller or phone and this cable also
has an inline controller you also get a
2 meter long PC extension cable so you
can directly plug into your audio and
microphone jacks on your PC and finally
the cloud mix also comes included with a
micro USB cable for charging but like
I've said in past videos I feel that
have phones that are coming out in late
2018 so come included with the USB C
port instead build quality wise the
cloud makes do not disappoint for HyperX
headphones just like the cloud album the
mix has an aluminum frame the faux
leather on the ear cups and headband
feels very supple and the ear cups
themselves have a soft search feel to
them very similar to what you would find
on the Skullcandy crochet 360 and sony
1000 x m3 and overall these headphones
are very solid there's zero creaking and
squeaking when you flex the headband
which is a very nice thing to see but
when it comes to their design in fits
there are a few things I want to point
out the cloud makes have a very subtle
design for gaming headphones but for
Bluetooth head
phones that you might want to wear out
in public their ear cups do stick out
quite a bit they don't stick out as much
as the infamous Sony xb9 50 n 1 but you
can see the clown mix in your peripheral
vision but design aside since the ear
cups on the clown mix don't pivot too
much it does mean they do apply a little
pressure on the anterior portion of a
year it's not bad and obviously these
headphones are big head approved because
they have very little clamping force but
since we're talking about 200 all our
headphones here I want the ear cups to
apply an even amount of pressure around
my ear now the cloud alpha is also apply
an uneven amount of pressure on my ears
when I wear them but since these are
hundred dollar headphones I'll deal with
it the ear crypts on the cloud mix are
also very spacious and should have no
problem fitting most ear types but since
the ear grooves on the cloud alpha are
slightly larger they're also slightly
more comfortable in comparison but
another problem with the cloud mix that
I do want to point out is that they
offer very little passive noise
isolation and they suffer from a lot of
sound leakage now passive noise
isolation and sound leakage isn't a big
deal for gaming headphones cuz you're
mainly going to use them at home when
you're gaming but for $200 Bluetooth
headphones noise isolation and sound
leakage is a big deal because you want
to be able to hear you music when you're
out in public where it can be noisy and
you also don't want people sitting next
to you on the bus complaining that your
music is too loud and when it comes to
their sound quality I can't deny these
headphones sound pretty good when
listening to music they have a very
similar sound signatures to the bose
qc25 where there's an emphasis on the
mids and trouble so vocalist or very
pronounced but just like the Bose even
though the bass is present it's not
going to hit you like the 1000x m3 but
unlike the post QC 35s no matter how
intense the bass gets on these
headphones the bass never bottles out
which is great for both listening to
music and for when you're gaming and an
explosion goes off but something that
also impressed me about these headphones
is just how loud they managed to get all
while suffering very little to no
Distortion these headphones are perhaps
one of the loudest headphones I've
tested so far and honestly they get so
loud that I feel it's unsafe but overall
these headphones sound good for both
gaming and for people who like listening
to music with a brighter sound signature
when it comes to tech specs HyperX
advertises a 20 hour battery life on
these headphones which is just a little
below average for headphones these days
now obviously when you're going to game
with these headphones you're gonna have
to use them passively because these
headphones will automatically power off
as soon as you plug in the audio cable
now a 20 hour battery life for Bluetooth
headphones is okay but since these are
$200 headphones it does suck that they
don't have fast charger now when it
comes to their Bluetooth connection
these headphones are rockin bluetooth
4.2 they have about a 30 foot range and
the connection can go through multiple
walls without any problems but these
headphones can only be connected to one
device at a time but these headphones
also have very little latency so they're
actually pretty good for watching
YouTube videos on your phone the latency
is only noticeable if you go in looking
for it even though for the most part I
do like these headphones for gaming
something that drives me crazy about the
cloud mix when I look at them as
Bluetooth headphones are the buttons and
the layout on the right ear cup you have
your power button and volume rocker even
though the volume rocker is slightly
raised the power button isn't so every
time I go to power these headphones on I
have to go hunting for that power button
and even though the volume rocker is
slightly raised since it's so hard to
tell the volume up and volume down but
and apart I always have to do this
little check to make sure I'm pressing
the right button but what I hate most
about these headphones is that they're
multi-purpose button is on the left ear
cup instead of the right ear cup where
all the other buttons are so every time
I go to skip a track I reach for the
right ear cup by accident having the
multi-purpose button and volume rocker
on different ear cups isn't just weird I
can't think of another pair of
headphones that I've tested that does
this and honestly I don't know what
hyperox was thinking when they decided
to go with this layout well finally
let's talk about the microphones found
on the HyperX cloud mix now just like
most other bluetooth headphones these
headphones have a built-in electric
connected microphone and the sound
quality for phone calls is so-so but
just as you respect as soon as you
attach the boom microphone the
difference is night and day and this
microphone does a very good job of
picking up just your voice and avoiding
everything else but overall I feel the
HyperX cloud makes or another great pair
of gaming
phones they sound very good for
listening to music and they're very
lightweight so they're great for hours
and hours of gaming but when you look at
them as 200 other bluetooth headphones
it's very hard to justify dropping all
that cash on these headphones because
these headphones don't perform any
better than $200 cloud
Alfa's you're just paying double for
Bluetooth connectivity and as $200
bluetooth headphones these wouldn't be
my first choice put in design and fit
aside the cloud makes off for very
little passive noise isolation when used
out in public and when you start looking
at headphones in the $200 range you
start seeing headphones that bring other
features like an ambient mode tile
integration a 25 to 30 hour plus battery
life with fast charging a built in app
so you can customize you EQ settings and
most importantly active noise
cancellation personally I really think
you're better off having your dedicated
gaming headset like the HyperX cloud
alpha and picking up a dedicated pair of
bluetooth headphones like the Sony watch
709 if you manage to get them on sale
you have two pairs of headphones for
just a little more of what the HyperX
cloud mix sells for and that's if you
want active noise cancellation because
if not you can pick up a pair of non ANC
headphones and cloud alphas for the same
if not less than what the cloud mix goes

enjoyed the video so hit that like
