it beau it's to see 35 2 versus the Sony
1000x em - these two are perhaps the
most popular options right now when it
comes to noise cancelling headphones and
both of these headphones have their own
strong and weak points but more
importantly which is right for you we're
about to find out don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and you can watch
these headphones and individual reviews
here after you're done watching this
video
both of these headphones retail for 350
dollars and both of these headphones
come in two colorways the both Q's - 35
- come in black in silver and the sony
1000m - come in black and gold and they
both come included with a hard shell
carrying case a micro USB cable for
charging and an audio cable the sony
1000 accent to come included with an
airplane adapter while both decided to
leave out their plane adapter for the
boss QC 35 - if you want to pick either
of these headphones up I'll have links
in description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deal
possible
both of these headphones are relatively
identical on the outside so the
predecessors the Sony and the are 1000 X
in the original both QC 35 and just like
before the Bullock's QC 35 to have far
superior build quality over the Sony
1000 XM to the panels on the bose qc25 2
or made out of glass filled nylon which
are more durable and lighter than the
plastic ones on the 1000 XM - the
plastic panels on my one thousand accent
- haven't had the cracking issue that
was fairly common on the 1000x but it's
still too early to tell if the cracking
issue is gone the plastic panels on the
1000 x m2 or snapped into place while
the panels on the bose qc25 2 or screw
it in so if you flex the headband on the
bose qc25 - there's really no squeaking
or cracking and a panel stay in place
better whereas if you flex the headband
on the 1000 XM - too much you risk the
panel snapping at a place both the
headphones are using synthetic leather
on the ear cups in headband and they
both have plush padding but the padding
on the bose qc25 - is just a little
softer and it stays cooler for a little
longer than the 1000 XM - the ear cups
on the Bose TC 35 - are also larger than
the
thousand xn2 so they in case you're a
whole ear while the ear comes on the
1000 XM to might rest on your earlobes
if you've got bigger ears what this
means is the both PC thirty-five to have
far superior build quality and slightly
better comfort over the Sony 1000 XM -
well like I said before the Sony 1000 XM
to forego build quality in favour of
features first off the 1000 X temps you
have a better battery life than the bose
qc25 to the sony 1000 XM - should will
ask you a little over 30 hours with
noise cancellation turned on while the
bose qc25 to have a battery life of 20
hours with noise cancellation turned on
and they both have quick charging if you
plug in the 1000 XM 2 for 10 minutes you
should get around 70 minutes of playback
time but if you plug in the bose qc25 2
for 15 minutes you should get about 2
and a half hours of playback time
controlling sound quality I prefer the
1000 X and 2 over the bose qc25 to the
highs on the sony don't crash like they
do on the Bose and there's much less
distortion at higher volumes on the Sony
although the both PC 35 to have a little
more death the bass just leaves you
hanging whereas the 1000 X n to have
clean bass and you can adjust the EQ
through Sony's headphones app and you
can't do that on the Bo is unless you've
done a lot of third-party app if you're
debating between these two headphones
chances are you're mainly interested in
the active noise cancellation and I've
got to say Sony has really improved
their active noise cancellation
technology when you activate the anc on
the sony 1000 XM 2 you feel no cabin
pressure on your eardrum and it won't
cause any headaches and the 1000 xm2 are
also really good at rejecting wind noise
whereas if the microphones on the bose
qc25 to get hit by a little breeze
you're gonna get some white noise and
i've been very vocal about this in the
past but the anc on the bose qc25 to
have a lot of cabin pressure and cause
headaches and it's not just me I've
passed the both QC 35 to around to a few
people and they all said they heard if
ANC is on on the bose qc25 - and you're
not playing music you're going to hear
accosting hissing sound whereas with the
1000x and - there isn't but you're still
blocking out the sound and
it comes to overall performance the
1000x sent to you is better at blocking
out more sound than the bose qc25 - and
the 1000x and to also give you more
control over your active noise
cancellation settings thanks to their
ambient sound feature if you want to
block out everything you can just have
your standard noise cancellation turned
on but if you set ambient sound to load
the 1000x n2 will pump in some outside
sound so you can be aware of what's
going on around you if you're walking in
the city they can also specifically only
let in people's voices and if you want
more ambient sound in you can just raise
the ambient sound setting and they can
even adjust your ambient sound setting
automatically depending on what you're
doing with the bullets can see 35 - you
only have three options to choose from
concerning your active noise
cancellation you can either choose from
high low or off but the coolest feature
the Sony 1000 accents you have that the
Bose does it is quick attention if
someone is talking to you while you have
your headphones on and you're playing
music you don't have to take your
headphones off all you have to do is
come to the touchpad on the right ear
cup and the headphones will
automatically lower the volume of
whatever you listen to and pump in all
the outside sound so you can talk to
somebody like this and you don't have to
take the headphones off whereas with the
Bose if someone tries to talk to you you
have to take your headphones off and
this isn't as sleek as a Sony the only
addition to the new boss QC 35 - is the
action button on the left ear cup and
you can either have this button do one
of two things either you can activate
google assistant or toggle through your
active noise cancellation settings like
I said on my initial review you can use
Google assistant with an iPhone but it's
not as useful as it would be if you used
it on an Android device if you tap the
action button once Google assistant will
tell you the time and any notifications
you might have but if you press and hold
the action button you can talk to Google
assistant
what's Tesla stock price Tesla is
trading at 350 dollars and 67 cents a
share after hours down 0.12 percent from
closing it's 4:42 p.m. you don't have
any recent updates and having the action
button on the boss you see 35 to is you
fool if your power user of Google
assistant it really strings on the
process of talking to your assistant and
with the bus QC 35 - you can use the
action button on the left to activate
Google assistant and you can use the
multi-purpose button on the right to
activate Siri if you're using an iPhone
so you get two assistants at your beck
and call and I like this because
sometimes Google is better at more
complicated questions than Siri what's
the weather like in New York City it's
currently clear and 87 degrees in New
York New York temperatures are heading
down from 87 this afternoon to 75
tonight what's the weather like in New
York City currently in New York City its
87 and sunny today it'll be clearer with
the forecasted high of 88 in a low of 72
who was the president eight years ago
George W Bush and Barack Obama were both
President of the United States in 2009
who all was president
eight years ago let's see what we can't
find
here's what I found on the web for who
was president eight years ago have a
look and here are a few minor things
that take into consideration the bose
qc25 - can connect to two devices at the
same time so switching from your phone
to your laptop like I always do
it's super easy whereas the Sony 1000 XM
2 can only be connected to one device at
a time so you can't just hot-swap and
like I said in my initial review premium
headphones like the 1000 XM 2 should be
able to connect to multiple devices at
the same time but the Sony 1000 XM 2
have been updated with a PTX HD audio so
the wireless audio quality is better
than the bose qc25 2 when streaming off
of the same device and I'm not just
saying that cuz it's not a spec sheet
you can really tell the difference so if
you're trying to decide between the bose
qc25 2 and the sony 1000x and to get the
Bose if build quality and comfort or
your top
even though the new action button is
nice is not a must-have feature because
you can still just activate Google
assistant straight from your phone but
for everything else I would pick the
Sony 1000 xm2 they sound better they
have more features they have a better
battery life and the Sony headphones
that gives you so much more control over
them not to mention the noise
cancellation on the 1000 xn2
is better than the boast you see 35 -
there's no hissing and there's no cabin
pressure but they still manage to block
out more sound remember this isn't a
full review of either of these
headphones I'm just trying to point out
the most important differences between
them so I can help you with your
purchase decision if you want to learn
