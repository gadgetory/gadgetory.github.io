most used piece of technology these days
I use them when I watch the videos at
home I use them when I'm out in public
so I can listen to podcasts and a lot of
the times when I'm out in public I leave
them in just so I can quickly tab until
they were to place a call for me and
from the looks of it a lot of people use
their ear pods a lot as well I mean
honestly I don't remember the last time
I use white ear pods on my iPhone but
after you have of heavy usage I've
noticed my ear pod to no longer hold the
charge as well as they used to him when
brand new air pods are supposed to last
five hours straight before needing to be
placed back into their carrying case to
charge and the case can charge them up
for a total of four times so added all
of the ear pods and case should last for
a total of 24 hours of listening time
and the our pods also have quick
charging so if you drop them into their
case for 15 minutes it'll get you three
hours of playback time very rarely have
I ever even been caught with dead ear
pods and I've tested a lot of wireless
earbuds and without a doubt the air pods
are the best and easiest to use casual
wireless earbuds that consistently
perform great but these days biopods
don't last nearly as much as they used
to if I use my ear pods for more than
two hours straight
then those story giving me easy
notification that their batteries are
low you know that little sound and
usually the left our pod dies before the
right but the carrying case itself still
manages to hold our charge as you used
to and probably because it's not
constantly under as much stress as they
are positive selves and what I mean by
this is that each air pod is able to
work independently from one another and
each one houses their own battery within
the stem this small battery is
constantly being drained and recharged
drained and recharged and drained and
recharged and we still know by now that
batteries were out the more you use them
batteries are like sponges when you have
a new sponge it will absorb a good
amount of water but as the sponge ages
and the more you use the sponge the
sponge won't be able to absorb nearly as
much water until eventually it's useless
now I'm not saying that a two hour
battery life on the air pods is useless
but I do expect that battery life to
continually decrease the more
I use my air pod here on out now I'm not
saying don't buy ear pods ear pods are
great I'm making this video so I can
give you an idea of how long your 160
dollar ear pods will probably last I
mean since you can't change the
batteries in these air pods after a year
and a half or two you're gonna have to
replace them I mean when I used to use
wired ear pods I would have to get a new
pair every four months or so because
either they would wear out or get lost
so if we do the math over the course of
two years I would have probably bought
six pairs of Europe odds at $30 each
costing a total of a hundred and eighty
dollars so the air pods already
definitely is still worth the money
given that they were good for about two
years and as long as you don't lose them
but even if you argued that it would be
cheaper to get a pair of higher-quality
earbuds that last way longer than
cheaply made ear pods ear pods give you
the sense of freedom no pair of white
earbuds can ever give you so like I said
I love my ear pods and I feel a lot of
other people do too and even though they
had a rocky start like being delayed at
first and a good amount of bugs at
launch they proved Apple is still
innovating and then one can make ear
pods better is if Siri wasn't so dumb
and unfortunately Apple didn't show off
any real improvements to Syria at WWDC
this year if you have a guy on air pods
you got to do yourself the favor and get
a pair even though apples next iPhone
event is right around the corner I don't
expect any huge overhauls to the air
pods just yet the only major changes to
the air buds I see at Apple's next
iPhone events or air pods with a case
that support wireless charging so they
can work with the air power mat that
Apple still claims is coming in 2018 if
you made it this far I guess you enjoyed
the video so hit that like button and
get subscribed it helps out more than
you realize support the channel by
