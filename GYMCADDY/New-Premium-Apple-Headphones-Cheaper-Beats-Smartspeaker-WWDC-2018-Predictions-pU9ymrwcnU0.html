I've bought a lot of tech products over
the years but there is one tech product
I wholeheartedly regret buying and
that's the beats Pro now I bought these
way before Apple bought beats by dre
back in 2014 so technically these are
monster headphones but I bought these at
a time where a beats were all the rage
and I thought if I'm gonna get beats
headphones I'm gonna get the best beats
headphones and unfortunately I didn't
know any better but after Apple bought
beats by dre we've seen a new products
come out like the beats solo 3 beats
studio 3 2 power beats 3 and the beats X
but the beats Pro which are still on
sale today for $400 have remained
relatively untouched personally I
wouldn't pay 400 dollars today for the
beats Pro and like I've said in past
videos
I wouldn't paid $350 for the Beats
Studio 3 if you could get them on sale
for like $250 brand new over Amazon then
yeah ok I would consider them but there
have been rumors going around that Apple
is going to be releasing a pair of
premium headphones priced above the
studio 3 now I don't know if Apple will
release these premium headphones as an
Apple product or under their beats
umbrella but I do think Apple is
starting to phase out their beats Pro so
that they can replace them with these
higher and premium headphones first off
a newbie spider a decade collection has
been leaked a few days before WWDC 2018
all featuring the Beats Studio 3 beats
solo 3 power beats 3 and beats X all in
OG red in black Holloway's but the beats
pro isn't a part of this collection also
a lot of online retailers no longer have
the beats pro in stock you can really
want to get the beats pro from Apple now
now could Apple release these premium
headphones at WWDC 2018 I think it's
highly unlikely but it could happen
I mean Apple gave us a sneak peek at the
air pad last year and that thing still
isn't on sale but rumors going around is
that these high-end apple headphones
will feature better build quality better
sound quality and better active
his cancellation than the studio threes
so that they can actually compete
against a bose qc25 series - or my
personal favorites - so many 1000x em -
they're also supposed to be as easy to
use as the air pods and they're also
supposed to make it easier for you to
interact with Siri but they're also
supposed to cost way more so maybe we're
looking at all 450 at all the price tag
or maybe even a $500 price tag but
comment down below what do you want to
see from these premium and Apple
headphones and how much are you willing
to pay personally I think Apple should
bring the price down at the studio 3 is
down to three hundred or two hundred
fifty dollars and if they want to charge
four hundred dollars for these premium
headphones then I think it makes sense
rumors are also going around that Syria
is supposed to be a big deal on these
new headphones but what I want to see at
WWDC this year is just some real
improvements to Siri Siri is just way
behind
ele XA and the big G's assistant besides
delays and pricing one of the reasons
why the whole pod hasn't done too well
is just serial one of the reasons why I
haven't even reviewed the home pod is
just because I've just been waiting for
it to get some updates because
unfortunately we live in a world where
products are being rushed out the door
and then fixed over-the-air which is
both good and bad depending on certain
products there's no denying the home
path sounds amazing but it's $350 price
tag is off-putting especially since Siri
isn't so smart so that brings us to our
next rumour and that's a beats brand the
smart speaker at a lower price since
Apple hasn't really updated their beats
portable speaker lineup it kind of makes
sense for them to announce something
like this since Apple definitely needs
to catch up in the smart speaker game
which is definitely heating up I
wouldn't be surprised if we saw Apple
announce a beach Brian smart speaker at
WWDC mm 18 cents WWDC is supposed to
mostly focus on software and computers I
wouldn't be surprised if Apple showed
off a new and improved Siri for the
majority of the events and then they'll
go hey sincere is so amazing you should
definitely go get that home pod and by
the way here's a cheaper smarter speaker
which will
your whole pod so you can use Siri at
home even more because remember she's
been amazing and then they'll probably
say their headphone announcement for
their iPhone event later this year
because I highly doubt they're going to
outright replace their studio 3 so
quickly because those were released just
last year so WWDC 2018 is almost here
and we're obviously gonna see a lot on
the software side like iOS 12 watch West
5 refresh netbooks are supposed to make
an appearance and will might even get a
sneak peek at the new Mac Pro these
rumored headphones and beats more
speaker is highly speculative but it'd
be awesome if we saw them come June 4th
but Apple does like to announce random
products at the end of WWDC so you never
know
