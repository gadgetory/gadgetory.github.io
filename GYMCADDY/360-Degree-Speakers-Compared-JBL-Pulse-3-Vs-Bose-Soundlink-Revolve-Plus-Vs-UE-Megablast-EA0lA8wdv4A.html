take price into consideration but not
today today I want to compare the three
most popular of 360-degree speakers
right now we have one of my most
favorite products the JBL poll story the
elegant bose soundlink revolve plus and
the somewhat improved you would be
megablast all three of these speakers
don't just look very different they all
have very different approaches to how
they actually produce their 360-degree
sound the JBL pulse 3 is the cheapest
speaker here and retails for $200 but
it's usually on sale for about $170
these days the UE mega blast retails for
250 dollars but you can usually get the
black version for about one hundred and
ninety dollars and finally there's the
Bose Soundlink for vols Plus which is
the most expensive speaker here
retailing for $299 and almost never goes
on sale if you want to pick either of
these speakers up I'll have a link to
description below and if you use the
links really helps out to channel and
also check out the numerous shelf down
below even though all three of these
speakers or portable speakers one is
tougher than the others the bose revolve
plus is the most fragile speaker here
due to its easy to scratch aluminum body
and it only has an IP x4 certification
but it is the most refined looking
speaker here the JBL pulls three carries
in ipx7 certification which means it's
waterproof for the most part but do
twist acrylic top you also run the risk
of scratching or cracking it if you
travel on a regular basis with the
speaker if you need a tough speaker then
the mega glass is your guy
it has an ip67 certification so it's
both dust and water proof and thanks to
its fabric and rubber body this speaker
can definitely take a beating when it
comes to ports both are evolved plus and
post three heavy easy to reach micro USB
ports and audio jacks for wired
listening the mega blast also charges
via on my curiously port but it doesn't
have an audio jack not having an audio
jack on the mega blast doesn't bother me
these days but what does is just how
hard it is to reach its microUSB port
since this port is so indented it limits
the amount of USB cables you can use to
charge the speaker
point of having a universal standard
like a microUSB port so you can mix and
match cables and if you need a
replacement you can easily just buy one
both the megablast you can really only
just charge the speaker with its
included cable so if you lose or damage
this cable it could be a headache in the
future I just feel this is a sneaky way
of UE trying to get you to buy their
$40.00 power up charging cradle and I
also hate the fact that you have to
stand a megablast upside down
when you're gonna charge it I just feel
that this is sloppy design but youi also
decided to omit physical control buttons
in favor of Amazon's ele XA voice
control on the mega blasts which also
bothers me you can use the mega blasts
as a souped up echo and admittedly it
works pretty well you might have to
enunciate sometimes but it gets the job
done a lot of what is the current price
of Bitcoin one Bitcoin is worth seven
thousand five hundred thirty dollars one
point three percent over the last twenty
four hours but you can only use voice
commands to player positive music or
it's a skipper track if the mega blast
is connected to Wi-Fi and if you're
streaming music from Amazon music
Pandora Spotify and a few other
streaming services but if you plan on
streaming music over Bluetooth either
because you're using Apple music or
google play music like I do then the
only way you can control your music
playback is from your phone the only
physical button is the mega blast has
are the comically large plus and minus
buttons on its front for von controls of
power button that likes when access is
talking and a Bluetooth button up top
the revolving poster II don't have smart
speaker capabilities like the mega
blasts but they do have a full set of
control buttons and I feel this is
important to have on all speakers
because sometimes it's just easier to
push a button than to use voice commands
or if you're with friends someone can
stop with skip a track without having to
tell you to use your phone now let's
talk about speaker setups because like I
said earlier they're all very different
so JBL pulls 3 has 340 millimeter
transducers are all located underneath
the fabric portion of the speaker and
there's dual passive radiators on the
top and on the bottom of the speaker
it's kind of a JBL trademark the bose
soundlink revolve plus has a single
downward firing transducer
that gets evenly spread out by an
acoustic deflector and in the neck
portion of the speaker there are dual
passive radiators as well and finally
the UE mega blast has the most Hardware
out of all of these speakers the mega
blast has dual 55 millimeter transducers
and dual passive radiators which are
pretty common for a speaker of this size
but the mega blast also has dual 25
millimeter tweeters which do help out in
the highs now before we go into the
sound touch just note the black glass is
set to it's the standard EQ settings
if I had to line these speakers up from
best towards regarding sound quality it
would go megablast revolve Plus and
pulse three and last the JBL post three
has a new sound signature and has a good
amount of bass but it doesn't sound as
clear or as full as the other two
speakers and it also gets the least loud
as here on next volume the buzzer
evolved plus has a sound signature that
puts an emphasis on vocalist and there's
also a lot of trouble although it has a
good amount of bass torval plus does
suffer a little when it comes to
instrument separation and at higher
volumes there is a considerable amount
of distortion and then there's the mega
blast when I first reviewed it a few
months ago my biggest problem with the
mega blast was that it had way too much
bass and absolutely no mids but now Yui
has changed that and I actually really
like how the mcbounds now instrument
separation is really good and when the
speaker is set to max volume distortion
isn't a problem and through you ease app
you can now adjust the mega bass EQ
settings you can either use or another
pre-made ones or you can make your own
so you can make the speaker sound
however you like through the app you can
also see other things like your battery
status network status and more
importantly you can meet the speaker
makes both of ZAP these are also pretty
useful my favorite thing about it is
that you can remotely turn on your Bose
speaker and something these other
speakers can't do and you can also pair
up another Bose speaker straight from
the app as well but if you get to post
three chances are you're going to be
using this app the most from the JBL
connect app you can adjust the
brightness of the light feature you can
select from a few different lighting
modes and you can also adjust the color
to your liking even though the post
three isn't the best sounding speaker
here it's definitely the coolest looking
to speak you hear that easily lightens
up a room and you're playing music with
it but due to the post freeze light
feature it's battery life is always
changing
even though JBL advertises a 12 hour
battery life on the pulse 3 depending on
what light mode you're using and what
brightness it's at your battery life can
vary from 3 hours to playback time or
sometimes more than the advertised 12
hours of playback time if the light
features turned off battery legs on the
revolve plus and Meg blast or allure
mark
with the volume set at 80% both the
revolve plus and megablast she'll ask
you about nine hours to playback time
now even though the megablast is the
most durable speaker here sounds pretty
good and it has a pretty good battery
life just know that you can't pair it up
to any other UE speakers which is
another major feature this speaker is
missing whereas the Bose Soundlink
revolve plus you can pair it up to one
other Bose speaker and then there's the
pull three which is rocking JBL connect
plus not only can you power up to 100
JBL speakers together but honestly
nobody really needs more importantly it
is by far the easiest and best way to
pair multiple speakers together you
literally just press one button on each
speaker and this because will figure out
themselves so which is the best
360-degree speaker here objectively I
have to give it to the UE mega blast
it's extremely durable it has a really
good battery life it gets the loudest
and it sounds best here at a very
reasonable price if you can get it on
sale but there are so many quirks with
the mega blast that you need to know
what you're getting into before you get
the speaker like I mentioned earlier I
hate that the speaker doesn't have a
full set of physical control buttons
Alexa is cool but not always the most
convenient I hate how the micro USB port
is so hard to reach for no reason and
not being able to pair this speaker up
to another speaker sucks if you've
already invested into the UE eco system
I feel the JBL post three is still the
safest bet and if you like the finer
things in life
then the bose sound like revolve plus
will get the job done too if you made it
this far I guess you enjoyed the video
