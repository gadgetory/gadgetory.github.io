mega blasts are two steps forward and
one step back for Yui on one hand I
think it's awesome companies are
starting to incorporate voice assistance
into their products but on the other
hand these speakers are missing very
basic functions that even the
predecessors boom and mega boom have and
as a result these speakers are for a
very specific type of consumer so are
the blast and mega blast right for you
let's find out don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and you go watch
some of my other videos here after
they're done what's in this video well
that these speakers are very similar to
one another and the main differences
between them are size battery life in
price the smaller Yui blast currently
retails for $230 and the larger Yui mega
blast currently retails for $300 and
they both come in the same colorway
options blue red black or white and they
both come included with their own wall
adapter and micro USB cable for charging
if you want to pick either of these
speakers up I'll have a little
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deal
possible first up let's go over build
quality and design
there's no denying both of these
speakers are very well built and are
super rugged their designs were very
similar to JBL speakers they both have
fabric and softest rubber bodies that
can take a beating they both have very
prominent volume up and volume down
buttons on the front a power button and
Bluetooth line on the top i'll deering
on the bottom there you can also remove
and there's a rubber cover that keeps
the microUSB port safe from water and
dust but the blast and mega blast both
have gotten rid of their aux jacks which
could be a deal-breaker for some people
both speakers are also ip67 rated which
means they're both water and dust proof
but unfortunately they do not float and
that's partly because they're pretty
freakin dense compared to other speakers
the UE blast weighs in at 652 grams and
the UE mega blast weighs in at 1,100 91
grams one of the biggest features of
both of these speakers is Alexa
integration after you've connected
either of these speakers to your home
Wi-Fi and sign in to your Amazon account
from the Ultimate Ears app you'll be
able to tell Alexa to control your smart
home gave Alexa commands ask her
questions and you'll also be able to
control your music playback all by just
speaking Alexa what's the weather like
in New York City today you can look for
mostly sunny weather with a high of 38
degrees and a low of 24 degrees
basically either these UE speakers will
behave like
Amazon echo dot or standard echo but not
an Amazon echo Plus which has a built in
hubs for your smart gadgets can talk to
one another and the microphone array on
these speakers is pretty good Alexa has
no problem hearing me when I'm far away
or even in the next room which is a
little creepy honestly Alexa can you
hear me yes I can hear you yes I can
hear you but unlike the Amazon echo show
I test out a few months ago which could
still hear me even when I called for
Alexa when I was playing music at full
volume the UE speakers will only hear
the Alexa hog word when music is playing
at a moderately low volume yes I can't
hear you so this could be a problem if
you're playing music and max volume and
you want to skip to the next track or
positive music you can't tell Alexa to
do it because she can't hear you so you
have to use your phone instead and it's
also very important to keep in mind that
these Alexa voice controls for your
music playback will only work if you're
streaming from Amazon music I Heart
Radio or tuned in but you he says
there's more services to follow but if
you're playing music directly from your
phone or another source or streaming
service personally I prefer Google Play
then the Alexa voice controls will not
work and oddly enough these speakers
don't have a multi-purpose button to
control your music playback or active in
a different voice assistant you can't
manually play pause or skip a track with
the older mega boom if you tap or double
tap the top you could control your music
playback but that's not the case with
these speakers they want you to do is
strictly with voice controls but if the
speaker's themselves aren't connected to
Wi-Fi and the voice controls won't work
period and not having a way to manually
control you music playback directly from
the speaker is a bigger deal than you
might think personally I like to listen
to music while I'm in the shower so
voice controls don't really work and
skipping or going back a track by
pressing a touchscreen with wet hands
doesn't always work flawlessly if there
was a third button I could easily just
skip a track by double pressing like I
did with my flip for if you have a few
Fred
and you're playing music your friend
can't simply just pick up the speaker
and pause or skip the track themselves
if you're using an unsupported streaming
service or if the speaker isn't
connected to Wi-Fi they would have to
tell you to do it directly from your
phone
I just feel alternate ears a third party
manufacturer is severely limiting
themselves by relying so much on Amazon
Alexa and as a result you the customer
aren't getting the best product if
you're not using the right streaming
service or voice assistant under the
ideal circumstances because again in
order for the blasts or mega blast to
work to the fullest extent they need to
be connected to Wi-Fi and you have to
use one of the supported streaming
services but let's say all of the
previously mentioned stuff isn't a deal
breaker for you you probably want to
know about their other tech specs and so
on first off Bluetooth range on these
speakers is pretty freakin impressive I
was able to get about a range of 120
feet with direct line-of-sight before
the Bluetooth started to starter out but
unfortunately these speakers cannot be
connected to two devices at the same
time so you can't ha swap so this means
if you're playing music off of your
phone and you want to switch to your
iPad you need to go into your Bluetooth
settings and manually connect from the
device you want to use and the speaker
will disconnect from the previous device
it's not the most streamlined but it's
okay because the speaker's can save up
to eight different devices regarding
battery life I feel it's okay even with
Alexa turned off I found myself charging
these speakers more frequently than
other speakers I've tested UE advertises
the battery life of 16 hours on the mega
blast and I'd typically average about 10
hours of playback time with the volume
set to moderately high and UE advertised
as a battery life of 12 hours on the
blast and I typically average about 8
hours of playback time these speakers
are also 360-degree speakers and
Ultimate Ears did not lie when they said
they have thundering bass I'm assuming
they have similar but improved speaker
setups from the lesson counterparts dual
drivers and dual passive radiators and
for the most part the blast and mega
blast performed the same
both the speakers have a lot of base but
I feel the mids are a little weak the
soundstage is pretty narrow and the
highest end to crash rather frequently a
max volume the blast likes to hover in
the mid to high 70s decibel range
whereas a max volume the mega blast
likes to hover in the mid-eighties
decibel range what this really means is
that when the blast is that max volume
is like the mega blast is that 75
percent volume so obviously the mega
blast gets louder and there's more wall
shaking bass in general but overall
sound quality doesn't improve but still
since these are bass heavy speakers I
think they're best suited for rap hip
hop or EDM but not so much everything
else because the mids are just so
freakin weak essentially if you decided
to go with the mega blast or with the
blast you're getting more bass in
general and a speaker that gets louder
but another feature that's missing on
both of these speakers which should be
pretty standard is being able to chain
them together as right now the UE blast
and mega blast can't be paired together
she can't play music simultaneously with
them I tried to pair them together
through the app and I was even on the
phone with tech support for over two
hours trying to figure this out
Yui also doesn't make any mention of
being able to connect these speakers
together in their marketing material so
if you already have a boom 2 or mega
boom and you were planning on chaining
the blast or mega blast to them as of
right now you can't but Josh from tech
support hi Josh did offhandedly
mentioned that maybe they were still
waiting for an app to be released that
would allow the blast and mega blast to
pair together but this under no
circumstances means there's such app in
the works but still pairing speakers
together is pretty standard and these
speakers should be able to do so from
day one so in conclusion although these
speakers are a great option for bass
lovers I can't really recommend them
first off battery life isn't that good
for speakers of their size but my
biggest problem is their over reliance
of Alexa like I said unless they're
connected to Wi-Fi and you're using a
supported streaming service they won't
work to their fullest capacity and not
having a play/pause button directly on
these speakers is a major annoys that
you shouldn't have to deal with when
you're paying upwards of $200 I think
it's great that manufacturers are
embracing voice assistance but their
products should be able to fully
function as speakers first and voice
assistance to be an add-on that you
choose to use not be forced unless you
are heavily invested in the
Amazon ecosystem I suggest you pass on
these speakers they're better options
out there for much cheaper Alexa what's
the weather like in New York City in New
York there's a freeze warning in effect
Friday November 10th six six pm to
Saturday November 11th 8:00 a.m. the
current weather is 35 degrees we're
partly sunny skies today today's
forecast has mostly sunny weather with a
high of 38 degrees in a low of 24
degrees Alexa can you hear me yes I can
yes I can hear you
