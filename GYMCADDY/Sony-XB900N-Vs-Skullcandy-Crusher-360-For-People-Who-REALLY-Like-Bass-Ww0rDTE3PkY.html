are the best mid-range ANC headphones
out there right now they offer a very
complete package without any major
compromises but technically the XP 900
ends are a part of sony's extra base
headphone lineup meant for bass edge who
really liked bass
hence the experiment name so if you're a
bass ed you're probably wondering if you
should get these or these gold candy
crusher 360s so let's see which one's
right for you now first off the school
candy crush 360s retail for 300 dollars
whereas the Sony xb9 hundred n to retail
for $250 and when it comes to build
quality and included accessories those
$50 really do make a big difference here
but if you want to pick up either of
these headphones they'll be linked down
below and if you want to learn more
about either of these headphones please
watch their full reviews so like I
mentioned earlier that $50 price
difference really does show between
these two headphones when it comes to
build quality and accessories for
starters dxb 900 ends come included with
a carrying pouch whereas the crush of
360 s come included with a hard shell
carrying case now this carrying case is
pretty large but if you plan on
constantly commuting with your
headphones then an included carrying
case is always depreciated but also the
crash of 360s use more premium materials
than the Sony's the ear cups and
headband on the question 360s have a
soft touch feel to them they have metal
yokes and the leather rad on these
headphones doesn't feel half bad
overall these headphones are built like
a tank now the sony is also have these
and build quality but they're just
mostly plastic so if you hold either of
these headphones in your hand you're
gonna automatically think the crusher
360's or more premium well when it comes
to fit the XP 900 ends are more
comfortable to wear them to question
360s for a few different reasons for
starters the crusher 360 spider
materials make them significantly
heavier than the XP 900 and weighing in
and whopping 320 grams whereas the
Sony's weigh in at 250 grams but the
sony's are also more comfortable to wear
than the crusher 360s
because of their slightly reduced
clamping force slightly larger your pads
and their ear cups also have more rain
of motion and the question 360's which
can only pivot and swivel so much now
both of these headphones are big head
approved but personally I do find the XP
900 ends significantly more comfortable
than the crusher 360s but when it comes
to tech specs the crush of 360s do a
really good job of keeping up for
starters the kirsta 360s have an
advertised battery life of twenty nine
hours whereas the sony's are good for 30
hours so both of these headphones have
great battery lights but the coarser
360s do outperform the Sony's when it
comes to fast charger if you plug the
crush to 360s in for 10 minutes from a
dead battery they're gonna get you 3
hours of playback time whereas the sony
is only going to get you one hour of
playback time from that same 10 minute
charge the only major drawback here is
that the crusher 360's are still using a
micro USB port instead of a USB C port
like on Sony's but when it comes to
Bluetooth connectivity both of these
headphones perform pretty much the same
they both can only be connected to one
device at a time so that means if you're
a power user you can't ha swap with
either of them but they also both have
AB deck support now yeah the xB 900 ends
also have LTAC support which is better
than aptX but just keep in mind the xB
900 engine are going to automatically
revert back to SBC on an Android device
if you decide to use a custom EQ aka
crank up the bass whereas the question 3
services are going to use app decks no
matter if you have their base effect
turned on or off but if you're an iPhone
user the XP 900 items are going to use
AAC no matter what EQ you use so really
the only ones being affected here when
it comes to audio codecs are Android
users so how much space exactly do these
headphones have is probably the question
you're currently asking ok so without a
doubt the crusher 3 Sexy's have
significantly more based on the sb900
ends it's not even close but the cross
truth resources basically have a
vibration motor built in
alongside with your standard 40
millimeter drivers the pressure 360's
drivers themselves have a frequency
response between 5 and
twenty-thousand hurt and then the
wrestle base is handled by the separate
crusher driver which is what Skullcandy
likes to call it whereas the xb9 Hodgins
have a frequency response between 2 and
20,000 Hertz so all of the sound
including the bass is handled by the xb9
a genetic drivers themselves now I will
admit the question 360s are a lot of fun
to use especially when you're listening
to rap EDM if you're using them to watch
movies or using them to game with but
these headphones don't get all that loud
and when it comes to their audio
fidelity their instrument separation and
sound stage isn't all that great plainly
said the extra bass feature on the
crusher 3 Sexy's does get old after a
while and if you want to use them as a
normal pair of headphones on the road
then they don't sound or perform all
that great especially for $300
headphones whereas the Sony's audio
fidelity wise they easily outperform the
question 360s and they also get
significantly louder but also through
Sony's app you can make them sound
however you want so if you want you can
have a bass heavy EQ ready for when you
just want to listen to music and then
you can have a more relaxed EQ for when
you just want to listen to a podcast or
watch a movie with your headphones this
added flexibility found on the XP 900
ends prevents them from being very
OneNote like the question 3 60s and I
feel that it gives you more bang for
your buck but a feature that I really
like on the question 360s that I wish
was available on the XP 900 ends is
being able to adjust your bass directly
from the headphones but the question 3
Circe's if you swipe up or down on the
left ear cup you can adjust your bass
whereas with the XP 900 ends if you want
to adjust your based or even just turn
the feature on or off you gotta open up
the app so personally I do wish we could
use the custom button on the Sony's to
toggle between preset EQ settings like I
mentioned earlier the XP 900 ends also
give you more bang for your buck than
the question 360s because they have
overall more features that are actually
useful for starters the XP 900 ends have
active noise cancellation that's
actually worth using now even though the
crusher 360 is more premium materials do
a better job of passively blocking out
noise
xb9 who joins all plastic body once ANC
has turned on the sb900 ends do a much
better job of isolating you from the
outside world
[Laughter]
the Sony XP 900 ends also have an
ambient mode where you can select how
much noisy cellphones pump in so he can
still be over your surroundings if
you're walking around the city or you
can still hear when someone calls your
name when you're watching movies at home
and this is something that the cursor
360 simply just don't act and it is
pretty hard to ignore
since these still are a pair of $300
bluetooth headphones so overall even if
you are a basehead who really really
likes space I still think you're better
off just picking up the Sony xb9 hundred
ends because they truly give you more
bang for your buck all while still
giving you more than enough bass to keep
you happy but I'm not saying stay
completely away from the skull candy
crush for 360s because at the end of the
day they are a lot of fun to use and
they give you a completely different
listening experience than any other pair
of headphones on the market right now
I just wouldn't get them if I plan to
use them as my main daily drivers I feel
the Skullcandy question 360s or like an
exotic sports car like let's say I
McLaren Sena you wouldn't want to use
them all the time and they wouldn't be
your only pair of headphones but when
you do use them you're a hell of a lot
of fun so what I'm saying is is that the
Skullcandy quest for 360s are still
great but I would only consider getting
them now if I already have a pair of
great sounding headphones if you made it
this far I guess you enjoyed the video
so hit that like button and get
subscribed to help someone didn't you
realize if you want to pick another part
except mention in this video those will
be linked in description down below any
girls will support the channel by
checking out the merch store but other
than that I'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
