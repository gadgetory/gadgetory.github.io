it with their headphones they're 1000x
and threes or currently the best ANC
headphones on the market and their watch
are 700 and or a really good pair of
budget-friendly headphones packed with a
lot of features but there are speakers
on the other hand could use some work
namely there are audio clarity could be
better and their software and Wireless
party chain feature could be more stable
so let's see what the new Sony XP 501 G
is all about the new sony xba-1 g is a
google assistant enable smart speaker
that we chose for $300 which is just 50
dollars more than what the sony xba-1
retails for but depending on your needs
one of these speakers is definitely
gonna be better suited for you so if you
wanna pick either these speakers up I'll
have them so description below
and if you use links it really helps out
to channel I highly suggest you check
them out because Sony speakers routinely
go on sale I'll show you Michael xB 501
G shares the same design and build
quality of the larger Sony XP 60 it has
a built in carrying handle a light
feature or hard plastic body and a metal
frame on the front and it's pretty
adorable kids it's rocking an ip65
rating which means a splash of water
shouldn't be a problem
but you shouldn't submerge the speaker
but I like the xB forty-ones fabric body
that can really take a beating the xB
501s G's plastic body can get scratched
pretty easily if you plan on traveling
with it on a regular basis now even
though the XP 501 G is considerably
larger than the XP 41 do towards the
built-in carrying handle rounded design
and since it only weighs 7 pounds taking
them to go with you isn't that bad now
what makes the sony xba-1 g very
different from sony's other extra base
speakers is its google assistant
integration you can use it to control
your smart devices play music or just
ask questions 1 BTC is approximately six
thousand three hundred forty-four United
States dollars you got it turning the
studio light on and the mics on the
speaker have no problem hearing you when
you say hey roll all the way up to 80%
volume but keep in mind in order for
Google assistant to work the XP 501 G
has to be connected
Wi-Fi so that's why I'm very happy Sony
made it very easy to manually toggle
Bluetooth on or off on this speaker and
if you want to you can strictly just use
the smart speaker like a standard
Bluetooth speaker I'm also very happy
Sony decided to include a full set of
menu control buttons up top so you can
manually control your music playback
unlike other manufacturers that omit
certain physical control buttons on
their sports speakers forcing you to use
voice commands even when you don't want
you namely the Google home Macs and the
UE mega blast but something that I you
really don't like about this speaker is
its poor setup the XP 501 G towards is
via a 12-volt DC in port and you can
also charge it using its USB C port and
I think it's awesome Sony is finally
embracing USB C but I think it's less
awesome that the speaker doesn't have an
audio jack and there's no USB output to
charge your own devices personally I
don't mind when smaller speakers don't
have an audio jack but I think larger
speakers like these should still have it
now you can use a USB C port to charge
your own devices but unfortunately this
USB C port doesn't support data transfer
so you can only play music off of this
speaker using a wireless connection and
oddly enough Sony's new speaker doesn't
support l deck or apdex audio codecs
because for comparison next p41
does have l back support it has an audio
jack a USB a out port and you can charge
it using the micro USB port now when it
comes to battery life I've seen better
sony advertises a 16 hour battery life
on the xB a 501 G but that's what the
volume said at 50% extra bass mode
turned off in with the light features
turned off so technically they're not
like but if you pick the speaker up
you're not gonna want to use it like
that so in my testing with the volume
set at 80% extra base mode turned on and
what the live feature turned on the
speaker only managed to average 6 hours
of playback time but given the speaker's
setup and the size of that subwoofer
it's understandable next P 501 G has a
single 4.9 2 inch front more firing
subwoofer and dual 1 and 3/4 and
satellite speakers
whereas the smaller XP 41 has dual 2.2 8
inch front modifying transducers and
dual passive radiators firing at the
front and at the back of the speaker now
we're about to jump into a scientist but
the Sony speakers are in Ex
bass mode and to make things a little
bit more interesting I'm also going to
be including the JBL boombox
never
with me
without a doubt what are the best things
that XP 501 G has going for it is its
clarity the new XP 501 G sounds much
clearer with its extra bass mode turned
on then all of Sony's other recently
released speakers vocalist organist push
back and then one sevens muffled but
thinks that a 5 inch subwoofer this
speaker still has an impressive amount
of bass for a small size the XP 501 G
has as much bass as a JBL boombox even
though it's half its size but due to his
lack of tweeters the mids and highs
aren't as the finest the boombox and its
sound stage isn't as wide as the boombox
but if you're somebody who's just
looking for bass but doesn't have the
room or the budget for the boom box and
the XP 501 G is a good option to
consider
and just like Sony's other speakers the
xB 501 G still connects the sun√≠s Music
Center app from here you can select from
a few pre-made EQ settings or you can
make your own you can also go in and
select from a few different lighting
modes there's rave chill strobe and or
wave mode without the strobe lights
but unfortunately next we 501 G doesn't
connect to Sony's festival app like the
XP 41 so you can't directly adjust the
colors of the light feature but another
thing I don't like about this new
speaker is that you can't pair it up to
any of Sony's other extra bass speakers
through a wireless party chain like I've
said in the past Sony's parry method for
their speakers is very finicky but I was
under the impression that I would be
able to pair the xB 501 G with other
Sony speakers but you can you can only
pair this speaker up with other smart
speakers using chromecast which i think
is technically cheating and it's not
going to work if you don't have Wi-Fi so
overall I feel that sony xba-1 G is a
bit of a mixed bag it sounds much better
than Sony's previous speakers and packs
an impressive amount of bass in a very
small package but due to that subwoofer
it's a real-world battery life doesn't
make it the best portable speaker to
take with you on the go but thanks to
its Google assistant integration the XP
501 G is a pretty good at-home speaker
they can take with you outside to the
backyard and entertain guests with and
if you're looking for a speaker to use
mostly at home then I think you're much
better off going with the xB 501 G than
the xB 41 but if you're looking for a
more rugged speaker that you can take
with you to the basketball court or
skate park then you're still better off
going with the xB 41 because if it's
tougher body smaller design and
longer-lasting world world battery life
