speaker some popular options are the
Sonia xp3 JBL pulse 3 and the JBL charge
3 they all hover at around the same
price point and have very similar audio
capabilities but they all have very
different designs and feature sets so
which is right for you we're about to
find out don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe and you can watch these
speakers individual reviews here after
you're done watching this video and
there will be a sound person between
these speakers at the end of this video
as well first let's start with the Sony
xp3 it usually retails for one $49.99
and most retailers but it's actually on
sale now and can be had for 118 over at
Amazon making this speaker the best
bargain in this group for now the JBL
charge 3 is the oldest speaker in this
group and usually retails for one $49.99
and most stores but I've managed to find
it for as low as 121 over in Amazon just
as long as you're okay with the
turquoise colorway and then there's the
JBL pulse 3 it's the newest of these
speakers and it retails for 1 $99.99
almost everywhere if you want to pick
either of these speakers up I'll have
links and description below and I'll
keep them updated so you can get the
best deal possible ok I'm gonna do a
quick rundown of these speakers design
and build quality the sony xba-4 upper
outer shell there's a metal painted grow
on the front there's a built-in light
feature that flashes to the beat view
music it can be laid down flat or stand
on its side control buttons and the NFC
touch point can be found on the top and
on the back of the device you will find
a 3.5 millimeter audio jack a 5 volt DC
charging port in the USB I don't so you
can charge your own devices the JBL
charge 3 is almost the same size as the
xB 30 but the majority of its body is
covered in a tight nylon fabric weave
there are LED battery indicator lights
on the front of the device the control
blinds are also found on the top of the
device except there's no NFC chip and
the blinds are very textured and on the
back of the charge 3 you'll find a
microUSB port for charging a 3.5
millimeter audio jack in the USB else
you can charge your own devices just
like on the XP 30 and finally there's
the pulse 3 it's the largest of the
group in the most fragile the majority
of the body which houses the light
feature is made of acrylic and although
it is tough you do run the risk of
scratching it
the lower portion of the polls 3 which
houses the three transducers is covered
in the same nylon fabric as a charge 3
and the control buttons and LED
indicator lights of the post 3 can be
found on the back as well with an extra
button to cycle through the light
features and you will also find a
microUSB port for charging and a 3.5
millimeter audio jack but unlike the
charge 3 or the XP 30 there is no USB
out so you can't charge your own devices
and overall all three speakers wait
about two pounds or one kilo and neither
one of these speakers are afraid of a
little water the sony xba-1 but it can't
be submerged under water in the jb
upholstery and the charge 3 or both ipx7
certified which means they can also get
wet and they can get submerged
underwater without any issues now let's
talk about speaker setup the sony XPS
dual 1.8 9 inch or 48 millimeter
diameter full range speakers in a
passive radiator in the center the JBL
charge 3 also has dual speakers but they
have a diameter of 50 millimeters or 1.9
7 inches and dual passive radiators on
each side with the diameter of 48
millimeters or 1.8 9 inches well unlike
the sony xba-40 or the JBL charge 3
which only shoot sound out through the
front this JBL post 3 is a 360-degree
speaker it houses its 340 millimeter
diameter or 1.5 7-inch transducers in
the bottom portion of the speaker that's
covered by the fabric at the zero 120
and 240 degree marks relative to the JBL
logo on the front and it also has dual
passive radiators on each side which are
slightly smaller coming in with the
diameter of 44 millimeters or 1.73
inches but at the end of the day all
three of these speakers managed to
achieve relatively the same decibel
levels and max volume which is in the
mid 70s
but even though all three of these
speakers do get just as loud they do
sound and perform differently when
played at the same loudness the most
noticeable difference between these
three speakers are the vocals in this
group the charge tree has the vocals
pushed way back whereas the post three
is the most worn in the group but then
you've got the sony XP 30 which places
the vocals right between the post three
in the charts 3 which I prefer and I
know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for
but I think the charts three is the
worst sounding speaker in this group
it's starting to show its age the bass
doesn't deliver and there's a lot of
amplification going on in the mids and
highs which does cause raspiness and
when set at full volume
the charge to Reese suffers from the
worst amount of distortion in this group
whereas the Sony Xperia suffers from the
least amount of distortion when set at
full volume in the mids and highs don't
crash
I think the sony xba-40 is the best
sounding speaker in this group and the
poultry is the safest is good for
personal listening the sound is neutral
but there's enough bass to keep you
satisfied but battery life is also
important to take into consideration the
Sony XP as the longest advertised
battery life coming in at 24 hours but
that's what the light feature turned off
and at relatively low volumes weald
world used with the light features
turned on and the volume set at 50%
we're looking at around 18 hours of use
then does the charge 3 with an
advertised battery life of 20 hours and
since it doesn't have a light feature to
power
I recently get more than 20 hours of
playback time and then there's the pulse
tree with an advertised battery life of
12 hours with the music set loud and the
brightness of the light feature turn all
the way up you'll be lucky if you get 8
hours out of it but with the volume set
at 50% in the brightness set at 25% I've
managed to get around 13 hours of
playback time and with the light feature
turned off you can squeeze out 15 hours
of playback when it comes to battery
life the JBL charge 3 is the winner here
for one big reason my biggest pet peeve
with the Sony's extra bass portable
speakers is that when the speaker gets
to 20 percent volume they will abruptly
stop the music say please charge and you
will have no other option than to put
the speaker back on the charger because
they won't go past 30 percent volume I
absolutely hate this feature but if what
you're most concerned about is the light
feature then hands down the JBL pulse 3
is the best choice obviously there's no
light feature on the charge 3 but the
poetry has the best light feature on the
market right now through JBL's connect
that it's super easy to control
you've got equalizer rave rainbow and
fire just in a few and you can even make
your own and you can change the color of
each light feature just as easy with the
color wheel or color matching with your
phone's camera
the main selling point off the post
three are the lights the light feature
on the sony xba-4 you don't have as many
customization options and cycling
through the light modes isn't as easy
unlike the post 3 that has a dedicated
button directly on the speaker to cycle
through the light settings you can only
turn the light setting on the XP 30 on
or off by pressing and holding the extra
base button and if you want to cycle
through the light mode you have to do
that through Sony's music center app
which likes to act up from time to time
on my iPhone but under sony xba-4 rave
chill strobe or Raven without the strobe
lights on the side and there's a few
calm options as well but like I said the
life feature on the xB 30 or the xB 40
is nowhere near as impressive as the one
at the pulse 3 and there's one more
thing I want to touch on before wrapping
this video up which is apparently
speakers together with the sony xba-4
dubose loading speakers together like
the xB 20 or the xB 40 and if you have
two of the same model speakers you can
have them play left and right stereo
audio in order to pair them you have to
press and hold the ad + + button
together for a few seconds until the
speaker's beep with JBL speakers you
literally just press one button on each
speaker and you're done it's much easier
but the torch 3 is using JBL connect so
you can only pair to other speakers that
are also using JBL connect like the JBL
extreme JBL pulls - or another charge 3
the JBL poster 3 is using the newer JBL
connect plus so you can pair the post 3
to another post 3 or a flip for or the
upcoming JBL boom box
look out for my JBL boom box review in
the future but you cannot pair the pulse
3 two speakers that are using the JBL
connect protocol like the charge 3 or
the pulse 2 or the JBL extreme ok so
this video is getting a little long but
here's the main takeaway if you're
trying to decide between these three
speakers you pick the JBL pull story
because it looks great and the sound is
going to satisfy you for personal
listening you pick the JBL charge 3 if
you're looking for the best battery life
and durability and you pick the sony
expedient the best bargain it sounds
great and has a good enough light
feature but just a heads up even though
JBL officially announced to JBL boom box
and if at the beginning of september i'm
willing to bet JBL is going to at least
enesta JBL charge for at CES 2018 and
here's the sound test all of these
speakers are playing at the same decibel
level in the same room and streaming
from the same device
so hopefully the only difference is
sound quality I'm also going to max the
volume out of them later into the test
so you can hear them at their loudest
comment down below with which one you
like best
I'm feeling lonely navona Mustafa and
they're right they need to Saudi without
