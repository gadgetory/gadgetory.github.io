beats three versus the jaybird freedom
if you're in the market for a pair of
premium wireless earbuds might be asking
which is better in which one should you
buy well the power beats three retail
for $1.99 ninety-nine while the Jaber
freedom retail between one forty nine
ninety nine and one seventy nine ninety
nine depending on the color and when you
get them first up we have the power
beats dream like we mentioned in our
review these earbuds are vastly improved
from their previous version they sound
better have a twelve hour battery life
they feature fast fuel which allows for
one hour of playback after just five
minutes of charging the controller has a
very satisfying click to them the new w1
chip ensures you have a strong wireless
connection to your iPhone pairing with
other Apple devices associated to your
iCloud account is super easy as well in
the adjustable your hooks ensure these
your buds never fall out on the other
hand the j-bert freedom earbuds are made
out of metal
they're super low-profile lightweight
they sound a little better than the
power beats three you can customize how
they sound from the my sound app they
even give you plenty of wing tips and
ear tips so you can customize exactly
how they fit in your ear these earbuds
can even be paired with two Bluetooth
devices simultaneously the jabber
freedom is a great option for anyone who
wants to listen to music while wearing a
helmet while they bike ride snowboard or
what have you
sadly they suffer from a few design
flaws the inline control on the Jaber
freedom houses most of the components
like the battery and bluetooth radio the
unlike controller is pretty heavy
compared to the earbuds themselves no
matter how secure your right ear bud is
in your ear the weight of the controller
will cause it to fall out frequently
which gets pretty annoying some may
argue if you wear the earbuds in the
over your style it'll solve this problem
well the controller isn't the only issue
here these earbuds are advertised as
having an eight hour battery life in
actuality the earbuds themselves can
only hold a four hour charge and you can
charge your earbuds back up if you
connect your charging cradle which will
start to charge them back up you can
even use the ear buds while you charge
them with the charging cradle but the
solution adds to the weight problem we
mentioned earlier you also risk losing
the charging cradle which means you
won't be able to charge the headphones
and you'll have to buy a replacement
cradle for 2495 from Jaybirds
site the inline controller does a great
job of separating
three binds which helps you use these
earbuds by just feeling but sadly the
blinds have a very dissatisfying clique
to them we also noticed easier but
sometimes suffer from choppiness while
playing music we also notice there was
some latency when it came to watching
youtube videos with the jaybird freedom
the audio and video were never in sync
for these reasons we recommend to go for
the power base 3 although they might not
sound as good as a jaybird freedom they
have a 12 level battery life without the
need of any external charging cradle
they can be charged by just using a
microUSB cable the controller is vastly
improved from the last the new w1 chip
ensures there's a strong wireless
connection with your devices the ear
hooks ensure they won't fall out and
getting an hour of play for 5 minutes of
charging is a huge plus well if you made
it this far leave us a like it really
helps if you like videos like this
