premium weightlifting shoes you might be
considering the Reebok legacy liftings
if you've been lifting seriously for a
while you might have thought about
getting yourself a pair of weightlifting
shoes to help you with your stability
while do you even need weightlifting
shoes or the legacy lifters even worth
the 200 on the price tag I'll tell you
you can pick up the Reebok legacy
lifters directly from Reebok for one
$99.99 with free shipping you can get
them either in black and gold or black
and white link to pick these up are in
the description below
okay look about myself first I've been
squatted with my adidas a decal for the
past three or four years I personally
like doing a high bar beltless ass to
grass squat with knee sleeves and when
it comes to delos I prefer to do the
bare foot orient juts with that out of
the way let's get started with the
review first off I want to point out how
incredibly heavy these guys are the
Reebok legacy lifters tip the scales out
1 pound 6 ounces each while do you think
is added power away just one pound each
most of the weight is distributed to the
back of the shoe seems like the heel on
the shoe is pretty dense speaking of the
heel the heel no legacy lifter is a 3/4
inch heel and have a 22 millimeter drop
which is much more dramatic heel job
than the adidas at E power having that
22 millimeter here job does feel very
different than the added power the
Reebok Legacy lifters also give you much
more arch support but when it came to
squatting at the grass
I did notice getting out of the hold was
a lot easier than with the addi power
the legacy lifters also have a footprint
with a slightly larger surface area than
the addi power the rubber outsole
combined with the slightly larger
surface make for a much more stable
platform to perform heavy lifts with you
don't have to worry about your feet
rolling inwards unless you've got some
really bad muscle imbalances or mobility
issues but when it comes to flexibility
the rubber outsole
really suffers the Reebok legacy lifters
are very stiff shoe trying to flex them
is a workout in itself we'll just have
to see how the flexibility changes as
they get broken it aside from the golden
heels which I think look badass I also
really like Reeboks - metatarsal strap
system it really allows you to customize
the fit of these shoes
the like easy lifters are pretty wide
compared to the addi power but thanks
for their lower strap you can adjust
that along with the laces and Orpah
strap you can make these shoes fit
exactly how you want them to something I
was never really able to do with my
Hattie power I would usually end up
getting some kind of discomfort while
working out of them now when it comes to
heel slippage there's zero - very little
and that's thanks to two things
versus due to the upper strap and
they're very well designed he'll counter
on the back this is Reeboks EXO frame
he'll counter which wraps all around
your heel the perforated foam also
provides a very good amount of padding
but it's also breathable enough to keep
your feet cool while you work out the
same perforated form is used on the
thumb of the shoe but I did find myself
constantly adjusting it during my
workout
unlike the adidas the Reebok legacy
lifters don't offer any grip on the
bottom of its tongue overall the
construction and design of the shoe is
superb you've got leather on almost 75%
of the shoe with that extra padding
around the straps which give it a little
touch of finesse branding is kept to a
minimal and classy things to Reeboks
Delta logo also if you look closely you
can also see Reebok stamp on the toe box
and on one of the clasps I just wish the
Aglets on the shoe were made out of
metal instead of plastic Halloween if
you didn't know this was called an aglet
well now you know you're welcome overall
the Reebok legacy lifters are very
stylish and comfortable shoe for
powerlifting and weightlifting the 22
millimeter hew job is pretty drastic
compared to what I'm used to but
adjusting is easy the two strap system
on the legacy lifters really allow you
to customize how they fit and they
really give you a solid platform to lift
it the rubber outsole and larger
footprint ensure your feet aren't going
nowhere when you're squatting I just
wish there was a little rubber for grip
under the tongue of the shoe to help it
stay in place these shoes are amazing at
one thing and one thing only
and that's keeping your feet stable at
all times if you've been squatting in
the adidas added power or nike Romo
Leo's 1 or 2 or any other squatting
shoes for a while and you've been
interested in to rebuttal in the
selectors then try them out the larger
heel drop could help your squat
assumption of these stances
these shoes are a little wide but I
still go to the sides now if you're
still new to fitness and you're still
learning how to squat then I advise you
to hold on
try squatting and deadlifting barefoot
and orange chucks chucks are cheaper
alternatives and still provide a stable
platform for working out it you should
first work on your form and make sure
you enjoy squatting and then lifting on
a regular basis before investing all
that money into a pair of shoes but if
you've been working out for a while and
you've been eyeing the Reebok legacy
lifters then pick them up your leather
inside
oh well wet they're 200 on the price set
I was pleasantly surprised when I was
working out of there and I feel that you
would be too
