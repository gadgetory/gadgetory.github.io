doing new iMac and Mac books with Cabul
eight processors they gave us a sneak
peek of the new home pot and iMac pros
which are due out in December unless
they get delayed and they also showed
off the new 10.5 inch iPad pro but for
some reason it didn't get too much love
at the time of the event so that's why I
got one and a smart cover and we're
going to reveal so while I get these
things out of the box don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe I think
you're going to like this video so this
here is the 10.5 inch screen iPad pro
Wi-Fi only in space grey with 64
gigabytes of storage
this one will cost you 600 $49 plus tax
if space gray is in your style you can
also get it in silver gold or rose gold
for $749 you can get the 10.5 inch iPad
pro with 256 gigabytes of storage and
for $949 you can get it with 512
gigabytes of storage and the fully
loaded iPad pro with Wi-Fi and cellular
capabilities will cost you a grand total
of 1000 $79 inside the box it's pretty
standard for Apple the tablet is front
and center you get a lightning to USB
cable and a USB power adapter Apple is
really trying to make the iPad a laptop
replacement for average consumers and
for someone who just uses our computer
tech social media watch videos answer
email in oriental free reports I think
it's very doable and with all the cloud
storage options out there right now I
think a lot of people can get away with
just a 64 gig option for comparison the
10.5 inch iPad pro footprint is just a
little taller and wider than the nine
point seven inch iPad the 10.5 iPad pro
is 6.1 millimeters thick
while the 9.7 ipad is 7.5 millimeters
thick and the bezels on the iPad pro are
much smaller than your standard iPad
concerning all of the power that's
packed in here that's pretty impressive
and they both weigh in at just one pound
concerning specs the 10.5 iPad pro has a
12 megapixel camera on the back with
optical image stabilization and consume
video in 4k and record 720p video at 240
frames per second for super slow motion
it can also do 1080p at 120 frames per
second as well
it also has a seven megapixel
front-facing camera for FaceTime and
snapchat filters and captures video at
1080p there's a touch ID sensor on the
front that's two times faster and when
it comes to Wi-Fi it has up to eight
hundred sixty-six megabytes per second
down so you can binge the new Game of
Thrones Season seven without any
interruption I'm going to have a
separate video showcasing the 10.5 inch
iPad pro 4k video and image quality so
make sure you check it out after this
video
I can't include 4k shots in this video
because of my current setup so many
shots you see in this video taken by the
iPad on 1080p at 60 frames per second so
they're going to be like super super
smooth but not as detailed one of the
standout features on the 10.5 iPad pro
that I think is what the upgrade is the
screen sir is 20 percent bigger than the
nine point seven inch iPad but in person
the screen looks freakin amazing video
doesn't do it justice the screen on my
iPad pro has 120 Hertz refresh rate
which means everything looks extremely
smooth it's almost liquid for comparison
the standard iPad screen has a refresh
rate of 60 Hertz and once you get used
to 120 Hertz on the iPad pro you can
really tell the difference it's like
when Apple released a Retina displays on
their iPhone for the first time and once
you saw it you couldn't go back and you
were able to see individual pixels
unnhhh on Retina displays well at least
I did another big plus is the screens
anti-reflective coating that makes the
screen easier to read in direct sunlight
than your standard iPad and the larger
screen on the iPad pro means you'll get
a full screen digital keyboard to type
on although this seems like an arbitrary
detail it's actually a big deal the
first half of the script of this video I
wrote on the nine point seven inch iPad
and adjusting to the keyboard was a
little tough and I did feel some
cramping in my knuckles after a while
first of all problems but the second
half of the script I wrote on the iPad
problem and the slightly larger keyboard
was much more comfortable to use
honestly when Apple announced a 12 point
9 inch iPad pro and when I saw it in
person I thought it was a little
ridiculous but I think they hit a sweet
spot with the template 5 inch version
and here are a few other things that you
should know about the 10.5 iPad pro it
adds up to a 10 hour battery life but if
you're doing something intensive
expected to drop dramatically but I got
us all in that now as with battery life
when I was shooting all that for
take footage stitching it together and
just doing normal things like watch
videos check my email and just search
the web as for speakers like the larger
iPad pro and it sounds pretty good for a
tablet just four gigabytes of RAM and an
a-10 x-fusion ship and starting percent
faster than the previous iPad pro all of
this makes for a comfortable size tablet
that runs very smooth with an all-day
battery life now once they my iPad pro
lag or struggle to keep up but Apple
products are known to slow down after
some time but hopefully this will be
able to keep up for the long run
especially with all that AR Apple is
pushing this iPad pro is currently
running iOS 10 and it's identical to
what you would see on your iPhone but
you can have multiple windows open and
multitask and the iPad pro has no
problem keeping up with two processor
intensive apps like Google Earth and
maps open I can even multi-touch and use
both hands simultaneously without any
problems multitasking on the iPad pro
isn't perfect but it's a step in the
right direction multitasking on the iPad
programs iOS 11 hits is really going to
change things
also don't forget this iPad pro can also
be used with Apple's new pencil I didn't
get it because I really don't need it
but Apple claims that three new pens to
pair with the new 120 Hertz screen means
that they have the lowest latency stylus
on the market I still want to compare it
to a surface pro imperson though just
like the larger iPad pro this 10.5 iPad
pro also has a dock connector so you can
attach Apple Smart keyboard and thanks
to the slightly larger footprint the
keyboard on the smart keyboard is now
also full size but at $159 the smart
Keyboard isn't cheap if you want to have
a keyboard with you at all the times and
you want to keep your iPad as thin as
possible that is worth getting but if
you're not planning on typing on the
iPad pro a lot then it would just be
better to use the on-screen keyboard or
just get a cheap third-party Bluetooth
keyboard I know Liza tech have some
crazy options and they just released a
crazy case with a backlit keyboard and
Apple pencil holder and abducts with the
smart connector for 12999
I wonder if I shouldn't review it but
typing on the smart Keyboard also takes
a little getting used to the spacing of
the keys is very familiar but they are a
little smaller they also have a very
small amount of throw to them but is
similar to what you would find on the
current
MacBooks the keys themselves are just
slightly concaved and there's a textured
horizontal paddle to them which really
help give your fingers of style of grip
while you type so has Apple finally made
an iPad that's good enough to replace
your laptop well if your casual user
then yeah I really think you'll be able
to get by just fine with an iPad pro in
a full-size keyboard and when I refer to
a casual user
I mean someone who just consumes media
answers email on a regular basis and
might have to make a PowerPoint or
keynote here in there but if you're a
power user or a creative you're still
going to be better off at the laptop or
workstation or even a surface pro the
iPad still isn't winning full desktop
apps so it's a huge crutch if you're
trying to use much more complicated
software ad versions of your favorite
programs just isn't going to cut it a
lot of people will argue that the iPad
will never be able to replace your
computer because it's not running a full
desktop OS well maybe things will change
with the release of iOS 11 there's a lot
of functionality coming to the iPad in
general in the near future but here are
a few issues I have with the iPad and
the Smart Cover first is with the volume
rocker I like to hold my iPad here at
the bottom half if I'm holding it
vertically if I want to adjust the
volume I can't just do this I have to
raise my hand and go looking for these
buttons and they're tiny too they're the
same size as buying on the iPhone I just
want to see Apple bring these buildings
down a little bit so I can adjust the
volume from here now I know you can use
control center to adjust a volume well
why have the buttons if you're not going
to put them in the right place another
issue I have is with the Smart Cover and
the camera placement I know some people
think taking pictures with the iPad is a
little ridiculous but if there's a
camera I'm going to use it if I'm using
my iPad and the smart case is open and I
want to take a picture I can't just do
this I have to do this or I have to do
this and this is just uncomfortable and
while I was out getting to 4k footage
there were times where I was doing this
this is not optimal my suggestion is to
move the camera sensor from this side to
this side and have a slit here on the
smart case so that when I have the smart
case open and I want to take 4k video
there's going to be a hole here so the
sensor can see whatever I'm trying to
shoot and this way I can keep this
a caisson and there's going to be a lot
of good for me to hold on to now I know
moving the sensor for one side of the
device to the other is going to require
a lot of work on Apple's part but I know
they can do it I believe in you but if
you're in the market for an iPad and
you're trying to design between a
standard iPad in the iPad pro I say
spring for the iPad pro the screen is
just so amazing you get four speakers a
whole lot of power and if you're the
type of person that records and takes
pictures with an iPad then you're really
going to like the sensor on the back you
can even edit export and post your 4k
video onto YouTube directly from your
tablet that's what I did that's
something like current MacBook can't do
what I'm still going to keep my laptop
around personally I wouldn't go in
installed working on a CAD drawing at a
full video or working on a Photoshop
project from scratch on an iPad due to
organic and software reasons assisting
that 4k video on the iPad took longer
than just doing it on a computer
but I would definitely like to use the
iPad pro to take those prizes with me so
I can put the final touches on them on
the go or have them with me so I can
show people my projects on that awesome
screen if you have the budget I think of
base iMac Pro paired with this 10.5 inch
iPad pro would be pretty cool just start
working on your project on your iMac Pro
and then transfer those projects to the
iPad pro and take them with you on the
go so people can see exactly what you're
working on hey if you enjoyed the video
