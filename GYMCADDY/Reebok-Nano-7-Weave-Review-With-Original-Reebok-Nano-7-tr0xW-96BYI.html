crossfit shoe in early January 2017.
And the response to it from the public was
luke warm.
The sole was extremely stiff, the shoe was
very narrow, and the nano 7 cage upper was
very uncomfortable.
But don't get me wrong, the stiff mid sole
made for a great weightlifting shoe, but due
to that uncomfortable upper it wasn't my go
to shoe.
Now six months later, Reebok has revised the
upper and has released their new Reebok Crossfit
Nano 7 Weave.
So, can Reebok save face with their Nano 7
Weave or is their Nano 7 still inferior to
their previous model, the Nano 6.0?
Lets find out.
Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe!
So unlike nike which has their Nike Metcon
3 and Nike Metcon 3 DSX Flyknit which is a
slightly a more expensive, and retooled version
of their base Metcon 3, The Reebok Nano 7
Weave is flat out replacing the previous Nano
7.
The Reebok Nano 7 Weave currently retails
for the same $130 the original Nano 7 retailed
for when it first came out.
Theres currently 3 color ways and expect more
to drop in the coming weeks.
Reebok is also trying to get rid of their
original nano 7 with a fire sale and offering
them for $79.99.
So once they're gone, they're gone.
Unless you know for a fact the OG Nano 7 are
going to fit you properly, you have a narrow
foot and you're not going to be running in
them too much I wouldn't buy them.
But if you're interested in the Reebok Nano
7 Weave I’ll have links in the description
below so you can pick them up.
And I’ll keep them updated the best i can
so you can get the best deal possible.
Comment below and let me know which color
way you like best of the Reebok Nano 7 Weave.
OK, so lets talk about the upper cause it
is the biggest change in the Reebok Nano 7
Weave.
There are still two layers, theres the mesh
upper that allows for a lot of breathability
and then theres the Nano Weave upper which
holds your foot in place and makes the shoe
fairly durable.
The Nano Weave is made out of thin plastic
fibers but the difference between the Nano
7 and Nano 7 Weave is that the thick fibers
now go horizontally and the thin fibers now
go vertically.
Also, the Nano Weave is now seamless which
gives the shoe a much simple and elegant look
compared to the last Nano 7.
The mesh portion of the upper is also slightly
thiner than the mesh on the out going shoe.
which make the nano 7 weave a little more
breathable.
I also noticed the delta on the nano 7 weave
is now reflective where as the first nano
7 is not.
Another added bonus that i noticed is that
there is a little bit more padding in the
tongue and heel counter area.
And finally i noticed the grip tape on the
middle portion of the shoe is now a little
thinner and sadly don't have the same amount
of bite as the grip tape on out going nano
7.
Concerning fit, I did notice the toe box was
a little wider… not as wide as the Reebok
Crossfit Speed TR and the mid foot was a little
wider as well (which was my biggest issue
on the OG Nano 7) so you'll be fine going
true to size with the Reebok Nano 7 Weave.
The new Nano 7 weave is still using the same
sole as the OG nano 7.
it still has the same track pattern on the
outsole, and the heel counter is still the
same.
But i did notice it was slightly thiner so
you do feel a little lower to the ground.
which personally i like.
I also noticed the midsole wasn't as stiff
so the shoe was a little more flexible in
the fore foot area.
But the shoe is still stiff enough which means
you get a lot of stability in the hind foot
area AKA your heel. which is still great for
heavy squats.
So those are the major differences I've noticed
between the OG Reebok Nano 7 and the updated
Nano 7 Weave.
For those looking for a general and performance
review, well the since Reebok Nano 7 weave
has a slightly different rope guard on the
medial portion of the shoe, traction is not
as good on the OG Nano 7 but it gets the job
done.
Unfortunately, the rope pro on the Nano 7
weave is still tiny so rope climbing is still
a little difficult none the less.
The traction pattern on the shoe still gives
you a whole lot of grip when you're pushing
off of your fore foot.
so its great for sprints, and sled pushes.
and in general the compound of the outsole
is still very sticky.
But keep in mind, the sole is still a little
too stiff to run or sprint in these shoes
comfortably for an extended period of time.
But this shoe still has absolutely no heel
slippage unlike the Nike Metcon 3. which is
good.
I’m really glad Reebok was able to realize
their Original Nano 7 was not the best, and
they listened to feed back from the community
and released their nano 7 Weave.
Its a step in the right direction, the shoes
fit and look better, the sole is slightly
thinner so you feel lower to the ground, and
the nano 7 weave is just ever so slightly
more flexible.
But even with the New Upper the Nano 7 Weave
is still better suited for weightlifting or
circuits that don't involve too much running
or sprinting.
the heel on this shoe is still very stiff,
so if youre a heel sticker running in these
shoes isn't the best. and even so the stiff
sole dosnt do a great job of dispersing all
of that energy when you're running so it goes
straight to your shins. at least thats what
I've noticed.
Or maybe I'm just spoiled from wearing so
much boost.
Regardless, crossfit shoes have a very hard
job to do, they have to be stable enough to
support you when youre lifting heavy weight,
but they need to be cushioned enough to dissipate
all of that energy when you're running or
sprinting.
None the less, the Reebok Nano 7 Weave is
still better suited for weight lifting.
The updated nano weave upper means a much
more comfortable fit right out of the box.
the toe box and mid foot are slightly wider
and you'll be fine going true to size.
If you already have the original Reebok Nano
7 and they fit you well there no need to upgrade
to the Reebok Nano 7 Weave.

Metcon 3 and Reebok Nano 7 check out the versus
