week they're usually on sale for 100
bucks they sound great their build
quality is decent and their battery life
is okay but I don't know what's a bigger
disappointment Star Wars the last Jedi
or the j-bird run
I feel the tapered one were rushed out
the door and even though they've been on
the market for a few months now they
still have their issues the jaybird run
were released in the fall of 2017 and
retails for 170 $9.99 a pretty fair
premium over the older jaybird x3 which
retails for one $29.99 but are usually
on sale for $100 even if the Jaber run
were on sale for the same price as the
x3 I still wouldn't get them in their
current state if you want to pick up the
jaybird x3 I'll have a link in
description below and if you use the
link it really helps out the channel
just a quick rundown of what you get
with the jaybird run you get your
carrying case that also towards us the
earbud you get a total of four pairs of
ear fins you get a total of four pairs
of silicone ear tips two pairs of oval
and two pairs around you get a short mic
USB cable for charging and a classic
Jaipur carrying pouch but surprisingly
you don't get compliant your tips which
are one of the reasons why I like the J
bar x3 so much so here's the biggest
problem with the J but run they suffer
from rampant connectivity issues and if
I remember correctly this is one of the
reasons why the air pods were first
delayed when I first got to j-bird run
and opened the jaybird app I first got a
notification that there was a firmware
update for the run but since it meant
downloading an app on my computer and
they regularly connected to J but runs
case to my computer I was like ignore it
ain't nobody got time for that so I went
a few days with the original one guy
owed that for firmware and it was awful
I couldn't get through a single song
without either of the earbuds
disconnecting mainly the left ear bud so
eventually I was like okay let's get the
new firmware and although it was easy to
install it kind of took me back to 2011
when I had to physically connect my
iphone 4s to my computer to get to the
newest iOS update after installing the
new firmware update there was a
significant improvement connectivity was
much more stable but it still wasn't as
good as any of the other wireless
earbuds I've tested just keep in mind
right earbud on the run is the master
and the left ear but is the slave if you
move your head a certain angle than the
left ear bud will lose connection if you
cover the right ear but too much then I
left ear bud will lose connection and I
even found that placing your phone in
your left
bakit will cause the Airbus to lose
connection in some cases there's only so
much software it can do but I think this
is a hardware issue but I would love to
be proven wrong
but the j-bert run also feature the
worst amount of latency I've seen in a
long time the air pods have almost no
latency while most other wireless
earbuds I've tested have about a half
second or less of agencies so some
people can ignore it but the jabber run
have like two seconds of latency and
personally I can't watch youtube videos
with this I mean this is just
that's insane but connectivity issues
isn't the only gripe I have with the
chaper run their current case is among
the cheapest and flimsiest I've tested
so far I am highly concerned that this
lid is just going to eventually end up
snapping off the ear buds also aren't
magnetically aligned to their case like
most otherwise your buds and this is one
of those small things you're really
going to miss when you don't have it
anymore
since the ear buds don't magnetically
attached themselves through their case I
noticed I drop these your buds way more
frequently when I'm taking them out or
putting them back in into their case
while at the gym and putting ear buds
into your ear after they were on the gym
floor is just disgusting and I also
think it's dangerous battery life on the
jaipur run is pretty fair when you put
them on they will verbally tell you the
recurrent battery status and through the
jaipur app you can see how much battery
each earbud has but when it comes to
performance i go to the gym four times a
week for two hours and Jaber claims the
earbuds can hold a four hour charge and
the case adds another eight hours and
that's roughly what I've been getting
usually by the fifth workout day I have
to put these guys back on the charger
now I'm not completely hating on two
jaybird one they have a few good things
going for them
the jaybird run are very low profile
when you stick them into your ears and
with the Jaber run you have a lot of
combination options when it comes to
tips and infants and once you find that
perfect combination they fit very well
the Finns keep them locked in place and
they're low mass means they won't wiggle
out like the Bose sound for free if
you're moving around too much one of the
things that always made a bird special
as a brand is their sound quality and
just like the x3 the runs sound great if
they manage to keep a connection and you
can make them sound however you like
through the Jaipur app if you listen to
a lot of hip-hop you can make them bass
heavy or if you want you can
really bring the vocals out but the only
problem is is that they don't get your
loud so this might be a problem if you
work out at a gym that really likes to
play Havana and max volume over and over
and over again the j-bird run also has
some really easy to use buttons that
don't require a lot of effort to press
if you press once on the right ear but
you'll play or pause your music and
double press and we'll skip a track and
if you press the left button once you'll
activate Siri but Siri will only talk to
you through the right ear bud
but unfortunately triple pressing
doesn't go back a track which is
something I really want to see j-bird
also gives you the option to make the
left button lower you volume and make
the right button raise the volume but in
most cases I just preferred the default
settings okay here's a microphone test
for the other jaybird Ryan and I
actually think it sounds pretty good but
this audio clip is being recorded by the
microphones on the day but run so you be
the judge of that
the j-bird run have some really good
things going for them they are very low
profile they were very lightweight and
they give you a lot of customization
options when it comes to finding your
perfect fit they sound good but at the
expense of volume but their battery life
is just good enough but the rapid
connectivity issues is just not
acceptable for a company like j-bird in
a highly saturated market I can't
recommend the Jade would run in the
current state if they're releasing new
firmware update then I'll give them
another try but for the Jade will run
too they need to fix the connection
issues improve the carrying case with
the sturdy hinge and magnets for the
earbuds they need to improve the drivers
in battery life and they need to swap
out the mic USB port on the charging
case for a USB C port
