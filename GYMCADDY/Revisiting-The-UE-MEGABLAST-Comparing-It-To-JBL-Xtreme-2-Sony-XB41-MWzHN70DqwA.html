a few months ago I didn't like it at all
it had a whole bunch of missing features
it relied to way too much on voice
commands and it just didn't sound good
it had way too much bass and no mints
but I decided to give the megablast a
second chance and even though it still
has its problems it actually sounds
really good now so good in fact it's
actually up there with the JBL Xtreme 2
in a smaller form factor than the sony
xba-40 one when the mega blast was
released in the fall of 2017
it was retailing for $250 but now the
mega blasts can be had for $200 or less
the sony xba-40 one was released at the
beginning of 2018 and retails for $250
and the JBL extreme 2 is the newest and
most expensive speaker here rate selling
for $300 if you want to pick either of
these speakers up I'll have links to
description below and if you use the
links really helps out the channel I
suggest you check them out because you
never know when these speakers will go
on sale should make it lucky and also
check out the numerous shelf down below
and if you want to learn more about
either of these speakers then watch the
full reviews first let's go for the
things that I hate about the UE mega
blast I hate that the mega blast relies
so heavily on Al xa voice commands to
player positive music and to skip a
track the voice commands are cool but
they only work if the mega blast is
connected to Wi-Fi and if you're
streaming your music over a supported
streaming service but if you're
streaming your music over Bluetooth
because you use Apple music or Google
play music like I do then the only way
you can control your music playback is
from your phone the only thing you can
do directly from the mega blast is
adjust your volume and this is
incredibly annoying because sometimes
it's just more convenient to have a
physical button to play or pause your
music or to skip a track directly on
your speaker I feel that all speakers
even smart speakers need to have these
three basic inputs because even though
Google home max is guilty of this
another thing I hate about the mega
blast is the recessed micro USB port on
the bottom of the speaker so this micro
USB port is so indented it limits the
amount of microUSB cables you can use to
charge the speaker to effectively just
it's included cable
I also think this is a sneaky way of Yui
and Logitech trying to get you to buy
their $40 power of charging cradle
because I also hate the fact that you
have to stand the megablast upside down
when you're going to charge it I just
think this is sloppy whereas with the XP
41 you can also charge away from
microUSB cable but the port isn't much
easier to reach but the extreme to is
the odd one out here because it can only
be charged via its AC port okay now that
I got all of that on my system let's
compare these speakers both the UE mega
blast and Sony XP 41 or super rugged and
durable they both have fabric outer
shows and they do a very good job of
standing up to bumps and scrapes and
they are both ip67 rated which means
they're both water and dust proof the
JBL extreme 2 is also pretty durable
things to his fabric outer shell but it
only has an ipx7 rating which means it's
only waterproof I think that the reason
it's not dust proof is because of the
exposed passive radiators on each side
but as long as you get dirt in them or
if you push them in you'll be fine but
now let's talk about speaker setups cuz
that's what impressed me the most about
the mega blast this time around even
though the sony xba-40 one is larger
than the mega blast it has the least
amount of hardware going for it the sony
xba-40 one has dual front worth firing
58 millimeter diameter transducers and
dual passive radiators in the center
that firing out the front and at the
back of the speaker now if we look at
the mega blast you'll see it has
slightly smaller 55 millimeter diameter
transducers and dual passive radiators
like the XP 41 but it also has
additional 25 millimeter diameter
tweeters now even though Yui advertises
the mega blast as a 360 degree speaker
it's really only just shooting sound out
the sides which is an important detail
to take note of for later in this video
and then there's the JBL extreme 2 which
is also a foot more firing speaker it
has dual 70 millimeter diameter
transducers there were 20 millimeter
diameter tweeters and expose passive
radiators on each side now Before we
jump into the sound test just know the
XP 41 is in extra base mode the mega
blast is using it's the standard EQ
setting and the extreme 2 has the newest
firmware update which improved its
everybody's
I personally think the megablast sounds
almost as good as the extreme - but the
megablast is really only worth using in
doors Yui advertises the megablast as
being a 360-degree speaker but the
megablast is really just shooting music
out of the sides so unless there are
walls for the music to bounce off of the
mega blasts has a huge dead zone on the
front and on the back of the speaker
we're going to do another 30 seconds
sounds us but this time the speakers are
outdoors and they're all playing at
as you can see the megablast has a
pretty significant debt zone on the
front and on the back of the speaker and
for that reason I would only recommend
it if you plan on using it strictly
indoors but actually filled up megablast
sounds almost as good as the extreme -
it sounds very clear which is something
I can't say about the XP 41 and I get
almost as loud as both the XP 41 and
extreme - but if I had to rank these
speakers in the audio quality it would
go extreme - in first place followed
closely by the mega blast and in that
last is the XP 41 even though you can
mess around the EQ settings on the XP 41
to improve its audio quality the lack of
dedicated tweeters on the XP 41 just
gives the speaker or hoard a time
separating the mids
from the highs now even though the mega
blast has a decent battery life is very
rugged and so almost as good as the
extreme - in a much smaller form factor
it's still missing basic features like
being able to pair it up to an Amish
speaker whereas with both the JBL and so
many speakers you can pair them up to
100 other speakers and obviously nobody
really means that but the problem with
Sony's wireless party chain is that it
either fails to connect sometimes or if
you do manage to pair a few of these
speakers up sometimes you'll get an echo
that can only be fixed by turning these
speakers off and pairing them back up
again like I've done in the past
JBL connect plus is the easiest and best
way to pair multiple speakers together
you just press one button on each
speaker and the speaker's will figure
out the rest by themselves if you plan
on regularly pairing multiple speakers
together I highly advise you invest in
two JBL is eco system because sometimes
it's more useful to have multiple small
speakers playing music instead of one
giant speaker just blaring in the
background so like I said at the
beginning of this video when I first
reviewed the UE mega blasts I didn't
like it at all and it still has issues
but you can say I'm very impressed when
it comes to sound quality if you're just
looking for a single speaker to use in
your bedroom or office and if you're
willing to look past the mega blast
glaring flaws
and I think it is worth considering and
it's $200 price point personally
whenever I'm going to use the speaker in
my room I've always been drawn to a
vertical speakers like the pulse three
because it takes up so little space on
my desk and whenever I wants it to
listen to music at higher volumes I
would grab the xba-40 one because it
also takes up very little space when you
stand it upright because even though the
extreme two sounds very good just like
it's bigger brother the JBL boombox the
extreme two lives in the studio just
because I don't have room for it in my
bedroom now remember the megablast is
only worth using indoors if you need a
speaker that can perform well both
indoors and outdoors then you're better
off going with the XP 41 or extreme to
go with the XP 41 if you want a single
speaker and if you want to save some
money and go to the extreme - if you
want the best audio quality and/or if
you plan on pairing multiple speakers
together on a regular basis if you made
it this far I guess you enjoyed the
