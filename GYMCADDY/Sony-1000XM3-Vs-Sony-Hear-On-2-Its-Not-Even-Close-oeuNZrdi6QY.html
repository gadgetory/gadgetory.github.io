between the Sony WH 1000 xm2 and the
Sony here on to it all basically boiled
down to fit and comfort because even
though the 1000x m2 has some really
great performing tech their ear cups
were pretty cramped whereas the ear cups
on the here on Tues were much more
spacious and more importantly the gap in
performance between these two headphones
was pretty narrow
obviously the 1000x and twos had the
superior active noise cancellation but
everything else like sound quality
battery life and features were pretty
much the same but now the gap in
performance between the sony Huron twos
and the new Sony WH 1000x m3 is
significantly wider and more importantly
for 1000x and 3's are now more
comfortable than to hear on twos so
here's how the new Sony 1000x and 3's
compares up against her here on twos and
why I just want to pick up the here on
Tuesday at all right now the Sony 1000
XM threes or Sony's most expensive ANC
headphones that are targeted towards
professionals and retail for $350
whereas the Sony wh h 900 n8k aid to
here on - are targeted towards a younger
crowd because of their more standout
lace design color options and a slightly
lower price tag of $300 but now they're
typically on sale for about $220 if you
want to pick either these headphones up
I'll have links or description below and
if you use the links it really upset the
channel I highly suggest you check them
out because Sony's headphones routinely
go on sale so you might get lucky and if
you want to learn more about either
these headphones then please watch their
full reviews and also check out any more
stuff down below
okay so first we're going to do a quick
little rundown of the major differences
between these two headphones before I
get into my tent a conspiracy theory
like I mentioned at the beginning of
this video the 1000x m3 is are now
significantly more comfortable than to
here on Tues the ear cups on the 1000x
and threes are much more spacious than
the previous 1000 XM - but during that
is deep as the Huron twos or the bose
qc25 since I have medium sized ears that
don't stick out that much
the 1000x and threes fit me perfectly
but for people who have larger ears or
ears that stick
a lot then you might be better off at
the Huron to use or both QC 35s but the
biggest reason I feel the 1000 action 3s
are more comfortable than to hear on
twos is cause of weight the new m3 is
weigh in at 255 grams so you essentially
forget you have them on because of their
low weight a new spacious ear cup design
whereas the Huron Tuesday in at a hefty
290 grams since I've been living with
the m3s for a few weeks now I just can't
get comfortable with the here on twos
they are heavy and I find myself having
to routinely readjust them because they
constantly shift around but we also need
to talk about design the here on twos or
perhaps one of the biggest agency
headphones you can buy the ear cups
stick out a lot and their headband is
also very thick and this also applies to
the previous 1000 XM twos even though
these headphones perform very well their
design definitely put some people off
whereas the n3 is have a brand new
design which has a new low-profile
headband and the ear cups don't stick
out as much the ear cups aren't as low
profile as the bose qc25 but they're
definitely much more manageable and when
it comes to active noise cancellation
performance between the 1000x m3 and
here on Tues it's not even close
substr 1000x m3s has sony's new q and
one processor and an atmospheric
pressure sensor just like the 1000 x and
two before it the m3s are able to block
out a little more noise than the 1000 x
and twos and significantly more noise
than the huron tubes and the 1000 x and
3s don't just block out more noise in
the here on Tues they also sound better
than the huron twos last year the sound
quality between the 1000 x m2 and here
on 2 was identical to me but that's not
the case anymore even though
characteristics like soundstage clarity
and instrument separation remain pretty
much the same between the here 1 to 1000
x m2 and 1000 x m3 the base on the 1000
x m3 is significantly better than the
older two headphones the based on the
1000 x m3 manages to get deeper is
cleaner and bottoms out much less than
the m2 or here on Tues listening to
Eminem's new kamikaze album would be
here on Tues was significantly different
and less epic than all the other times
i've listened to that album with the m3s
now even though both of these headphones
still have similar tech specs like a
three hour battery life they can only be
connected to one device at a time they
both have Sony's dsee and elder
technologies and they both have very
accurate touch pads on the right ear
cups which means they both have quick
attention and ambient sound modes the
gap in performance between the 1000 X
and 3 and here on Tues is significantly
wider because more important things like
fits sound and active noise cancellation
performance is significantly better on
the m3s than on the here on Tues but
here's why i just want to pick up the
here on tuesday at all right now like I
said on the full review and again I do
urge you to watch that video if you
haven't I didn't expect to get to Sony
one
and three so soon I honestly thought the
1000x and twos were going to be Sony's
flagship agency headphones for another
year because they performed so well but
obviously that's not the case but I'm
very glad the EM freezer here and I
personally think we are going to see the
new here on Three's and possibly the new
XP 950 n ones at CES 2019 I think Sony
released on 1,000 X and three by
themselves because they didn't want any
of their other ANSI headphones to be
overshadowed by the EM threes like the
here on Tuesday overshadowed by the 1000
X and choose last year and I think the
Huron 3s are going to have a very
similar design language to the m3s and
watch 700 n The Watcher 700 NK mout in
the spring of 2018 and I like to think
of this as the beginning of Sony's new
generation of ANC headphones when I
first reviewed the watch show 700 n I
noticed they had much more spacers ear
cups they were still pretty low profile
they had a lot of bass and a fully
wrapped leather headband something
that's me at the time seemed odd because
all of Sony's other anc headphones only
had leather on the underside of the
headband but now if we look at the m3s
they have a lot in common with the watch
700 more spacious low-profile ear cups
significantly better bass and a fully
wrapped leather headband so I think we
can expect to see the new here on
Three's in a few months with much better
bass but more importantly a new low
profile design because like I said
earlier the current here on Tues are
just a huge pair of headphones that
weigh a lot
have a very wide headband compared to
most other headphones and their ear cups
stick out a lot which can make some
people feel self-conscious about them
when they wear them out in public so
right now if you're trying to choose
between the sony 1000 XM 3 or the here
on Tues and if money isn't a concern
then your only option is to get the sony
1000 X and three they're better than the
here on twos in every way except for the
price tag but I know that for some
people dropping $350 for a pair of anc
headphones just isn't an option
so there are a few other options you can
either wait till CES 2019 and see if
Sony does in fact release their new here
on Three's and extra base headphones or
you can look into some of the new $200
ANC
phones drop in this holiday season by
school candy and audio technica
personally I'm really looking forward to
the new school candy venues but
personally I just want to pick up the
here on Tuesdays I think there's a very
high likelihood of suffering buyer's
remorse in just a few months if you made
it this far I guess you enjoyed the
