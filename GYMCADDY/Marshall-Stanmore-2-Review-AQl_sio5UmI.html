speaker lineup they sound great and you
can take them almost anywhere because
they're pretty durable and they have
long lasting batteries but a portable
speaker means you're paying extra for
that added durability and built-in
battery and if you're just looking for a
speaker for at-home use you're really
only concerned about is sound so that's
where something like the Stanmore 2
comes in it's slightly bigger than the
extreme tomb but it gives the boombox a
run for its money when it comes to sound
quality and bass before I started using
Noor VPN I would never use public Wi-Fi
because I didn't want to risk having my
data exposed which meant any time I
traveled or was in a dead zone in the
city I would have little to no internet
on my phone but now with noir VPNs
military-grade encryption I can use
public Wi-Fi and know that my dad is
safe from would-be hackers Nord VPN can
do a lot more but this is one of the
main reasons I use them see how you can
enjoy three years of online security for
only $2.99 a month by clicking on the
link in the description down below just
were clear we're gonna be focusing on
the nine voice assistant enabled martial
Stanmore tomb that we chose for $350 if
you want to have Alexa or a Google
assistant built into your new martial
speaker it's gonna cost you a $50
premium and for comparison's sake the
JBL Xtreme - its epic leery toast for
$300 and the JBL boombox retails for
$450 if you want to pick out of the
speakers up I'll have links in
description down below I highly suggest
you check them out because you never
know when these speakers might go on
sale like I mentioned earlier the
Stanmore 2 is strictly a at-home speaker
there's no built-in battery and no IP
water or dust durability certifications
like you will find on portable Bluetooth
speakers the Stanmore - however it does
have that classic martial design that I
personally like we've got a highly
tumble of the looking body with a woven
fabric grille on the front and brushed
metal accents are doing the speaker the
control panel is perhaps my favorite
part of the speaker it just screams
build quality the power switch has a
very deep gnarling you've got three
control knobs up top and the source and
multi-purpose buttons have a lot of
tactile feedback now we'll dive deeper
into these control knobs in a minute but
overall I'm a really big fan of
Marshalls more sophisticated and
timeless
design is going to look good in almost
any living room you place it regarding
ports the Stanmore 2 still has a 3.5 mm
audio jack up top for Wired listening
and I like the Marshall still has an
audio jack on the newer speakers because
some manufacturers are starting to
remove the audio jack on some of their
newer speakers Marshall still even
includes an RCA input on the speaker and
on the back you'll also find an AC input
for power but personally I would also
like if Marshall had built in a USB a or
USB C port so you can charge your own
devices
how many USB out port on your speaker to
charge your own phone just gives it that
little bit of actual functionality that
you miss when you don't have it anymore
because even when you're not listening
to music you can still use your speaker
as a charging pump but when it comes to
speaker setups Stanmore 2 has a similar
friend of center dual tweeters off to
the side and a base of lecturer that
shoots out the back whereas JBL's larger
portable speakers both have dual front
modifying transducers dual tweeters and
dual passive radiators shooting out the
sides
now we're gonna jump into a sound test
the boombox is an indoor SMUD understand
more to is playing with the bass now set
to 7 and the trouble is set to 6
even though the Stanmore 2 has less
hardware going for it compared to JBL
speakers it performs us as well but I
can't help but feel the sound stage on
the boombox is a little wider than
understand more twos but it definitely
doesn't take away from the listening
experience
now all of Marshall speakers feature
control knobs up top that gives you
direct control over the speakers based
in trouble and if you raise the base all
the way up on their speaker it's going
to have more wall shaking base 10 to JBL
boombox which I know that's what some
people are looking for but through
Marshalls app you have even more control
over your speakers sound signature you
can go in and adjust the mids on the
speaker to bring vocalist forward and
having this level of control over your
speaker's sound signature it's just
unheard of compared to JBL speakers
their app just doesn't allow you to mess
with their speaker's EQ settings you
have to use a third-party app but the
boombox does have an outdoors mode which
lowers the bass and races to trouble so
the sound can travel a little farther
outdoors and when it comes to max volume
again to stand more to easily gets
louder than both the extreme 2 and boom
box it actually gets uncomfortable a
loud but that loudness could be useful
for people who would like to use this
because outdoors on a patio or something
but something to always take into
considerations with the jpoa larger
portable speakers is that if you use
them while they're plugged in they're
going to get louder and they're going to
sound fuller but they still don't get us
loud or have this as much base as the
Stanmore 2 now if you watch my marshall
kilburn to review you know that one of
the things I really disliked about that
speaker is the lack of a multi-purpose
button but thankfully that is an
initiative the Stanmore 2 has that
multi-purpose button we can play pause
and skip through your music directly
from your speaker this might not seem
like a big deal to some but there are
some speakers out there that just don't
have this button and again it's one of
those things you miss when you don't
have it anymore we're going Bluetooth
connectivity the Stanmore 2 is rocking
bluetooth 5.0 it can be connected to two
devices at the same time and if you're
an iPhone user it's also good for
watching videos because it has very
little latency and if you're an Android
user the Stanmore 2 also has the app
tech support which is also good now I
just want to point out that app tech
support really only matters to Android
users cuz Apple insists on using
older AAC codec on their iPhones to keep
it simple the benefits of using an
Android device with your app tech
support its speaker is that there's
going to be almost zero latency when
watching videos your music is just going
to sound better and you're not going to
hear as much distortion at how volumes
compared to using an iPhone and again
for comparison's sake JBL speakers don't
have app that support but something JBL
still does better than any other speaker
brand out there is their multi-speaker
pairing JBL connect plus would let you
pair up multiple JBL speakers together
with just a tap of a single button and
more importantly you don't have to open
up any other apps and it just works
every single time now Marshall does have
a coupling feature but you can only pair
up the two speakers together and it only
works with the act on two stand more -
or whoa Berta - so even though it's nice
Marshall has a coupling feature now it's
a little behind compared to JBL whose
ultimate ears and so nice pairing
features even though Sonia still needs
to work on theirs but overall I think
the Marshall stand more - is a good
option to consider if you just want one
at home speaker like I've said in the
past even though I really do like to JPL
boombox I use it mostly as an at-home
speaker cuz I feel it's just too big of
a hassle to carry around because if
you're looking for a speaker to take on
the go with you on a regular basis then
I highly recommend the extreme - instead
but one of the biggest reasons the
boombox is so popular is because of its
sheer amount of bass and how loud it
gets if you're someone looking for that
then you can find it and more in the
stand more - in a slightly smaller
package and not to mention that classic
marshall design might be more appealing
for some people if you made it this far
