my D desk
I call it Johnny if you know what's
moving out from comment below but this
isn't the only John you can get for five
hundred dollars you can also get the DJI
phantom 3 standard but depending on who
you are and what you plan to do with
your job you'll be better off with one
with the other so once your own is right
for you let's find out don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe so let's go
over what comes in each box because
there is a big difference the DJI sport
comes in a few colorways you get the
drone some replacement propellers a
micro USB cable in a wall adapter for
charging in a carrying case if you want
a dedicated controller you have to pay
an extra 150 dollars and I'll go into
detail about the benefits of the
controller later in this video for the
same $500 the DJI phantom 3 standard
comes included with a dedicated
controller a power brick for charging
the battery and extra propellers as well
if you want to pick either of these
drones up I'll have links in the
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best view as
possible and if you're looking for deals
on other drones check out my friends
over at red nose calm now let's address
the elephant in the room the DJI phantom
is huge compared to the spark the
battery pack in the Phantom is the same
size of the body of the spark the t GI
spark is basically the size of my iPhone
6s plus the size of the DJI sparks does
have its pros and cons it's super easy
to take with you almost anywhere its
small enough that if you're leaving the
house in a rush and you realize you
forgot your spark you'll run back in to
get it whereas if you forget to phantom
you first think ah do I really want to
lug that thing around because remember
you're not just taking no phantom you
also have to take the controller but the
bigger size of the phantom 3 does have
its benefits first starters is much
easier to see when you fly it's also
much more stable in windy environment
because if the sport gets caught in a
gust of wind it's going to get it pretty
hard to control but the smaller size of
the spark makes it look inconspicuous
and the majority of the people don't
notice it or they just think it's a toy
but when people see the larger phantom 3
they know you're flying a drone and they
get scared is going to fall on them or
something
and also the DJI spark is much quieter
than the Phantom 3 the size of the doll
also plays a part and the value lies at
fly time and this year's fourth of July
cookout everyone kept asking about the
DJI spark and the first question was
about
berry later when I told them it was good
for sixty minutes of flight time and it
took 80 minutes to charge they were get
disappointed in comparison the DJI
phantom 3 is good for twenty seven
minutes of flight time but here's the
thing you can charge the DJI spark with
the microUSB cable making it super easy
with the Phantom you have to take out
the battery without a proprietary
charging cable and turns it that way
chances are if you're watching this
awesome video is because you're looking
into your first drum so you might be
wondering which one is easier to fly
without a doubt the DJI spark is super
easy to control it's perfect for any
beginner you have multiple ways to
control it first you can use gestures
where it will hover in front of you and
you can use your hand to adjust its
position you can even wave at it and it
will fly back and up to get a bird's-eye
view of you and you can tell it to take
a picture of you by making a frame with
your fingers you can also use your phone
to manually fly it and you'll get a live
feed on what your drums
just keep in mind the controls feel a
little dull but it's good for beginners
you can also use tap to fly and even
highlight people and objects and the
drone will automatically follow the
Phantom three on the other hand comes
included with the controller a
controller that's the same size of the
DJI sparks carrying case but with this
controller you get much better control
of your drone and you can fly the
Phantom much more aggressively then
spark you still have to pair your phone
so you can get a live feed of all your
drone seeds as well the controller also
lets you fly the DJI phantom much higher
and farther than the DJI spark since you
have a dedicated radio and controller
for the Phantom 3 you can fly the drone
to a max range of a thousand meters or
0.62 miles whereas if you're flying the
DJI spark with your phone you're relying
to your phone's Wi-Fi signal strength
and that will give you Sparkle range of
100 meters or 300 feet if you were to
spring for the $150 controller the DJI
sparks range will get bumped up to 1.2
kilometers or 0.75 miles the controls
also get much sharper and you'll be able
to fly to DJI spark at a max speed of 31
miles per hour but just remember you
still have to keep the controller of the
DJI phantom charged a full charge is
good for two and a half hours and it
charges via microUSB cable and it takes
2 hours to charge from zero now let's
talk about the camera and gimbal systems
on these drones the DJI spark has a 12
megapixel camera and it can capture
video at 1080p 30 frames per second I
would have really liked if we could do
60 frames per second instead the DJI
phantom also has a 12 megapixel camera
but it can capture video at 2.7 K at 30
frames per second which means more
detail you can also do 1080p at 30
frames per second or 720p at 60 frames
per second basically you get more
options and better video quality from
the Phantom 3 the DJI spark houses its
camera in a two axis gimbal a good comp
it's safe for pitch and roll but not yaw
the Phantom 3 has a 3 axis gimbal and it
can compensate for every direction
this means the video quality and the
Phantom 3 is also much smoother don't
get me wrong the DJI spark has smooth
video quality as well but you will
notice a little shakiness from time to
time concerning sensors the DJI spark
has a 3d sensing system on the front of
the device this sensor detects objects
tell you how far things
in the live feed and it'll even
automatically stop the spark from
crashing into something if things get
too close when I started flying this
system saved my butt multiple times
there's also another sensor on the belly
of this point that can help detect
objects below it crashing the DJI spark
is hard unless you're flying from side
to side
having the 3d sensing system is like
having a co-pilot with you the Phantom 3
unfortunately has no such sensors so it
all comes down to you it's not going to
save you from close calls like the DJI
spark can the DJI spark small-size
combined with this 3d sensing system
makes it super easy to fly even when
indoors on the other hand I wouldn't
dare fly defending three indoors what do
these drones connect the DJ eyes go up
both of these apps do relatively the
same thing you start up the app when
you're going to flying and you get a
live feed of what the drone sees you can
toggle settings activate different
flight modes and features and even get
live GPS positioning if you lose sight
of your drone while flying you can also
manage your video recordings and
pictures taken with your jump you can
even use the auto edit feature to create
a 30-second video on the fly to share on
social media with clips you select I
really don't have any complaint on the
GI Zapp's so for $500 both of these
drones are very capable and they perform
better in certain situations than the
other the DCI spark is great if you want
a small John you can take with you
anywhere and fly indoors and outdoors if
you want to get videos and selfies of
yourself and loved ones at this year's
cookout or at the Beast to share on
social media then the spark is the way
to go you do lose out on battery life
and range but the spark is better suited
for personal use you're better off
getting to DJI phantom 3 if you want to
fly your drone long distances if you
want to get epic landscapes shot or if
you're trying to produce higher quality
video content you get much more range or
longer battery life and a much more
capable camera and gimbal system but you
don't get the convenience the spark has
to offer and even though the spark is
small don't underestimate its
capabilities if you decide to upgrade to
the $150 controller you get to fly the
spark much more aggressively and you get
much more range out of it I really don't
think one drone is better than the other
it comes down to what your needs are
