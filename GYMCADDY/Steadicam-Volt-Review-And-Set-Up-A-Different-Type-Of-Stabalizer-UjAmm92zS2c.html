Steadicam plus the Kickstarter campaign
to fund their Steadicam bolt a
drastically different stabilizer for
your smartphone or GoPro and it seems
like a lot of people are interested
because it got one thousand one hundred
percent funded but is it any good we're
about to find out don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and you can check
out to my other videos here after you're
done watching this video and stay tuned
because I'm also gonna help you out with
the setup process the Steadicam bolt
currently retails for 199 and if you're
interested in picking this product up
I'll have a link at the description
below the packaging on the Steadicam
Volt is very nice first you slide off
the outer sleeve and then you lift the
lid you'll first see the instruction
manual in a soft shell carrying case
you'll then find seven magnetic
counterweights and they are used to
calibrate the Steadicam bolt you'll then
find the two rechargeable batteries and
you'll find their charging cradle a new
microUSB cable you can use any wall word
or USB sod on your computer to charge
them the lights on the Creator will
flash red while charging and then flash
blue when their batteries are fully
charged the vol comes pre-installed with
a cradle that will hold most smartphones
but you also get an adapter to attach a
GoPro overall the packaging is great and
if you don't spring for the hard shell
carrying case you can always just use
the box okay so we're gonna set up the
Steadicam bolt so you're gonna get this
and you're gonna unfold it you can just
open that up okay you're gonna notice
that the body has this brace I'm gonna
tell you right now from experience get
rid of it it's useless and all it does
it gets in the way and it even was your
shot sometimes so you can just slide
that off and get rid of that goodbye
okay alright now we're gonna go ahead
and we're gonna open this up alright so
you should have something like this now
make sure that the switch is powered off
alright now we're gonna go to the bottom
I'm gonna slide that open and throw in
your batteries make sure it's turned off
or else this thing is gonna start
spinning like crazy
alright now we're gonna grab your phone
now for reference this is an iPhone 6s
completely naked no screen protector no
wraps nothing I like to I like to
you want to get it as centered as
possible there's going to be a little
indicator here telling you what their
center is just Center it as best as you
can and last before we go into the next
step you're gonna notice there's a knob
down here make sure it's all the way
down at one all right so if you have
every use of three being three being
scale you should have some experience
with what we're about to do now this is
normal this is fine okay this is we're
gonna calibrate this you are going to
grab the Steadicam bolt hold it like
this
and you're gonna let go oh no that's
completely normal if this happens you're
going to go and look for your counter
weights one of these counter weights
that's going to have some threading on
it you're going to go ahead and screw
that in okay now that the counter
balance is screwed in you're gonna do
the same thing hold it like this and
it's still gonna go up if that happens
that's still perfectly fine you're gonna
go and grab some counter balance here I
have four no actually three four total
of four counter balances just gonna slap
that on and do the same thing so the
goal is is to keep this flat okay so
it's going down alright if we take one
counter balance off and we do the same
thing you're gonna notice it's gonna go
up so that means we're gonna get this
counter balance put it back on and now
we're going to adjust the knob so we're
just gonna slap here we go here we go
again
and perfect this is exactly what you
want you want the the best estate
balance if it turns from side to side
that's normal and we can just tune that
up okay just keep playing around with
the knob until you've got something like
this if that happens you're halfway
there next up you're going to hold it
like this now this if this happens
you're going to go to this knob here
if it goes back you want to bring your
phone forward a little bit
about me this is as good as you're going
to get it now if you've balanced your
phone correctly then you're then this is
going to stay pretty steady but if your
phone isn't perfectly centered let's say
like this this is gonna start happening
it's gonna start going off to the side
if that happens just play around with
your phone in until you can get it
perfectly balanced I've been messing
around with this thing for a little bit
now so I'm actually pretty good at
setting this up on the first try here we
go this is as good as I'm gonna get
now once you power on the device don't
worry this is normal okay just grab onto
it and you are set to go okay oh the
Steadicam bullet is made mostly out of
plastic in ways just one pound but after
shooting with it for over an hour you
get a killer shoulder workout like I
said earlier the Steadicam bolt is only
compatible with smartphones and some
GoPros unfortunately you can't attach a
point-and-shoot camera which is the
letdown for the price point there are
only two buttons on the device itself
there's an on/off by an endo button to
switch between sport mode and movie mode
one of those in a second on a full
charge the Steadicam bolt will last you
eight hours in order to charge the
device you have to take out the
batteries and place them into charging
cradle I just find it odd that you can't
charge the vote directly through all
built-in micro USB port but unlike other
stabilizers the Steadicam bolt doesn't
require you to use an app to operate it
but you can't download an image maker
and it's a third party camera app that
basically gives you more control
settings over your camera shots taken
with the Steadicam fold or noticeably
smoother but keep in mind my iPhone 6s
plus does help smooth out the video
since this has optical image
stabilization but you will notice the
shots taken with the votes stay on the
horizon better and there's much less
wobbling but even with the Volt you will
notice them undulating in the video
there are no controls on the vault
itself if you just hold on to the handle
your phone or GoPro will stay true to
the direction it's facing but if you
want to move the camera you just have to
hold on to the main body of the bolt and
move your hand or you can just manually
adjust it steady can't suggest you use
two hands but you can get away with just
using one hand but using the Steadicam
bolt requires a very
gentle touch the main selling point
steadicam points out about the vote over
more popular three access gimble's like
the smooth queue is that the vote allows
for fluid and much faster panning
movements on the camera since you can
manually adjust the camera you'll be
able to keep up with the action better
than with the slower joystick controls
to move the queue but to be honest I did
find myself missing a joystick for
certain shots here and there the
Steadicam vote makes it very easy to
adjust the pitch of your camera you
literally just set and go like I said
earlier there are two modes to the book
there's your default sport mode where
basically there's more friction on the
system and then there's movie mode where
essentially there's less friction on the
system if you tap the system it's going
to send the camera gliding whereas if I
were to do the same thing in sport mode
you're gonna notice the camera comes to
a stop much sooner in the hands of
somebody with more experience movie mode
can be used to capture some awesome
shots but for me I just keep it a sport
mode even though the Steadicam boat does
a great job of keeping your camera
steady you have to be mindful of your
movements if you move too much either
the gimbal system will snag your hand
will hit the counterbalance or your hand
will hit the main body of the unit and
it's gonna ruin your shot if you move
the system too fast the pitch is gonna
start to change but the biggest issue I
noticed with the Steadicam both is that
this system does not do well in windy
environments basically your phone
becomes a sail and if it gets hit by a
gust when the camera will start to move
making it useless for video recording
for the most part people who look into
getting a stabilizer for their flown or
GoPro are usually going to be daily
vlogging so they're going to want to get
shots of themselves and then quickly
switch the subject matter in front of
them the Steadicam boat makes it very
hard to film yourself with the back
facing camera due to the counterbalance
on the front you have to get creative
with how you hold the device unless
you're fine with using the front-facing
camera on your phone the Steadicam volt
is better suited for capturing shots of
subject matter in front of you then of
yourself and paying $200 to get
stabilized shots with your phone is a
bit steep and if you're looking into
getting this because you're trying to
produce higher quality videos it's safe
to assume you're either
using a DSLR or mirrorless camera I mean
don't get me wrong
phones these days have great video
quality it's how I got started with this
channel but using a dedicated camera
really has its perks
I feel the Steadicam volt it's too
expensive for the average Joe and I feel
it's lacking in features and
capabilities for someone with a bit more
experience to be honest I'm not a fan of
the Steadicam volt for starters that 8
hour battery life is too short compared
to other gimbals out there offering 12
hours of battery life at a cheaper price
and in my testing I haven't been able to
get anywhere near an 8 hour battery life
the lack of physical controls means
one-handed operation requires a lot of
dexterity or you have to use two hands
instead and there's no built-in shutter
button which means you have to press the
phone screen and readjust the Volt again
every single time you start recording
and if you're not mindful of your
movements you'd then risk messing up
your shots for $200 I feel the Steadicam
volts should have built-in physical
buttons and give you the option to
operate it with a joystick for minor
movements or single-handed operation and
let you manually move it for fast and
fluid shots and I feel that should be
compatible with certain pointing shoots
and mirrorless cameras and I would have
also liked if it had much larger
batteries for a longer battery life and
not to mention better quality materials
but I feel the Steadicam Volt as is
should have been priced at around $100
and marketed as a simpler and cheaper
alternative to current more popular
3-axis gimbal systems on the market
