if your phones you might be considering
the beat text or the j-bird x3 they're
both compact wireless earphones that are
super lightweight and easy to store away
when not in use but fundamentally there
are very different products that aims to
serve two different types of food
so which you should get I'll tell you
first of the $20 difference between the
J part X 3 and of except the J Brand
Xperia are available in two colorways
and currently retail for one $29.99 at
most retailers while the B techs are
available in four different colors and
retail for one 49.95 if you want to go
with a more affordable option then you
should go to david x3 when it comes to
form factor the beats X and J but x3 are
very different the beats X or long and
wrap around your neck
the main mostly out of plastic and when
not in use can simply watch on your neck
without any problem the day but Experian
the other hand or a little shorter and
features slightly more premium materials
they're super lightweight but if you
were to simply watch them on your neck
we're not amused they might fall off
because of their my controller although
those earphones are in your earphones
they fit very differently to the beat X
give you a total of four silicon your
tips and two silicon wingtips to choose
from they do a great job of getting to
your ear canal and staying there under
most circumstances they also form a
really good feel that helps with passive
noise isolation but the day bird x-ray
give you more customization options when
it comes to fit they give you three
pairs of silicone ear tips three pairs
of comply your tips and three pairs of
ear fit you can literally spend hours
customizing how these earphones fit
until the perfect just for you the
compliant your tips are especially cool
because they create a very secure fit
and provides far better passive noise
isolation than the beat x could ever
give you but no matter how much noise
isolation your earphones offer you it
doesn't matter these sounds bad the B
techs have a neutral sound signature
they are in two bass-heavy and the hides
are fairly clear they don't sound bad
in overall offer a pleasant listening
experience the tapers on the other hand
sound much better and that's no surprise
the neighbors have always been known for
their superior sound quality just like
their fit the de Burgh allow you to
customize the sound signature as well
all you have to do is jump into Jaybirds
my sound app and either select from
their pre-made sound profiles or you can
make your own if you're interested in
sound quality then - j-bot x3 are the
way to go
what makes the beats x very different
from the jaybird x3 aside from their
form factor is Apple's new w1 chip if
you're heavily invested into Apple's
ecosystem you should consider the B text
the
one ship allows for simple pairing and
seamless transition between multiple
Apple devices associated with your
iCloud account and yes you can still
connect the beats X to non Apple devices
via bluetooth by pressing and holding
the power button to put them in pairing
mode the David XT on the other hand use
Bluetooth 4.1 and allow you to pair up
to two devices at the same time however
the beat decks do have a longer range
than the gene products 3 I also notice
there's some leniency with the jupiter's
free which results in audio not being
synced up with YouTube videos it's a
slightly in C but noticeable when people
are talking in videos both your phones
also have inline controllers as they
should but they are very different the
control on the B text is much better to
use and/or much more tactile so control
under jaybird is a little different and
that's so great to use the RNs tactile
laser but they also both have built-in
microphones dad get the job done however
the sound quality on the mic is a little
better on the beats X because of their
position battery life when both
earphones is also similar they both have
an eight hour battery life but the way
you charge them is completely different
the beta X charged via a lighting cable
which makes life a little easier today
but extra charge via a proprietary cable
which means another cable to keep track
of if you lose or forget to proprietary
cables then you won't be able to charge
your earphones unless you buy another
one the beats X also feature fast fuel
which will get you two out to playback
time from just five minutes of charging
which is a great feature to have the J
board however don't have such a feature
over all the beats X or more of a
lifestyle products that can be worn
almost anywhere sure you can use them
while working out but keep in mind they
aren't sweat proof if you want something
that you can wear for long periods of
time without any discomfort have fast
charging capabilities and are all about
convenience then get the beats X the J
Brand X 3 is a great option if you want
something lightweight and compact for
when you workout since they are sweat
resistant you don't have to worry about
them getting a little wet personally I
prefer the beats X because of their w1
chip and fast charging feature but if
neither one of these are doing it for
you then remember you can always pick up
the Black Power beats 3 from Amazon for
one $49.99 link for that is in the
