p21 is a refined version of the previous
Sony XP 20 now I really like the new
design and durability improvements found
on the sony xba-1 and sony xba-40 one
but unfortunately i don't think that new
design language carry an overwrite well
to be so mean xB 21 now don't get me
wrong it's still pretty good but I still
prefer the looks of the Sony XP or the
new Sony SB 21 the Sony XP 21 is the
smallest and most affordable speaker in
Sony's newest portable bluetooth speaker
line-up currently retails for $99.99 and
it comes in 4 colorways black blue red
or white the older Sony XP 20 is now
going for as low as 70 bucks if you want
to pick up either of these speakers I'll
have a look at the description below and
if you use the link really helps out the
channel personally I would pick up the
Sony XP 20 before they're gone and I
highly suggest you check out the sony
xba-1
because sony products routinely go on
sale so you never know under the hood
the sony xba-1 is rocking very similar
internals to the sony XP to thwart a -
they both charge via our mic USB cable
and they both have a NOS track they both
have 1.6 5 inch diameter transducers and
dual passive radiators that shoot out
the front and out the back both of these
speakers also feature life feature on
the front but they look and perform very
differently both the live features on
the sony xba-1
and XB 41 have been improved from their
previous generation they're much more
vibrant and they look much better but on
the other hand i feel the life feature
on the XB 21 doesn't look nearly as good
as the XB 20 the lighter feature on the
expert 20 is much easier to see and it's
much more dramatic
just like the xB 31 and xB 41 the xB 21
now has a fabric outer shell but I don't
think the xB 21 looks nearly as good as
this larger brothers
due to its proportions and how visible
to life strip is it kind of looks like a
rectangular baseball to me personally I
prefer the pill-shaped industrial look
the xB 20 has with this exposed speakers
paints a metal grille on the front and
soft touch body I know looks are
completely subjective so comment down
below with which design you prefer but
the SB 21s new shape does give it the
ability to stand up straight while the
xB 20 can only be laid flat okay now
that I've ranted about the xB 21s design
let's talk about its improved
over the XP 20 in general Sony's new
speakers are way more durable than its
older speakers the Sony XB 20 is just IP
x 5 rated so a splash of water here and
there isn't going to be a problem but
you should still take it easy on the XP
20 you shouldn't submerge it and I would
try to avoid getting sand in it the XP
21 on the other hand is ip67 rated so is
dust proof it's waterproof and it also
floats and sony also claims that its
shockproof now as well
having one with this actual durability
is always a very welcome feature for
small portable Bluetooth speakers that
are meant to go with you everywhere
battery life on these speakers is also
pretty much the same both of these
speakers advertise a battery life of 12
hours but only actually expect to hit
those numbers if you use these speakers
with the volume set at 50% now with the
life you should turn off real-world use
but the life feature turned on and with
the volume set at 80% I managed to get
about 6 times for playback time before
the speaker's started to interrupt the
music every 30 seconds or so by saying
please charge but 6 hours of battery
life with these guys still pretty good
and what's going to sense
so fast
please
unlike the sony xba-40 and stone exp 31
which sound exactly the same in their
default settings I actually think the
Sony XP 20 sounds better than the sony
xba-1 when they both have the extra base
feature turned on now both of these
speakers have the same amount of base
but I feel the sound is much fuller and
mids and vocals are much more pronounced
on the xB 20 then on the xB 21 and for
those who might not be familiar with
Sony's extra bass light up these
speakers are on the warmer side so
they're going to be better for a rap hip
hop or EDM cuz they're going to put an
emphasis on the bass if you listen to
rock pop or anything with an emphasis on
vocals
I think these speakers sound a little
money but if you head over to Sony's
music center app you'll find a sound
mode called live sound and live sound is
different from just having the extra
bass feature turn off with life sound
turned on the base on the xB 21 is
lowered a little bit mids and vocalist
or push to the front and the trouble is
increased a little bit as well this is
the setting you want to use if you're
not listening to a lot of rap
unfortunately the hb20 doesn't have the
setting but you can always just change
the equalizer setting on either these
speakers through the app when listening
to a podcast I usually like to turn off
the extra base feature on the xB 20 and
it's super easy you literally just press
the extra base button the xB 21 doesn't
have a dedicated extra base button
anymore but you can still turn off the
feature by pressing and holding the play
in mine is mine at the same time until
the power indicator light turns green
and to turn the extra base feature back
on all you have to do is press and hold
to play in - button again until the
light turns white again regarding
connectivity both of these speakers have
the same wireless range of about 50 feet
and they both have surprisingly very
literally insane when watching video now
you can connect up to a 100 Sony
speakers together which Sony calls
Wireless party chains anything from the
xB xx all the way up to the xB 90 and
they'll all play in sync and the newer
xB 21 connect City xB 20 with no
problems if you want to learn how to
pair these speakers up just watch my
tutorial but if you want to get
right stereo sound going you need to
have two of the same speakers
unfortunately the XP 20 + XP 21 won't
play in stereo mode only in sync Sony's
app also allows you to play around with
a life feature found on both of these
speakers and you have the same three
options there's a rave where the lights
will flash that'll be the free music
there's chill with the lights will
gradually blink on and off and then
there strop but unlike the larger Sony
speakers the light feature on the XP 20
+ XP 21 doesn't change color and like I
mentioned earlier I feel the line
feature on the older XP 20 it looks much
better than the one on the XP 21 to me
the light feature on the sony xba-1 just
kind of looks like somebody just super
glued on led to front Sony's party
booster mode also made its way over to
the XP 21 leanness nothing more than a
gimmick but if more talented than me
maybe personally I still like the XP 20
more than the XP 21 I feel looks much
better than the XP 21 and I think it
sounds slightly better than the XP 21
right out of the box but the XP 21 is
much more durable than the XP 20 which
was kind of its Achilles heel when
comparing it to the JBL flip or there's
still room for improvement on the XP 21
I would have really liked if it used
their USB C port for charging instead of
a micro USB port I would have liked if I
could use it as a battery bank for my
phone and I would like to cycle through
the light settings directly from the
speaker instead of having to open up the
app every single time the xv-21 is okay
but I think you're better off getting
the XP 20 before they're gone or spend
the extra 50 bucks and get the XP 31
like you can't go wrong with the XP 31
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
