few months - JBL extreme - has been one
of my favorite speakers period it's not
too big it has a decent battery life I
can take it almost anywhere and most
importantly sounds pretty good and the
extreme - has done a very good job of
outperforming similar speakers that were
released after it but today we're gonna
put the extreme two up against two more
large portable speakers let's see if the
sony xba-1 G or the Marshall Kilburn -
can finally be thrown to JBL extreme -
all three of these speakers were
released in the second half of 2018 and
they all retail for three hundred
dollars if you want to pick either of
these speakers up I'll have links to
description below and if you use the
links he really helps out the channel I
highly suggest you check them out coz
Sony and JBL speakers routinely go on
sale so you might get lucky and if you
want to learn more about either of these
speakers then please watch their full
reviews design-wise these speakers look
very different from one another the JBL
extreme 2 is the smallest and lightest
speaker here weighing in at five point
two pounds and it's the most rugged
speaker here because it has a fabric
mesh body that does a very good job of
standing up two bumps or scrapes users
gotta be careful with those exposed
radiators the kilburn 2 is also pretty
rugged but honestly I would hate to
damage that little girl in the front or
scuff up the temple of her looking body
but technically the coburn 2 is the most
fragile speaker here because it's only
rocking an IP x2 rating so I would keep
the speaker away from water just to be
safe but in general I'm a really big fan
of the kilburn choose classic design and
finally there's the sony xba-1 jean this
is the big boy of the group it weighs in
at almost 7 pounds and takes up the most
table space but unfortunately due to its
hard plastic body it's not very rugged
because it does tend to scratch very
easily and it's important to keep that
in mind because all of these speakers
are meant to be portable speakers that
you take with you on the go because they
all have some sort of carrying handle
but JBL does win bonus points here cuz
they were smart enough to build on a
bottle opener on their cang strap and
now I just want to quickly address a few
things about the sony xba-1 jean this
speaker has a built-in light feature a
vacant control from Sony's music center
app it looks decent and it does add an
extra element
to music but you do end up sacrificing
some battery life the G in soon exp 501
G also stands for Google assistant 1 BTC
is approximately six thousand three
hundred forty four United States dollars
you got it
turning the studio light on this feature
works very well and it can do almost
everything on normal Google home can
accept you can't make phone calls with
it
but if you don't want to you can just
use the XP 501 G like a standard
Bluetooth speaker but now I want to
focus on ports because depending on your
needs this can be a real deal pic for
you the sony xba-1 G has a dedicated
charging port in a USB C port but this
USB C port can only be used to charge
the speaker or charge your own devices
it doesn't support data transfer so you
can only play music off of the X B file
1g wirelessly and unfortunately this
video doesn't have all deck support
which is a huge supporter from sony's
other speakers the marshal Kilburn -
does still have an audio jack but sadly
there's no USB out port so you can
charge your own devices and finally
there's the extreme - which i think has
the best port set up here for a portable
bluetooth speaker
it keeps the audio jack if you really
need it and it has a USB a out port so
you can charge your own devices but I
think the marshal kilburn 2 has the best
bluetooth connectivity set up here it's
rockin bluetooth flatpoint know it has
app that support it can be connected to
two devices at the same time and if
you're an iPhone user it's good for
watching videos because it has a very
little latency the JBL extreme - can
also be connected to two devices at the
same time but the speaker isn't the best
for watching videos cuz it does have a
bit of latency but then there's the sony
xba-40 1g this guy can only be connected
to one device at a time and it's not
suitable for watching videos whatsoever
this thing has a lot of latency in both
Wi-Fi and bluetooth mode and the colburn
too has the best real-world battery life
here with the volume set at 80% and with
the base knob set to 5 which is about
the same amount of base the extreme 2
has the speaker's gone for about 11
hours to playback time whereas the
extreme chill is gone for about nine
hours playback time and unfortunately
the sony xba-1 g
has the worst real-world battery life
here of just six hours and that's
because the battery has a lot more work
to do here because of the extra base
feature and the light feature but if you
use this speaker with those features
turn off thing you should be able to
squeeze out a little bit more battery
life out of the speaker but then that
kind of defeats the purpose as to why
you even got this speaker and now let's
talk about speaker setups the XP 501 G
has a single front were firing subwoofer
and dual angle satellite speakers that
do a very good job of covering a larger
area outdoors than most other speakers
the Marshall Coburn 2 has a single
forward-firing woofer and dual tweeters
but since there's a base of flector that
shoots out the back the speaker does
perform better when it's up against the
wall and finally does the JBL extreme
soon even though it's the smallest
speaker here it has the most hardware
gong for it it has dual form or firing
transducers dual tweeters and dual
passive radiators that shoot out the
sides now we're about to sample to a
scientist the extreme 2 is using the
latest firmware update does only xB 501
G is an extra base mode and the Marshall
kilburn 2 is playing with his volume
knob set to 10 based at the 5 and
trouble set to 7
never
- feel
you get to fight
now both the sony xba-1 G in Marshall
Kilburn to have the potential to have
more base into jail extreme to and have
almost as much base as to JBL boombox
what the XP 501 G you can go into Sony's
music center app and adjust its EQ from
there and with the Kilburn 2 you can
manually raise the bass in trouble with
the knobs up top but bass isn't
everything I can't help but notice the
extreme to has the wider soundstage and
better SMS operation whereas with both
the Kilburn cheer and XP 501 g
everything does sound a little close
together compared to the extreme to so
the extreme two does still have the
better audio fidelity and in general it
has a decent amount of bass but a very
important detail i do want to point out
is that if you use the extremes your
wildest plugged into power is going to
get louder and sound fuller with more
bass or as with both the sony and
marshall speakers if you plug them into
power they aren't going to perform any
differently so yeah if you want lots and
lots of bass in a small package go with
the sony or Marshall or if you just want
a good sounding speaker go with the
extreme - and overall I still think the
JBL extreme 2 is the best $300 speaker
here and here's why like I just said the
extreme to you has the better audio
fidelity here and if you use it while
this plugged in it's going to get louder
and have more bass it also has a decent
real-world battery life that's going to
have no problem asking you a whole deal
listening and if you're at the beach or
at the basketball court you can use it
or charge your own phone if you're
running low on battery something that
the kilburn can't do and the extreme 2
is also the better investment here
because if you plan on getting other
smaller JBL speakers in the future you
can pair them together with JBL connect
plus whereas the Colburn 2 can't be
paired up to any other speakers and the
XP 501 G can only play in sync with
other smart speakers using chromecast
and that only works if you have Wi-Fi
but the Marshall Coburn 2 is still a
very close second for me because in some
ways it's better than the extreme - I'm
a really big fan of its classic design
it has a lot of bass in a pretty small
package I really like it's bluetooth
performance it has a longer-lasting
battery and it even has fast charging
the only thing I hate about it is that
it doesn't have a more
purpose by into physically controlling
music but I will only consider picking
up the Marshall Coburn chew over the JBL
extreme - if you don't plan on picking
up any other speakers in the future at
all if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
