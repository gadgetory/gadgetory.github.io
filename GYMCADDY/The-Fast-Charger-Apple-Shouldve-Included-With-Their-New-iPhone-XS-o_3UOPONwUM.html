was announced a small USB sea wall
adapter was leaked and a lot of people
including myself thought Apple's new
iPhone was finally gonna have fast
charging right out of the box something
that I think is reasonable to expect
when you drop over a grand for your new
smartphone and something that's been
standard on a lot of other flagship
devices for a while now but nope Apple
courageously decided to keep using the
same five watt wall adapter and USB a
two lightning charging cable they've
been using since the iPhone 5s and this
is a big deal because it takes ages to
charge the iPhone 10s Max's 30 100
million power battery and after getting
to see the performance improvement in
just how fast this charger actually
charges my iPhone I feel this is to
charge your Apple should have had
included in the box with your new
iPhones but nope Apple expects you to
fork over an additional $30 if you want
their new 18 watt the USBC wall adapter
but it doesn't end there since this is a
USB see a wall adapter you probably also
have to get a new USBC to lightning
cable for an additional $20 if you don't
already have one so bringing the total
cost of this upgrade to $50 now $50 is
slightly better than what you had to pay
before if you want it fast charging
before if you wanted fast charging using
only first party devices your cheapest
option was getting Apple story wall USB
C power adapter which by itself cost $50
now using a 30 watt wall adapter to
charge your iPhone is complete overkill
so that's why I'm happy this 18-month
one is finally here and like I said
there is a huge performance improvement
i've known as that my iphone tennis max
can go from 30% battery to 100% battery
in about an hour but i've also noticed
that while my iphone is charging with
this new 18 watt charger it gets super
hot and i would even say it gets
slightly hotter than my pics were three
when it's charging with its fast charger
now yeah obviously you don't have to buy
apples a new charger if you want fast
charging on your iphone they're much
cheaper options out there thanks to
third parties but this just goes to show
how Apple's greediness and stubbornness
is really starting to get in its way
current iPhone sales just are
meeting apples expectations so they're
actually offering people more money for
their older iPhones if they trade them
in when they get a new iPhone so this
way Apple hopes to increase their new
iPhone sales without having to go
through the embarrassment of actually
lowering their prices but I think Apple
would have seen better iPhone sales if
they included this new fast charger in
the box and marketed it properly sure me
out the general consensus among all the
iPhone 10's reviews on YouTube is the
new iPhone 10s and 10's max is slightly
faster than last year's there's no
headphone dongle and fast charger in the
box and there's really no need to
upgrade from last year's model and a lot
of people with iPhone 6s 7s and eights
are holding on to their older devices
cuz teachers don't co real need to
upgrade but I think if Apple had
included this fast charger with their
iPhone 10s they could have said this is
the longest lasting and fastest charging
battery in an iPhone ever all of this in
a British accent now obviously if you're
tech-savvy you know fast charging has
been around for a while and is standard
on a lot of other phones these days but
for the non tech savvy people who do buy
iPhones I bet it would have at least
caught their attention more and led to
more people upgrading just because
everyone wants to phone with the longest
lasting battery and as a reminder
iPhones before the iPhone 8 don't
support fast charging at all
thus incentivizing people with other
iPhones even more but instead Apple's
going down this path where they're
trying to siphon as much money as they
can from their customers by increasing
their products prices up selling you if
you want a headphone adapter and now
upselling you even more if you want fast
charging with your new phone and again
I'm making a big deal about this cuz
charging the iPhones on its max feels
very antiquated because it charges very
slowly compared to other phones and fast
chargers come included with almost every
other phone out there but yeah if you
have a new iPhone or plan on picking one
up you are better off picking up Apple's
new fast charger because there are some
very serious performance improvements
and it's pretty compact compared to a
lot of other third-party chargers I've
seen out there and I really do hope
Apple listens and at least includes this
new fast charger with their next iPhone
