headphones well it's been done before
Samsung did it with their iconic
earphones both did it with this sentence
board pulse and rumor has it Apple is
trying to incorporate that feature into
the next-gen Apple earpods
and they're probably more than it I
didn't even mention what I think the you
a sport wireless heart rate earphones
execute on the feature better than most
and today we're giving the Under Armour
sport wireless heart rate earphones a
long overdue review the you a sport
wireless heart rate is a JBL product and
currently comes in two color weight
black like these and they also come in
way they're competitively priced at one
forty nine ninety five which is pretty
standard for sport wireless earphones
these days also keep in mind if you buy
these earphones you also get twelve
month premium membership to lamp buy one
for free which is a $30 value by itself
if you want to pick these your phone's
up I'll have a link in the description
below packaging here is pretty
remarkable when you look the LED it says
only JBL audio engineering can meet
Under Armor standard for premium
performance to create the ultimate sport
headphones I'll be alerted to that first
you'll see the headphones laid out
neatly in front of you under that you'll
find included carrying case inside the
box you'll also find a micro USB cable
three extra ear tips for a total of four
different ear tips and some
documentation that you'll need an
electron microscope to read because the
Texas of frickin tight and there's no
wall work but other than that packaging
is pretty solid the earphones themselves
are a cross between the Bose sound sport
and the power beats three the uterus and
the UA earphones is very similar to ones
found on the Bose sound sport and
they're meant to simply rest on the ball
of your ear which mean there isn't a
tight seal in a lot of ambient noise and
manages to get in which I know runners
like but not so much weight lifted but
unlike the Bose sound sport the UA ear
tips don't have that extra ear thing
instead Under Armour and/or JBL decided
to use an ear hook sort of like the one
on the power beats three personally i
prefer an ear hook over fin cuz are much
more secure and i don't have to
constantly have to be readjusting their
earphones like the jaybird x3 or the
beat sack the rest of the earphones is
pretty standard
there's a thin sausage cable connecting
the two and as an inline controller with
three binds so you can control humidity
playback and the blinds have a very
satisfying click to them you know how
particular I am about haptic feedback on
products in general I'm a fan of the
overall design the lightweight they fit
well and they have ear hooks so I don't
have to worry about them falling out so
how do they sound you might be wondering
and the short answer is they're so so
they sound fairly decent on the mids but
the highs can get pretty tinny and the
lows aren't there and like I said
earlier they don't create a really good
seal so you get a lot of leakage and a
lot of ambient noise does manage to get
it but some people will argue that if
you want great sounding earphones then
you should get over the ear headphones
and technically they're not wrong but
jaybird manages to deliver amazing audio
quality with the gbx3 so why shouldn't
other competitors if you're looking for
exceptional sound quality from your
sport earphones then you should look
elsewhere but the you a sport wireless
heart rate your phones are in just about
sound as the name implies they also
track your heart rate during your
workout and you can check your heart
rate a few different ways first you can
use the you a record app to get
real-time readings all you have to do is
make sure your headphones are clear with
your phone open the app and set up on
track workout and then you'll see stats
like duration calories burned current
heart rate and which is own urine and
you can set the headphones to tell you
your current stats answering intervals I
set my travel 15 minutes honestly the
tracking feature is pretty mean and
don't worry you can still leave the app
even while I was tracking your workout
but if we're some reason you don't want
to use the app to track your heart rate
because you want to see battery or
because you don't have your phone with
you you can still use the heart rate
tracking feature by pressing and holding
the touch sensitive you a logo on the
right ear but for five seconds then the
headphones will tell you that the heart
rate monitor is turned on and at any
point during your workout if you simply
touch the UA logo again the headphones
will audibly tell you your current heart
rate accuracy on this heart rate monitor
is pretty good it consistently detected
my heart rate throughout the whole
workout and the readings I was spitting
out wasn't aligned with what my garmin
vivosmart 3 treadmill heart rate monitor
and manual calculations were recording
the reason I really like having a heart
rate monitor in my ear is because I can
still see what my core and heart rate is
even if I'm wearing wrist wraps or
straps when I live because if you're
going to wear either wraps or straps you
can't wear a wrist mounted heart monitor
and being able to see a live reading for
my phone is pretty cool the UA sport
while is heart rate earphones connect
your phone via bluetooth for that too
and have a 30 foot range with direct
line-of-sight to your phone they also
have a battery life of about 5 hours but
expect that badly to drink faster if you
have the heart monitor turn on at all
times
and sadly there's no quick charging
feature also these earphones are IP x5
waterproof so you'll be flying and
covered in sweat but you shouldn't
submerge them in water like I mentioned
earlier these earphones also come with a
caring touch it's a silicone soft
showcase that slips up it doesn't
provide much padding but does include a
case is still much better than the ones
that come with the palm is three beats X
and Raburn x3 I just don't get why those
earphones come with such bad carrying
cases in conclusion I really like these
earphones
I think the freaking dope but if you do
decide to pick these up I just want to
make sure you know what you're getting
these are not the best sounding
earphones out there and they let a lot
of ambient noise in their battery life
sucks so you're probably going to have
to remember to charge them every time
before you go to the gym and not having
a quick charging feature is a bummer but
they are very comfortable to wear and
they never fall out of the air and the
heart rate monitor is a really cool
feature especially if you're using Under
Armour's record app if JBL manages to
improve the sound quality so is the
battery light and include a quick
charging feature in their Gen 2 version
of these headphones they will have a
serious knock out with the wireless
sports earphone market hey if you made
