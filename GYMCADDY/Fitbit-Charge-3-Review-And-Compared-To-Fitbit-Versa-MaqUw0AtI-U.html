release their Fitbit Versa
it's still a fitness tracker first and
SmartWatch second but everything it's
supposed to do it does it very well and
I still think the Versa is still the
best fitness tracker in fitbit's lineup
but now we have the Fitbit charge 3 it
does almost everything the Versa dies
but in a much smaller and inconspicuous
package the new base model Fitbit charge
3 retails for $150 and the base model
Fitbit Versa retails for $200 and in
classic Fitbit fashion both of these
trackers have limited-edition variants
besides coming with an additional more
premium wristband the only technical
difference between a base model Fitbit
and limited edition Fitbit is a built-in
NFC chip so you can use your Fitbit for
contactless payments similar to what you
would see people with Apple watches do
personally I always recommend going for
the limited edition variant because
you're getting an additional wristband
at a discounted rate so if you want to
pick either of these Fitbit sup I'll
have links or description below
and if you use the links it really helps
out to channel at first glance the new
Fitbit Taurus 3 looks identical to the
previous charge 2 and that's not a bad
thing the charge 3 has a very
conspicuous design for people who want
to wear a fitness tracker but without
broadcasting to the whole world that
they're wearing a fitness tracker but
the torch 3 does bring some very
welcomed physical and technical
improvements from the charge to first
stop it is much easier to remove the
wristband on the charge 3 compared to
the charge 2 and even the Versa you just
press a button on the bottom and it pops
right off so swapping bands is going to
be much less of a headache the charge
story also now has a solid state home
button similar to what you would find on
an iPhone
Fitbit did this so he can swim and track
your workouts with the charge 3 just
like you can with the Versa whereas you
couldn't swim with the charge 2 but
perhaps the most notable difference
between the charts 2 in charge 3 is the
new touch screen the charge 2 had a
haptic touchscreen meaning that it
wasn't actually registering your inputs
like a smartphone does it was
registering the force of your tap so in
order for it to register an input you
had to tap it hard enough
BIF method did work pretty well but it
did lead to a lot of failed attempts but
the advantage of having a haptic touch
the charge to meant that it was still
pretty usable even when the screen was
covered in sweat or water whereas the
Taurus 3 now has a traditional touch
screen meaning that it's going to
register your taps and swipes just like
any other smartphone and just like the
Versa and using the touchscreen on the
charge 3 is pretty easy but things do
start to get a little tricky when the
screen is 1 and this is pretty normal
for touchscreens but as long as you wipe
it down you'll be all right and just
like before the Taurus 3 still has a
black and white all that screens similar
to the charge 2 and this screen is very
easy to see even in the brightest of
days but if you are hard of seeing then
you might be better off springing for
the Versa I found that even with the Tor
stories largest text option some people
were still having issues even just
telling the time under charge 3 but now
let's talk about what the tourists we
can actually do from an activity
tracking standpoint the charge 3 can
track everything the verse again they
can both track your steps calories
burned heart rate floors climbed various
different workouts sleep and they both
have female health tracking capabilities
and all the data that these fitness
trackers collect gets sent over to
fitbit's app and fitbit's app is still
one of the best fitness tracking apps
out there it manages to display your
stats in a very easy to read and
understand manner but if you really want
to dig in deep and see more detail stats
about your workouts then you can do that
now even though the charge 3 inverse are
both able to track the same things we
did find slight performance differences
between them hard we track an accuracy
between the charge 3 and versa is
relatively the same but we didn't know
the step tracking an automatic workout
smart tracking was a little less
accurate on the charge to read and on
the Versa mainly the charge 3 had a
harder time automatically detecting when
a were cat has started and ended and the
torch 3 on a regular basis did
overestimate how many steps were taken
or how for a user had ran and the torah'
stories lower accuracy could possibly
have something to do with its lack of a
3-axis gyroscope
something that the Versa does have over
the charge 3 now if you're an avid
runner both the charge 3 and vs. support
connected GPS meaning that if you want
to get a more accurate stats about your
runs or jogs then both trackers can
connect your phone and use its GPS so
you can map out your runs and
more accurate paced readout but this
also means you're gonna have to bring
your phone along
now the reason neither of these fitbit's
have built-in GPS is because fitbit
wanted to keep costs down and they also
wanted to keep their trackers as small
as possible so if you're okay with
bringing your phone along on your runs
or jogs then if it will be fine or if
you really need something with built-in
GPS then you might want to look into
something from Garmin or maybe even an
Apple watch another upgrade the torch
three has over the charge two is that it
now has an advertised battle knife of
seven days versus five days but we found
out with all day and night where and
with one hour of daily interval training
the charge three is really only good for
about four and a half days maybe five
days from a full charge whereas the
Versa has an advertised battery life for
four days and under the same
circumstances it's really really good
for about two and a half days maybe
three days from a full charge and to
charge the torch three you have to use
one of it beats many proprietary
charging cradles now even though having
to keep track of this proprietary
charger isn't a big deal I just want to
take a minute to say that this was one
of our least favorite things about to
charge three there have been a lot of
times where we've dropped the charge
three to charge and only to come back a
while later to find that I didn't
actually charge because it wasn't
perfectly aligned I just want to point
this out because this wasn't an issue
with the previous charge tomb and it's
also not an issue with the verson and
finally let's talk about what the Versa
can do that the charge 3 can't both the
Versa and charge 3 can show you call
text app and count on the notifications
right on the screen you can even quickly
respond to text with canned messages on
both of these trackers but only if
you're using an Android device but
obviously since the Versa has that
larger full-color display you're going
to get larger and fuller readout of
those notifications you can also
download third-party apps to the Versa
like you would on an Apple watch but
these apps aren't as fleshed out and
there aren't as many apps available
compared to the Apple watch but if you
want to customize your versa there is a
pretty extensive library of free and
paid watch faces and in general the vs.
larger screen just makes it much easier
to see your stats and navigate through
its menus than to charge 3 but in
general I think choosing between the
charge 3 and verse
these days is mostly about form-factor
they both tried to same activity stats
as one another but the versa does it a
little more accurately than the charge
three but still the accuracy difference
between the charge three and versa isn't
really going to make your break your
Fitness progress you're still gonna have
to get up and put the work in the charge
three is a good little fitness tracker
if you want something small and
inconspicuous to help you keep track of
and quantify your daily activity and not
to mention that multi-day battery life
is still pretty impressive but still the
Versa is the best fitness tracker in
fitbit's lineup key word being fitness
tracker the Versa is a good-looking
fitness tracker first in SmartWatch
second the full of notifications and
downloadable apps make it more useful
for when you're outside of the gym
but I want to go comparing it to an
Apple watch if you're looking for a
SmartWatch get a SmartWatch cut since
you can't talk to your voice assistant
answer cause or respond to text I
directly from the Fitbit Versa then I
wouldn't consider it a SmartWatch and
given this price point that's okay
some people just want a SmartWatch so
they can track their workouts and even
though the series for Apple Watts kind
of sold the show at Apple's latest
iPhone event its lowest bar of entry is
$400 so if you just want something to
track your workouts with then the Taurus
3 Zen versus 150 and $200 price points
may be more palatable if you made it
