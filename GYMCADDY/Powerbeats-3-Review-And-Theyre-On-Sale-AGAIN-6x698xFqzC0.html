beats three to review a lot of people
including myself have been asking what's
the difference between the power beats
three and the power beats two and should
you upgrade well we're going to answer
that right now this is Jim Carrey's
review on the power beats 3 opening the
box can be a little tricky at first but
what's inside you'll be greeted by the
earbuds three extra pairs of ear tips
for a total of four to choose from
documentation carrying case and a
comically sharp micro USB charging cable
you'll have to bring your own wall board
for this one the power beats 3 have a
battery life of 12 hours a big
improvement from the power beats - they
have fast fuel which will get you one
hour of play for five minutes of
charging fast fuel is a new feature the
power beats - don't have which is great
if you constantly forget to charge your
earbuds like I do the water and sweat
resistant but for your buds that are
supposed to be used in the gym they
better be compared to the power beats to
the power beats 3 look and feel exactly
the same until you get up close and
personal first we notice that inline
controllers have been revised gone is
the rubber outer shell and in this place
is an all-new plastic construction the
new rocker is much easier to use you can
really tell each button apart by just
feeling which helps get rid of clicking
the wrong buttons by mistake like on the
power beats - they also have a much more
satisfying click to them compared to the
previous version
listen moving up to the earbud
themselves we notice the power beats 3
or larger than the power beats - but
it's not a deal-breaker surprisingly we
notice the power of these 3 were a
little more comfortable in the ear as
well we're guessing the added size of
the earbud is helping to house a larger
battery and larger drivers the power
beats 3 battery lasts much longer than
the power beats - and we notice they
sound much better as well
the bass was much deeper range and
instrument separation was improved and
they were even louder overall the sound
quality improvements are very noticeable
so for those reasons the added size is
justified the power beats 3 also
features apples much bragged about w1
chip for those who don't know Apple
bought beats by dre a while back and
that's why they're advertised so much in
their stores Apple first mentioned the
w1 chip in their September keynote when
they introduced a recently delayed ear
pod well thankfully the w1 chip is also
being incorporated into new Beats
headphones
the w1 chip allows for easy pairing less
power consumption which in turn helps
with battery life and a much stronger
connection which helps gets rid of the
random choppiness that you may
experience at the powerbeats2 what's
really cool is that after your earbuds
pair with your iPhone they'll
automatically pair well with all other
Apple devices associated with your
iCloud account so instead of having to
appear your powerbeats 3 with the iPad
and then pair it again with your iPhone
all you have to do is just change the
output on the iPad or iPhone which is
awesome sadly not everything in the
powerbeats 3 is perfect this is the
carrying case that came included with
the powerbeats2 it's a clamshell design
that offers front protection from water
in minor bumps and has a reliable zipper
that never gets caught this is the
silicon coin purse you get with your
powerbeats 3 it offers a little
protection compared to the last and it
feels like it's a cost-cutting measure
if I'm paying $200 for some earbuds
I want a quality case aside from the
case the power beats 3 are big
improvement the fast fuel battery life
and sound quality improvements or what
make these earbuds appear to the power
beats to the new w1 chip and the
seamlessness it offers is super cool if
you're in the market for new your buds
you can't go wrong with the power beats
3 if you don't want to drop 200 bucks on
your buds and you're okay with the
shorter battery life and let's sound
quality while you work out then pick up
a pair of power beats to 400 bucks if
you already have the power beats to and
you're flying with them then you don't
have to rush out and get the new ones
links for both will be posted below if
you want to pick up a pair of earbuds
we'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
