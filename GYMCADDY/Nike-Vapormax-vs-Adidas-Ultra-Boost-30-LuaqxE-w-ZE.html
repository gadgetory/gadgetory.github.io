amount of hype and publicity when they
first came out because the radical
design Mecca has lost Irvine but a lot
of people keep asking which is better
the Nike Vapor max ready to sold to
boost their both prices same and a lot
of people say the vapor max is magic
answer to adidas runaway hit boost
technology so let's compare the two and
find out
like I mentioned earlier both of these
shoes are priced fairly similar eligible
3.0 usually retailed for 180 while the
vapor max retail for 190 prices might
transcript of colorways and materials
used but both of these shoes are
definitely up there when it comes to
price I'll have links in the description
below if you want to pick up either one
of these shoes let's talk about the
uppers first both these shoes use some
type of new material that make them very
comfortable to wear lightweight and very
reasonable like you uses their fly mitt
which can be found on a lot of other
shoes as always climate is a little
stiffer and helps give the shoe a much
more structured feel adidas on the other
hand uses their primary material which
is much more elastic than Nike Flyknit
adidas primeknit makes for an extremely
comfortable shoe if you're going to wear
the ultra booster quenelle as a casual
shoe but it does leave something to be
desired if you're going to go out
running in them if there's nothing to
like your foot has the proper lockdown
when you run the vapor max also has nike
flywire system that really helps with
the lockdown when you tighten your laces
the fly wire system compresses your
whole foot evenly unlike the cage used
on the ocean coast if you tighten your
laces on the OSHA boost before you go
for a run all you get is a little bit of
pressure on the instep of the foot now
let's talk about the actual boost and
air max units style-wise the vapor max
is very polarized some people love the
look of the new air max units because
they look so futuristic while other
people absolutely hate them because they
look like giant bubbles there's no
missile on vapor max so it's literally
just your foot right on the air max unit
the new Air Max uses a very durable
rubber and there's extra rubber placed
around the unit to help reinforce it
only time will tell how it will actually
hold up the adidas ultra boost on the
other hand has a much more conservative
sole which can be worn almost anywhere
it's also much more low-profile the
loose outsole is also made out of
continental rubber which really helps
with traction and durability
actually wearing either one of these
shoes feels completely different
the Nike Vapor Max has those very bouncy
ride and it does take some getting used
to it also feels really high because the
Air Max units are so thick so it kind of
feels like you're walking on the still I
also mentioned in my initial review
that's a
the airmax units cups the bottom of his
heels feels a little off and after
wearing the shoes daily for almost a
week
it still feels weird the o2 boots on the
other hand have a much more comfortable
and saucer-eyed when you walk in the
ultra boost each step you take doesn't
feel that squishy like the vapor max and
since the also boost midsole has a lower
profile your foot won't get caught when
you're walking up a flight of stairs so
why is the Nike Vapor max size like many
other nike shoes out there they tend to
be a little narrow but they run true to
size likewise whereas the adidas ultra
boost run to the sides but if you want a
slightly snug fit you can always go down
half the size now don't get me wrong the
vapor max is a decent shoe and it's
pretty performance oriented the stiffer
flight net gives us you a very
structured fit and the flour helps with
the lockdown the vapor max is a great
shoe for distance runners that like a
lot of padding but if I want something
where casually and used as a daily
driver I'll be default into Mario
schools
