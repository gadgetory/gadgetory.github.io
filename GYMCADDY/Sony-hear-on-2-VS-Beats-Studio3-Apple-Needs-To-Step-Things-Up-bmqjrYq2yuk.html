videos that I personally think the Saudi
here on 2 or great alternatives for the
B studio 3s
at a lower price before you buy the B
studio threes at least consider the Sony
here on to first sure they might have
some corks but I think you might be
better off with these than the beats
just so you know this isn't a full
review on either these headphones I'm
just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with your purchase decision
if you want to learn more about either
of these headphones watch their full
reviews like I mentioned earlier the
Sony here on - are slightly cheaper than
the Beats Studio threes the B Studio 3
is typically retailed for three $49.99
and the here on to retail for to $99.99
but I got these for - $49.99 and both of
these headphones come in multiple color
ways if you want to pick either of these
headphones up I'll have links or
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deal
possible I suggest you check out the
links coz Sony products routinely go on
sale and it helps that to channel both
of these headphones charge via on my
curios B port and they both have a 3.5
millimeter audio jack for Wired
listening but only the here on two can
be used passively with a wired
connection so even if you want to use a
wired connection with the beats they
have to be powered on but more
importantly the B studio threes come
included with a hard shell carrying case
whereas they here on twos don't they
come with a carrying pouch so if you
plan on traveling a lot with either of
these headphones that's something
important to consider also both of these
headphones can only fold up they can't
be laid flat which might make storing
them in your bag a little harder but
when you pick either of these headphones
up the first thing you'll notice is that
the here on - you are slightly heavier
than the Beats Studio threes they're
here on to your weigh in at 291 grams in
the B studio threes weigh in at 260
grams and that's because the P studio 3
s have been or plastic panels and quite
frankly I feel the build quality on the
beats isn't as good as the Soniya
there's less squeaking and crackling
under here on - when you flex them then
on the beats but keep in mind both of
these headphones are all mostly made out
of plastic and their build quality isn't
as good as the bose qc25 series - now
when it comes to overall design it
really comes down to your personal
preference
they're both stylish and they both come
in multiple standout colors I think they
both look good
but if I had to pick one on looks alone
then I would take the beats over the
here on to their mullah profile but the
biggest design difference between these
headphones are the ear cups the ear
comes on the beats to do threes are
supposed to go over the ears but they
still end up resting on your earlobes
and on the top portion of your ear when
wearing the beats you'll notice your
ears are much more cramped but the ear
cups on the hear on to do a far better
job of engaging your ears they don't
rest on any portion of your ears and
they give you more room there's also
much less padding in contact with your
head when you wear the hear on to the
ear cup design is my favorite feature on
these headphones because it means much
less heat buildup after prolonged use
sessions the here on to are also more
comfortable to wear than the studio
threes and that's because the ear cups
and the Sony's also have more range of
motion than the Beats the beats have
more clamping force and the ear cups on
the beats don't pivot as much so when
you wear them they might cause some
discomfort in the jaw area if you have a
bigger head the ear cup design alone is
one of the main reasons why I prefer the
hear on to you over the Beats Studio
threes and the here auntie will have a
better battery life than the B studio
threes with noise cancellation turned on
but here on to you average 28 hours of
playback time with noise cancellation
turned on while the beats average 25
hours but with noise cancellation turned
off the here on to you are good for 35
hours while the B studio threes are good
for a staggering 47 hours of playback
time and they also have for better quick
charging if you're running low on
battery and if you plug them in for 10
minutes then you'll get 3 hours of
battery life whereas with the Sony's
you'll be lucky if you get 70 minutes
the Beast of your freezer also use the
apples w1 chip and this is a bigger deal
than you might think
with the PC you know the threes you can
easily and quickly switch between either
rehab advices but the Sony here on 2 can
only be connected to one device at a
time so you can't hot-swap so if you
plan on switching from your phone to
your laptop on a regular basis and
you're gonna have to mess around with
the Bluetooth settings every time and
honestly it's pretty annoying I guess
this is why I end up using a wired
connection when I'm going to add a video
on my laptop using the human 2 and it's
also worth noting if you plan on
watching a lot of video with these
headphones then you might be better off
with the beats as well the beats have
almost no delay between video and audio
so everything is
sink whereas the Sony's have just a
little bit of delay it's negligible but
it's still there but if you're using a
premium Android device the hero 2 does
support aptX HD audio so it's a fair
trade-off when it comes to sound quality
between these headphones I have to give
it to the hero to the best of your three
sound decent enough to please your
typical consumer they have a good amount
of bass without being overpowering but
their mids and instrument separation
isn't the best
whereas would be here on to the first
thing you're going to notice is that
they have a much wider soundstage their
mids are much more pronounced and they
have far better instrument separation
and with the here on two you can adjust
the EQ settings through Sony's app you
can either choose from a few pre-made
ones or you can make your own so you can
adjust the sound of these headphones to
better suit your type of music whereas
with the beats you're limited to Apple's
pre-made EQ settings unless you use a
third-party app but what's pretty cool
about the huron 2 is that it has touch
controls on the right ear cup tap or
double tap to play your pause swipe
front or swipe back to skip or go back a
track and swipe up or swipe down to
raise or lower your volume and tap and
hold to activate your voice assistant
the touch controls on the huron to or
easy to use and very accurate wear has
to be studio threes are still using
buttons there's nothing wrong with using
buttons but Sony solution is far sleeker
but the coolest thing about the touch
pad on the huron 2 is quick attention if
you fully cover the touch pad then the
headphones will lower the volume of
whatever you're listening to and they'll
pump in all of the ambient sound so this
way you can talk to someone without
having to take your headphones off
both of these headphones also have
active noise cancellation like I've said
in past videos that ANC on these
headphones is only worth using and
already quiet too violently loud
environments don't get ease of these
headphones if noise cancellation is your
main priority for that you'll want to
look into the Sony 1000x m2 on the beats
you can either have the noise
cancellation turn on or off and they
will automatically adjust depending on
your surroundings
both the Sony you can choose between
having the anc turn off or you can have
it turned on so they'll block out
everything the best they can or you can
also have them pump in ambient sounds
you can still hear your surroundings
when walking around in the city
the ANC and the Sony manages to perform
just a little better than the bass
studio threes but unless you are able to
try them on back-to-back you won't be
able to tell the difference but more
importantly the here on Tuesday any
cabin pressure or causing the discomfort
on your eardrums when a and C is turned
on where has to be studio threes do
cause a little discomfort on your
eardrums you might find yourself trying
to pop your ears when we're in the
studio three sometimes but most people
manage to get used to it
both of these headphones also like to
pick up a wind noise very easily when a
and C is turned on so if you get hit by
a breeze with either of these headphones
then you'll get a sound but the Sony's
does have on wind noise reduction
setting that does help but it then
reduces the amount of sound it actually
cancels out remember this isn't a full
review on either of these headphones I'm
just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with your purchase decision
if you want to learn more about either
of these headphones then watch their
full reviews well like I said in the
beginning I feel the Sony here on - are
a great alternative to the Beats Studio
threes styling aside coz looks are
subjective the here on to sound and fit
much better which are the two most
important aspects to consider when
choosing a pair of headphones the ear
cups on the B studio threes are just so
cramped compared to the open feel of the
ear cups on the hear on to the noise
cancellation on either of these
headphones isn't amazing but the sony's
do manage to do a little better than the
beats like I've said in past videos I
would only consider the B study of
threes if I were going to strictly use
them at the gym the clamping force means
they stay in place very well and they're
very low-profile but otherwise I highly
advise you at least look into the sony
here on - before buying the B studio
threes hey if you enjoyed the video
