what is this like fifth live unboxing
I've lost count but if you're new here
this is a series where I unbox a product
live because personally I find normal
unboxing videos a little boring I get
bored just watching people unbox a
product and then just read off the spec
sheet it doesn't do anything for me but
I think this could be a lot more fun if
we do it live Custance we're doing it
live you guys can interact with me
through the chat and since we're doing
it live you guys are going to get my
live first impressions and raw reactions
cuz they have been times where I've been
completely blown away or disappointed
the first time I unboxed a product and
today we're actually gonna be unboxing
something pretty different for the
channel usually on the channel I do a
lot of headphones
um you know these are these gold candy
course or 360s I love these things and
these are the 1000 X M 2 s no M threes I
love these things but today is a special
live unboxing cuz we're going to be
unboxing the Google pixel 3 now this
Google did send it out you know I'm very
honored and humbled I'm actually very
surprised that I even got this thing but
yeah this is the Google pixel 3 right
here now unlike most other tech
youtubers that you know alright a level
where they can get a new phone every
three to six months and test it out you
know I've actually been rocking this
iPhone 6s plus since I first got it and
I got it reluctantly because before that
I had the HTC One m8 and I'm telling you
guys I loved I love this thing and when
I first switched from the HTC One m8 to
the iPhone 6s plus I think the biggest
thing that I missed from this guy was
the dual front-facing speakers cuz you
know I've always really liked watching
for videos on my phone but then having
to sacrifice that though those dual
speakers was was one of the biggest
letdowns for the iPhone 6s plus but you
know after a while you get used to it
but it's always something that I always
wished that I
miss and I always thought why I really
want those those speakers so anyway
after the success plus I upgraded to the
iPhone tennis match which were a live
streaming off of right now and you know
even though I like it there are a few
things that I would change there's a few
things that you know does bug me about
the iPhone tennis match which I'll go
into that in do a full review which
should be out in about a week or so but
either way this is the Google pixel 3
you guys know what this thing is I've
never seen a product leaked more than
the Google pixel 3 but you know what
we're gonna jump into it okay so I'm
gonna go ahead and oh and also we didn't
just get the Google pixel 3 we also get
the stand and we got I think is a custom
case now if this is custom
I still haven't like looked at it so if
it's like a custom design then we're
gonna experience it together ok so I'm
gonna go ahead and open this guy up
camera and give me a little zoom up in
here ready all right oh hold on wait oh
there's another thing guy my bad and but
what we got oh look at that
now also before I forget we also have
the og Google pixel here this is
actually a camera man's phone and you
know this phone is you know pretty at
the end of its road so we are looking to
upgrade this phone in a few weeks you
might be getting a 1 plus 6 maybe the 1
plus 60 alright so we're gonna go ahead
and
oh man
oh that's nice that's nice okay okay
okay so the first thing now I'm noticing
is this soft touch on material on the
back which is one of the things that
drives me crazy about the new iPhone is
with the success this is metal so
whenever you drop it when you put it in
your pocket or you leave it somewhere
it's gonna stay there and but with the
iPhone tennis max that thing somehow
manages to always make its way out of my
pocket and it's always sliding around a
table and I try to live with it without
a case for a week and a half and I just
couldn't you know I actually had to get
this case for three big reasons that
again I'll go into in the full review
but so so long story short the iPhone
10's max the iPhone 10 those phones just
aren't designed to live outside of a
case because ever since I had the HTC
one I made I've always liked having my
phones naked because I liked feeling the
the premium materials I mean you can see
how like beat up this HTC one I made and
you know personally I don't really care
that it gets damaged because I feel it
tells a story but but with the iPhone
10s you just you just can't you just
can't have that phone outside of the
case it's just not designed to but this
phone this phone I think can can can
live outside of a case cuz it's not a
slippery it's not a slippery and the
edges I'm already noticing is a little
chamfered so it's easy it's much easier
in the hand and hold it and much easier
to hold in the hand
another thing is hold on look at all
that oh look at all that that's pretty
cool alright okay so now you can see
even though the hold on okay so the
pixel three is slightly narrower than
the og pixel but the screen to body
ratio is much nicer and and we have the
dual firing speakers here which which
I'm really excited to have again I
haven't had this ever since the HTC One
m8 so I'm really excited to have that
hold on so um you know what this is
going through like this setup let's just
skip this for now okay oh it's kind of
weird not having any power buttons on
this side okay alright so next up oh
wait actually we got to look what else
is in here
okay so here's that yep okay make a
little sim removal tool oh okay okay
look at that this is gonna go up on the
wall of stickers let's see what else all
right in the meantime do we have any
questions going on there how much did it
cost
no um so like I might write a beginning
of this video Google sent this out and I
don't do phones on the channel but I'm
very excited that they sent this out cuz
I've already started working on a video
with the iPhone tennis match now my
review isn't going to be super technical
or all about benchmarks cuz everybody
else has done that my review is going to
be more what's it like upgrading from
this phone jumping up to the iPhone 10s
max because there's a lot of people who
still have who've held on to their
iPhone 6s plus
iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8 pretty much
because there wasn't a big reason to
upgrade from those phones cuz let's say
this this is my iPhone 4s this is the
the last iPhone before Steve Jobs passed
away
when when when I first got this phone
this was from a time when people were
whenever they saw you with a new phone
they would go oh my god is that the new
iPhone or let me try it out let me try
it out and then and then like they were
like take it from you because they just
wanted to see what this thing was all
about and now we we don't see that as
much because with the iPhone Tenace max
people they would go oh you got the new
iPhone they'll go check out their own oh
okay oh the cameras a little nicer and
then just give it back it's not as big
of it's not as much of a big deal so
that's kind of the concept I'm trying to
go with it's like what's the like
upgrading from this three or four year
old phone up to the this new flagship so
so so that that's the concept I'm going
with that video you're gonna see b-roll
shot with the iPhone tennis max and
b-roll with the iPhone success so I'm
gonna try to make that different to make
it try to make it interesting so so yeah
so anyway let's go back here what do we
got here alright so okay so these are is
the pixel bytes well though the wired
ones and they're very very similar to to
the to the air pot-stirrer what's going
on here hold on what is going not that
hard you can do it you think that right
hold on is this like a test what
hold on I'm like I'm gonna end up
cutting something hold on wait whoa
what's going on here Anais why am I
feeling so bad
hold on yep there you go finally all
right why am I feeling something okay so
we got the ear so we got the pixel but
is this adjustable yes yes it is
adjustable okay all right cool all right
but this is this feels very much this
feels very much
now I haven't even taken the air pee
the ear pods out of my case because you
know since I have ear pods don't really
need them but yeah they're yeah they're
super they're pretty much one of the
same okay all right so here you got the
USB C cable for charging okay and again
soft touch going on there and we've got
the dongle all right so you you would
think that this dongle wouldn't be a big
deal and four four four four average
people who are just like using their
phones and they have Bluetooth earbuds
and they have bluetooth headphones I
don't think having an audio jack or a
dongle is going to be missed but as a
content creator having that dong have
not having that dongle is is a huge
letdown because right now we're live
streaming with the 10s max and in order
for me to hook up the microphone I had
to go out and buy my own dongle because
for some reason the Tennis Masters
didn't have that dongle so so that
that's one of them might that's one of
the small things that did peeve me and
here we go again we got a we got a USB
wall charger and
the cool thing about Google is that
you're actually going to get fast
charging with their phones
whereas with Apple you're gonna have to
pay like an extra $80 total to get fast
charging because you got to go out buy
an adapter buy a USBC cable so it's an
it's an $80 upgrade for something that's
pretty standard with most other Android
phones and here it's like small things
like that that you know does get
annoying about Apple all right so what
about here we got this with that all
right do we have you know the document
we got oh no this is no no here's the
iPhones it's all this is all white it's
all very similar to one another easier
confusing
all right we're back we're back okay
we're back we had a little freaking
Wi-Fi hold on okay so actually we're
gonna open this up because we still have
been open that up already
so is this okay what is this that is is
this a Banksy that's not a big see
what's a Banksy had some artist Natalie
just shred his art at auction a few days
ago okay hold on that's 19 pixel her
brain what is this Hebrew Hebrew Ben all
right well um to be honest well I
expected maybe like teen pixel maybe
like the Google logo um it looks nice
but not my style
but either way I do think this is one of
those phones that you will be able to
then you will be able to UM use without
without a carrying case I like the new
10s unless they're unlike the new iPhone
10s so all right case thank you very
much but not my not my style
okay all right now next stop Dan we're
gonna check out the pics will stand now
this was also a surprise now it's kind
of weird how there were like so many
leaks about the Google pixel first a
pixel 3xl leaked out a whole bunch and
then after that was done leaking the
this this the pixel three started to
leak and then as we got closer and
closer to the event the pixel stand
started to leak and even with all these
leaks Google still managed to keep their
Google the home hub is that the home hub
a surprise the pixel the their new
laptop was still a
Stan's surprise so we got to see what
else is coming up okay here we go all
right so yeah hold on oh it's coming in
it just fell out okay all right okay oh
you know what I should have brought I
should have brought up my gogo whole
mini I love that thing it's downstairs
okay okay
nice nice
now I can say this build quality
I like I like this design and build
quality a little bit more than dear
Logitech what's it called the Logitech
powerup Matt I did a review on it a few
back in August
honestly I got that so I could practice
using this slider that I got then over
over the long run I didn't like but oh
cool we got oh shoot we got another
faster hearing but this is this is like
so Google like just a design so like we
not weird streamlined that's no not not
streamlined not streamlined Apple's
design is more streamlined Google's can
be a little bit out of the box sometime
especially with their pixel 3xl with
that huge huge huge notch all right can
we open it is this another test
just another man okay so is this longer
I just look this up longer I'm probably
gonna be using I'm probably going to be
using this case this cable for my my dad
oh okay yeah this is way longer than the
other case now partially I don't really
care for wireless charging in a phone
for a few reasons
wireless charging just isn't as fast as
charging with a wire
and also you can't use your phone and
charge your phone at the same time so
that's kind of a big deal from him um
but so what else another thing about
wireless charging is that in order that
wireless charging you can't have a metal
back which is one of the reasons why the
10s doesn't have a metal back has a
glass back and is one of the biggest
things I miss from my 6s plus now this
is a glass back and they have some type
of soft touching on it so it's still
going to be able to wirelessly charge Oh
actually let's hook this up let's see I
haven't been able to sign in on that but
let's see if we have like an animation
here or something all right
is this adjustable no no but there's a
very like just like actually this this
is the same size as done has the same
footprint as the Google whole minion and
it has a rubber bottom so this thing is
now going anywhere
now this doesn't adjust so that's one of
the one of my small gripes with that new
in charging that operate charging that
the and that Logitech came out with what
okay there we go all right cool
all right but since we're not logged in
here I can't really do much with it just
yet
let's see starts in free set up next
well done
password
well okay well I'm going to get used to
this small screen in general is kind of
jarring because like again I've been so
used to having a plus device I got put
in the wrong password I've been so used
to using a plus device and so password
yeah what's up ask me questions they
have a little bit of latency so the
orient amazing the Sunrisers are good
dome sign eyes are 4.50 BTN sees all
right so we connected yeah okay okay
next checking for updates this is
probably going to take a little bit of a
while just may take a few minutes up
okay no don't copy I haven't had an
Android device since that I'm eight so I
don't have anything that I really want
here we have any more questions from the
people's I have more questions guys next
three
yes sure I don't know what I'm gonna
green to you I probably just like Google
have my firstborn I'm just cooking yes
on everything
hold on can we get in here real quick
definitely definitely at the pixel three
feels much more it feels premium but not
as sharp as dumb as the og pixel when
I'm done you when I'm done reviewing not
reviewing but making my video on the
iPhone sentence max I'm going to be
using this as my daily driver make a
make your video on this and then you
know depending on how I'm feeling I'm
probably just gonna be switching back
and forth I am really liking this this
Oh hold on I've cared and carrier with a
QR why is this asking for a QR code @ k
@ q ik I skip unlike unlock okay so to
use something
all right so we're gonna set up the
fingerprint sensor now honestly just a
sensor again I do miss having a
fingerprint sensor it's it's it's much
more foolproof and much more direct than
face idea because something because face
ID maybe three because face idea is kind
of like Wi-Fi when it works great you
don't think about it but that one it
doesn't work you're just like oh man
what's going on
why couldn't why can't this be better
squeeze squeeze
Oh squeeze okay hold on
what's up just enter in the back it's a
lot smaller oh that's here always on
display anything else thinks we'll do
this later
how is it oh yeah yeah the fingerprint
sensor here is much smaller they're all
set everything okay
all right there we go all right hold on
what is this I still gotta you know I've
been I haven't used Android in a few
years so I'm very excited hold on
so I'm very excited to to like see what
Andrey is all about again because okay
so yeah there you go there's a Google
pixel three it is the og pixel not not
bad to screen the screen is much much
nicer what's going to the other pixel
have it's a set and I said is an LED
screen right I'm not sure because
there's an oh oh
right and hold on how do we navigate
through this I kind of feel like a baby
deer walking for the first time I don't
really know like what suppress okay
oh what's gonna save up occasions video
portrait do we have how do we get the
camera - I think you just gotta put it
yeah I don't I still got a good start
using this again I'm gonna be I'm gonna
be I'm definitely gonna start using this
pixel three and see what androids all
about again you know cuz I'm not I'm not
I'm not an Apple fanboy I try to not
fanboy on anything cuz really I get no
benefit from fanboy with one company or
another cuz you know I went from an
iPhone and then I thought this is too
small and I'm and I want some of the
other features the these Android devices
have so I upgraded to a samsung galaxy
s5 and before I had this iPhone I had a
droid enjoyed incredible and before the
Droid Incredible I had this droid
whoever members destroyed it remembers
this so I had this I stretched on to the
goo HTC Incredible then you know
everybody was like iPhone iPhone iPhone
so I got the iPhone it was okay upgraded
to the samsung galaxy samsung galaxy s5
didn't really like it because i'm not a
big fan of TouchWiz and I'm still not a
fan of touch ways today and even though
even though I could have gotten let's
say us galaxy s 9 or a note 9 one of the
reasons I didn't want to get a Samsung
device is because Samsung isn't really
good at upgrading and updating their
products their their phones so like
after six or seven months you know your
updates just are almost non-existent so
then so I traded in so I traded in the
Galaxy s5 and I got the HTC One m8 and
again I think this is one of my favorite
phones that I've ever had because at the
time it was at the time it was top notch
but also since it was HTC and not a lot
of people knew about it and then when it
time and when it came to upgrade HTC was
at that point where they started their
decline so I said you know I don't want
to get an HTC because I don't know I
don't like the direction that they're
going and then I also said I don't want
to get a samsung galaxy s7 I think it
was a 7 because at that time a Samsung's
phone they weren't medaled they were
still plastic and after using the HTC m8
for a while aye-aye-aye
I fell in love with the metal case so at
that time my only option was going to be
the iPhone 6s plus and you know I got
the iPhone 6s plus
I kept it until a few weeks ago and you
know this iPhone is kind of special to
me because I started making videos with
this phone so and so when it came to
upgrading it wasn't about all I had an
iPhone before I'm gonna get another
iPhone now upgrading came because I said
you know workflow could be easier
because I could record on the iPhone and
then get those files and just use
airdrop to pass those files to the to
the iMac so it's more of an so it's more
of a workflow thing but I was looking
into getting a pixel 3 XL but but
overall again it came down to a work to
workflow thing because like since I use
pages
I can start a script on the iMac and
then move that script over to my phone
if I need to go somewhere I can work on
my script to wherever I'm at
and just when I'm done writing the
script there I can just transfer it over
you know it's much easier and again in
the files the videos the pictures if I'm
using the iPhone I could just do stretch
it over to the iMac but now that I got
the pixel in a pixel three you know I'm
gonna be able to see what what this is
all about see what what androids are all
about what were you in 2018 so so yeah
all right so we've got anything else
we're all set all right wait the screen
curved has a swing curved no no and
actually I don't like that on on
Samsung's devices because I feel like
you're getting robbed of real estate Oh
fingerprint just didn't work
oh no I did a lot of wrong finger I got
a there we go that's fast that's one of
the things I actually don't like about
sensing devices that censor screen is
curved and it curves over this way I
always see like this glare here so so
like this glare here so I'm not a fan of
the curved screen on the Samsung that's
not so but no this screen is flat and
the glass the glass curves over a little
bit but the screen itself is flat oh you
got anything else before we head out the
camera show off the camera what are you
alright let's let's take a picture where
should we take a picture huh let's take
a picture of the stick
okay and now Ben I mean you can't really
see much let's let's see how do we go
back okay we go back there okay hold on
weeds take a picture of this cuz we got
a look at them out we got to go to mind
the stuff going on here
okay apparently one thing I definitely
want to do test out is going to be the
low-light performance of this of this
phone hold on can we how do we adjust
the brightness of this here yeah I got
it there you go
this seems a little bit a lot a lot
saturated but again I still I'm still
getting to know this phone so yeah
alright yep nope that's not yes to have
no idea what I'm doing but I'm gonna use
this phone to three weeks maybe a month
get to know it for real then put out a
nice little video on this alright we're
all set one more question how do you
keep your headphones from overheating in
the hot summer day in your car
what do you mean like it says overheat
in the meaning of the way the whole
