through its iPhone 10s refresh cycle as
in it's not all that different from the
previous JBL charge three but there are
some small but significant changes under
the hood on the new charge four here's
what's new and what I like about the new
JBL charge four and you really need to
upgrade if you really have the JBL
charge three money wise the new JBL
charge four retails for the same hundred
and fifty dollars at two previous charge
three used to retail for and JBL is also
going to be offering the new charge four
in a staggering ten different colorways
if you want to pick either of these
speakers up I'll have links to
description below and if you use the
links who really helps out to channel I
highly suggest you check them out
because you never know when these
speakers might go on sale she might get
lucky and also chair learn more shelf
down below design wise the torch for
looks practically identical to the
charge three they both have fabric
bodies a row of control buttons up top
all battery gauge on a space and expose
passive radiators on each side the both
even rockin the same ipx7 rating meaning
that they're both waterproof up to 30
minutes and one meter of water and they
both have the same advertised battery
life of twenty hours but if you look
closely there are a few differences
between the charge for in charge three
first up is the proportions the charge
for is slightly bigger and wider than
the charge three and truly looks like a
shrunken down extreme - but proportions
aside the first most obvious in
significant difference between the
charge for in charge three is going to
be under its rubber prominent the new
charge four charges via a USB C port and
still keeps the audio jack and USB a
output that was present on the previous
charge three and I think this is great
like I've said in previous videos if
your product is launching in late 2018
it better have USB C charging and the
charge for also comes included with the
new USB a two USB C charging cable
offers for JBL but unfortunately it
doesn't come with the wall adapter and
although it's not a big deal I don't
know why JBL is chipping out on this
because previously they didn't now
regarding this new USBC port
unfortunately it can only be used for
charging the charge for you cannot use
it or charge your own devices and you
cannot use it as a wired connection and
I think this is a huge messange a
yells part I think would have been
awesome if you could use this USB C port
for more than just charging but still I
think it's still good on JBL as part cuz
you can still charge your own devices
through the USB a port and they still
kept that audio extra if you really need
that wired connection you can still have
it because in comparison the new boom
and mega boom 3 don't have audio jacks
and although personally I don't mind it
I still feel larger speakers like these
should still have it another major
difference between the torch 3 and
charge 4 is going to be their batteries
the charge 3 has a 6000 million power
battery whereas the charts for has a
slightly larger seven thousand five
hundred million power battery but both
of these speakers have an advertised
battery life of 20 hours both the volume
set at 80% the torch for Minister
average 11 hours playback time but
perhaps the biggest difference on the
charge for from all of JBL other
portable speakers is going to be its new
speaker set up the torch 3 has dual two
inch diameter front with firing
transducers and dual passive radiators
on his side
the smaller four also has a similar dual
transducer and dual passive radiators
setup and even the larger extreme 2 has
dual front were firing transducers and
dual passive radiators and an additional
dual tweeters now even though the torch
for still has dual passive radiators on
each side instead of dual transducers it
has a single 2 by 3.5 inch transducer
that's been offset to the right now even
though the charge for is moving from a
dual channel setup to a single
transducer setup it hasn't negatively
affected with performance compared to
the charge 3 but now we're going to jump
into a sound test and then I'll let you
know what I think about the charge for
sound quality
drift away
with the flow
falling down from the sky
just like all of JBL's other newer
speakers starting with the post three
the JBL tours 4 has a neutral sound
signature with just the right amount of
based in trouble that should keep most
people happy
even though instrument separation
clarity and soundstage between the Torah
story and charge for stay relatively the
same the biggest difference between the
charge 3 and charge for sound quality is
going to be the bass the charge for has
significantly more bass than the charge
3 and as a result says you can feel the
music more it's more fun to listen to
music with the charge forward then the
charge 3 and this is why even though the
choice for has a larger battery than the
Taurus 3 it still has the same battery
life the charge 4 is now a 30 watt
speaker whereas the charge 3 is a 20
watt speaker now even though I do enjoy
the charge for his added bass for a lot
of people including myself it's not
going to merit upgrading from the charge
3 now even though the new charge for is
putting out more power than the charge 3
it doesn't get any louder than the
charge 3 obviously it's going to get
louder than the flip floor and distort
less at higher volumes but I think that
charge 4 is using all that extra power
to produce a richer and deeper bass and
personally I think that's perfectly fine
regarding bluetooth the Taurus for has
been upgraded from Bluetooth 4.1 to
Bluetooth 4.2 and just as you'd expect
lose connection on the speaker is stable
and doesn't cut out and just like before
the speaker can be connected to multiple
devices at the same time which is good
but unfortunately if you're an iPhone
user the charge for still has a little
bit of urgency so this speaker isn't the
best for watching youtube videos on your
phone and just like JBL's or other newer
portable speakers the charge for is
rockin JBL connect plus and this is one
of the biggest reasons why I like JBL
speaker so much it's the easiest and
fastest way to pair multiple speakers
together you literally just press one
button on your speaker and the speakers
will figure out the rest by themselves
you don't have to open any other apps
and the speakers are always stay in sync
it just works and for those wondering
unfortunately the torch for in charge 3
can only be paired up in sync you cannot
get them to play in left and right
stereo mode even though they're both
charged models and
very similar JBL silenced us on you
having to of the exact same speakers if
you want to get left and right stare
remote going and personally I just think
this is ridiculous
but it's whatever and regarding the rest
of it yet there really isn't much going
on I'm still waiting for JBL to add some
adjustable EQ settings that get uploaded
directly to their speakers but besides
that there's really no reason to open
JBL speaker app unless you have a pulse
three or two of the exact same speakers
and you want to get them in stereo mode
but overall like I said at the beginning
of this video the JBL charge four is
going through it's iPhone 10s refresh
cycle there really isn't anything
totally new on the charge four and
there's no reason to upgrade from the
charge three especially since the charge
where you got that far more up to a few
months ago for JBL connect plus but
don't get me wrong I do like them to
charge for has more based on the toy
story and I do like that the charge for
now has USB C charging but other than
that there's are no major differences
between the charge three and towards
four but still the JBL charge four still
keeps his title as one of the best
midsize speakers out there it sounds
good it has a good battery life and is
pretty adorable and I wouldn't be
surprised if the next JBL for five is
right around the corner with a similar
single chances to set up and USB C
charging personally I would have made
the choice for more interesting by
throwing in at least a single tweeter
and fast charging and maybe it's time
for JBL to introduce a new wireless
charging accessory for their speakers if
you made it this far I guess you enjoyed
the video so hit that like button and
get subscribed it helps out more than
you realize support the channel by
clicking on the links down below and
I'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
