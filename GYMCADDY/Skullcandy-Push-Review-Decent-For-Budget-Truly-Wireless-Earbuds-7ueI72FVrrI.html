second half of 2018 first the released
her new school candy venues their first
ANC headphones they released her new
school candy crush her 360s currently my
favorite abase had headphones and now
they released their skull candy push
their first truly Wireless here but and
considering their price point they're
not half bad they're a good option for
an Android or iPhone user looking to go
truly Wireless without having to spend
the big bucks
but they do bring some compromises but
first a word from one of our partners
before I started using nor VPN I would
never use public Wi-Fi cuz I didn't want
to risk having my data exposed which
meant any time I traveled or wasn't a
dead zone in the city I would have a
little to no internet on my phone but
now with no one VPNs military-grade
encryption I can use public Wi-Fi and
know that my dad it is safe from would
be hackers nor VPN can do a lot more but
this is one of the main reasons I use
them so you can enjoy three years of
online security for only $2.99 a month
by clicking on the link in description
down below the new Skullcandy push truly
wireless earbuds have a retail price of
$130 but on launch day they're already
on sale for $100 so take that as you
will personally I do hope to Skullcandy
push continue to go for $100 cuz there
are a lot of other companies starting to
put out more truly wireless earbuds add
sub hundred all the price points namely
Jem jlabbe and anchor and for
comparison's sake the Apple earpods have
a retail price of $160 but if you want
to pick either of these earbuds up I'll
have a link so description below and if
you use the links it really helps out to
channel now like I just mentioned there
are a lot of other subhanaw taala truly
wireless earbuds out there but I feel
the Skullcandy push warrants they're
slightly higher price tag because they
have a slightly better build and a
slightly better user experience over
they're more affordable competitors even
though my not seem like a big deal to
some the pushes charging cases using USB
C and seeing USB C on a pair of
budget-friendly wireless earbuds is
great because if your phone charges with
a USB C port you can charge your phone
and earbuds with the same cable there
is one of the biggest reasons why people
love their pot so much even me
now the earbuds themselves have an
advertised battery life of six hours and
the case can supply an additional six
hours of battery giving these earbuds a
combined the battery life of twelve
hours of playback time now a combined
battery life of twelve hours isn't
amazing compared to other truly wireless
earbuds but these earbuds continuous six
hours of playback time is because ear
pods top out at five hours and most
other bargain brands top out at around
three hours of playback time and I've
noticed that I can go two days in
between charges with these ear buds but
for comparison when my ear pods were new
I could go about four or five days in
between charges but now since the
battery is on my two-year-old ear pods
have the graters officer really I can
only go about two days in between
charges with them now battery
degradation is normal for all
electronics but what I do want to point
out about these truly wireless earbuds
is that they don't have fast charging
and not a lot of other truly wireless
here buzz besides ear pods have any
meaningful fast charging and fast
charging for wireless earbuds is very
important if you plan on going on long
commute with them on a regular basis so
just keep that in mind if you plan on
picking up a pair of truly wireless
earbuds in general now when it comes to
the overall to build quality of the case
it's decent for a pair of hundred thirty
all other wireless earbuds now the only
thing I'm worried about concerning this
case is accidentally snapping off the
lid but other than that I think this
carrying case is on par of that of the
Sony WF SP 700 N and j-bird run
especially since the case magnetically
attaches to the earbuds something that
Sony's and Jabir's cases don't do and
it's one of those small important
details you miss when you don't have it
anymore but definitely what are the
biggest drawbacks of this carrying case
is its sheer size it's huge compared to
the earpods case and given this size I
do wish they've held more than just six
additional hours to playback time and
now let's get to the ear buds themselves
when I first took them out I was
reminded of the Sony WF SP 700 n their
build quality is decent and I really
like how low-profile they are compared
to a lot of wireless here but I've
mentioned so far now these are in your
earbuds and they come with an additional
two pairs of silicone ear tips but
interestingly enough you don't get any
additional orphans and the ear friends
on the buzz themselves aren't
moveable and personally I wish we could
at least remove these your friends I
just feel it could get in the way for
some people well regardless when it
comes to fit these your buds stay in
place very well and they produce a very
good seal and since they're so
lightweight and low-profile they never
work allowed but the most important
thing the Skullcandy push get right is
their bullet-tooth connectivity the rock
and bluetooth for to but more
importantly their Bluetooth connection
is much better than a lot of other truly
wireless earbuds I've tested in the past
cuz you never get any crackling or
stuttering if you move your head from
side to side or if your phone's in your
pocket or if you cover the master here
about it now you might get some
stuttering if there's a wall between the
earbuds and your phone but it's still
very good and these earbuds also have a
very little latency when watching videos
on your iPhone it's still there but it's
much less than most other truly wireless
earbuds that orange air pods but
unfortunately the Skullcandy push don't
have Aptech support which only matters
for Android users cuz iPhone insists on
still using the AAC codec but I also
noticed the Skullcandy push did have a
considerable amount of latency when
watching videos on my pixel 3 so Android
users just be warned but when it comes
to sound quality and just be warned
easier buds have a lot of bass I think I
can confidently say these are some of
the bass heavy as well as here but I
ever tested the air pods you also have a
lot of bass but nowhere near as much as
the push and some people might like that
and others well even though the bass is
fun at times it does tend to overpower
the mids a lot but more importantly the
highs on these earbuds never crash or
get tinny which is good and typically
does tend to happen on Cheaper earbuds
now one of the things that always drew
me away from truly wireless earbuds was
the lack of physical media controls you
always ended up only having partial
media controls and had to rely on your
voices system to do the rest which isn't
always the most efficient the Skullcandy
tried their best to give you full media
controls with their new earbuds
by having a multi-purpose button on each
ear but first I want to say that they
know the actuation pressure on these
buttons you don't have to press so hard
on these buttons to get them to work
which means they don't dig into your ear
canal
the j-bird run deal which is good now
you can play or pause your music by
pressing once and either your buddy and
you can adjust the volume up by double
pressing on the right ear bud and if you
want to lower the volume you can double
press the left your button now a
decision as efficient as I like it to be
and I found is still easier to adjust
your volume directly from your phone but
if you want to skip a track you can
press and hold on the right ear but for
3 seconds and if you want to restart a
track you can press and hold the left
ear bud for 3 seconds and if you want to
summon your voice assistant you can
triple press on either ear but even
those gold candy tried their best to
bring you physical media controls on
they're truly wireless earbuds I still
think it's pretty clunky I think it
would be better if pressing on either
earbud once played or positive music
double pressing on the right ear but
skip the track double pressing on the
left ear bud went back a track doing a
press press and hold on the right earbud
raise the volume until you released it
doing a press press and hold on the left
here but lower the volume until you
released it and triple pressing on
either ear but summing your voice
assistant but when it comes to phone
calls
I think audio quality is pretty good now
it's not as good as air pods but it is a
little better than even some headphones
but just like most of the truly wireless
earbuds the phone call is only coming
through the master in this case but
overall if Skullcandy decides to keep
selling their truly wireless earbuds for
100 dollars I think they're a decent buy
at that price like I've said in the past
I've always shied away from truly relics
here but especially for the gym because
their battle life wasn't always great
their cases were typically pretty clunky
connection stability was always an issue
you had to give up your online
controller but most importantly they
were pretty expensive wireless earbuds
from big-name companies typically retail
for $150 and up that's why I still
prefer to just use wired Bluetooth
earbuds at the gym they typically cost
less than truly Wireless here but they
have better connection stability they
have longer battery lives with fast
charging and they have that
all-important in like controller which i
think is essential for when you're
working out but I do like to use truly
wireless earbuds for casual use like ear
pods so I can listen a podcast when I'm
running errands take
phone calls or watch videos with and I
think Skullcandy is targeting the casual
use market with their wireless earbuds
the Skullcandy push all into water or
sweat resistant and the own meant to be
used at the gym
again reinforcing that casual use market
and I think those gold candy push are
better suited for casual use because
unlike the Bose sound sport free the
tapered run and Sony WF SP 700 n which
are very clunky and cost more the push
don't look at a place when you're
wearing them at the checkout line at the
grocery store they also have a very long
continuous playback time of six hours
which should easily last most people
typically use session the Skullcandy
push also have a very above-average
microphone on them making them decent
for phone calls and son store bluetooth
connectivity is very stable and have
very little A&amp;amp;C they're decent for
watching videos on an iPhone and again
remember these are one of the few truly
wireless earbuds that charge via a USB C
port which just complements your new
Android device beautifully if you made
it this far I guess you enjoyed the
video so hit that like button and get
subscribed it helps out more than you
realize
