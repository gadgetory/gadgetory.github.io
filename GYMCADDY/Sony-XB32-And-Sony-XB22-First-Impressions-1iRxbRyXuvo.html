first impressions video today we're
gonna be unboxing the Sony XP 22 and
sony xba-40 2 portable bluetooth
speakers now I think this first
impressions video is going to be pretty
important for a few reasons
when these speakers were first announced
at CES 2019 a lot of people including
myself were kind of disappointed that
tech spec wise these speakers don't look
any different from the current Sony XP
31 and sony xba-1 speakers and another
major question going on right now is
okay we got the XP 22 and the XP 32 but
is there going to be a Sony XP 42 I mean
there's there's no mention of
replacements for the sony xba-40 one at
this time now from my experience and
analytics Sony's XP 41 speakers up sells
the 32 31 and 21 by a big margin so I
honestly don't get why Sony hasn't even
at least hinted at a sony xba-40 tune so
right now this is all we got and if this
is just a cosmetic change then maybe if
you're looking into getting a speaker
for this summer a Sony speaker you might
be better off going off with the sony
xba-1 or Sony XP 21 or 41 and save
yourself some bucks because these
speakers are now on sale for like 50
bucks or $100 off now since these are
out now but enough talking let's get
into actually unboxing these things and
now let's start off with the one that I
think most people are going to be more
interested in and that's going to be the
sony xba-1 and jump right in now I got
this speaker today at the store and you
know I haven't looked into seeing if
they change the tech specs on this or
what but definitely I'm kind of confused
as to why Sony didn't upgrade the XPS 32
and xB 22
you at least have you as BC like JBL is
doing with their JBL charge for and
their upcoming JBL foot five I mean just
so that you guys know this is the flip
for and not the new flip five but yeah
here's the XP 32 and oh it's it's uh
it's a mix between the V 31 and the old
Sony XP 3 so here on the front this is
all fabric is this the same it looks
like it's a tighter mesh than on the 31
but all of this this is now all just
soft soft touch rubber now one of the
reasons why I like the vxb 31 so much is
because it's a super rugged speaker
since this is all fabric if you take it
anywhere it's not gonna get any bumps or
scrapes it's gonna it's gonna just not
be a problem but with this soft touch
plastic if you take this out to the park
or something this thing is going to
develop scratches over of and over the
period of time that you like you just
take it on the go with you so so I'm
kind of confused as to why Sony kind of
went back and went to the soft touch
material I mean it looks good it still
looks sleek I mean we got this new le
this new led design here but as to going
back to soft touch rubber I don't know
I'm not the biggest fan of that
I think the XP 31 is going to be a much
more rugged speaker than the 32 and the
Sony XP so yeah there we go we powered
on the light we powered on the speakers
and you see that the light strip is on
and the light strip on this speaker has
the same exact design going going on as
the old one you see you like you got the
little lines inside the light strip I
mean it looks good but it's the same as
the 31 and it's on the 32 alright so
back here just like before we've got if
the compartment for ports that's where
we got same exact got it
and it still has a microUSB port for
charging and like I said if if Sony at
least upgraded this speaker to have a
USB C port instead of a microUSB port I
think that would have been a a reason to
upgrade or a reason to go with the 32
over the 31 but right now this just
looks like it's going to be a pure
cosmetic change I mean it looks good
but I don't think it's going to be as
rugged as the sony xba-1
I don't know I mean does this thing have
and it still has the same ip67 rating
the same 24 hour battery life it has
party booster great I mean for those
that I don't know what party booster is
is that if you tap the speaker in like
certain places it's going to do certain
sounds you know that's actually a
feature I forgot the XP 31 had until
like recently I was looking over the
text or something oh yeah that's right
party booster another Sony speaker that
and another Sony feature that I never
use yeah here's the Sony XP and that's
the Sony XP 31 don't get me wrong I
think the sony xba-40 2 looks good but
is I highly doubt is gonna be as rugged
as the sony xba-1 and that was one of
the big reasons why I like two sony
xba-40 one so much it's a super rugged
speaker but it still looks good it has a
built-in light strip has a 24 hour
battery life
it sounds decent enough and if you can
get it on sale for like a hundred bucks
that's that's a great value right here
but for this right now it's kind of hard
for me to recommend the 31 over the 32
but you know what let's go ahead and
jump into the Sony XP
tech specs or the same they've got the
same speaker setup they have the same
battery life or if if I'm correct what
do you got you got a 12 hour battery
life yeah this has a 12 hour battery
life and let's see yeah it still has
a microUSB port for charging again I
just think that it's kind of weird I
just think that Sony Sony's speaker
division is kind of not communicating
with their headphone division like let's
say for example the sony xba-1 hundred i
just did a review on these a few i think
two weeks ago that video came out you
can watch it right here hopefully i
remember to plug that thing in so yes so
this is the sony xba-1 hundred and these
headphones have me pretty excited for
the what i think is going to be called
just sony xba-1 thousands the sony
xba-40 enones
replacement now the reason why I like
these headphones so much is because they
they've been redesigned from the ground
up compared to the 650 BTS
I think this design looks much better
but there's also some technical
improvements like we've got we've got a
USB C port for charging these have a
voice assistant integration these these
these headphones actually connect to
Sony's headphones app whereas these
didn't show with the Sony's with Sony's
headphones app you can go in and you can
adjust the bass level on these
headphones you can adjust what else you
can change the sound positioning of
these headphones which again is another
Sony feature you never use and you can
also have Google assistant or Elektra
Gration on these headphones so so you
can see that Sony is really has really
been improving on their headphones
because you know right now everybody's
favorites Premium ANC headphones or the
1000 XM threes so I just think that
Sony's product divisions aren't you know
communicating because they're not
getting out the park with their
headphones Sony's doing great with their
cameras I mean for disclosure I shoot
only on Sony cameras but their speakers
there's really no difference from this
first impressions video from the speak
to this speaker - just the design and
you know like I said we want to see us
BC charging on this fast charging would
have been great to see on this speaker
maybe changing the speaker layout would
have been interesting as well
why now Sony needs to improve their
Wireless party chain that's always been
a pain in the butt but actually quick
quick note first impressions here we go
the light feature on the sony xba-4 on
the sony xba-1 hold on let me see if we
can power this on real quick yeah I
don't know if you can see that but this
this some light feature is much brighter
than the and then the 21 so that's nice
but but again there's really no no big
tech spec difference because under the
hood everything is the same but you know
what we're gonna go ahead pair these
speakers up to my phone we're gonna
check out the Fiesta Bowl app on the
sony xba-40 - and then do a very
rudimentary sound test just to see if
they sound any different at all and
we're back so I just hooked up the
speaker's over to my phone and I've got
the Sony Music Center app open here now
it just as before we've got the same
settings you can go in and change the
sound you can mess around with the you
can select for me if you accused that
they have or you can make your own all
just just like before undo let's
actually go ahead and put this back on
extra bass mode and you also got the
different illumination options so that
when you're playing music
it changes the behavior of the lights I
wonder if it's changing they're know all
that hold on so right now it's on rave
we're gonna put it on let's leave it on
rave and let's actually go ahead oh wait
just for you guys
for huto for those who don't know about
party booster tap settings on let's how
do we drum kit okay
done all right so it's just going on
here comes party booster guys again
again that's another Sony feature that I
doubt anybody actually uses but you know
comment down below if you use um Sony's
party booster feature let me know but
let's go over to the Fiesta ball app
illumination with this here you can
actually have some control over the
lights on your speaker now the Fiesta
Bowl app used to be and exclusive for
the sony xba-40 one the larger ones but
now the smaller XB 32 supports possible
cool but it makes me a little nervous
does that mean that the that there isn't
gonna be a next be 42 and the XB 32 is a
replacement for the XB 41 I hope not I
hope that's not the case because this
thing is not going to be able to compete
against the JBL extreme - you know cuz
right now that's that's the bet I think
that's the best speaker you can get
right now if you're looking for a
portable Bluetooth speaker you know a
large one JBL
extreme 2 is the way to go if you you
plan on getting multiple speakers like a
charge like a charge 4 or 5 but let's go
ahead and do a quick quick little sound
test see if we've got something hold on
ok so we're gonna do a very basic sound
test so that an official sound test but
I just want to see if there's any sound
difference between these two speakers
because you know tech spec wise they
have the same exact speaker setup so see
let's see if there's any like tuning
their friends both of these speakers are
running extra bass mode and they're both
playing at the same volume so let's see
what we've got
so first of all we're gonna start off
with xB 32 okay all right
as we wait for the smoke clear and you
are trans in the air I know that we can
rise together touch the Stars I know
that we will see
who's coming
they sound exactly the same what do you
think yeah they sound very they sound
very alike
there hasn't been like any major
differences here now both of these feel
like I said both of these speakers are
running extra base the the extra base
mode EQ they're both have they're both
set at the same volume but they don't
sound they don't sound any different now
obviously I'll in the full review
there's going to be an official sound
test with better mics and you know but I
don't know they don't sound any
different so yeah like like I said at
the beginning of this video right now
it's looking like if you're looking into
getting a Sony speaker for the spring or
the summer I think you're probably
better off picking up the sony xba-1
because it's going to be on sale now
since the XP 32 is out and on personally
I think the XP 31 is going to be a much
more rugged speaker than the Sony XP 32
because the sony xba-40 2 has gone back
to that soft touch rubber outer outer
shell one of the biggest problems with
the older Sony XP 30 X be 40 and XP 20
was wet it was that when you took them
out if you took them to the park or you
took them to the - to the beach or
something this body would get scratched
up like in a lot with the XP 30 ones and
you know this family they don't do that
so that's why I prefer this speaker
design over the speaker design now don't
get me wrong this thing looks good but
it's nowhere
near as its I don't think it's going to
be any any anywhere as as rugged as this
and since these speakers have the same
internals and SPECT expects as these
like I said I think you're probably
gonna be better off picking yourself up
and xB 31 or xB 41 since they're going
to be on sale versus these new speakers
because again it's just a design refresh
I would have liked to at least seen a
USBC port on this speaker but Sony
didn't even throw that in here and I
don't get why when almost all their
other projects are starting to come with
USBC but I guess you guys can expect a
full review on this speaker in about two
weeks or so because right now I'm kind
of busy getting the Jabra elites 85h
video out but yeah that's the first
impressions look on the sony xba-40 2
and sony expeed 22 kind of underwhelmed
and right now it's up in the air if
there's going to be a Sony XP 42 but um
I'll catch you guys next time
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed a house
someone didn't you realize if you want
to pick another part except mentioned in
this video those will be linked in
description down below any girls will
support the channel by checking out the
merch store but other than that I'll get
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
