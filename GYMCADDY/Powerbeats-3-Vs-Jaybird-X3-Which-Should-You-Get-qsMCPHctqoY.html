is better and which should you buy let's
find out first let's address the
elephant in the room
the J products three retail for one
$29.99 while the powerbeats three retail
for one $99.99 after crunching the
numbers and carrying the one that's a
$70 difference that's five two poly
burritos with extra steak and guac the
price difference here can be the
deciding factor for consumers on a
budget and it's certainly giving the
extra leg up here they're both Bluetooth
wireless earphones that are water and
sweat resistant they both have an inline
controller that have a very satisfying
click to them you can pause and skip
tracks answering the client calls
integers volume they both have in your
earbuds they're both made out of plastic
and have a soft touch feel to them and
they both have flat cables that's where
the similarities end
the powerbase three feature on
adjustable your hook and they do an
amazing job is securing them in place no
matter what you're doing the power beats
won't fall out you're given up a total
for silicone ear tips so you can choose
which fits best in your ear canal
unfortunately the silicone ear tips
don't create a good enough seal to keep
the ambient noise out on the other hand
the J Barracks trees come with multiple
ear fins comply your tips and silicone
ear tips you can wear them either in the
under ear or over your style your
friends are an elegant and Co solution
for keeping your ear buds in place
without the need of your hooks I wish I
thought of that the compliant your tips
that come included with jaybird
earphones also do an amazing job of
creating a near-perfect steel in your
ear canal and do a better job of keeping
ambient noise out than the silicone tips
on the power beads unfortunately for
going traditional your hooks in favor
for your friends I mean the ear buds
will occasionally fall out from time to
time if you're being active but nowhere
near as much as a jaybird freedom deal
compared to the power beats ^ is 3 so
much better
they sound clear they have a deeper bass
and a little louder but even though the
power beats 3 sound quality has improved
they don't sound as good as the J bit
extreme you can even adjust the extra
sound to your liking through J / to my
sound app the only way you can adjust
the sound on the powerbase 3 is through
your devices easy Q which pales in
comparison to the my sound app so sound
quality obviously goes to the J Brand X
3 the JBL x3 is using the latest and
greatest in bluetooth technology and you
can even connect them to two devices at
the same time the power beats on the
other hand are using Apple's new w1 chip
that was introduced back in September
when they announced the air pad
the w1 chip certainly gives the power
beats and advantage since they allow for
super easy pairing they offer a stronger
wireless connection with your Apple
devices and they require much less power
which means they help with battery life
the w1 chip also means you can pair with
other Apple devices associated with your
iCloud account seamlessly listening to
music with your power beats on your
iPhone and now you're going to watch
videos on your iPad just switch the
output no need to pair them again both
of these your phones have a range of
about 45 feet from your device with a
clear line-of-sight the power beats did
perform a little better but just by
about 5 feet the table x-rays have an 8
hour battery life and thankfully don't
require an external battery pack like
the freedom's do but in order to charge
these earphones you better not lose a
proprietary charging cradle if you lose
this you're out of luck and even though
jaybird sells replacement charging
cradles for the freedom they don't for
the x3 right now and now the freedom
charging cradle does not fit the
Explorer you I tried the power base
where we have an insane 12 hour battery
life and can be charged by a standard
microUSB cable they also feature fast
fuel which gets you an hour of battery
life for five minutes of charging is
worth noting the xray don't have any
quick charging capabilities and to be
honest fast fuel is great if you forget
to charge your phones like I do in
conclusion there's no clear winner here
both of these your phones are great and
they both have their trade-offs the JBL
x3 are a great choice if sound quality
is super important to you if you want to
save money if you know that your fin
system work great for you if battery
life is in an issue for you or if you're
not interested in quick charging on the
other hand the power piece three are a
great choice if a long battery life is a
must if you have multiple Apple devices
and don't want to constantly have to
pair your earphones if you really hate
when your ear buds fallout and prefer
ear hooks or if quick charging is a must
personally I prefer the power beats for
myself because the infant system don't
work too well with me so I prefer your
hoods a long battery life is a must and
being able to seamlessly switch between
my devices without having to pair them
is really nice but that may not be the
case for you if I could I would ask for
earphones with the body battery life and
quick charging feature of the power
beats 3 with the comply ear tips sound
quality in my sound app from the JBL x3
