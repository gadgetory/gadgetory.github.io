I managed to get my first pair of Yeezys
after taking Elle's on both the bread
and zebra eating a few weeks back and
with summer coming up having an
all-white pair of Yeezys in my
collection means they'll be looking good
at this year's cookout but getting these
Easy's wasn't so easy and I thought I'd
share that story with you guys at first
I tried to get a raffle tickets on my
local finish line store but when I
actually got there with my friends the
clerk told us they ran out of raffle
tickets so we basically went there for
no reason the next day I tried to
reserve my parent on the adidas
confirmed that but when the time came
the adidas confirmed as decided to crash
on him then the next day my friends told
me PacSun was having a raffle and we
made plans to go get raffle tickets
later that day but when we were getting
ready to leave I had to cancel last
minute to do a favor for my mom and I
mean you can't say no to your mom oh
right I wasn't gonna be like sorry mom I
can't do your favor because I have to go
to the mall to get a raffle ticket so
that I can have the opportunity to buy a
pair of shoes but I did manage to get my
raffle ticket from PacSun later that day
after I did that paper but after I got
my raffle ticket I waited all day hoping
to get a call from PacSun but it never
came so I was like damn it I didn't win
the shoes so the next day I got up and I
went to the gym to workout just like I
do every Saturday morning
so I'm bench pressing and I'm making my
way up to my 275 singles and then my
phone rings while I'm working my way out
of the hole and the phone call went a
little like this a young lady says hi
just a Sarah from tax tone I just want
to let you know unfortunately one of the
initial winners of our easy raffle
didn't pick up their pair of a 12 p.m.
today so we had to redraw another winner
and I went with you so after I was
finished with my workout I went home
showered and changed and went to the
mall and pick these guys up so yeah
these are the cream light easy 350 b2
they're super clean and they have that
super iconic silhouette but I really
like the settle textures that play on
the climate of the shoe if you look
really closely the shoes still have that
classic stripe on the side it's not in a
contrasting color well you can see the
change in the texture also the shoes are
in solid white the little off light
hence the name quick down the side of
the shoe your see the stitching and F
stitching is truly
white and hopefully you'll be able to
see the difference on the camera another
subtle texture I like about these shoes
is how does textures meet down the
middle on the back of the shoes you see
the pull-tab without any contrasting
stitching and above that you will see
another pull tab what you need is logo
on it and those three stripes are 3m the
missile of these shoes is also off-white
and you can still see the boost
underneath and on the bottom of the shoe
you can see the cutouts and see more of
the boost material concerning fit these
shoes are little tighter than I expected
these are my first pair of Yeezys and I
get a size 10 and I can see now why a
lot of people say go half a size up
I mean I'm gonna keep getting size 10
years ease but if you have a wider foot
then you should go up half-size but yeah
these are the triple ytz 350 v2 you're
super clean and super dope I just feel
lucky I won the raffle after packs one
had to redraw another winner cuz someone
didn't pick up their parent who knows
these might be my new lucky shoes
actually as I was walking around the
mall after I picked these up some guy
who was holding for Yeezy boxes ran up
to me and said he would give me 400 for
mine he was clearly gonna resell them
and me being me replied not if you want
ease you got to do 600 so what do you
think should I have sold them for 400
how much do you think Capri ytz will
resell for people don't think prices
will go so high because there's so many
of them but comment below and let me
know what you think even if he did offer
me 600 I think I would've still said no
because I just really wanted the easy
maybe if I win the next round easy then
I might we sell those I'm not a huge fan
of the next all the ones to drop but let
me know did you manage to cop the cream
buggy ZZZ or did you take it out and
what do you think about the next color
way that's drop it comment below hey if
