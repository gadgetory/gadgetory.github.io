when it comes to sound quality and
connection speed having a hardwired
connection is the best way to go for now
that's where these come in the Odyssey I
sign time why is your phone coming these
are plain or magnetic in-ear headphones
which quanti looks and it's a price tag
so they want the money let's find out
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe so if you're not an audiophile
then you might not know about the
company Odyssey in short they make high
fidelity headphones for people who want
to get the best sound quality one day
listen to music so that's why these wide
in-ear headphones cost a whopping $400
and the Odyssey I sign 20 which are
slightly upgraded version of the
eyesight 10 go for $600 let's go over
what comes inside the box cuz there's a
lot to cover you get your headphones and
you'll notice they don't have any wires
attached to them you also get a
softshell carrying case that's made out
of weave nylon and what I'm assuming is
faux leather inside the carrying case
you'll find a few things first you'll
notice there are two cables one those in
a minute there's a USB Drive that has
the instruction manual stay down to it
you get a total of three silicon ear
tips three silicon ribbed ear tips two
ear hooks two pairs of ear locks and a
cleaning tool and a cable management
clip both of these cables are flat and
half soft so it's rubber on them but
they have different connectors on them
you'll notice the audio jack cable is
pretty standard and there's no in like
controller or mic on it the other cable
is where things get very interesting
this cable has a lightning jack on it
and also really big in my controller on
it as well there are three volumes
volume up volume down in a multi-purpose
button in the center and doesn't mic as
well but this thing is much more than an
inline controller it's also a deck or a
digital to analog converter basically
what it does is that it amplifies the
signal from the iPhone and converts it
from a digital to an analog signal this
gives you a much better signal and as a
result better sound quality at this
point you might be wondering wait so can
I only use these headphones with Apple
products well remember you get two
cables you get one with the auxiliary
jack and one galanga
although you can use these headphones
with any other product using the unzila
Jack's you get a much better listen in
your experience what's the Lightning
jack cable
that built-in deck they sound better
and/or much louder with the language a
cable unless you're going to be using
your own deck with the other cable but
the deck isn't the reason why the oddity
I signed ten or so special these
headphones are special because they use
planar magnetic technology in
traditional earphones they use a
traditional dynamic driver which
basically is a cone-shaped diaphragm and
voice coil with the magnet behind them
this technology has been around for very
long time and it's cheap to make so
what's the problem the cone-shaped
speaker will produce very inconsistent
sound in various frequencies this is
what causes poor sound quality models
bass and blown out highs when the volume
is turned up high also the style of
speaker will deteriorate over time when
you use them planar magnetic headphones
on the other hand are much more detailed
and they give you consistently good
sound quality no matter at what volume
you're using them and in the past having
planar magnetic headphones meant large
over-the-ear headphones attached to an
and cuz they required a lot of politic
the sound going but now Odyssey managed
to shrink down the technology to what it
is today and thanks to advancements in
technology they don't require as much
power so you can use them with your
phone now so here's the million dollar
question or at least for another
question how do these earphones sound
well to put it simple
sound amazing for starters if you're
going to be using these headphones you
really shouldn't be streaming your music
you should have your music stored
locally on your phone in the highest
quality setting look I did this is
something where you truly have to try it
out for yourself to see how amazing our
Odyssey also has an app for these
headphones you can't do much except for
updating the firmware and you being able
to set you equalizer setups
I really wish they took the j-bert
approach with this app and have multiple
EQ profiles set up and let you download
community generally the EQ profiles as
well but keep in mind the EQ updates
directly through these headphones like
the Jaybirds
so your EQ settings will follow you from
device to device like the zebra next
three do
although the Odyssey eyesight can sound
like nothing I've ever heard before when
it comes to comfort there so so first
the portion actually goes into your ear
canal is a little bigger than other ear
phones on the market I actually had to
use the smallest ear tips with
these earphones when I usually use
mediums with others on the market they
also cause me sore spots from time to
time after our them for long periods
although the I sign 10 are huge they're
very lightweight and when you put them
on they aren't very noticeable one big
disappointment though are the ear hooks
they do a great job of keeping the
earphones in place but they're very
stiff and constantly worried that
they're going to snap I just wish we got
silicone ear hooks like the powerbeats
or silicone infants like the beats X and
J but X 3 because I wasn't able to get
the helix to agree with me either
also even though these are in your
headphones they don't really block out
much ambient noise if any and there's a
lot of sound leakage so if there are
people around you they'll be able to
hear what you're listening to also do
you remember that built in back on the
Lightning jack cable
well it's heavy and it has a tendency to
pull out your headphones as you're
moving up thankfully Odyssey included a
cable management clip and what I did was
attach it to the bottom of the deck and
I clip it to my shirt and you had it an
easy fix
so are the artists II I sang 10 worth
$400 absolutely making planer magnetic
in your headphones is no easy feat but
should you get them well unless you're
somebody who needs to have the best
sound then no remember although these
headphones sound incredible they score
very so so in the comfort department and
they don't really do well when it comes
to noise isolation and there's a lot of
sound Likud's but they're designed that
way so you'll want to listen to these in
a private environment and they're now
waterproof so it's not like you can work
out with them the oddity I sign 10 is a
very precise piece of hardware there's a
very specific time and place for it
