another shoe review for you guys and
that's the adidas white nmd with the gum
outsole
just like many of you I took an elven
trying to get the pirate black and zebra
easy boost 350 b2 so instead I grabbed
these off of a d2 site adidas is
periodically restocking these from time
to time so you just have to be patient
and check back every so often if you
want to get yourself a pair since these
are prime minute they will run you 170
bucks but they're worth it if you ask me
also fun fact the picture on the shoe
box features the gun outsole instead of
the actual shoe like other adidas boxes
do but enough of that let's get into the
review the whole upper of the shoe is
made out of adidas awesome primeknit
material the primeknit on the centum d
is thinner than the one found of the
ultra boots and ultra percentage it's
also smooth and has no raised surfaces
like the priming on dr2 speaking of the
arts you I can't wait until more
colorways for that drop as always if
you're looking for something comfortable
yet stylish you can't go wrong with
Carmen amenities
unlike the art to the our one feature
lace loops for your laces and doesn't
actually weave through the primarily sis
here are your standard white ones
there's nothing special about them aside
from being pretty raw adidas also added
a little hint of cream on the sock liner
which is a very nice touch if you ask me
it's subtle but earlier on the back of
the shoe you've got a pull tab that says
the brand with three stripes in
different languages and black lettering
there's also a soft touch plastic
overlay on the heel counter of the shoe
and speaking of the heel counter there's
one built into the shoe that's made out
of the same felt lining that acts as the
midsole although then the heel counter
here does this job of keeping your feet
in place when walking also side note the
felt lining on these nmds is white which
is differ from the usual black on the
other end of these shoes some people say
the NMD aren't as comfortable because
they don't have a proper insult but
personally I don't mind it
moving down the chute we've got the main
reason why bottoms which is the boost
Mitchell but like I said before the
books Mitchell on the nd is usually a
little stiffer than the boots found on
the ultimate personally I prefer the
stuff for boots on the MMD but if you're
going to be on your feet
walking for several hours then you've
got to go with the ultra boost also if
you've never worn a pair of nmv
just know that walking with that long
heel is going to take a little getting
used to
along the boost you've got those famous
plugs in white and those are there for
support overall I think they give this
shoe a very clean look they also offer
some shadows and the white lighting that
gave off a contrasting effect sorry my
design background is showing personally
I would prefer if they made the adidas
logo clean to match the cream on the
sock liner because the color of the user
right now is very hard to see and moving
to the bottom of the shoe we've got the
gum out so there have been of the white
permanent and then these two release but
the gum out so just give the chute this
pop of color that makes them stand out I
don't know about you but I personally
hate shoes with white out shirts they
get ruined the second you take a step
outside remember there's also a black
version you can pick up but that one's a
little hard as a fine I got the white
ones cuz I thought they would look great
at the summers yacht party now all I
have to do is get invited to a yapper
yeah but when it comes to fit you can go
true to size if you like a little room
in your shoes and um these usually do
run a little big so going down half the
size wouldn't hurt these are a size 10
and they're a little big on me but I'll
manage which caught me off guard since
my arches are size 10 and those fit me
perfectly hey if you made it this far I
