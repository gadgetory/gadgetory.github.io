there's no denying that it's smaller
than the Sony XP 60 but costs the same
as the much larger Sony XP 90 so how
does the JBL boom as compared to these
two Sony speakers we're about to find
out don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and if you want to watch
either of these speakers individual
reviews tap here after you don't want in
this video and there will be a sound
test at the end of this video - like I
just said the JBL boombox is a pricey
speaker it currently basically retails
for 450 dollars for the same 450 dollars
you can also get the much larger Sony XP
90 but if you're not interested in such
a large speaker you can get the sony
xba-4 $350 if you want to pick either of
these speakers up I'll have links to
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deal
possible in this group the JBL boombox
is the smallest speaker closely followed
by the sony XP 60 and the sony xperia
has is just gigantic DJ bill boombox is
also the lightest weighing in at 11 a
half pounds or 5.2 5 kilos whereas the
sony xba-1 as 17.6 4 pounds or eight
kilos and then there's the sony xb9 be
weighing in at a monstrous thirty six
and a half pounds or sixteen point five
six kilos seriously it's a workout just
moving this thing around it's also worth
mentioning the JBL boombox is the most
durable in this group
it's ipx7 certified so is now going to
matter if you get too wet or somehow
falls into a pool heck I bet you can
even use it as a floating I'm not saying
that you should but it'd be cool if you
did it's also wrapped in a nylon weave
that repels most stains and really
doesn't show wear and tear whereas both
the sony xba-40 a soft plastic that does
get scratched very easily and they're
not waterproof like the JBL boom box
we're going to speaker set up all these
speakers only shoot out sound through
the front the JBL boom box has dual four
inch diameter woofers dual point seven
nine inch diameter tweeters and four
point one seven inch diameter passive
radiators on each side the sony xba-4
dual five-inch diameter woofers and dual
two-inch downward
and the Sony Xperia has dual seven inch
diameter woofers and 32.3 6 inch
diameter tweeters but at any given time
you're only using 2 of those 3 tweeters
when the speakers upright you're using
the top 2 tweeters and when two speakers
lay flat you're using the 2 tweeters on
the side and obviously these speakers
sound very different the JBL boombox is
the most balanced speaker in this lineup
it has a much wider soundstage and
significantly better instrument
separation and the JBL boombox really
puts an emphasis on vocals and treble
both the Sony XP 60 and XP 90 perform
the same and just overall sound clarity
isn't as good as two JBL boombox their
soundstage is much more narrow and
there's barely any instrument separation
and vocalist routinely gets found out
but they do have a lot more bass at sub
basement they're still good for a hip
hop or EDM and when set at max volume
obviously the XP manga gets the loudest
IMAX volume the XP 90s average decibel
reading is in the mid 90s range ii
louder speaker is the JBL boombox with
an average decibel reading in the mid
80s the sony XP 60 also has an average
decibel reading in the mid 80s but the
JBL boombox gets a touch louder but at
that max volume the JBL boom box is just
blaring out vocals in trouble whereas
with the sony xba-4 bumping bass so so
listening to the sony xba-1 box with the
sony xba-4 the music whereas with the
boombox you're missing that extra
element or dimension I don't know I hope
that makes sense all of these speakers
also have built-in batteries but they
perform very differently
will'd world used with the JBL boom box
set in indoor mode and the volume at a
moderate level for personal listening
I've averaged 21 hours of battery life
with the volume set at 100% I've
averaged 17 hours of battery life but
neither the Sony xb9 t or the sony xba-1
will battery life on the sony xba-1 the
light feature turned on in its normal
listening mode and at a moderate volume
I've averaged nine hours of battery life
and with the sony
the same circumstances I've averaged
seven hours of battery life and if you
use either of these two speakers at max
volume you'll be lucky if you get a
battery life for four hours
so the JBL boombox is battery life
absolutely demolishes the battery lives
on both Sony speakers ports on these
speakers are also a little different but
worth mentioning the JBL boombox has two
USB ports you can charge two of your own
devices and there's even an audio jack
both the Sony speakers only have one USB
port and there is no audio jack but
through that one USB port you can charge
your own device and also use it as a
wired connection except if you're using
an Apple device if you have an Apple
device you can only use a Bluetooth
connection with either Sony speaker but
the Sony speakers also have RCA port so
you can daisy chain them to other
speakers or add them to your home audio
system and if it matters there's also a
mic input but more importantly both Sony
speakers have been upgraded with aptX
audio so if you're using a supportive
device like a premium Android phone
you'll notice the wireless quality isn't
much clearer than using your standard
Bluetooth connection and finally the
most obvious difference between the JBL
boombots and both Sony speakers are the
light features on the front and if you
don't like them you can just turn them
off but the light feature is nice to
have especially if you're going to be
hosting parties elate into tonight and
through Sony's Music Center app you can
select from a few different light modes
and through the music center app you can
also adjust the EQ of either of these
speakers you can either select from a
few pre-made ones or you can even make
your own it's nice to have that option
because on the JBL boombox JPL's connect
that does not let you do that so you'll
have to use a third-party app so to wrap
things up the JBL boombox is a pricey
speaker for what it is it sounds good
but the premium price tag it carries is
all about portability durability a clean
design and a very long battery life it's
good for personal listening but when the
volume is all the way up and you want to
get things bumping it's just missing
that e whereas with the sony xba-1 sound
as clear as the JBL boombox
but they are better suited for hosting
parties in listening to bass heavy music
and they do offer that extra wow factor
with the light feature on the front
personally i prefer
the JBL Boondocks for various reasons
but I do wish it got louder now remember
this isn't a full review on either of
these speakers I'm just trying to point
out the most important differences
between these speakers so I can help you
with your purchase decision if you want
to learn more about ease of these
speakers watch the full reviews by
tapping on the icon in the top right
and here's a sound test as always these
speakers are playing in the same room
streaming from the same device and at
the same distance away from the same
microphone and at the same image decibel
level so hopefully the only difference
is sound quality also the JBL boom box
is in indoor mode and both Sony speakers
have stamina mode turned off if you
don't know the difference between those
modes then you should watch the full
review
