out there but the ji Yoon's smooth four
and DJI Osmo mobile - or arguably the
two most talked-about Gamble's right now
they both cost the same and they both do
the same thing but the each target a
different demographic if you're trying
to choose between any of these two
gimbals here are the main differences
that I think you should know about just
so we're clear this isn't a full review
on either these gimble's I'm just trying
to point out the most important
differences between them so I cannot be
with a purchase decision if you want to
learn more about either of these
Gamble's then watch their full reviews
both the DJI Osmo mobile 2 and ji-eun
smooth for retail for $139 and they both
come with very similar accessories they
both come in a hard styrofoam carrying
case and they both come with a charging
cable but the smooth four also brings an
included attachable base which is great
if you're going to be getting lots of
motion time lapses if you want to pick
either these gimbals up I'll have links
to description below
and if you use the links it really helps
out the channel I just have to check
them out cuz you never know when he's
good most might go on sale first let's
got some small but important details out
of the way first
both of these Gamble's have a universal
mount on the bottom so you can attach
them to your tripod both of these
Gamble's aren't 360-degree Gamble's and
both of these Gamble's charge via
different USB ports the Osmo mobile 2
charges via a microUSB port and I find
it odd DJI they will just use a USB C
port cuz that's what the magic air uses
but the Osmo has a dedicated USB a port
so you can charge your own phone whereas
the smooth four does use a USB C port
for charging but unfortunately you can't
use this USB C port to charge your own
device instead you have to use the micro
USB port found on the tilt axis to
charge your own phone and personally I
can't use this micro USB port and I feel
G you and should have at least included
a USB eyal to charge other devices
because like I said in the full review
if you're going to be filming with your
phone you're constantly going to need to
recharge it especially if you're filming
in 4k even though both of these Gamble's
do relatively the same thing there are
three main differences I want to talk
about and that's range of motion
physical controls and in software with
the smooth four you're just able to move
around much more
the gimbal snagging and messing up your
shot whereas the Osmo 2 doesn't have as
much range of motion so if you move in a
certain direction or if you hold it I'm
straying away
it'll might snag and get your phone off
access you're just able to get away with
much more with this women with four
whereas the Osmo 2 really only likes to
be held upright obviously both of these
Gamble's are going to help smooth out
your video and for the most part they
both do a good job but neither of these
Gamble's are going to perfectly smooth
out your video they're still going to be
some up and down undulation going on but
you can further smooth out your video by
adjusting the way you walk the motors on
both these Gamble's who are relatively
silent but I did find the Osmo might
give off a slight whining sound if
they're working hard to keep your shot
level but it happens very rarely but
overheating hasn't been an issue with
either these Gamble's which is always a
good thing to see but perhaps the
biggest difference between these two
Gamble's are the physical controls and
form factors first up plainly said the
DJI Osmo mobile twos handle is much
smaller and much more ergonomic than the
smooth force whereas a smooth force
handle is just a rounded off rectangle
then never really rests comfortably in
the hand but both of these handles are
made out of plastic and are very
slippery so I highly advise you a tester
wrist strap but the biggest feature of
the smooth for has to offer are the
physical control buttons and the zoom
wheel with the physical control buttons
you can quickly and easily adjust your
capture settings without having to use
the touchscreen and with the zoom wheel
you can precisely pull focus or zoom in
on something and thanks to these
physical controls I feel too smooth for
is the filmmakers gamble but
unfortunately the smooth Ford doesn't
have a joystick to control the pan and
tilt action of your camera you can only
do it manually the control buttons on
the DJI Osmo mobile 2 are very minimal
and unlike the smooth 4 there is a
joystick so you can control your camera
movements there's also a switch on the
Osmo 2 so you can adjust the zoom of the
camera but you don't have as much
control as you would with the smooth 4
zoom wheel but another big difference
between these 2 Gamble's or if their
apps in order to get the most out of the
Jean smooth 4 you're better off using
2zy play app so you can take full
control of the physical buttons and
quickly adjust your camera settings
because without it you're not going to
be able to take full advantage of the
zoom wheel which is kind of the selling
point of the smooth four but I can't
help but notice the image quality of the
zy play a p-- isn't as good as DJ eyes
app or the iPhones native camera app
it's not as sharp and the image can get
blown out a times she used a
construction feature is also mostly
useless it loses a subject very easily
but since this is software I do hope to
see my play app will improve over time
DJ eyes active tracking on the other
hand is far superior and I found it very
useful for what I want to keep a
specific subject and frame but I still
have to move around these are eyes app
also manages to capture image quality
that's a little closer to real life than
the zy play app these your eyes app is
also much simpler to use which some
people will like and others won't if you
want to fine tune your shot you're going
to have to fiddle around with the jedis
app much longer then you would wish u
n--'s app and the process of digging
through the menus and using the
touchscreen you're probably gonna have
to readjust a shot but with all that
being said since both of these gimble's
cost the same i think it all comes down
to your needs
I feel that even smooth for is better
suited for filmmakers and the DJI Osmo
mobile 2 is better suited for live
streamers the smooth form manages to
keep your shots steady at all costs
while giving you quick and easy access
to adjust your settings so you can get
the best shot the Osmo simple to use
interface lightweight design ergonomic
handle joystick and he was ba port for
charging your own phone makes it perfect
for people who want to go live for
extended periods of time
I feel the smooth four has a better
hardware and the Osmo 2 has a better
software
I feel DJI needs to improve the range of
motion of its gimbal with the Osmo
mobile 3 and I feel she you needs to
bring better software in a much more
ergonomic handle with the smooth v if
you made it this far I guess you enjoyed
the video so hit that like button and
get subscribed it helps out more than
you realize support the channel by
