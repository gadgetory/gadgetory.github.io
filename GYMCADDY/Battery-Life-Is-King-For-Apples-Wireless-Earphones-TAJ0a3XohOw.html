asked and when Apple muscled up the
courage to remove the headphone jack
from the iPhone 7 that went all-in under
Wireless future prediction but they also
backed it up by showing us our all-new
w12 as of today they've released three
offerings that include their new w1 chip
we have the air pods power these three
beats solo three in the
soon-to-be-released beat substitute you
can pick up either the black or gloss
black beats solo three for 220 or you
can pick up the black car beats three
for 149 on Amazon today so which are
right for you well it's obvious Apple is
trying to cater to all of your different
customers instead of just making one
pair of wireless earphones and calling
it a day they've released three vastly
different products that each have their
own strengths and weaknesses but one
thing is for sure Apple wants to be the
king of long lasting wireless earphones
let's take the beats solo three for
example these your phones have a total
battery life of 40 hours on just one
charge and they also feature fast fuel
which gets you three hours of battery
life from just five minutes of charging
the both QC 35 on the other hand can
only last 20 hours on a full charge and
a quick charge of 15 minutes only gets
you 2.5 hours of playback time moving on
to the power beats 3 to get to a whole
12 hours of playback time from a full
charge they also feature fast fuel which
will get you an hour of playback from 5
minutes of charging the jaybird x3 on
the other hand can only last 8 hours on
a full charge and don't feature any kind
of fast charging and to drive home how
impressive a 12 hour battery life is on
an earphone just know that Bose is sound
sport and sounds sport poles only have a
eight and five hour battery life
respectively and even with the
relatively small form factor each Apple
earpods has a five hour battery life
from a full charge combined with their
fast charging carrying case the Apple
earpods can last a total of 24 hours in
comparison the Samsung gear icon acts
can only last three hours from a full
charge with all fitness tracking
features turned off and I know a lot of
people give Apple and beats by dre a lot
of flack about their poor sounding
products relative to the competition but
Apple is clearly trying to dominate the
market through sheer battery life
because no matter how great your
earphone sound it
doesn't matter if they're out of juice
when you need them the most like I
mentioned before Apple has a very
specific customer in mind for each of
their wallets earphones the beats solo 3
are a great option for anyone who
travels a lot and listen to music while
they're on the plane train bus ride or
just waiting for their layover not to
mention there are also an all-around
good option to just use while you're
home or while you're at the office
the power beats 3 on the other hand are
the perfect option for anyone who's
looking for something to work out with
the power B story are water and dust
resistant and can take a beating the
fast feel feature is also great if you
constantly forget to charge your
earphones like I do because you leave
them in a gym bag the airports are more
geared towards the professional that
wants to wear wireless earphones but
don't want anything too athletic looking
and don't want to wear over the ear
headphones because they tend to mess up
their hear the air pods are great for
anyone who just wants something small
unobtrusive and just work and like I've
mentioned before there's something just
liberating about not having to worry
about having a wire snagging on your
clothing or furniture Wireless is the
future and Apple is clearly a strong
advocate for it and I have high hopes
for the upcoming big sets I believe they
will bring the luxury of Wireless to the
masses who don't want to teach too much
for wireless evolution hopefully this
video has helped steer you in the right
direction for your purchasing needs

proofs in the description below hey if
