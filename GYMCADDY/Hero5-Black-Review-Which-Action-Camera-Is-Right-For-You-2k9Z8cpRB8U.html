black Nick Woodman the CEO of GoPro has
finally been able to release the action
camera he wanted to create from the
get-go and if you're in the market for
an action camera you might be
considering either the GoPro Hero 5
black or the GoPro Hero 5 session at the
time of this recording you can pick up a
GoPro Hero 5 black with a 32 gig micro
SD card head strap and carrying case for
399 from amazon link is in the
description first let's talk about the
form factor the hero five black is 2 and
1 30 inches by one in one-third inches
by one and one-half inches it's pretty
small in volume but it's pretty dense so
it'll sink to the bottom if dropped in a
pool or lake this is also a great segue
to let you know that this camera is
waterproof down to 33 feet under water
any deeper and you'll need to get a dive
case the hero five black features a 2
inch screen on the back this is
obviously a standard feature if you're
deciding between the hero five black or
the hero 5 session all the other screen
doesn't have the highest pixel density
it gets the job done you can also
quickly change between video picture or
time-lapse mode you can even adjust the
resolution frame rate and feel the view
just to name a few since battery life is
a big concern the screen will
automatically shut off after minute of
inactivity or after a minute of
continuous recording but don't worry the
GoPro is still recording and the screen
turns back on quickly from just a single
tap the hero five black also still has
the classic LCD screen on the front and
just like before it'll show you how many
videos or pictures you have
approximately how much space you got
left on the SD card and battery life it
is worth noting the touch screen can be
a little tough to use at times and using
the screen when it's wet is near
impossible but don't worry you can also
connect the camera to your smartphone
through GoPros app in the app you can
use your phone as a viewfinder watch
your videos or even adjust the camera
settings on the left side of the device
there is a door that when lifted gives
you access to the cameras to connection
port 1 micro HDMI port and one USB
type-c port the type-c USB port allows
for faster transfer speeds and charging
rates the faster transfer speed is a big
deal if you're going to be recording a
lot of 4k video as mentioned before this
camera is waterproof down to 33 feet on
the water and it's all things through
these gaskets just make sure to close a
compartment properly before going for a
swim or
you're gonna have a bad time on the
bottom of the GoPro there's another
compartment that holds the battery and
SD card unlike the hero 5 session the
battery here is removable and it's
another feature that might make you
consider this camera over the session
this is a thousand 220 million battery
and it's good for 40 minutes to two
hours of battery life battery life on
the hero 5 is all dependent on the
resolution frame rate if you have GPS
voice control or image stabilization
turned on one of those in a second and
how long the touch screen has been on
the hero five black is not just a hero 5
session with the touch screen and
removable battery it also has a better
camera that gives you more capture
options the euro 5 black can do
everything the hero 5 and heroes a shoe
can do but here are a few standout
settings that make this camera special
first off you can capture 4k video in 30
or 25 frames per second with a wide
field of view or 24 frames per second in
super view or wide field of view it can
also capture 1080p video at 120 frames
per second in wide or narrow field of
view whereas the hero 5 session is kept
at 90 frames per second in wide field of
view the hero five black can also
capture ultra slow motion 720p video at
240 frames per second with the narrow
field of view the hero five black can
also capture stills in 20 megapixels
whereas a hero 5 session can only do 10
megapixels in the hero session 8
megapixels as mentioned before this
camera also has image stabilization it's
the software kind not on a chemical kind
what I've preferred mechanical and
stabilization yes but the software does
a great job of correct in the video the
hero five black also has a built-in GPS
that will geotag your pictures and video
this GPS feature is not found the hero 5
session and finally the hero five black
also has voice control it allows you to
tell it to start recording take a
picture or stop recording it's very
accurate and can be very helpful if you
have gloves on or if the screen is what
but if you choose to use any or all
these features at once it'll take a
total battery so which GoPro should you
get well go pro now has an action camera
for almost every consumer if you want to
capture 4k video or you want to capture
slow motion video in 1080p or even ultra
slow motion video in 720p at 240 frames
per second you
you should get the hero five black if
you need an action camera with the
removable battery that you can swap out
so you can keep recording then you
should also get the hero flat black but
if you don't need to capture raw or wdr
photos or if you don't even know what
that means you need to pick up the hero
5 or hero session links to their reviews
and where to get them are in the
description well if you made it this far
