Black Nick Woodman the CEO of GoPro has
finally been able to release the action
camera he wanted to create from the
get-go and if you're in the market for
an action camera you might be
considering either the GoPro Hero 5
black or the GoPro Hero 5 session at the
time of this recording you can pick up a
GoPro Hero 5 black with a 32 gig microSD
card head strap and carrying case for
399 from Amazon link is in the
description first let's talk about the
form factor the hero 5 black is 2 and
130 inches by 1 in 1/3 inches by 1 and
1/2 inches it's pretty small in volume
but it's pretty dense so it'll sink to
the bottom
if dropped in a pool or lake this is
also a great segue to let you know that
this camera is waterproof down to 33
feet underwater any deeper and you'll
need to get a dive case the Hero 5 black
features a 2 inch screen on the back
this is obviously a standard feature if
you're deciding between the hero fly
black or the hero 5 session all the
other screen doesn't have the highest
pixel density it gets the job done you
can also quickly change between video
picture or time-lapse mode you can even
adjust the resolution frame rate and
field of view just to name a few
since battery life is a big concern the
screen will automatically shut off after
a minute of inactivity or after a minute
of continuous recording but don't worry
the GoPro is still recording and the
screen turns back on quickly from just a
single tap the Hero 5 black also still
has the classic LCD screen on the front
and just like before it'll show you how
many videos or pictures you have
approximately how much space you got
left on the SD card and battery life it
is worth noting the touch screen can be
a little tough to use at times and using
the screen when it's wet is near
impossible but don't worry you can also
connect the camera to your smartphone
through GoPros app in the app you can
use your phone as a viewfinder watch
your videos or even adjust the camera
settings on the left side of the device
there is a door that when lifted gives
you access to the cameras - connection
port one micro HDMI port and one USB
type-c port the type-c USB port allows
for faster transfer speeds and charging
rates the faster transfer speed is a big
deal if you're going to be recording a
lot of 4k video as mentioned before this
camera is waterproof down to 33 feet
underwater and it's all things through
these gaskets just make sure to close a
compartment properly before going for a
swim or else
you're gonna have a bad time on the
bottom of the GoPro there's another
compartment that holds the battery and
SD card
unlike the Hero 5 session the battery
here is removable and it's another
feature that might make you consider
this camera over the session this is a
thousand two hundred twenty million
battery and it's good for 40 minutes to
two hours of battery life battery life
on the hero five is all dependent on the
resolution frame rate if you have GPS
voice control or image stabilization
turned on one those in a second and how
long the touchscreen has been on the
hero five black is not just a hero five
session with the touchscreen and
removable battery it also has a better
camera that gives you more capture
options the Euro five black can do
everything the hero five and hero Sacha
can do but here are a few standout
settings that make this camera special
first off you can capture 4k video in 30
or 25 frames per second with a wide
field of view or 24 frames per second in
super view or wide field of view it can
also capture 1080p video at 120 frames
per second in wide or narrow field of
view whereas the Hero 5 session is kept
at 90 frames per second in wide
field-of-view
the hero4 black can also capture ultra
slow motion 720p video at 240 frames per
second with the narrow field of view the
hero 5 black can also capture stills in
20 megapixels whereas a Hero 5 session
can only do 10 megapixels in the hero
session 8 megapixels as mentioned before
this camera also has image stabilization
it's the software kind not a mechanical
kind what I've preferred mechanical and
stabilization yes but the software does
a great job of correcting the video the
hero4 black also has a built-in gps that
will geotag your pictures and video this
GPS feature is left on the hero 5
session and finally the hero 5 black
also has voice control it allows you to
tell it to start recording take a
picture or stop recording it's very
accurate and can be very helpful if you
have gloves on or if the screen is what
but if you choose to use any or all
these features at once it'll take a
total battery so which GoPro should you
get while GoPro now has an action camera
for almost every consumer if you want to
capture 4k video or you want to capture
slow-motion video in 1080p or even ultra
slow motion video in 720p at 240 frames
per second you
you should get the hero 5 black if you
need an action camera with the removable
battery that you can swap out so you can
keep recording then you should also get
the hero flat black but if you don't
need to capture raw or wdr photos or if
you don't even know what that means
you need to pick up the hero 5 or hero
session links to their reviews and where
to get them are in the description well
