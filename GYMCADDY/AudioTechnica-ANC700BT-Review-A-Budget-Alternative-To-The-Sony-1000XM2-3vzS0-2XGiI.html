us a first look at their ath ANC 700 BT
quiet point headphones
I know typing $350 on a pair of
headphones is a lot for some people so a
lot of people having eagerly been
waiting for these headphones to drop
here's what I like what I don't like and
how the ANC on the Audio Technica AFC
700 BT compares to the Sony 1000 XM -
okay from here on out I'm going to be
referring to these headphones as the
quiet point the audio technica quiet
points currently retail for $1.99 and
come in black and I think the silver
version will be released as well on the
other hand the Sony 1000x m2 which have
the best active noise cancellation on
the market right now usually retails for
$350 if you want a pic ease of these
headphones up I'll have links of
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel
check them out because Sony headphones
routinely go on sale and I wouldn't be
surprised if the quiet points do as well
okay let's go over what comes in the box
the Audio Technica quiet points come
included with the carrying pouch that
admittedly looks nice
but if you do plan on traveling a lot
with these headphones I recommend you
invest in a hard shell carrying case the
quiet point also come included with a
3.52 2.5 millimeter audio cable and a
USB a two micro USB cable personally
since this 2018 i really feel these
headphones should have used a USB C port
instead for some reason only the premium
headphones like the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px
and Bing in all of sin h9 I have USB C
port I also don't like how the audio
jack on these headphones is not so easy
to reach which makes finding a better
quality audio cable for these headphones
a little harder when it comes to build
quality the quiet points are using very
similar materials to the soleus they
have a stainless steel frame plastic
body panels and synthetic leather on the
headband and ear cups but they're very
lightweight coming in at just 247 grams
whereas the sony 1000 XM to weigh in and
277 grams and even though 30 grams might
not seem like a lot it's really
noticeable when you have them on your
head and as a result the audio technica
quiet points are very comfortable to
wear either when you're
walking or if you're at your desk and
some work done
I dare even say they're as comfortable
as the Bose QC 35 because they have very
little clamping force they have very
spacious oval ear cups that encase your
ears and don't rest on your earlobes
since your ear cups pivot and swivel a
good deal they should be able to conform
to most head types and since minimal
padding actually makes contact with your
skin overheating also isn't a problem I
have a big head because I'm awesome but
I have no problems wearing these
headphones for long periods of time
whereas with the Sony's yester still
comfortable and their big head approved
but since their ear cups aren't as
spacious and since there is a lot of
padding they'll rest on you your loads
all you'll probably end up with the
shorty ear cups after long now when it
comes to battery life Audio Technica
advertises a battery life of 25 hours
and with ANC and Bluetooth turned on and
with the volume set at 50% these guys
average 23 hours to playback time not
bad but with ANC turned off these guys
managed to hit 30 hours of playback time
these headphones are using bluetooth 4.1
and they have a range of about 30 feet
with direct line-of-sight
there's no connection issues if your
phone is nearby or if it's in your
pocket but if there's a single wall
between your audio source and your
headphones then the signal will start to
stutter but more importantly these
headphones can only be connected to one
device at a time which does suck and
there is a good amount of latency when
watching videos but you can always just
use them passively with the wired
connection now let's talk about their
active noise cancellation performance
when you get into the $200 price range
ANC can be very hit-or-miss the ansi on
the points does a good job of blocking
out constant low-frequency sounds like
road noise if you're on the bus most of
the ANC headphones do a good job of this
as well but when it comes to blocking
out chatter these headphones don't
really block out too much but what
really matters is that these headphones
don't hiss or put a lot of cabin
pressure on your eardrum with ANC turned
on that's the main reason why I can't
wear the Bose QC 3/5 is they produce a
lot of cabin pressure and they give me
headaches
obviously the ANC on the quiet points
isn't as good as the Soudan 1000x m2 but
they should get the job done if you're
on the buzz on your way to school or
work
but when it comes to sound quality dads
wear these audio-technica's shine they
have a neutral sound signature but with
just the right amount of punchy bass
they have a wider sound stage then the
Sony's and their bass doesn't bottom out
but this is what their ANC turned off
these headphones sound very different
with ANC turned on their soundstage
tightens up and the bass isn't as punchy
so naturally I prefer to listen to these
headphones with ANC turned off when
using these headphones with a wired
connection I did notice the highs were a
little crisper but mainly I've been
using these headphones with a wired
connection as monitoring headphones for
the last few videos I put out but if you
do plan on wearing these headphones out
in public just know there is a
considerable amount of sound leakage but
now we need to talk about my least
favorite feature on these headphones and
that's our touch controls
unlike the Sony's which have a touchpad
on the right ear Cup the quiet points
have three touch points on their left
ear cup tap the logo wants to play a
positive music tap above the logo to
raise the volume tap below the logo to
lower the volume and swipe up or swipe
down to skip or go back a track but keep
in mind when adjusting the volume on
these headphones you're adjusting the
local volume not the volume on your
source so if you max out the volume on
the headphones it doesn't mean the
volume is maxed out on your phone and I
find it very annoying but the touch
controls on the quiet points in general
suck playing and pausing a track is fine
but trying to escape or go back track
almost never works and since the touch
controls are on the left ear cup it
doesn't feel natural for me since I'm
all rightie the top controls on the
Saudis are almost flawless personally I
would have very much preferred if audio
technical use actual buttons here
because I find myself just using my
phone to control my music playback
instead because it's much easier ok and
here is the microphone test and the
short answer is microphone isn't that
good but this audio clip is being
recorded about the microphone on the
audio technica ANC 700 BT 3 give you the
judge so the final verdict on the audio
technica ANC 700 BT is that they're good
for 200 all the headphones they have
good build quality and they're very
comfortable to wear their ANC should get
the job done for your bus ride commute
without causing you any headaches and
they have a very decent battery life but
wear these headphones stand out is their
sound quality they sounded much better
than I expected their Bluetooth
connectivity isn't the best because of
their latency and only being able to be
connected to one device at a time so
these might not be the best for a power
user who wants to quickly switch from
one source to another or for someone who
plans on consuming a lot of video with
these but the biggest letdown on these
headphones has got to be the touch
controls if you made it this far I guess
you enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
