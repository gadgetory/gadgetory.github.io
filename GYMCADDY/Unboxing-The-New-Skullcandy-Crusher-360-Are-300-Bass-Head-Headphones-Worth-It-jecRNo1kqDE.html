unboxing I shouldn't be clapping next to
the mic so anyway we're gonna be doing
or third live unboxing today and for
those who may be new here I personally
find unboxing videos very boring I get
bored just watching somebody unbox a
product and then just read off the spec
sheet it does nothing for me
and since we're doing but I think
there's be a lot more fun since we're
doing it live since we're doing it live
you guys can interact with me through
the chat and since we're doing it live
you guys are gonna get my real first
impressions and raw reactions cuz there
have been times where I've been
completely blown away by a product the
first time I unbox it or where or I've
just been completely disappointed case
in point the Sony 1000x and threes you
know I love these things and I was
ecstatic
first time I turned them on because they
were much more comfortable than the 1000
xm2 or if we go to the other side of the
spectrum these gold candy venues these
are school candies first ANC headphones
and I was somewhat disappointed when I
first unboxed them because the build
quality isn't that great so overall I am
kind of disappointed in the Skullcandy
venues and that's important to take note
of coz today we're going to be unboxing
the skull candy crusher 360s now those
venues and 360s were announced at the
same time around IFA about a month ago
and I'm gonna be honest when I first
heard about the skull can do three the
skull candy crush or 360s and I heard
that they were gonna be $300
I was sticker shock because that is
significantly more than what the current
skull candy crush was go for these
retail for $200 but they're usually on
sale for 150 now so we really gotta see
how much better these are to the venue's
constraining build quality wise and we
also got to see what justifies the new
skull candy crush near 360s to cost
three hundred dollars versus the
original skull candy crushers cuz
correct me if I'm wrong I know that
right now the skull candy question 360s
are currently the most expensive skull
candy headphones out there
and I think they could possibly the most
the most expensive
um Skullcandy Skullcandy headphones ever
so there's a lot of questions
surrounding these headphones so let's
actually go in and actually unbox them
now just keep in mind I haven't watched
any other videos of featuring these
headphones I barely even skimmed over
there are a website page so I don't know
what to expect from these headphones and
I do that on purpose so that since I
don't know what we're gonna expect I'm
going to be genuinely surprised so it's
a lot more fun for both me and you okay
alright so okay so this thing has a
little alright I'm about to open this up
let's see what's inside you ready okay
okay they have a a very Beats Studio 3
style case going for them actually let's
have a look at this box it's actually
this is the limited edition version and
you know it actually looks pretty pretty
cool uh so oh wow there's a lot of
there's a lot of springiness to this
okay so we're gonna unbox actually
reveal this for the first time
okay you ready one two three they're the
oh okay these look a lot oh these feel a
lot better than the venue's oh yeah this
this feels much more premium okay this
slides is just like the original
crushers and okay good good good so so
they actually pivot a little bit one of
the biggest problems with the with these
crushers is that they don't pivot too
much so anytime then I put them on okay
clamping force is fine but since they
don't pivot there's a lot of you know
just unnecessary pressure here and it is
very uncomfortable I would really like
these headphones that a little bit of
this so that the
distribute the pressure evenly because
this feels a lot better than what we
have here because it's like it's getting
pinched in so let's see wow these feel
okay
yeah look a little a little bit of pivot
action there that that is super
important okay now remember these cost
three hundred dollars which is $50 more
than the Sony XP 950 n1 which are
another pair of bass heavy headphones
left and right okay here we go first
time going on and these feel a lot
better than the Crushers yeah these feel
a lot better
yep yep I'm happy with this these these
are these are bacon approved
unlike the venue's these guys these guys
are not big head of proof because I'm in
order to put them on you got to take
them out all the way this way so it
doesn't go anymore
but these these are baked and approved
and hold on let's see oh and they don't
stick out as much which is very
important to take note of because if
you're going to wear this the Sony xb9
50 n1 you gotta have Apple levels of
courage to actually wear them because
those things stick out a lot because for
comparison these are the cross for 360s
okay now sticking out too much
acceptable mm and you're like here on
twos and these stick out as much as the
XP 950 n once hold on and yeah you see
these stick out a lot more you see what
I'm talking about but they're
comfortable they're comfortable
alright so headphones aside they have
very little padding here it's not a
problem but build quality was I can see
why they're asking $300 for these just
by the build qualities I like them
the only thing is that they don't fold a
flat edge whatever but as long as they
fold collapse dad cool that's don't
alright so let's see what else is in the
box
okay well ah you know this case isn't
doesn't feel as nice as the venue's case
but case wise it's gonna do exactly what
it needs to do alright so you've got the
same it's a microUSB cable you know what
kind of sucks is that these headphones
are three hundred dollars and they're
coming out in late 2018 I I would have
liked these no not like these headphones
should have came included with a USB C
port instead alright let's see there's
the audio cable there's an inline
controller on this one there's an inline
controller on this one which something
the venue's didn't have but oh oh I
don't think this is an inline controller
at all this is probably the the base
toggle yeah because it doesn't click it
just slides up and down and that and
that it's very similar to what the
crushers have you see you got this
little thing this is for your base it is
your base so just not so maybe that's
for the base adjust but I know these
things have like touch controls on them
swipe to adjust sense okay cool
says swipe to adjust sensory baits all
right so we got to see the accuracy of
this cuz some headphones like the audio
technica ath 700 something something the
last 200 other Audio Technica headphones
that review the touch controls
completely ruined those headphones for
me is there anything else in here aside
from manual no there's nothing else okay
let's give this thing oh and there's a
little battery gate on the back too I
like that
do we have any juice oh look at
Oh Alex nice neck field looks very nice
we're gonna go ahead and actually sync
this up to the iPad real quick I should
have had another phone ready just in
case
um cameraman do we have any any
questions going on they want to know
which one's gonna be this one the old oh
yeah what the first video it's going to
compare the scroll candy crusher 360 to
the skull candy crusher okay
because I know a lot of people want to
know should they upgrade should they pay
extra for the 360 what's the difference
and then the second video that's going
to be the Sony xb9 50 n1 and if these
versus video where is bluetooth neither
does this pairing question 360s okay
connect it all right we still got the
same british boat a voice going on you
know what
first impressions first impressions I
like these a lot better than the venue's
the venue's I'm sorry
I can't recommend these the watch 700 an
or the Sennheiser 4.50 BT and sees those
are still better but these these are
making a much better first impression
let's go over to YouTube
they want to know working me buying the
360 um online hat skål skål candies
website because like either just so
we're clear I didn't get these
headphones early Skullcandy I'm not
affiliated with with them anyway that's
why I can say whatever I want to say
about skull candy I I just pre-ordered
them and I had to wait like three weeks
to get them and now they're here so just
go over to skull candy site and pick
them up let's see we're gonna play we're
gonna play kill shot by Eminem because
that song has oh no because that song
has a lot of bees kill shot
your beard is weird stop yelling at the
mic no I don't know it
well done play means I can't hear you I
gotta just hold on hold on that's not on
yet how do we do this
why is your stickers are hard to move to
keep to take off Skullcandy you need a
need a easier to peel sticker you know
I'm going to add this to my collection
I'm gonna add that up there you go okay
so how do we actually okay so no that's
not it or jazzy's done with those well
we'll find out I can't hear you wait
there I'm just wearing
Oh
Oh
oh okay I get all shy I can't hear you I
can't hear you
oh these Oh
hahahaha that's too much that's too much
I want candy here it can they hear the
music through the mic I can't oh oh
that's a lot that's a lot these have
more bass than the Sony xb9 50 analyst i
can tell you that right now but they
don't get too loud you're a little bit
that's all
that's that sensory overload did they
hear it through the mighty some of them
can hear it a little bit okay whoa like
any time that gaze drops it like the
whole thing is just shaking and and on
and i like you just saw I didn't expect
it I like I raised it without noticing
one thing I can already tell you that
I'm starting to wonder why didn't they
they didn't do that if they should have
like put some type of marking or
something to say hey listen this is your
your touchpad side cuz because it's kind
of well if my touch my physical control
buttons are here then my bass control
knob is here oh oh oh look at that look
at that wait come here look at the gauge
down up down up down okay I like that
accuracy accuracy is pretty cool what is
this button do just like it's like dee
dee anybody watch Dexter's Laboratory
hey let's see um what is this - no it's
all blue green
I wonder what this button is doing
oh okay
huh I don't know I gotta figure out what
that button does okay whoa okay all
right all right you good you good you
good that's a lot of pee all right hold
on hold on actually hold on let me see
if we can hear get close you get close
to that see if you can see a shake I
wonder if you can hear it shake hold on
let me put this microphone you can hear
it you can hear it shake the table can
you hear that I think they can hear it
all right let's just get rid of that put
this back no no there's a button there's
a blank cause like I know you swipe it
up and down is your intention okay I
just felt something also you know what
you know what it is it's probably like
they go all right 50 I think that I
think they're like precess I think you
can go from like zero 25 50 75 100 and
then if you want you can just use a knob
and I just in yourself
I don't know I'm guessing I'm guessing
all right you know what
you know what I'm not hating these I
actually but but the thing is they're
not getting too loud that's them like
they're a little quiet this this sounds
like when yeah these are at 70% so this
had max volume to me right now it's
sounding to this like if it were at 70%
so these are a little quiet but it's
that bass that bass whoop it's it's that
you know what
first impressions good hey what just
happen alright um do we have anything
else to look into we have any questions
we're good we're all set
alright guys so first impressions skull
candy crush or three Sexy's not bad not
bad they definitely feel a lot more
premium than the crusher or G crushers
especially especially the leather the
leather feels much nicer the ear cups
although the ear cups are bigger hold on
can we yeah can we get like a shot of
that like the ear cups are a
significantly bigger oh yeah let's see
how they compare to look at that you
hear that squeaking already I barely
even touched you you already squeaking
yeah yeah these were yeah these are
bigger you know what kind of really
excited so I'm making this video I've
heard the base of that dunno old crush
yours hmm yes yes oh god I still got a
sink him up to the iPad I've never sent
them up to the iPad
I'd say we're gonna sync that up real
quick get the get the first impression
and then we're gonna call it a night cuz
Karen I got home to do sure Wireless
yeah these aren't as comfortable because
they're putting all this pressure here
it's not a good time
all right so same song just to keep it's
just to keep it fair hold on we're gonna
let the volume these get louder these
get louder than the question of 360s
that's that's one no no these get louder
but these have nowhere near as much base
as the crusher presets these hold on
hold on let me let me okay okay I got I
got my baseline I got my baseline for
that hold on hold on yeah woof these
feel a lot more comfortable than the
question of 360s and way more
comfortable than the venue's okay hold
on hold on we're gonna switch the source
here okay
Oh
there it is all right some of it
okay so the max base on the Crushers is
like these at what is that like 20
percent yeah 20 percent that's 20
percent so so these at a hundred percent
the base is like these at 20 percent
but these aren't getting as loud so
sound quality is pretty good sounds cool
quality is pretty good the base isn't
muddling the mids and the highs and the
high is aren't getting as they don't in
like these cuz sometimes the highs on
these I mean it really like to get tinny
but the base on this it just it's like
it's like riding around with the a car
with a flat tire it's just like this is
not not good base I'm I'm a fan of these
I'm a fan of these these these these
Skullcandy I don't know what happened
with the Skullcandy venues but the
Skullcandy 360s skull candy crush 360s
these these I like these these I'm now
I'm very excited to get this video going
I like these
I like these how's it up that gets off
all right very good top all right guys
so we're we're gonna call that we're
gonna we're gonna call it quits there
wait call it quits
is it big hair to prove yes these are
big head approved actually let's see how
far oh there's a lot more room there's a
lot more room for these suits to go oh
yeah these are like falling off hold on
these are gonna be like a half half way
kind of guy oh there we go yeah I only
have to extend the headband halfway for
it to get a comfortable fit with these
and remember since these ear cups
actually pivot unlike the questions if
they're a lot more comfortable because
with the venues like I said on the full
reveal in order for me to get a
comfortable fit on this
I got to extend them all the way out and
then bring them back to clicks so these
are not vacant approved but the Crushers
those are big head approved I liked the
performance on these so we're gonna call
it quits that's it alright guys so
there's my first impressions on the
Skullcandy crushers expect a full review
on those guys by the end mm let's say
Friday or Saturday but but I like these
I like these alright guys good night
wait what wait what are those what the
lows how good are they no they're good
all right bass is very deep bass is good
your question Noah what's known as
question I know you had a hurry it up
because because kami I got homework to
do you leave you better than the other
ones then the crushers yeah yeah cuz
these the ear cups they don't pivot and
since they don't pivot they pinch the
front portion of your head but since
these actually pivot now since these
actually pivot and they don't have as
much clapping force they're a lot more
comfortable
I like this alright so we're done we're
good alright guys have a good night
thank you so much for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
