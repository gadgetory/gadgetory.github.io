it comes to technology when Google
believes the Moto 360 way back in
September 2014 with Android 1.0 I
couldn't get my hands on a quick enough
and now Google is giving Android wear a
much-needed update with their new
Android wear 2.0 Google in partnership
with LG has launched two new
smartwatches to feature the new OS and
today we've got one of those watches the
LG watch style full review first up is
the unboxing and Dan's existing have a
big box for SmartWatch presentation of
nice when you open the lid everything is
going out for you neatly inside you'll
find the watch itself or wall watch some
documentation and a charging plug I wish
they including a cleaning cloth though
this watch only comes in one size which
is a legend
I'd imagine people with larger wrists
will have a problem wearing this watch
since I've got average risk and I'm
already at the third-to-last whole
design watch the watch does okay you get
a stainless steel housing that comes in
either silver rose gold or titanium
there's also a mirror surface that goes
all around the watch sadly the back of
the watch is made out of plastic and
actually can have a wireless charger LG
watch cell also comes with genuine
leather strap but their quality leaves
something to be desired I fear that in
six months these straps will be totally
destroyed but on the bright side these
wristbands are interchangeable and
swapping wrists and here is much easier
than on the Apple watch
moving in suspects we've got a one-point
2 inch round polar display with the 299
PPI and cornering Gorilla Glass 3
covering at all the screen on this watch
is much brighter crisper and has deeper
colors than the run IQ I reviewed a few
days ago the watch style is also 10.8
millimeters thick whipped it very nicely
on your wrist it also weighs just 46
grams this watch also sports 512
megabytes of RAM and 4 gigs of on-board
storage so you can download apps from
the Play Store there's also a 240
million battery which should last you a
whole day the LG watch cell also has a
built-in microphone so you can use
Google assistant but there is no speak
on board when it comes to connectivity
you get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy
and finally just watches ip67 water and
dust resistance 1 but more importantly
than the features as watch hands are the
features that is missing first off you
should notice this watch doesn't have a
heart rate sensor so if you're looking
for something to wear while working out
this isn't for you there's also no NFC
tip so you can use
to pay which is a big new feature for
Android wear 2.0 there's also no LTE
connectivity for the LG watch style but
to me that really doesn't matter I don't
need to make phone calls off of my watch
and adding a watch to my mobile plans
doesn't really matter either
you think those you watch and navigating
through the cards it's like butter
there's no lag and no hesitation LG also
copied Apple's rotating crown design
which allows you to scroll through your
cards or the app drawer but not having
to smudge your screen Android wear also
introduced a whole bunch of watch faces
some that can display a ton of
information at a glance and some that
have a much more classic design to them
what if you wanted you can go into the
Play Store and download more watch faces
apps and even game smartwatches are
great for people who are always on the
move
and need to be on top of their emails
text calendar events phone calls and
reminders in Android wear 2.0 still does
a great job of showing you all that
information on the blind and if you need
to reply to either one of those texts or
emails you can do so in a few different
ways you can either use pre-made
responses voice text and even swipe on a
miniature keyboard which is fairly
accurate overall the LG watch style does
a great job of doing what it's supposed
to do it looks good on your wrist and
shows you phone notifications as they
come in the simple and classy design
looks good now and it'll still look good
in two years well for two hundred and
fifty dollars it's grossly overpriced
what watch sales have never taken off as
much as manufacturers had hoped and
sales have actually declined which is
why a lot of brands are leaning towards
the fitness craft so the LG watch style
not having a built-in heart rate monitor
is a flop it doesn't even have NFC which
means you can't use tap to pay our
features that's becoming more and more
popular with more new Android launches
just around the corner I would recommend
you hold off on this or looking for
those watches Big Brother the LG watch
sports review on that coming system
if LG wanted to be competitive they
should have priceless watch at 160 or so
