all right buffers are we live now yeah
okay we obviously still have no idea
what we're doing but hello everybody and
welcome to another live unboxing if
you're new here this is a series where I
unbox a product live and obviously I'm
still trying to iron out the kinks I
don't know what I'm doing but I do this
series because there have been times
where I've been completely blown away or
disappointed the first time I unboxed
the product case in point the Microsoft
Surface headphones I was very mm when I
unboxed these headphones on Wednesday
and now that I've been using these
headphones for a few days I'm still very
on these headphones I don't love them I
don't hate them I'm still very neutral
on them but I still have it I'm gonna
continue using them for the next few
days before I make a final decision on
them but yeah right now I'm very mmmm
with these headphones so far for today's
victim we actually have the AKG and 700
NC now these headphones were announced
alongside these headphones with Sony
1000 XM 3 s if you watch the channel you
know absolutely love these headphones
but for some reason these headphones
haven't gotten too much love from the
press I haven't seen too many other
people review these headphones I haven't
seen too many commercials on these
headphones the only time I've seen these
headphones in a commercial is during
that Samsung commercial where you got
the girl and she's playing on on some
Galaxy Tab and then her mom comes in and
she goes hey you're gaming store wants
to sponsor you if you look closely that
girl is actually wearing these
headphones but they don't make any
mention of them and AKG is kind of like
Samsung Samsung's version of Beats they
bought this company and now whenever
they sell like a note 9 or a Galaxy S 9
or whatever ideally they would like you
to use their phone with these headphones
so who knows maybe everybody's just
sleeping on these headphones these
headphones could be
or maybe learn nut but I'm gonna tell
you right now from the box these things
feel very sturdy I mean here's the front
and there's the back and also this thing
also won a best product award at E I say
if your mother in the convention so
again very very curious to see as to why
these headphones even though box feels
good they've got an award they were
announced alongside the Sony 1000x and
threes we haven't really seen too much
about these headphones now also afford
this livestream like I said we're gonna
be switching it up a little bit we're
gonna be talking about cyber monday
deals and I actually have a subscriber
question concerning cyber monday and
that question was what deals would you
actually avoid this whole you know
holiday season we just wrapped up Black
Friday deals week now we're going into
cyber monday deals week there are good
deals still going on deals that I still
recommend you pick up but there are
still also some other deals that I see
and I go I would avoid those so yeah
we've got any questions in the comments
now what's going on in the comments out
it highly highly highly doubt it
I highly doubt the cross or three cities
go on so and actually that reminds me if
you you know if your subscriber and you
saw the post the Sony xb9 fifty n ones
are back on sale for like $118
now that's 50% off unfortunately so so
if if you've been like on the fence
about picking those headphones up i
would pick them up now because they're
50% off but again i really do think it's
highly likely that we're gonna see a new
version of those cell phones at CES 2019
again sony you guys are gonna fly me out
i'll be more than happy to go over there
and cover those headphones for you so
yeah i think we're gonna see a new
version of the XP 950 n ones but if you
want them for 50% off that's a really
good deal and actually going off with
tangen off of that the sony watch 700 n
you know I really like these headphones
really good budget headphones their
build quality yeah isn't isn't amazing
but their features their performance
technology
they're great these are still going on
for these are still on sale for 98 bucks
but they're temporarily are out of stock
over at Amazon I think you can still
pick them up and then once they Amazon
gets them in stock they'll send them out
but definitely if you haven't picked
these up yet these are going for 50% off
this is a solid deal and you know that
actually segues into one of my cyber
monday deals that I would avoid these
JBL 65 BT NC headphones those headphones
or 200 'allah headphones but they're
currently on sale for 98 dollars as well
I would actually personally avoid those
headphones they're not the most
comfortable headphones out there mainly
because of their fork design they don't
actually have a fork they have like
there's one yoke thing going on the
range of movement for their ear cups
isn't as good so they do apply a bit of
pressure on the anterior portion of my
ear they're not the most comfortable and
they're ANC does have a lots of cabin
pressure so personally I would avoid
those I would pick these up and also you
know just staying on that topic these
Sennheiser 4.50 BTN C's I really really
like those headphones those headphones
even though they don't perform as well
as these they look much better their
build quality is much better during
prime day they went on sale for 98 bucks
they were you know neck-and-neck with
these now there are only going there
they haven't hit the 98 dollar mark
they're going for $130 I think they will
be going on sale sometime between now in
cyber monday 298 dollars I do think it's
highly likely but if they don't $130 for
those headphones it is still a pretty
decent price because again you're going
down from $200 and you know just
wrapping up one last pair of headphones
something that I also saw you know
during the whole event and whatnot the
Sony 1000 XM twos these bad boys were on
sale for $200 that was a good deal
because in comparison the bose qc25
series 2 which were released around the
same time you know like a few weeks
before or after these headphones those
headphones are only going for $50 off so
$300
so if you guys scoop these up let me
know in the comments below because they
were going for $200 they're back up to
300 but again cuz of cyber monday I
really do think these headphones will be
going back on sale for about two hundred
dollar price price mark we got to know
the question going on or can we go what
do you mean like completely wireless or
wireless personally I'm not the biggest
fan of truly wireless earbuds the only
truly Wireless here but I do like or the
air pods because those from day one have
been foolproof now truly wireless
earbuds have been improving recently so
definitely I will be giving those type
of headphones those types of products
another another chance I'm actually
going to be reviewing the Sennheiser
truly wireless earbuds they they
recently just went on sale but you know
right now unless is for me unless his
ear pods it it's a bust
but I think the Bose sound sport free or
down to like 160 and you know when those
first came out there was the core going
for like 250 then they went on sale for
late you know Bose reduced the price to
like 200 now they're going for like 150
even though they're bulky they do
perform pretty well but again I'm not
the biggest fan of truly Wireless year
but personally unless its ear pods and
you know when I use ear pods I'm network
of the mic when I when I use ear pods I
don't use them to like listen to music I
use them whenever I'm out and I'm going
to be consuming a podcast or something I
use that to listen to podcast I use them
to take phone calls ask Siri to do
things if she's competent enough but I'm
not the biggest fan of truly wireless
earbuds that's why you know I have such
a big focus on headphones so we go to
wicking into the unboxing flip the
camera around flip the camera around man
alright so during is the livestream on
Wednesday I actually thought it was
highly unlikely that the JBL charge for
was
to be going on sale because those that
speaker when I retail is for $150 right
now I think it's on sale for like $130
super jealous because you know I picked
that I picked that speaker up a few
weeks ago for 150 now it's going for 130
also the boombox is going for like 380
or 390 the extreme to get a close one
the extreme to the extremes who's going
on sale for like 250 I actually released
the video last yesterday featuring is
that that speaker against the Marshall
Kilburn tree which is also on sale for
like 250 oh the flip for actually got a
close-up on though on the red one the
little red one the flip for that guy is
on sale for like sixty four sixty
dollars I think $70 that's a good that's
a good price
even though I'm not the biggest fan of
JBL headphones in general I'm a really
big a fan of their speakers and the
pulse 3 get a close-up on the post 3 is
that the one of the lights okay now you
know that guy is on sale for 120 but
just keep in mind the polls 3 is just a
slightly souped up flip for with a very
nice life feature but if you're looking
for speakers definitely definitely JBL
is the way to go and actually cameraman
get me the extreme one over there in the
corner
I've actually been if you want move the
box I've actually Oh careful with Rick
okay oh you just killed Rick god no okay
so I've actually been getting a lot of
questions about the extreme one the
extreme one is going on is on sale for a
hundred and fifty dollars that's 50% off
from its original retail price from when
it was new but now the extreme two is
out that speakers going for about two
hundred dollars
I would only pick up the extreme one if
you have absolutely no plans on picking
up any other speakers in the future you
think the safer investment right now
would be to pick something up that has
JBL connect plus because who knows maybe
in the summer you say hey I want to pick
up another JBL speaker but if you pick
up the extreme one you
I'm gonna be able to connect any other
speakers because the extreme one is
never going to have JBL connect plus
because of hardware limitations whereas
if you wanna right now I would actually
highly recommend you guys pick up the
charge three because I think the charge
three is on sale for like 90 bucks
there isn't a big difference between the
charge three and the charge form and the
charge three actually has a firmware
update available for it to have JBL
connect plus now if so if so whenever I
do my reviews I can actually hook up the
post three extreme to flip for charge
for boombox
all up to the charge three because it
has that JBL connect plus firmware
update so again longevity-wise
longevity-wise I think it's it's it's it
would be better to avoid the extreme one
and pick up the charge three or the
charge for just because if you you have
the option of being able to get more
speakers in in the future and that's and
that's kind of your command to me man
this is awesome okay and that's kind of
why I gave the wind to the extreme to in
yes in yesterday's video over the
marshal Kilburn - I actually really like
that speaker and it's an I'm a really
big fan of its design and if you haven't
noticed by now I'm a really big stickler
for design but since the marshal - you
can't pair it up and not marshal - since
the kilburn - since you can't pair it up
to other speakers in the future you're
dropping $300 on a speaker you know you
can't go out and pick up let's say a $70
speaker like the flip for and pair it up
to your extreme - so I think
longevity-wise having that ability to
connect other speakers together is kind
of what gave the extreme to the wind but
the marshal Kilburn - has better battery
life than the extreme - has more bass so
there's a lot to like about the extra
about the marshal Kilburn - but you got
to know what you're getting into
so i think that answered the question
very well
yeah alright so shouldn't be snapping
next to the mic so let's gonna get into
the headphones now huh I don't know
about Samsung but guys I
these headphones last Saturday and I
paid for the expedited shipping and
Samsung said we'd get the expedited
shipping and we'll have this over to you
by Tuesday these iPhones didn't arrive
until Friday so I don't know and you
know the thing is I'm not I'm not it's
not a FedEx or UPS problem
it's Samsung didn't even ship these
headphones out until Tuesday they didn't
ship out from the warehouse so okay well
then wait so if we're doing like this
note hold on I just don't want to I just
don't want to open it upside down hold
on okay so we're gonna do the reveal you
ready ready one two three
Oh oh that's a very nice case and this
case is very similar to to the 1000x and
threes but I can already tell these are
some big boys hold on hold on let's get
this thing out here okay so they both
have just like the Microsoft Surface
headphones they all have a fabric outer
shell if we give me give me like a Down
shot here this guy is way thicker
whereas this is much more low-profile
and the Microsoft Surface these this is
more wedge but you know has a larger
surface area but the texture on this is
much more it's much more raised it's you
can definitely feel the fabric you but
there's some very nice branding up here
look at that not bad not bad
you know I can live with that I kind of
like the blank look here but all right
so let's go ahead and open this bad boy
up see if these are worthy of that if
design Oh huh hmm yeah these are bulky
but they do fold up lightweight they
look like metal but they're not oh wow
they're click there and this and that's
very lightweight these actually look
very similar to the JBL Everest elite
750 and
see and okay oh this this these ear cups
there's a lot of friction I guess it
takes a lot of effort to actually turn
these see if that breaks and tension
yeah hmm
these year cups are looking pretty
narrow these yeah this this is this
looks to me like a rebodied JBL Everest
elite 750 and see and you know like I
said earlier JBL I love their speakers
the headphones on the other hand could
use some work which was left which is
right
do they is there a thing oh there it is
no no because I'm used to like having
two things over here okay so we got the
things here but actually check these
buttons out I actually really like these
buttons that very quickly very tactile
very nice let me see what we got okay
oh come on come on
that's a micro that's a micro USB port
camera man get my face if your product
is coming out in late 2018 basically
2019 we want to see USB see charging
come on and also the charge for again
Samsung owns AKG Samsung's owns Harman
Samsung owns JBL I don't get why these
headphones came came with USB see
charger because again keep in mind every
time Samsung sells a Galaxy whatever
they would ideally like you to purchase
their headphones so why would their
phones have a USB see charging towards
but not their headphones their
headphones has a micro USB charging port
and I remember when there would be
studio threes when those first came out
that was you know that was one of the
biggest like what the heck why do do the
Beats Studio threes have Micro USB not
on now the Lightning port light my
iPhone so hmm
that sucks all right so let's go okay oh
okay
so let's put this out of sick
actually what does that a seven that's
my lucky number seven okay
so we're gonna try these guys on for the
first time see if they are big had
approved
I'm very iffy on these all right that's
kind of weird okay all right
okay okay no um I don't they're not bad
you're not that they have a very little
clamping force which is something which
is something that now that I've been
using the Microsoft Surface headphones
for a while now these headphones have a
very very snug fit you're not they're
not uncomfortable like the Bauer's and
welcomes px but these guys these guys do
you have a very snug fit so you know for
me if you have a bigger head these
aren't too good for me right now but the
clamping force on these is very similar
to the clamping force on these now the
ear cups they are actually doing a very
good job of cupping your ear they're not
too big that's one of the things about
the bose qc25 series to their ear cups
are very big they're very spacious but
for me since my ears aren't that big
they are they're too big so so this is
kind of that happy medium that these ear
cups or more are they more spacious than
the 1000x m3 is that's yeah a little bit
they're a little bit more spacious than
the 1000x entries it definitely gave me
more spacious than the question 360s but
but you know this is this ear cups
feeling good feeling good so all right
look at that I think is this Alcantar it
looks like Alcantara on the bottom side
that's a that's definitely a play a play
out of both boses design right there
that's one of the things you know make
them cool they have a little bit of
Alcantara bottom portion over the ear
cup of the headband it's not a big deal
it's nice but yeah alright we got a new
the questions going on there or what
alright guys so let's see do we have
actually we can hook it up to this
father hold on sure so yep still getting
used to using the older iPhone again
bluetooth on let's see how do you think
oh it's a little sweat school Oh
okay so the anc just kicked in and you
can really feel it okay actually say
something something we're not doing this
again
recites a meme the story of Darth
Plagueis the wise gulp no that's like
that's the ending I need you to do the
whole thing I forgot you know I hear
guys have yeah Jedi ever told you the
story of Darth Plagueis the wise and
Anakin guys no no and then star Sirius
goes and then it's like sinister the
sinister joining me alright um hmm okay
so and see on these headphones
oh these headphones without a doubt have
more cabin pressure then the bose qc25
and that's one of the reasons why you
know even though they're very
comfortable there are their build
quality is very very good for me they're
built their their cabin pressure is just
too much and this I don't know if you
saw it on the camera but once once these
powered on it hit me like a truck and oh
this is this is this is too much cabin
pressure oh man how long that we go on
has the last room been going to find you
22 minutes okay so I think we're gonna
wrap up there because you know I'm not
gonna do like a sound test or or
whatever but well actually you know
don't we have accessories in here or
something let's hold on okay so there's
like a little net in here and okay so
this is only going to fit the headphones
one went okay okay so they do fold flat
I think I guess why okay well no wait
how do you put this away is there like
this or is it like that what yeah okay I
think that looks right all right I think
I guess I know why I had these
headphones haven't been very popular
because that a inseam is just way way
too much I mean one of them just like
some people whenever they review their
phones mkbhd for a reason for for
example he says that he has his pillars
as to what makes a great smartphone for
me you know I'm trying to develop my own
pillars as to what makes a great pair of
headphones number one is going to be fit
and comfort if your if your headphones
don't fit well then you're not gonna
want to wear them you got a big head
that's why I do the whole big head of
proof thing because you know I got guys
who are cranially gifted and you know
headphones can be a little harder to buy
for them especially over there over the
Internet's so yeah definitely comfort is
something that I do always stress
another thing is going to be the sound
quality you don't want the base to
sputter whenever the base is really
going on and that's one of the issues
I'm having with the Microsoft Surface
headphones if the base on these do like
to sputter whenever it gets deep or
whenever whenever it gets going or
whenever you know if the volume is too
up high the base on these does start to
sputter sputtering base is acceptable
for like a $200 pair of headphones and
down buffer $350 I don't want any
sputtering in my in my headphones so
that's one and that's another issue that
I'm definitely gonna be talking about in
the full review for these so yeah sound
quality is butter if they're NC
headphones I'm always always definitely
looking for headphones that I have a
little bit of cat the less cabin
pressure the better
now all a NC headphones have to be able
to block out constant low-frequency
sounds like whenever you're on a bus and
you hear the constant
or an or in an airplane those constant
low frequency sounds ANC headphones
better better be able to block that out
and then if if they're able to block out
chatter then that's kind of like a step
up for ANC headphones that's why I've
always liked the 1000 X and choose so
much over the Bose QC 35 s these both of
those headphones are able to block out
the low-frequency sounds but when it
comes to chatter the M choose do do a
little better of blocking out those
random high frequency sounds Evander
Bose and then and and and you know it
does it with having less cabin pressure
than the Bose and then the M threes does
all all of that but a little bit more
with you know with the same amount of
low cabin pressure so those are
definitely the pillars that I look for
and then now battery life I'm looking
for like a 25 hour or plus battery life
fast charging is always nice and I also
want my headphones to be able to pair
our multiple devices at the same time
something that the Sony headphones just
don't do I mean technically you can get
it to work but it's not it's not it's
not like full if that makes sense it's
it's kind of like watered down so yeah
those are the pillars I look for right
now first impressions I can tell you
these guys just completely failed on
those I'm gonna have to do the ANC test
see how much noise are actually blocking
out but there's there's a lot of cabin
pressure here way more than the bose
qc25 s I would expect this amount of
cabin pressure from like a pair of
headphones from like 2015 V these don't
have too much cabin pressure but the
hell so are they blocking out too much
noise but again I gotta get the the the
ANC test going so we can get like an
actual look at how much noise these
headphones are actually blocking out now
before we head out let's actually have a
look at the cables actually you're
getting a pair of this is not this is
nice this is nice okay so you're
actually getting a pair of braided
cables you got an airplane adapter
alright there's that oh actually that
reminds
I don't think these came with an
airplane adapter but airplane adapters
they don't really matter because the
reason why airplanes have two sockets is
because of redundancy if one breaks then
you can just use the other one and then
that way the company doesn't have to pay
to like repair or replace the whole
chair so so airplane adapters isn't a
big deal you'll be fine if you just have
one audio jack and here is the audio
cable and yes yes thank you we have a
good quality audio cable like I said
yesterday like I've said in past videos
ah 2.5 No
all right whatever all right so like so
it's a 3.5 millimeter audio cable but a
2.5 for the headphones this is the same
set of the bose qc25 s has going
personally I would prefer if they have
3.5 and 3.5 but it's whatever but unlike
the 1000 X and threes unlike the
Microsoft Surface headphones unlike the
bose qc25 s this audio cable is actually
nice as long is braided feels like
quality I like this and there's also a
little built-in remotes so oh and
actually that makes sense because the
Samsung phones actually still have an
audio cable okay
all right Sam Samsung I see what you did
there that that's a good idea
all right but other than that do we have
any questions in the comments I was
thinking about it but those guys are
like $600 so so first I have to wrap up
with these headphones and then get to
the Sennheiser headphones maybe I'll get
to those headphones because $600 for a
pair of headphones is a lot but those
are you know like normal ANC headphones
you know these are all $350 those are
$600 but those are more for like
entertainment so you use them at home
but I think those are like marketed as
you can use them at home or take them on
the go so I'll probably get to those
maybe in a few weeks and maybe
next month or something but right now I
think priority is going to be the 1000x
and my three versus the Microsoft
Surface headphones versus the AKG and
700 and C's you know there's going to be
a video where I'm not going to be
comparing my favorite agency headphones
I'm gonna be comparing the top know the
newly released agency headphones for
2018 so that video isn't gonna have the
Bose QC 35 s or the Sennheiser pxc 5
fifties just because those headphones
aren't much older so I don't think it
would be fair these are for the boys
that have been released in 2018 and you
know what speaking about the son has is
there a px c5 50s those are also I think
those are on sale for like 50 bucks not
50 bucks I think those are on sale for
for $200 I think they're going up
against the 1000 X 7 threes those
headphones I think they're like two
years or two years that are half old
there they're there they're definitely
pretty old compared to a lot of other
headphones yeah yeah they're yeah
they're going for $200 if I had to pick
yeah 200 hours if I had to pick between
the P XE 550 and C's or the Sony 1000 X
M two's for $200 because even though the
M 2 s or back to like $300 I really do
think they're gonna go back on sale on
Cyber Monday I would go with the Sony's
over the Sennheiser's because the Sony's
are still a little newer than the P XE 5
50s and I really do think we're going to
see a we have to we have to because the
AMC market is just so hot we had really
do think we're gonna see a new version
of the P XE 5 50s at CES 2009 teen I
mean sennheiser and Bo's are definitely
starting to fall behind the pack because
everybody is the headphone agency
headphones right now it is pretty hot or
pretty hot so so I definitely think
we're gonna see a new Sennheiser
headphones from that end so other than
that or we got alright guys
so again happy belated they
giving thank you guys for joining me and
again I'm gonna be active on the post
