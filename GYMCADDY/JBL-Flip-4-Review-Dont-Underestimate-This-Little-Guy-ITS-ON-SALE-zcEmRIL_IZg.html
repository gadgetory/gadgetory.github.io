cookouts camping and parties but what's
a party without music that's where the
new JBL for this little guy is loud
enough to fill any dorm room or get a
small get-together bucket and now
adorable enough to take almost anywhere
because it's finally waterproof so
should you pick this guy up let's find
out all right so the JBL flip 4 comes in
a few different colors black blue grey
red teal and white and every color
currently retails for 99 95 and Amazon
puts them on sale from time to time if
you want to save some cash you can
always pick up the JBL flip three but
you'll be missing out on full
waterproofing never sale quality and a
slightly longer battery life I'll have
links in the description below if you
want to pick into one of these up I'll
keep the links updated so you can get
the best deals okay so let's get the
sucker out of the box there really isn't
much going on it's a nice box for sure
you look the lid and then you look the
cover and you'll see the speaker itself
front and center inside the cover you'll
also find the user manual and a warranty
information and inside the smallest side
compartment you'll also find a micro USB
cable for charging there's no wall board
and no audio cable included which is the
letdown if you ask me but in general the
JBL flip 4 is your standard Bluetooth
speaker that can connect to most devices
this Bluetooth speaker also features a
smart phone app and you can pair up to
100 JBL speakers from one another so
they play music simultaneously
personally I think connecting 100
speakers is overkill or you can also
pair two of these speakers together so
you can play them in stereo mode the dbl
flip for itself is pretty sleek to begin
with but this thing is very dead it
caught me by surprise the first time I
picked it up the majority of the surface
of the speaker is wrapped in the nylon
fabric covering and the end cap and
spine or made out of rugged rubber which
help it be a little durable and provides
a good amount of grip on the spite of
the JBL flip 4 you'll find the power
line of battery gauge the JBL connect
plus button and a tab that covers the
audio jack and micro USB port you'll
also find a Bluetooth buying volume
controls and a multiple purpose Blayne
which all have really good tactile
feedback one press of the triangle or
play button pauses or plays your music
impressive skips attract and if you long
press it you'll activate Siri if you're
using an iPhone but oddly enough you
can't go back a track by triple
precedent so what's the difference
between the JBL flip 4 and the debut
foot 3 you look exactly the same
well for starters the JBL flip 4 is now
ipx7 waterproof which means you can
submerge it in water without any problem
whereas the JBL flip 3 is only splash
proof but even though the JBL flip 4 is
now waterproof one major fly still has
is that it doesn't flow so if
hypothetically if you were using the
speaker next to a pool on a bullet or
next to a lake and the speaker somehow
fell into the water
it'll just sink to the bottom which
could be a problem and when it's
completely submerged in water the
Bluetooth connection will cut out until
you take it out of the water again the
JBL flip for also sounds 20% better than
to JBL from three and will go into sound
quality in just a bit
and finally the JBL flip forward in a
house a 12 hour battery life versus the
flip 3 turn elegantly alright so let's
talk about what matters in that sound
quality the JBL flip for has no problem
filling a room or bathroom and anyone
within a 30 foot radius of this thing
outside will have absolutely no problem
hearing it winter same act value
personally I feel the foot for stance is
best when it's used at a moderate to
moderately high listening volume the
basis punchy and the mids and highs are
clear it's at higher volumes where the
resolution and clarity of the highs are
vocal starts to suffer well for a small
hajjali speaker that is to be expected
this speaker does connect your phone or
other devices via bluetooth for that -
and has a range about a hundred feet
with direct line-of-sight instance of
Bluetooth 42 you can press the two
devices at the same time with UT
beautiful for white now I have a pair to
my iPhone and message and the wireless
connection has no problem going through
multiple walls if they're using it
inside your house but if you prefer a
wide connection the JBL flip or has you
covered like I said earlier there is an
audio jack and I can tell you right now
that it's a really huge bed after
listening to the same songs with and
without a wide connection back to back
I'm happy to report that the overall
sound quality gets better it's much
clearer and it's louder and unlike with
the Bluetooth connection where the sound
quality
suffer on high volumes using a wired
connection really helps keep the
resolution intact alright and now for
the drawbacks for starters even though
you can take phone calls with a
Bluetooth speaker I don't really think
you should when talking at a moderate
level in about five feet away the user
on the other side reported a lot of
distortion and a lot of raspbian in
order for you to get a good sound
quality you need to get really close to
the speaker and at which point it would
just make more sense to take your phone
call from your phone and like I said
earlier even though the speaker is not
waterproof it's still sick also the
speaker only shoots out sound in one
direction personally I don't mind but I
just want to make that clear for people
who might not know but in general the
data of the score is a small speaker
that practice pipe
it's like rocket racoon from Gordon of
the galaxy it's waterproof and you can
take it almost anywhere it has a 12 hour
battery life if not longer depending on
how you use it it's a good first size
and if there are other JBL speakers
lying around you can pair them together
just as long as they have JBL connect
plugs enable the speaker will make you
the life of the party after summer
get-togethers
the JBL flip 4 is a pretty solid
