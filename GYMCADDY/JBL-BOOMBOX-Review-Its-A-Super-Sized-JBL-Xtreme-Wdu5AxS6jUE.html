this is JPL's biggest and most expensive
consumer grade portable bluetooth
speaker and although pricey compared to
other new speakers on the market right
now of the same caliber let's see how
the JBL boombox performs don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe and you go on
to my other videos here after you don't
want in this video and there will be a
sound test at the end of this video to
the JBL boombox currently only comes in
black but JBL says there will be an
olive colorway of the boombox around
January comment down below what other
color ways you would like to see on the
table boombox
currently the JBL boombox retails for
four 49.95 which is a hundred and fifty
dollar price trim from the smaller JBL
extreme which isn't really that extreme
anymore if you want to pick this speaker
up I'll have links to description below
and I'll keep them updated so you can
get the best deal possible the JBL
boombox has the same classic design you
can expect from other JBL portable
bluetooth speakers the boombox is
basically a JBL charge 3 that got a hold
of a Mario mushroom and got super-sized
it's covered by the same nylon mesh
weave that does a great job of repelling
almost everything you throw at it
there's a base on the bottom with a
built-in battery gauge that allows you
to see its current battery status at a
glance on top you've got the same binds
as the charged 3 and extreme there's a
multi-function button to control your
music playback volume controls a
bluetooth pairing bian and JBL's connect
plus button also if you press and hold
the multifunction button you can
activate Siri on the back there's a
rubber grommet that houses two USB port
so you can charge up to two devices at
the same time and AC in for charging and
audio jack and a microUSB port for
service aside from the power cable and
owner's manual the JBL boombox doesn't
come included with anything else when
laid flat the JBL boombox is 10 inches
tall 19 and a half inches wide and has a
death of 7.7 inches in a weighs a modest
11 and a half pounds for everybody else
using the SI system the JBL boombox is
twenty five point five by forty nine
point five by nineteen point six
centimeters and it weighs five point two
five kilos regarding speaker setup the
JBL boombox has dual four inch woofers
and dual 1.7 nine inch tweeters on the
front and the
side just like all other JBL speakers
there are a dual passive radiators with
the diameter of four point one seven
inches unique to the JBL boom ice is a
plastic carrying handle and
unfortunately it doesn't come off and
you can't attach a shoulder strap like
you can on the JBL extreme
although the handle does make carrying
the boombox around easy after a while of
lugging the boom box around it does get
hard partially I think JBL should have
included a shoulder strap option as well
because for long walks you're gonna wish
he had it trust me
the JBL boom box also has a new sound
mode laying on the back you can choose
from either indoor or outdoor mode while
in indoor mode the sound of the speaker
has a little more death in the bass is
much deeper but when an outdoor mode the
overall sound gets pushed forward and
the bass isn't as pronounced unless you
know what to listen for or listening to
music with a lot of bass you're not
really going to notice a difference
between the two modes at first tech
specs on the JBL boombox is pretty
standard when it comes to newer JBL
speakers you've got bluetooth 4.2 and
you can pair up to two devices at the
same time and it's good for a wireless
range of 70 feet with the right
line-of-sight to your phone not bad if
you plan on using this outside on a
regular basis it's ipx7 certified so
water is it a problem you can even
submerge it and it won't even care and
just like the JBL pull 3 the JBL boombox
also floats in water and keeps playing
music like a boss the table boom box is
also rocking or rechargeable 20,000
milliamp battery and the box claims it's
good for up to 24 hours of playback time
and honestly I've only managed to get
that 24 hour battery life on the JBL
boombox by having it at a moderate
volume and while in outdoor mode when
using the JBL boom box in the slightly
better sounding indoor mode and a
moderate volume I averaged about 21
hours of playback time and when the JBL
boom box was at max volume a Wilding
indoor mode
I got about 17 I was a playback time
nonetheless the JBL boombox has a very
solid battery life but in order to
charge the JBL boombox from an empty
battery to full it's gonna take a little
more than six hours and unfortunately
there is no official quick charging
controlling sound quality a huge
elo plays it safe with the JPL boombox I
mean it sounds good with almost every
genre of music the speaker has good
estimate separation in a white
soundstage
but the main focal point of this speaker
are the vocals admits bass is also good
in at times there's even spine-tingling
sub bass but although this speaker does
get loud I did expect it to get louder
and max volume the JBL boombox has an
average decibel reading in the mid 80s
rates but at that max volume the serous
age does get a little narrow and stuff
starts to roll off personally I think
the speaker sounds is best all the way
up to the 85% volume arc but just to be
clear that's why the speaker is an
indoor mode but also let me be the first
to tell you that this speaker does
require a break-in period it's also
worth mentioning that two JBL boombox
does sound a little better when it's
plugged into the charger that one is
simply being powered by the built-in
battery and this isn't surprising
because this is the same case with the
JBL extreme the combined output power of
the JBL boombox when powered by the AC
charger is 30 watts
whereas what is being powered by the
battery the combined output power gets
reduced to 20 watts and obviously it
does this for battery life the JBL
boombox also connects to JBL's connect
tab and for the most part the app
doesn't do much you can see your current
battery status toggle from indoor mode
to outdoor mode or you can upgrade your
speaker to relay this firmware but
unfortunately you can't adjust the EQ so
you'll have to use a third-party app to
do that but the app is handy when you
have to manage multiple JBL speakers
when you have them paired together as
mentioned before the JBL boombox is
using JBL connect plus with JBL connect
plus you can connect up to 100 JBL
connect plus and able speakers together
and have them play music and sync right
now the JBL boombox can only be paired
to the JBL flip 4 and the JBL pulls 3
because they were both using JBL connect
plus so you can't pair the JBL boombox
to the GBO charge 3 or the JBL extreme
which are using the older JBL connect
but there's still hope
representatives on JBL's forums have
stated that the JBL charge 3 should be
receiving a firmware update so they can
connect to JBL connect plus enabled
speakers the update for the JBL charge
three should be avail
in mid-october but it's still subject to
change so it could still get pushed back
or might not even come out at all the
representatives however have also stated
that due to technological limitations
the JBL extreme will not be receiving
any such form or update so there's still
hope that the JBL charge 3 will still be
able to pair with the JBL boombox flip 4
and pull 3 but the JBL extreme will
never be able to pair with the JBL boom
box at all and it's also worth
mentioning if you have two JBL boom
boxes you can pair them together and
have them play left and right stereo
audio and pairing multiple speakers
together is super easy all you have to
do is press the JBL can I plus buy an
awning speaker and you're done just like
all other JBL because the boombox also
has a built-in microphone and right now
I'm standing about five feet away and
personally I don't think the microphone
sounds that good but it'll get the job
done but this audio clip is being
recorded by the microphone on the
boombox so you can visit up to that
overall the JBL boombox is a very
durable and good sounding speaker it's
built like a tank
it gets louder than the JBL extreme and
the JBL charge 3 but it's still small
and light enough that carrying it around
isn't as big of a hassle like larger
speakers in its price segment although I
would really like to have a shoulder
strap option as well whether you're
using too JBL boom acts at a moderate
listening level for personal use or at
full volume while hosting a get-together
the rechargeable battery will last you
multiple listening sessions something
the sony xba-4 XP 90 can't do sure it's
pricey but if Portability and battery
life are your top priorities while still
having big sound then the JBL boombox is
right for you okay it's time for the
sound sense
just a heads up the JBL boom box is in
indoor mode as always all of these
speakers are playing in the same room at
the same decibel level streaming from
the same device so hopefully the only
difference here is sound quality
