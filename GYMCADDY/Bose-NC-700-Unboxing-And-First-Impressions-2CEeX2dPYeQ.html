unboxing and first impressions video on
the brand new bose noise-canceling
headphones 700 which from your net we're
just going to be referring to as the
bose 700 now the first thing I want to
address about these headphones has got
to be their design now just going off of
the comments on my last recent post
featuring these headphones the seven
hundreds have proven to have a rather
polarizing design some people love it
some people hate it some people or more
down the middle like me but now actually
getting to see these headphones in
person I gotta admit I don't hate how
they look they definitely look much
sleeker and much different from
everything else out there but definitely
during the development of these
headphones somebody in boses boardroom
went and said hey listen if somebody's
going to be wearing our headphones out
in public we want everybody else to know
that they're wearing a pair of Bose
headphones and they've definitely
managed to do that because these
headphones really do look very different
from most of the headphones out there
which at the end of the day most
headphones do look very similar to one
another
the only headphones that I can think of
right now that kind of share some type
of resemblance to the Bose 700 is maybe
the Bowers and Wilkins px but
design-wise personally they're growing
on you but putting a side designed
because ultimately that's all subjective
what I'm really interested about these
headphones has got to be their build
quality and their functionality now one
of the things I couldn't help but think
when I first took these headphones out
of the box was that I don't think the
700 are going to be as rough or as
rugged as the QC 35 s now let me wrong
the 700 you have seemingly good build
quality and they better cuz there are
$400 headphones but I do think you're
gonna have to take it a little
easier on these headphones then you were
with the QC 35 now I'm not saying that
these headphones are dainty but
definitely you do want to keep them
looking fresh now one of the biggest
differences between these headphones and
the QC 35 s has got to be the underside
of the headband there's no more
Alcantara it's now all silicon and when
you actually flex the headband
it looks like the headband is more
fitting a little bit so I think it looks
cool it looks like a looks a little
alien now the top portion of the
headband is also silicone now personally
I did think that this top portion was
going to be leatherette from the product
pictures but it's actually all silicone
which it's actually collecting a whole
bunch of little fibers no that's not I
don't know that's not cool but
regardless the seven-hundred still have
those trademark super spacious ear cups
which are effectively what made the bose
qc25 s so popular and so comfortable and
just like before the 700s do have that
same great feeling mouth all right as
the QC 35 s and it still feels better
than the leatherette found on the 1000x
and threes and it still feels slightly
better than the leather i'd found unto
new XP 910 but with all that out of the
way i'm actually going to put these
headphones on for the very first time
let's see if these new headphones are as
comfortable as the QC 35 s or who knows
maybe the this new yoke design has
altered the way these headphones fit and
rest on your head but let's see if these
headphones are just as comfortable again
they're gonna go on my head for the very
first time right now oh then we gotta
stretch this out a little bit yeah I
gotta say you're just as comfortable as
the QC 35 s now personally I was a
little worried that this new yoke design
was going to change the way that these
headphones have rest on your head cuz
they don't have as much range of motion
compared to the QC 35 s or the 1000s and
threes but you know what I think that
was my biggest concern about this new
design was that the yoke was going to
limit or change
the way that these headphones rest on
your head but ya know there's still just
as comfortable but I do think they have
more clamping force than the QC 35 is
but definitely still the bow 700 are
still a very pair of super comfortable
headphones okay and we're back now I've
managed to see how I look with these
headphones on and right off the bat one
of the things I can say that I'm not
really a big fan about these headphones
is that how much their headband is
sticking out you know personally I would
have liked if they if this headband been
a little bit more low-profile because a
lot more headphones these days that are
starting to come out or much more
low-profile because let's take for
example the 1000 X and 3's
you can see that they're still and
they're much more you know low-profile
compared to the 700 and even the surface
headphones hold on you see if I throw
these on their headband is super low
profile but if we go over to the QC 35
again these guys have that super you
know round effect here they're not as
low-profile and if we throw on these
700s these are still rocking that you
know not as low-profile headband and
work back unfortunately after an hour
and a half maybe two of trying to get
these headphones to connect to their
companion app unfortunately due to
multiple failed connection attempts I
just haven't been able to get a V Bo 700
to connect to boses new bose music app
which is the companion app that you got
to use if you want to get access to all
of the features on these headphones so
since this is a first impressions video
I gotta say that getting these
headphones connected to their companion
app hasn't been as easy as it typically
is with Debose QC 35 s and boses connect
up now unfortunately I did want to give
you guys a first look of what the app
would look for these headphones but
unfortunately you're gonna have to wait
until the full review hoping that I'm
gonna be able to actually get it to work
but the next thing I want to check out
on these headphones has got to be the
cabin pressure in their active noise
cancellation now I know this might not
go for everyone but for me the active
noise cancellation on the bose qc25 s
does cause me some headaches
again this may not be the case for
everybody but it is for me and it is the
case for a lot of people who comment on
my videos saying that they also
experience a lot of cabin pressure on
the bose qc25 so right now the 700s are
set to zero so thankfully I can still
toggle active noise cancellation on or
off directly with the headphones without
having to use their companion app so
right now there are at 0 and actually I
think 0 means ambient noise is coming
through because I can hear myself
perfectly and you know what it sounds
very natural doesn't sound very
artificial like the ambient modes on
some other headphones like let's say for
example a pair that might come to mind
maybe the ambient mode on the Jabra
elite 85 h's that one does sound a
little artificial but here it actually
sounds very natural so either way we're
gonna go ahead turn on active noise
cancellation see if the cabin pressure
issue has been fixed 3 2 1 okay she just
said 10 and you can you slowly feel a
lot of the ambient noise go away and you
know what I'm not getting any of the
cabin pressure that I typically feel
with the QC 35 there is still a little
something but it's definitely nowhere
near as harsh as the cabin pressure on
the both QC 35 so again like I said this
may not be the case for everyone but one
of the biggest complaints that I've
always had about the bose qc25 s has
been their cabin pressure when you have
their a and c set to 10 and but here
with the 7
it's definitely not as harsh as it is on
the QC 35s and you know it's definitely
much more manageable for me which is
actually a really good thing to see now
the last thing that I will check out on
these headphones has got to be their
touch pads now this has been rather
controversial again because if the 700s
are moving away from physical buttons
like on the QC 35 and instead moving to
a touch pad which granted is just this
little section right here so let's see
what the accuracy is like so we're just
gonna throw up the phone right there
there's Old Town Road am I doing this
right double tap it's a double tap okay
okay double tap pause this and plays oh
hold on that's loud can you okay I'm
very used to Sony lowering and raising
the volume of it okay but okay hold on
let's can we skip skip it's you know the
hold on and pause okay there's
definitely going to be a learning curve
there but right now with the volume it
only it looks like you got it nope hold
on you got a play and you got a like go
up every step all right
in pause that alright so I think we're
gonna leave it at that so this has been
a first impressions video on the new
bose noise-canceling headphones 700 a ka
v 700 or maybe they're gonna go by and
see 700 so i don't know but either way
this has been a first impressions video
so like I said the design of these
headphones has has been rather
polarizing but actually getting to see
them in person I think their design is
actually starting to grow on me they're
still definitely just as comfortable as
appose QC 35 s but personally I don't
think there
want to be as rugged but more
importantly the active noise
cancellation on these at least the cabin
pressure has been improved from the bose
qc25 which is great but definitely we
still got a test them and see how well
they do of blocking out sound so but at
least a cabin pressure first impression
wise a lot better
as for the touchpad I think the touchpad
is a bit too small but maybe there might
be a learning curve maybe I just gotta
get used to it because again I am very
used to the touchpad on the Sony 1000x
and threes but overall the bow 700s have
made a okay first impression when makers
again still these headphones do have a
lot of hype to live up to especially
since you know they're if they're not
replacing the Bose QC 3 5s but you know
the bar has already been set and again
these headphones do have to do a little
better than the bose qc25 is because
these guys are going up from $350 to
$400 but guys I think we're gonna leave
it at that look out for a few videos on
these headphones in the future but other
than that I'll catch you guys next time
