Microsoft did a really good job of
keeping links to a minimum for their
October service event because I was
genuinely surprised when Microsoft
announced a new surface headphones and
even though there are a really good
first tribe the surface headphones still
have a lot of growing up to do in this
increasingly competitive ANC headphone
market the surface headphones are
Microsoft's first in health design
active noise-cancelling headphones and
retail for $350 making them premium ENC
headphones that compete directly with
the sony 1000 XM threes which for
transparency are still my favorites and
most recommended ANC headphones if you
want to pick either of these headphones
up I'll have links on description below
in a few user links really helps out the
channel I suggest you check them out
because you never know when these
headphones might go on sale since the
surface headphones are a pair of lay
flat headphones this is why they come
included with a pretty large hard shell
carrying case so keep that in mind if
you plan on traveling with these
headphones or on a regular basis these
headphones also come included with a 3.5
to 3.5 mm audio cable I'll be it
I do feel this audio cable is pretty
cheap for a pair of $350 cans but for
those wondering these guys can be used
passively which is good and finally
these headphones are also come included
with a USB a two USB C charging cable
which is also good to see cuz we're kind
of in this middle ground where some
companies are starting to fully embrace
USB C and some other companies are
stinking to microUSB as a cost savings
measure now I really have to give credit
where credit is due
the hardware here is amazing even though
they're not using premium materials like
real leather fabrics or high amount of
metal these headphones just feel very
premium these headphones have a slate
matte finish all around the underside of
the headband is silicone and the
headband also has a very sturdy and
satisfying click to it whenever you
adjust it moving down to the ear cups
the volume and ANC does rotate very
smoothly in either direction and the
padding on these ear cups is not too
soft
but not too firm the only criticisms I
have about the build quality of these
headphones is that when you tap on the
touch pads you hear a lot of springing I
also hate how flush the power button is
on these headphones
and I would have preferred if the habit
itself had a little more padding but
overall the build quality headphones is
great and I'm a really big fan of these
headphones your overall design but when
it comes to fit and comfort there are a
few things I need to point out when I
first saw the surface headphones I was
worried that due to their circular ear
cups that we're going to rest on you
yellow because that's what happens with
most of the cans that have circular cups
and this is why I always prefer oval ear
cups but thankfully the circular cups
here are just for aesthetics these ear
cups still have an oval cut out if you
have medium flush tears the surface
headphone should fit you just fine but
they're not as spacious as the sony 1000
X and 3 and definitely not as spacious
as the bose qc25
but they are more spacious than the sony
1000 x m2 but when it comes to their
clamping force the surface headphones do
have a very snug fit even after a good
break-in period the surface headphones
still have a more snug fit than I would
like and I do get wear in fatigue after
about an hour so for those reasons these
headphones are not big head approved
when it comes to tech specs these
headphones have an advertised battery
life of 15 hours with a and C turned on
but unfortunately a 15 hour battery life
these days is below average if Microsoft
wants to be competitive we need to see
something around the 25 hour mark the
surface headphones also have fast
charging but again it's below average
microsoft claims of 5 minute charge will
get you about an hour of playback time
but the sony is getting you 5 hours of
playback time from a 10 minute charge
and the bose qc25 is getting you two and
a half hours from a 15 minute charge and
overall the surface headphones barely
managed to last me a week from a full
charge but the surface headphones can be
connected to more than one device at a
time which is great if you're a power
user and it's one of my biggest gripes
with Sony's headphones in general and if
you're an iPhone user the surface
headphones you also have very little
latency making them good for watching
youtube videos on your phone which again
is one of the m3s biggest weak points
and when it comes to active noise
cancellation on the surface headphones
it's actually pretty decent they don't
block out as much No
as last year Sony 1000 xm2 or dis year
Sony 1000 xm3 but they do block out as
much a noise as the bose qc25
and they do so with less cabin pressure
than the Bose but definitely the surface
headphones has and the easier time
blocking out constant low-frequency
sounds like road noise and does struggle
a bit when it comes to a random higher
frequency sounds like chatter
so yeah like I said Al see on the
surface headphones is decent there's no
hissing and it's a very good first try
the surface headphones do have a little
bit more cab impression than both of
Sony's premium A&amp;amp;C headphones but it's
definitely more manageable than Bose
escapa pressure the surface headphones
also do a very good job of preventing
wind noise when using ANC outdoors and
that's cuz they're NC mics or slightly
recessed into the body similar to what
Sony has going on on their headphones
now like I mentioned earlier these
headphones also have rotating dials on
both of its ear cups the left one
controls a and C and the right one
controls volume and personally I really
like these dials because you can
manually and quickly switch from a and C
high to enhance mode which pumps in all
of the ambient sound around you to give
you an open-back headphones fact which
is useful if you're walking around in
the city or even if you're in an office
but my problem with Microsoft's enhanced
mode is that it's filtering and letting
in the wrong sounds and has one of these
headphones pumps in noise pollution like
the rumbling of an air-conditioning unit
or road noise if you're in a car not
people's voices so whenever someone
talks their voice sounds incredibly
muffled through enhance mode and for
comparison sony has their own ambient
sound control they let you control how
much ambient noise you want to let in
and they also do a much better job of
still blocking out the noise pollution
you don't want but let's in people's
voices
so like I said I feel enhanced mode on
the surface headphones it is working in
Reverse and it's not just a simulation I
was having the same issues when I was
out in public with these headphones but
now let's focus on the right dial this
dial controls your phone's volume and
can still locally adjust a volume if the
headphones are used with a wired
connection while powered on both the
left and right ear cups have touch pads
that respond to the same gestures and
they respond very well
tap wants to play a pause tap twice the
skipper track and tap thrice to go back
a track personally I just use the right
touch pad because I'm a righty but as of
right now you can't dedicate media
controls to one year cut and have
reassigned hotkeys to the other ear cup
and there's no word if these touch pads
can respond to swipes like the m3 scan
but I really do hope Microsoft pushes
out some software updates giving you
more control over these touch pads
because there's a lot of potential here
for PC and Android users just imagine
being able to assign double tapping to
the left ear cup to open up a program or
a game on your PC now when it comes to
sound quality the surface headphones are
very average estimate separation in the
mids is very weak in the same stage is
very narrow so everything just tends to
blend together right out of the box
these headphones have a flat sound
signature but through the Cortana app
you can go and adjust EQ which is
something I always like to see but my
biggest issue with these $350 headphones
is that their bass does tend to sputter
pretty often sputtering isn't an issue
if you listen to these headphones at 50
percent volume but if you listen to them
at 80 percent or higher than sputtering
is going to be more common the surface
headphones also sound very different
with ANC turned on or in enhanced mode
and this is very common for ENC
headphones an enhanced mode the
soundstage on these headphones opens up
a little bit and the sputtering becomes
less frequent but it still happens now
for the most part if you want to get the
best sound quality out of your anc
headphones you should listen to them
with active noise cancellation turn off
but unfortunately I haven't been able to
figure out how to turn a and C or
enhance mode off on these headphones
another feature I haven't figured out
how to turn off on these headphones is
these have
auto play and auto pause feature now
when you take these headphones off
they're automatically positive music and
when you put it back on they're gonna
start playing your music again now this
feature works very well and it doesn't
randomly start playing and pausing you
music when you're walking around like
the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px which also have
this feature but personally I would
prefer to have this feature turn off
I've just never been a fan of this
feature in general and other headphones
but another thing Microsoft is really
pushing on these headphones is Cortana
integration and a lot of agency
headphones these days have some sort of
voice assistant integration Sony is Team
Google and Beau's plays nice with both
Google and Alexa at least for now in
order to summon Cortana you can either
press and hold on the touchpad or you
can just say hey Cortana which is
actually the faster of the two methods
hey Cortana what is the current price of
Microsoft Microsoft is at one hundred
and six point five trading up three
point three eight percent as a 3:30 4:00
p.m. Eastern Standard Time and Cortana
can be pretty useful she greets you and
tells you how much battery life you have
when you power on the headphones hi
you've got about seven hours of battery
left you are connected to I phone next s
max she tells you when you have
notifications and you can ask her to do
a lot of things you wouldn't normally
ask Google assistant but the thing I
like about Cortana is that when you
summon her with the hot word you have to
pause for a second and then talk and
this is pretty jarring cuz we've gotten
so used to Alexa and Google assistant
where you don't have to pause you just
say the hot word and keep talking hey
what's that the orbs heretics at the orb
to green so this pause makes Cortana
feel a little dated compared to other
voice assistants and like I said earlier
using the hot word to summon Cortana is
faster than pressing and holding on the
touchpad
whereas for comparison both of Sony's
and Moses headphones have a dedicated
physical button that you can assign to
your voices system so as soon as you
press and hold this
you can just start talking what's the
current price of Bitcoin 1 BTC equals
3,740 United States dollars and having a
dedicated physical button to summon your
voice assistant on your headphones is by
far the fastest most efficient and most
accurate way to interact with your voice
assistant using your voice with the
surface headphones is cool but I think
Microsoft would have been much better
off just using a physical button or they
need to update Cortana to at least get
rid of that pause but another thing I
want to point out about these headphones
is that there's no voice mapping during
the setup process so anyone can just run
up to you and say hey Cortana and just
try to mess with you now yeah you can
always just turn off the mic but still
some people might still want to try to
troll you it's kind of like the early
days of Xbox one voice commands so you
know that's always a possibility with
these headphones if you've made it this
forward comment down below if you prefer
Halo or a Gears of War
personally I prefer user work but this
is the microphone test on these circuits
headphones and it's decent but it could
be better but this audio clipping is
being recorded by the microphones found
on the Microsoft Surface headphones so
you can refer to that so like I said at
the beginning of this video I feel that
Microsoft's new surface headphones are
all really good first try even though I
really do like the hardware the still
room for improvement when it comes to
sound quality enhance mode the way you
interact with your voices system and
better life and like I mentioned earlier
I see a lot of potential here for PC
power users if Microsoft gives you more
control over those two touch pads but
I'm not going to sit here and tell you
that the surface headphones are a
disappointment or vastly inferior to
their Sony 1000x and threes because it
literally took Sony three tries to get
there and see headphones right and still
there are a few things I would like to
see improved on the 1000x and threes and
the surface headphones does a few things
better than the 1,000 xn3 but if you're
in the market for a pair of premium anc
headphones I still think you're better
off with the Sony 1000x and threes but
I'm still pretty excited to see where
Microsoft goes with the surface
