pair of truly wireless earbuds the obvious
answer is AirPods…
But the same hasn’t been true for android
users until now.
Even though the market is flooded with truly
wireless earbuds who’s prices range from
$50 dollars to $1,000 dollars, have different
features and styles… not many have been
able to hit the same dollar to performance
ratio found on the AirPods.
But I think thats finally changed with Samsung’s
new Galaxy Buds.
But first let me explain what I mean by dollar
to performance ratio.
Let’s take the Sennheiser Momentum true
wireless earbuds for example…
Over all I really like these earbuds.
They sound fantastic, they fit well, they
have an ambient sound feature which is very
useful, you can watch videos with them cause
they don’t have latency issues, their touch
pads are very accurate, they look good, and
their charging case isn’t that much bigger
than the AirPods.
But at $300 I personally find it very hard
to justify paying that much for a pair of
truly wireless earbuds.
And if we look at cheaper wireless earbuds
that are sub $200, you’ll notice they’re
very bulky, they’ll might be specifically
geared towards working out, or will suffer
from connection issues or have a lot of latency
just making them not suitable for watching
videos with.
But the Galaxy Buds on the other hand retail
for $130 and tick off all the right boxes
which make them a no brainier for any android
user to pick up.
First off theres the fit, the galaxy buds
are tiny compared to a lot of other truly
wireless earbuds out there.
Since they’re so small they’re barely
even noticeable when you have them in and
since they’re so light weight they never
fall out.
Now the galaxy buds also come included with
a few pairs of ear fins which are supposed
to give you a more secure fit, but since even
the largest pair of ear fins barely manage
to do anything for me I just don’t use them.
And personally I don’t mind that the Galaxy
Buds don’t come with larger ear fins cause
it would have also meant their carrying case
would have to be larger to accommodate for
the larger ear fins.
And I think that when ever you’re looking
into a pair truly wireless earbuds you also
have to take their carrying case into heavy
consideration cause you’re going to have
to carry it around all the time.
I think that one the main reasons why AirPods
are so popular is because their carrying case
is just so small.
AirPods still have one of the smallest and
best preforming carrying cases out there compared
to newer and more expensive options out there.
Now even though the Galaxy Buds carrying case
is just a little bigger than the AirPods…
its still a lot smaller than most other carrying
cases out there.
Which means the Galaxy Buds are just as easy
to carry around with you as AirPods.
But AirPods still significantly out perform
the Galaxy Buds when it comes to battery life.
The AirPods have an advertised battery life
of 25 plus hours of total playback time.
The AirPods can go for 5 straight hours and
their case can supply an additional 4 or 5
full charges.
Where as the galaxy buds have an advertised
battery life of 13 hours of total playback
time.
The Buds themselves can go for 6 straight
hours and the case can supply an additional
7 hours of playback time.
Even though the Galaxy Buds are technically
lagging behind the AirPods when it comes to
battery life… their battery life is technically
average compared to a lot of other truly wireless
earbuds on the market.
Galaxy Buds aren’t lacking, AirPods are
just over achievers when it comes to battery
life.
And for me when my AirPods were new I could
go about 5 days in between chargers where
as the Galaxy Buds can go about 2 days in
between charges.
Now thankfully the Galaxy Buds also have fast
charging which a lot of other truly wireless
earbuds in this price segment don’t have.
If you drop the buds into their charging case
from a dead battery for 15 minutes they’ll
get you almost 2 hours of playback time.
But still fast charging on the Galaxy Buds
is still lagging behind the AirPods cause
from the same 15 minutes they’ll get you
3 hours of playback time.
But the Galaxy Buds give you multiple options
to charge their case.
If you want you can charge them through their
USB-C charging port or you can charge them
wirelessly.
But the most talked about feature on the Galaxy
Buds is being able to charge them with power
share on the Galaxy S10.
And personally I think this is a great feature
to have cause if you’re ever caught with
a dead battery you can just charge them up
from anywhere.
Another great feature the Galaxy Buds have
over the AirPods is an ambient mode.
Now an ambient mode or transparency mode is
quickly becoming standard on a lot of other
truly wireless earbuds and I feel its sorely
lacking on the AirPods.
But the fact that the Galaxy Buds even has
a transparency mode in its price segment is
impressive.
But most importantly the Galaxy Buds also
have a quick ambient mode where if you press
and hold on one of the touch pads they’ll
lower the volume of your music and pump in
all of the ambient sound so you can quickly
talk to someone with out having to take your
ear buds out.
And having an ambient mode in general is super
useful because you can still be aware of your
surroundings while you’re listening to music.
So if you’re walking around in the city
you can still hear cars passing by or if you’re
sitting in a waiting room you’ll still be
able to hear when your name gets called.
And just so you can get a better understanding
of what Quick Ambient mode is, heres a demo
of quick attention on the Sony 1000xM3’s
which is the same as quick ambient mode on
the galaxy buds.
But one of the most important features the
Galaxy Buds has over other truly wireless
earbuds is their wireless connectivity set
up.
Now the Galaxy Buds have bluetooth 5.0, but
more importantly each ear bud establishes
a connection with their phone just like AirPods
do.
So instead of like other truly wireless earbuds
that have a master and slave set up where
one ear bud is connected to your phone and
relays the audio to the other earbud resulting
in significant latency when watching videos,
phone calls only coming through the master
earbud, sporadic connection drops, and or
only being able to use a specific earbud if
you just want to use one ear bud at a time…
Galaxy Buds don’t have any of those issues
what so ever.
Like I mentioned earlier you can watch youtube
videos with them cause they don’t have latency
issues like a lot of other truly wireless
earbuds do, their connection is just as stable
as AirPods, and phone calls come in through
both earbuds just like AirPods.
And now lets talk about sound quality on the
galaxy buds.
To be frank, the sound quality is fine.
Its no where near as impressive as the sound
quality you would find on the Sennheiser Momentum’s
I mentioned earlier, but the Galaxy Buds don’t
have a bass heavy sound signature by default
to hide the fact that they have very weak
mids and clarity like some other truly wireless
earbuds do.
But the Galaxy Buds get decently loud, they
never get tinny, and even though they don’t
have a whole lot of bass, its enough to keep
you happy.
And through Samsung’s Wear app you can also
select from a few pre-made eq’s and personally
I like to keep mine set to clarity.
But in general, since I like to use truly
wireless earbuds to mainly listen to podcasts,
watch videos and take phone calls… the galaxy
buds get the job done just fine.
But finally, I want to highlight the touch
pads found on the galaxy buds.
One of the biggest draw backs of AirPods and
a lot of other truly wireless earbuds is limited
on board media controls.
If you want to do something simple like play
or pause your music, skip a track or adjust
the volume you either have to summon your
voice assistant and hope they get it right…
Siri.
Or you gotta take your phone out of your pocket
more often.
And even though galaxy buds aren’t the first
truly wireless earbuds with built in touch
pads, they’re one of the most accurate and
easiest ones to use.
So I can play or pause my music, skip a track,
or adjust the volume all without having to
take my S10 out of my pocket.
But over all, if you’re an android user
in general… the Galaxy Buds are a no brainer.
Cause even if you’re not using a Samsung
device you can still download Samsung’s
Galaxy Wearable app through the play store
and get the most out of the galaxy Buds.
But if you’re an iPhone user you shouldn’t
consider getting the Galaxy Buds over AirPods
cause you’re not going to have all of the
same features and performance available to
you like on android devices.
Personally I wouldn’t go comparing the two
to one another, Android users just finally
have a solid truly wireless earbuds options
that perform just as well as AirPods do on
an iPhone but that don’t cost an absurd
amount of money.
And both the AirPods and Galaxy Buds can learn
from one another.
I would have liked to see the Galaxy Buds
have a total battery life of 24 hours like
the AirPods, and I would like to see the AirPods
get super accurate and easy to use touch controls
like on the Galaxy Buds.
But whether you’re picking up the AirPods
or Galaxy Buds…
I still only recommend them for casual use.
Cause neither of them sound amazing, they
just sound fine.
And even though the Galaxy Buds have an IPX2
rating which make them splash resistant, I
wouldn’t go soaking them in water or sweat.
If you’re looking for a pair of wireless
earbuds to work with I would get something
like the Jaybird Tarah Pro.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
