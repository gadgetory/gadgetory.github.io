market was quickly flooded by truly
wireless earbuds from other companies
and most of them were sports wireless
earbuds meant for working out but then
premium truly wireless earbuds started
to become a thing so given that ear pods
are super popular and overall pretty
good
is it really worth paying almost double
for something like the sennheiser
momentum truly wireless earbuds nose
premium truly well is here buds on the
market right now let me tell between 250
and 300 dollars whereas the air pods
retail for what I think is a reasonable
hundred and sixty dollars but the
Sennheiser Momentum's we have here
specifically we tell for three hundred
dollars louboutin even just released
their own bread to truly wireless
earbuds which command a $1,000 asking
price so it could definitely be worse so
if you want to pick these earbuds up
I'll have them linked down below a
common theme among premium truly
wireless earbuds is that they try to use
more premium materials and have a more
fashion-forward design compared to the
all plastic earbuds and a Sennheiser
Momentum's are no exception starting
with their carrying case it's completely
covered in fabric so it's gonna be
scratch resistant and personally it
reminds me of a miniature carrying case
that comes included with premium ANC
headphones like the Sonia 1000 X to the
three and surface headphones the air
buds themselves are in your earbuds that
don't have your fins but do you feature
a touchpad on both earbuds now I'll go
deeper into these touch pads in a minute
but personally I wish these metallic
spin rings also came in a black option
for those who don't want their earbuds
to stand out as much now when it comes
to comfort like I mentioned earlier
these are in your earbuds and you get a
total of four different silicone ear
tips personally I only like to wear in
your earbuds for short periods of time
like when I'm at the gym because after a
while they do get itchy to me so I am a
little biased towards the air pods when
it comes to all-day comfort and wear but
objectively even though the Momentum's
don't use orphans since they're so
lightweight and compact they do a very
good job of thing in your ear and they
don't fall out and since these are in
your earbuds they do a much better job
of blocking
ambient noise compared to the air pots
but personally I just can't wear the
Momentum's for nearly as long as air
pots and even after a while I forget I
have my ear pods in which it just
doesn't happen within your earbuds for
me we're going tech specs the Momentum's
have a pretty average 12 hours of total
playback time the earbuds themselves are
good for four straight hours of playback
time and the case can supply an
additional two charges whereas the air
pods have a total playback time of 24
hours when they're brand new my repairs
on like 2 years old now so they can't do
that but the ear pods themselves are
good for five straight hours of playback
time and the case can supply an
additional four charges give or take and
the airplanes charge in case is pretty
impressive overall because even though
it's one of those smallest charging
cases out there it's usually able to
supply more charges compared to larger
charging cases but something the
Momentum's charging case has going for
it is that it charges via a USB C port
and having a USB C charging port here
can be particularly useful for Android
users because they can charge their
phone in earbuds with the same cable
just like iPhone users can with their
ear pods and Android users are also
going to have a better user experience
on the Momentum's when it comes to
connectivity now these are bizarre using
bluetooth 5.0 and they have a master and
slave set up like most other non Apple
wireless earbuds where the right earbud
is the master and the left ear bud is
the slave and overall they have a very
stable connection that doesn't cut out
and in an earbud which can be a problem
on some other truly wireless earbuds out
there they're even good for watching
videos on your phone because they have
very little latency which again can be a
problem on some other truly wireless
earbuds out there but just keep in mind
they do have a bit latency when watching
YouTube videos on an iPhone but that
latency goes away if you're watching
Netflix whereas these earbuds never
happen really and see one users an
Android device and they even support
both attacks and apdex low latency which
is good now when it comes to sound
quality there's no denying tease your
budget managed to sound better event the
ear pods specifically the Momentum's
have more detailed mids and better
estimates operation
compared to the air pods where as I
found the mid on air pods to be a little
muddy and they try to cover that up with
an excess amount of base but the
Momentum's also have an adjustable EQ
and even though this EQ is useful I wish
I had more control over it and just find
the dresser controls to be pretty
limiting I just wish I had more control
over the EQ similar to the j-bird run xt
but one of my favorite things about the
Sennheiser Momentum's is their touch
pads on either ear button one of the
problems a lot of other truly wireless
earbuds have including air pods is that
they have very limited media controls so
if you want to do something as simple as
skipping a song or raising the volume
you either have to rely on your voice
assistant which can be tedious compared
to just using an inline controller like
we used to do when why are your buds
were more common or you just have to
whip out your phone more often but
thanks to these earbuds
touch pads and Sennheiser's a well
thought out by and layout you can fully
control you music unlike the air pods if
you tap once on the left ear but you can
play your positive music you can double
tap to skip a track and you can triple
tap to go back a track and to raise a
volume you can press and hold on the
right earbud and to lower the volume you
can press and hold on the left ear
button you'd be surprised to learn that
not a lot of other truly rollies earbuds
give you this level of control over your
music with their onboard controls and
it's a very welcomed feature but these
earbuds are also feature a transparency
mode which can be very useful if you're
walking around the city or you can talk
to someone without having to take your
earbuds out of your ears basically if
you're listening to music if you double
tap on the right earbud the Momentum's
will pause your music and pump in all of
the ambient sound around you very
similar to quick attention on the sony
one Allison lexan 3
and if you want you can even keep
transparency mode on and play music at
the same time so it's like listening to
music with open-back headphones the only
thing that you can't control is how much
ambient noise these earbuds pump in but
so I'm glad the Momentum's have this
feature these earbuds can also
automatically pause your music when you
take them out of your ears like air pots
but unlike air pods
instead of using proximity sensors the
Momentum's paused your music when the
earbuds are physically separated from
one another just on out point that out
now when it comes to phone calls on the
Momentum's or one of the few truly
wireless earbuds out there that actually
offer you stereo phone calls unlike a
lot of other truly wireless earbuds
where phone calls will only come in your
body usually the master and when it
comes to the microphone on the
Momentum's it's okay but it's definitely
not as good as earbuds but this audio
clip is being recorded by the
microphones found on the Sennheiser
Momentum's so you could get a touch of
that
but overall Sennheiser is truly wireless
here but to perform very well the
Momentum's have solid Bluetooth
connections which is the most important
thing to consider when choosing truly
where all those earbuds they sound great
I like that you have full control over
your music playback things to the touch
pads and I really appreciate their
transparency mode but I wish the
Momentum's were able to at least match
the air pods 24 hours of total playback
time given that their carrying case is
larger and I also wish they came in a
black version for those who want a more
subtle look
but at 300 dollars I personally find it
very hard to justify spending all that
money on a pair of wireless earbuds when
there are cheaper options out there
specifically the ear pods and almost for
the same money you can get a pair of
premium ANC headphones or for less you
can get a great pair of two men
generally headphones like the audio
technica sort of 50s but I know some
people just don't want to wear
headphones cuz they're going to mess up
their hair on their way to work or they
just don't want to lug them around and
that's completely understandable so if
you're dead set on getting the
tons just know they're a good pair of
wireless earbuds if you made it this far
