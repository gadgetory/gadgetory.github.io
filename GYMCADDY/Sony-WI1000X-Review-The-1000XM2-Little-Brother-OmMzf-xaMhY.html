m2 but Sony also dropped their WI 1000x
on the same game the WI in WI 1000 X
stands for Wireless in here and these
are net been styled in your headphones
but although Sony really hit the mark
with their 1000 XM 2 on the WI 1000 X
any good or about to find out don't
forget to Like comment and subscribe and
you can watch some of my other videos
here after you're done watching this
video the sony wy 1000x come in the same
two colors as - 1000 XM - black and gold
and they're currently retailing for to
$99.99 that's the same price as the sony
1000x headphones and $50 less than the
new 1000 XM - i just-i you should know
if you want to pick either of these
products up I'll have links in
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deal
possible if the unboxing experience
under WI 1000 X is the same as the 1000
X n2 over ear headphones we open the lid
in front and centre are the earphones
underneath you'll find a few things I
could micro USB cable for charging a
micro USB 2 3.5 millimeter audio jack
cable a few earbuds in a sock carrying
case you get two sets of earbuds to
choose from your standard silicone
earbuds and you also get a silicone and
remember hybrid pair they're sort of
like comply your tips except they're
much bounce here and they don't mold as
much but I really like how all of the
earbuds are color-coded and I really
like the case they come in it really
helps with organization
design-wise the W I went out the next
share the same design language as the
Sony one does an accent to headphones
obviously these are neck band styled but
for those wondering they do not fold up
and they are not waterproof but all of
the materials used on the wi 1000x can
be found in the headphones the neck band
is made of the same stainless steel and
there's also the same synthetic leather
on the legs of the neck band there's a
good amount of padding for the back of
your neck and the whole unit itself
weighs just 72 grams so you actually
forget you're wearing them after a while
there's an NFC touch point on the right
side and on the left leg you'll find a
micro USB port for charging on the
inside of the left leg you'll find the
power button volume controls and a
play/pause button to control your music
playback
they're very raised and very easy to
tell apart just by touch and they also
have really good tactile feedback
you press the power button once while
that your phones are on it will tell you
your current battery status and if you
press and hold the play/pause button
you'll activate Syria also the neck band
will vibrate when you receive calls and
to be honest it scared me half to death
the first time they did so and finally
on the right leg you will find the
control button for the active noise
cancellation from there you can toggle
from ambient sound noise cancellation on
and noise cancellation off moving up to
the actual earbuds themselves you'll
notice they're pretty big you'll notice
there's a cutout for the bottom portion
for the noise cancellation mic on either
earbuds and you'll also notice they're
angled a bit although they fit well and
go pretty deep into your ear canal
since the earbuds themselves are pretty
heavy they will fall out if you run with
them on concerning tech specs the wi
1000x have a battery life of 10 hours
with noise cancellation turned on and
with noise cancellation turned off they
should last you for 13 hours but if you
were to use them with a wide connection
that with noise cancellation turned on
they should last you for around 14 hours
and am i testing they've actually lasted
for about 12 hours with noise
cancellation turned on and they also
have quick charging so 10 minutes of
charging should get you around 70
minutes of playback time just like the
1000 x m2 sadly the wy 1000 x is using
the same bluetooth 4.1 as the 1000 x m2
which means you still get the same
40-foot wall it's range but you can't
quickly switch from device to device
instead you have to go into your
settings menu for each device and
manually disconnect the 1000 X from one
device and manually connect them to your
other device I just filled with apples
w1 chip out there and with bluetooth for
that 2 or 5.0 as an option premium
headphones like these should be able to
be connected to multiple devices at the
same time and be able to quickly switch
between them but I don't know what Sony
has done with the noise cancellation
technology but I really like it one of
the biggest reasons I don't like to
boast QC 35 is because the noise
cancellation has a lot of cabin pressure
and there's a lot of hissing when you're
not playing music but the new 1000x
headphones have no cabin pressure
whatsoever in the noise cancellation is
even better than the bose qc25 and most
of those traits carry over to the wy
1000x
the noise cancellation causes no
pressure on my eardrums and they also
haven't caused me and headaches and the
noise cancellation mics on the wi 1000x
do a really good job
of rejecting one noise just like the
1000 xm2 although the in your earbuds
don't offer as much passive noise
isolation as the headphones you can
really tell the difference once the
active noise cancellation turns on but
the noise cancellation on the WY 1000x
is only worth using if you're indoors
they do a really good job of cancelling
out noise pollution like a whirling AC
or road noise from a passing car but
everything else still gets in and since
your ears aren't encased in ear cups
there's only so much the noise
cancellation on the neck band can do so
if your main concern is noise isolation
then you're better off with the 1000 XM
- the WI 1000 X also feature ambient
sound settings that allow you to control
how much outside noise gets pumped into
the earphones they can also focus
specifically on people's voices if
you're walking in the city you might
want to have ambient sound set high so
you can know what's going on around you
if you work in an office you might want
to have ambient sound set to medium so
if HR yells for you you can still hear
them or if you just want to be in your
own little world you can just turn
ambient sound off and only have noise
cancellation on but the funny thing is
if you turn ambient sound all the way up
you'll be able to hear even more stuff
than you would with just your normal
hearing they're like hearing aids these
earphones are also connected so nice
headphones app from there you can also
activate that active sound control
basically if your earphones detect your
being still
they'll have noise cancellation on but
you can adjust send in the settings if
the headphones detect your walking
they'll raise the ambient sound a bit if
they detect you're running or exercising
with them don't raise the ambient sound
even more but personally I wouldn't use
these for working out and if they detect
you're taking public transportation
they'll block out everything the WY
1000x also have a built-in pressure
sensor just like the 1000 x m2 so they
can measure the barometric pressure in
your immediate surroundings and then
compensate the sound and noise
cancellation accordingly the idea is
they should be able to get the best
noise cancellation whether you're on the
ground on an airplane but I still
haven't been able to test either these
headphones on an airplane when it comes
to sound quality these didn't blow me
away their death vocals and mints or
pretty good but when it comes to the
lows and highs that's where these
headphones fall short
first the highest end to be too sharp
most of the time and they do cause
discomfort or they just completely crash
and the bass on these headphones really
like
roll off in just model de receta sound
but do so nice headphones app you can
easily adjust the EQ of the neckband
just like with the 1000 XM - but even
after going through all the EQ options
and even trying to adjust it myself I
just couldn't find the right settings to
fix the sharp eyes and model bass but
through Sony's app you can also just to
surround settings and change the sound
positioning of these earphones but just
like the 1000 xn 2
I just keep those features turned off
but I know I've given Sony a lot of crap
in the past for having bad mobile apps
but their headphones app has been very
solid even after the iOS 11 update like
I mentioned earlier you can use these
earphones with a wired connection you
can use them all powered off or you can
use them while they're on and still
enjoy some noise cancellation but what I
don't get is that you can't use the
controls on the left leg of the neckband
to control your music playback and since
there's no inline control on the cable
you have to whip out your phone to
control your music I just wish you could
just still use the buttons the WI 1000x
also has a built-in microphone for phone
calls just like the 1000 x m2 and just
like the 1000 x m2 the microphone isn't
that good
i hear the person sounds too far away
and you might have to speak up sometimes
but this is the audio clip is being
recorded with the microphone on the wi
1000x
so you can be the judge of that but
overall I feel WI 1000x are just man you
can't work out with them because the
earbuds are heavy and will fall out and
the neck band will fall out of place if
you're on the bench press and they're
not sweat resistant although the noise
cancellation is impressive a lot of
sound still manages to get in and again
the lows and highs and these earphones
don't sound together if you're willing
to spend upwards of $300 for a pair of
headphones I really can't find a reason
why you would get these over the 1000 XM
