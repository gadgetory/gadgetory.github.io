buds… and its with good reason.
They’re a really good pair of truly wireless
earbuds that perform very well, they fit well,
and both the buds themselves and carrying
case are pretty small.
But most importantly, they only cost $130.
But the $80 sound core Liberty Air have also
gotten a fair amount of hype.
So could these really be a viable alternative
for both the Galaxy Buds and AirPods?
Usually any time you try to save money with
third party accessories you have to make some
sacrifices.
And the first most obvious sacrifice with
the Soundcore Liberty Air is the way you charge
them.
Unfortunately the liberty air charge via a
Micro-USB Port.
Which means, you most likely wont be able
to charge your ear buds and phone with the
same cable like you can with the galaxy buds
or AirPods.
And trust me being able to charge your phone
and ear buds with the same cable is a highly
under rated connivance.
And it also doesn’t hurt that you can charge
the galaxy buds wirelessly.
And when it comes to the Liberty Air’s charging
case, obviously its very reminiscent to the
AirPods charging case, except it’s slightly
longer and thicker.
But thanks to rounder corners, the liberty
air are just as easy to stash in your pocket
as the AirPods and Galaxy Buds.
And over all, the liberty air’s charging
case is on the smaller side compared to a
lot of other truly wireless earbuds on the
market that aren’t AirPods or galaxy buds.
And when it comes to battery life, the liberty
air really try to match the AirPods the best
they can.
The liberty air have an advertised battery
life to 20 hours of total playback time.
The buds themselves can go for 5 straight
hours just like the AirPods and the case can
supply an additional 3 full charges.
And just keep in mind, AirPods have a total
playback time of 25 plus hours and the Galaxy
Buds have a total playback time of 13 hours.
But now lets talk about the buds… obviously
they’re going for an AirPods vibe here as
well, but they’re definitely much chunkier.
And compared to the galaxy buds they’re
huge.
But remember they’re only 80 bucks so I
guess it evens out.
But unlike AirPods, the liberty air’s are
in ear ear buds.
And over all, they fit well and they do a
decent job of passively blocking out ambient
noise.
And just like Galaxy Buds, the Liberty Air
are rocking bluetooth 5.0.
But unlike Galaxy Buds or AirPods where each
ear bud establishes a wireless connection
with their phone, the Liberty Air’s are
using a Master and Slave set up which is common
on a lot of truly wireless earbuds.
For the most part they have a stable connection
that doesn’t cut out and they’re ok for
watching videos on your phone.
They have like a quarter second delay on both
android or iPhone… but if you don’t focus
on the delay, you wont notice it that much.
And regarding the liberty air’s sound quality…
over all I would only recommend them if you
mostly plan to use them to listen to podcasts
or watch videos with.
Since these earbuds have a very bright sound
signature with very little bass, these earbuds
just don’t sound good for listening to music
period.
And I also found that when you raise the volume
on these earbuds they start to sound very
distorted.
And just to be as straight forward as possible,
no the liberty air don’t sound as good or
better than AirPods or the galaxy buds.
And I really want to put an emphasis on only
using these earbuds for watching videos cause
their microphone just isn’t good for phone
calls.
Even though phone calls come in through both
earbuds which is good to see, I just wouldn’t
take phone calls with these cause of their
microphone.
And finally theres the touch pads on the liberty
air.
Honestly I think I’ve been spoiled by the
touch pads found on the galaxy buds.
Cause the touch pads on the Liberty air just
don’t give you the same amount of control
as the galaxy buds.
You can really only play or pause your music
by double pressing on right ear bud and skip
through your music by pressing and holding
on either ear bud.
And in general the touch pads on the liberty
air just don’t have the same accuracy as
the galaxy buds, so I just avoid using them.
So over all, I would only recommend the Soundcore
liberty air to a very specific type of consumer…
one thats looking for a pair of truly wireless
earbuds to mostly listen to podcasts or watch
videos with.
And just remember, the liberty air do have
a bit of latency when watching youtube videos
on both and iPhone or android device.
Besides their fairly impressive 20 hour battery
life, I just wouldn’t recommend the liberty
air’s even at their $80 price point.
And I wouldn’t consider these as AirPods
or Galaxy Buds alternatives.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
