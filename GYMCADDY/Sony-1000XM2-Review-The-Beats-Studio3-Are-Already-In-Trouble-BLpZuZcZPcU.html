and now sony has released our 1000 x m2
although nothing's changed on the
outside the saudi one dozen x m2 have
been improved on the inside but if you
only have the sony 1000 x should you run
out an upgrade to the 71,000 x m2 we're
about to find out don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe
any can watch some of the videos here
after you're done watching this video
when the Sony and the or 1000 X first
came out they were selling for 3 $99.99
but thankfully the new Sony WH 1000 xm2
are retailing for 3 $49.99 and you have
two colors to choose from black or gold
and now the older 1000x are selling for
298 over an Amazon if you want to pick
either of these headphones up I'll have
links to description below and I'll keep
them updated so you can get the best
deal possible sony products routinely go
on sale so you might get lucky the
exterior and materials used on the sony
1000x m2 or identical to the 1000 x the
majority of the body is made out of
plastic they have synthetic leather on
the exterior of the ear cuffs they have
a stainless steel headband they have the
same physical buttons a power button and
noise cancellation button on the left
ear cup and even the pan is the same you
also get the same accessories as the
1000 x like a heart cell carrying case a
micro USB cable for charging and
airplane adapter and an audio cable
although sony does a great job of
packing in a whole bunch of features
into their products build quality is
still not up to par to the both QC 35
but if you're mindful of them they
should last you a long time and when it
comes to comfort they're identical to
the 1000 X clamping force isn't you type
in the head there's enough padding and
prolong use is no problem the first most
noticeable upgrade to the sony 1000 x n2
is the battery with noise cancellation
turned on the 1000 x 7 - should last you
for 30 hours and with noise cancellation
turned off they should last you for 38
hours but am i testing they've actually
lasted me for about 35 hours with noise
cancellation turned on and then moderate
listen levels and for comparison no one
does and acts have a battery life of 20
hours with noise cancellation turn on
this sony 1000 x n2 also not have quick
charging which is great to have if you
guys forgetful as me if you plug them in
for 10 minutes don't get you around 70
minutes of playback time which hopefully
should last you you want to commute
if you take public transportation if a
comparison the 1000x
don't have a charger but sadly the sony
1000 x m2 is still using bluetooth 4.1
you still get the same wireless range
around 40 feet like the 1000 X but I
really wish Sony took this opportunity
to upgrade to Bluetooth 5.0 or at least
bluetooth for that too just like the
1000 X the 1000 x m2 can only be paired
with one device at a time you can't just
quickly swap from your phone to your
laptop like I do with the bose qc25 with
the power base 3 instead if you're using
the 1000 x m2 with your phone you have
to disconnect them and then go into the
Bluetooth settings of your other device
like a tablet or laptop and connect the
1000 x m2 to that device manually
another upgrade to the sony 1000 xn2 is
the noise cancellation and ambient sound
features like I said in the past the
noise cancellation on the boss gives you
35 always gave me a headache and I
always felt a good amount of cabin
pressure
the older sony 1000 x didn't cause me
any headaches but did have the slightest
cabin pressure but with the sony 1000 x
m2 i feel absolutely no cabin pressure
and there have been no headaches
whatsoever but that's just me also while
getting shots on the Hudson River I
noticed it was almost no wind noise
whenever I got hit by a gust of wind
only very rarely and I just the right
angle did the noise cancellation
microphones on the 1000 XM to cause that
white noise sound whereas the noise
cancelling microphones on the bose qc25
and 1000 X or a little more sensitive to
wind compared to the 1000 x m2 sony also
added a pressure sensor into the 1000 x
m2 so they can measure the barometric
pressure and humidity surroundings and
then compensate the sound and noise
cancellation accordingly
the idea is that you should get the best
noise cancellation whether you're on the
ground or on an airplane the 1000 x m2
also have the same ambient sound
settings as the 1000 x you can have the
headphones pump in all of your
surroundings sounds where you're playing
music so you can hear what's going on
and stay safe when you're walk-in in the
city or have the headphones only let in
people's voices so if people call your
name at the office you can still hear
them or you can just have your basic
noise cancellation on and block out
everything the sony 1000 XM 2 also now
connect to Sony's headphones app
available on both Apple and Android and
this app gives you so much control over
the headphone
first does adapt to sound control where
the ambient sound settings will
automatically adjust depending on what
you're doing if your setup still don't
block out everything once the headphones
detect you're walking your play
notification sound and start pumping in
some ambient sound and focus on people's
voices
if the headphones detect you're running
they'll let in even more ambient sound
and if they detect you taking public
transportation they will again block out
everything obviously if you just want a
noise cancellation on all the time you
don't have to bother with the ambient
sound settings but the ambient sound
settings on the 1000 x-series are very
useful and is one of the main reasons
why I prefer them over other headphones
on the market when it comes to sound
quality there's really no noticeable
difference between two 1000 X in the
1000 X and - and that's not a bad thing
I thought we stopped at 1000 X sounded
better than the bose qc25
they sound clearer and they have enough
space to keep you satisfied they don't
get as loud as the XP 950 anyone but
they can handle almost everything you
throw at them and through the headphones
that you have a few equalizer settings
to choose from and you can even make
your own
but even if you max out the bass on
these headphones you're not going to get
the same effect as you would with the XP
950 n1 but I really do like how easy it
is to adjust the EQ on the 1000 XM - and
since the EQ is a loaded onto the
headphones you EQ settings will follow
you from device to device so through the
EQ you can tailor the sound of the 1000
X and - exactly - you like it you can
also adjust the surround settings at the
sound position of these headphones but
honestly I just keep those settings off
the bass on the 1000 XM - isn't going to
satisfy a basin like the XP 950 n1 but
then I suppose to their main focus is a
noise cancellation and comfort touch
controls make a return on the 1000 X n -
if you double tap the right ear cup your
player posi music if you swipe forward
to skip a track and if you swipe back to
go back a track and if you swipe up or
down they'll adjust the volume and if
you press and hold the right ear cup
they'll activate Syria but if you cover
the right ear cup the headphones will
automatically lower the volume of
whatever you listen to and let in all
the ambient noise in so if somebody's
trying to talk to you you can still hear
them even with the headphones on Sony
calls this feature quick attention and
as my face
feech on these headphones hands down
these headphones also have a built-in
microphone for calls i feel the user
sounds a little far away and you might
have to speak up sometimes but when i
spoke to people on the phone using these
headphones they said it sounded just
fine but this audio clip is being
recorded with the headphones themselves
so you could be the judge of that
before i wrap this video up i want to
play some stuff out about using these
headphones with the included audio cable
if you have them plugged in and powered
off you can use the 1000 xm2 without
noise cancellation but the sound gets a
very shallow and the base is very flat
if you power them on in have a wired
connection the sound quality goes back
to your pre-installed EQ settings and
the noise cancellation turns back on if
you want it but what really sucks is
that the touch controls on the right ear
cup won't work if you have a wired
connection with your phone and since
there's no inline controller on the
cable you have to whip out your phone if
you want to control your music playback
I just don't like functionality being
taken away from you also audio quality
really isn't that different when using a
wired connection versus a wireless
connection with your phone which isn't
that surprising since Sony is very good
at having a very clear and minimally
distorted wireless connection I've
noticed this with both their headphones
and their speakers the only difference I
noticed was that the headphones get
slightly louder when used with the wired
connection so the Sony WH 1000 xm2 are
really just an improved version of the
sony MDR 1000x
the 1000x tend to have a longer battery
life and they now have quick charging
the newest cancellation has been
improved and you have so much control
over your ambient sound settings through
sony's headphones app sound quality on
the 1000 x + 2 is just as good as the
1000 X but being able to easily adjust
the EQ is a much welcomed feature but
I'm still a little disappointed sony
didn't upgrade the bluetooth on the 1000
x m2 for easy switching between your
devices if you already have the 1000 X
you don't really need to upgrade unless
the 20 hour battery life is a problem
for you if you're deciding between the
1000 X or paying the extra $50 for the
1000 X I'm - I feel it is worth it
because you're getting an improved
battery life with quick charging improve
noise cancellation and even more control
over your sound quality I'm even willing
to argue these are the best overall
consumer headphones on the market right
now but that could change once the bose
qc25 to come out
in a few weeks rumor saying October 4th
