engineering and it's clearly giving us a
preview of what's to come in the second
generation
DJI Matic pro this compact drone is as
easy to fly and as consumer friendly as
the DJI spark and it's almost as capable
as its older brother the DJI Matic pro
the Mavic error is what happens when the
spark and the Matic pro have baby and
the price of the MAV Akira is sandwich
right between the spark and the Matic
pro the base Medicare is currently
retailing for seven hundred ninety nine
dollars and for that price you get the
drone the controller one battery one set
of propeller guards a carrying case a
whole bunch of miscellaneous cables and
accessories and two extra sets of
propellers unfortunately you have to
bring your own micro SD card there's
also a fly more combo pack that retails
for 999 dollars
and essentially you get a total of three
batteries are charging hub to charge
them all in a larger travel bag and two
more extra sets of propellers given that
each battery for the Medicare cost $79
alone in the charging hub by itself cost
$49 plus the extra propellers and the
travel bag and DJI claims you're saving
one hundred thirteen dollars I feel it's
a fair deal not a great deal but a fair
deal if you want to pick the DJI
maverick air up I'll have links to the
description below and if you use the
link it really helps out the channel
check them out because DJI drones
sometimes go on sale so you might get
lucky the DJI Mavic error is slightly
bigger than the spark but still slightly
smaller than the Matic pro just like
pneumatic pro the magic air folds up the
back legs rotate backwards and out and
the front arms extend outwards
even though thematic air is slightly
bigger than the spark in its folded
state the Medicare is easier to store in
a jacket pocket than the smart but it is
important to take note that the
propellers on pneumatic air are a
different size and the ones found on the
spark or maverick Pro and unfortunately
they don't fold up personally I feel
that these are I should standardize the
propellers between the Maverick error
and the second generation Matic pro this
way it'll be a little easier to get
replacements if you go to a store and I
also think these are I should have used
foldable props on pneumatic air because
I feel that in the event of a crash
the bull prods have a better chance of
survival the DJ I'm AdvoCare has an
array of sensors built-in that help it
avoid crashing and help you find more
precisely when indoors there a pair of
sensors on the front a pair of sensors
on the back and sensors on its belly
so the Mavic air can know when there are
obstacles in front of it behind it and
underneath it
the sensors can also detect if there's
water underneath so it won't
accidentally land in water which would
obviously be a mood killer if you did
and on that note the Medicare is not
waterproof so you shouldn't be flying it
in the rain or snow
thanks to flight autonomy 2.0 the
Medicare creates a real-time 3d map of
its environment and it's able to better
position itself and even automatically
avoid obstacles without user input but
the MAV acara is still prone to crashing
if you're flying from side-to-side
something I usually do to get panning
shots personally I think the second
generation Matic pro will come included
with all of the sensors found on the
medic error and with additional sensors
on the sides and on the top of the
aircraft rendering it virtually crash
proof like the DJI phantom4 pro or at
least I hope on the back of the era ders
or USB C port and a microSD slot that
can take cards up to 128 gigs but the
magic error also has eight gigs of
internal storage if you're shooting in
1080p that's a good amount of storage
but if you're shooting in 4k that ain't
a lot underneath the SD card slot you'll
also find a light that also functions as
a function button something that took me
awhile to figure out because you will
have to use this by a wind current to
control it to the drone and on the sides
of the drone there or latches that keep
the battery secure DJI claims a maximum
flight time of 21 minutes for the air
but that under ideal conditions in my
testing in the NYC area with high winds
and with temperatures between 28 degrees
and 48 degrees I averaged the flight
time of 18 minutes I have yet to hit
that magical 21 minute mark but below
average performance in cold environments
is normal for batteries so I'll probably
hit that 21 minute mark in the spring or
in the summer now when it comes to
charging the air is better you first
have to remove it and then use a
proprietary cable and in order to fully
charge it it's going to take about 50
minutes now let's talk about the camera
the DDI Medicare the Medicare has a 12
megapixel camera that's housed in a 3
axis gimbal the camera on the Medicare
also has the largest field of view at 85
degrees whereas the SPARC has a field of
view of 80 1.9 degrees and the pro has
the narrowest field of view at 78 point
eight degrees essentially you'll be able
to capture more of a scene with the
Medicare as opposed to the pro when it's
looking at the same thing away at the
same distance on a side note I like how
the body of the air essentially wraps
around the camera so even in the event
of a crash the gimbal system is still
somewhat protected the 12 megapixel
camera on the air can shoot up to 4k 30
frames per second and can capture
stunning slow-motion video at 1080p 120
frames per second for comparison the pro
also maxes out at 4k 30 frames per
second but the best it can do when it
comes to slow motion video is 1080p 96
frames per second or 720p at 120 frames
per second but the pro can also capture
cinema 4k at 24 frames per second
MultiAir kent and just putting it out
there the spark maxes out at 1080p 30
frames per second and shooting in 4k
means you'll be able to capture more
detail and you'll be able to zoom in
more without losing too much video
quality but personally I like shooting
in 1080p 60 frames per second the most
because it means much smoother video
quality but is not as crispy
and the camera on the Mavic era also
does an okay job in low-light
environments given that it has a 2.8
aperture but one major thing that air
has over the pro is that it can shoot
HDR photos which means better looking
stills the Mavic air can also capture a
few different types of panoramas if
you're shooting a taller subject you can
use the vertical panorama mode and for
wider subjects you can just use the
horizontal panoramas
although these panorama modes are found
on the spark the manicure is able to
shoot the necessary photos and stitch
them together much faster and then there
is my personal favorite spherical
panoramas although these do take a bit
longer to take the end result is truly
stunning you can go into the DJI app and
manipulate the photo any way you want
and even in high winds the end result is
still very clean and the air can also
take these spherical panoramas in a
fraction of the time the spark does one
of the things that I really like about
the Mavic area is just how many options
you have when it comes to actually
flying it if you want to take a quick
selfie you could just use gesture
controls since the Mavic area is
slightly bigger than the spark you can't
palm launch which honestly isn't a
problem with me because I always just
end up crashing my spark anyway the
gesture controls automatic error are
much more accurate and there are much
more robust and the ones found on their
spark it's able to track your palm more
precisely and you can even make it move
forwards and back by opening or closing
your arms in order to take a picture you
just throw up a peace sign and to start
recording you just make a rectangle with
your fingers
the only problem I've really only had
with the desert controls is telling the
Medicare it's red
if you want you can also just fly the
Medicare with just your smartphone and
the DJI go for app the touchscreen
controls are accurate but the control
input is numb down a bit so you'll be
able to fly the Medicare as fast or as
precisely but when strictly using your
phone to control the Medicare you'll get
a range of about 80 meters or 260 feet
with directly on the site and with
minimal signal interference but I do
want to point out that this 80 meter
range is slightly shorter than the 100
meter range the spark has when flying it
with just your phone as well when using
the included controller the DJ I'm
advocare has a range of up to 4,000
meters or 2.5 miles which is a little
more than half of the range of the DJI
Matic pro 7,000 meters or 4.3 miles but
again these numbers are well in ideal
conditions when flying in a highly
populated area with lots of tall
structures I routinely got signal
interference I could usually only go
with distance of about a thousand or
1,200 meters before my video stream
completely cut out or got too much
static to know exactly what I was doing
well when it comes to linear speed the
Medicare is slightly faster than the
Maverick Pro with the top speed of 68.4
kilometers per hour or 42 miles per hour
while in sport mode versus the pros top
speed of 65 km/h or 40 miles per hour
but it is important to keep in mind that
while in sport mode the sensors on the
Medicare or attorney officer you're
flying blind but more importantly when
used with the controller the medicare
has a max ascend speed of 4 meters per
second versus the pros 5 meters per
second descent speed and the air and the
pro both have a descent speed of 3
meters per second and to me this is just
as important to know because it's how
faster drones can gain or lose altitude
because personally I never really go oh
geez Rick I really wish my drone would
fly faster I'm usually going oh geez
Rick I really wish my drone would get up
faster or come down already
but the Mavic air is very precise and
nimble control inputs are very accurate
and the air itself is very agile is able
to accelerate very quickly and stop on a
dime
but don't let a small size fool you even
in the roughest of wind
pneumatic air stays stable and allows
you to place it wherever you want
without losing
all of it now when it comes to the
controller itself let's talk about
battery life first in order to fully
charge it it's going to take about two
and a half hours and after a full flight
with the Maverick error the battery on
the controller is still at about fifty
percent but in order to charge it you
have to use the included adapter and
personally I think the controller should
have used a USBC port instead because I
feel losing this adapter it's pretty
easy unlike the pros controller which
has a screen that shows you information
about your join at a glance the
controller on the air has none of that
but the joysticks do screw off and don't
worry if you lose them DJI included a
second pair you have shoulder buttons to
quickly capture a picture or video a
second shoulder button for quick access
to your camera settings or rotating knob
to adjust the tilt at the camera and the
all-important return to home button so
you can call your drone back when you
have no idea where it is the controller
design itself is fine but I just find it
so hard to actually place my phone
inside even without a case or even a
skin I just wish the cradle was a little
bigger but now let's talk about the
things I hate about thematic error first
off I absolutely hate how every time I
want to charge the battery I have to
completely unfold the Mavic to get the
battery out I also hate that you have to
remember to fold and unfold the error in
a specific order first the back legs and
the front arms to open the drone and
first the front arms and then the back
legs to collapse on another thing I hate
about the Medicare is just how hard it
is to get the SD card out I've been
using tweezers to get the card out
because my dainty little fingers are
still too big and this matters because
if you're going to be shooting a lot
you're probably going to want to quickly
swap out the SD card and like I
mentioned earlier I think it's super
weird that the controller uses and
adapted to charge I just wish to use a
USB C port like the air store I just
need to worry about one cable but this
is just mean they're picking the DJI
medicare is a great little drawing for
any intermediate pilot it can capture
some stunning video in pictures but it's
also just a lot of fun to fly to play
around with smart capture and just to
play around with the various picture
modes it has a good amount of range for
any hobbyist and you can fly it indoors
or even in the horses of winds
personally I think that if you in the
market trying to decide between thematic
era and the current Matic pro I don't go
out the Mavic air if your picture
quality is just as good and unless
you're trying to capture some at
landscape shots the few extra minutes of
flight time and extra range aren't that
big of a deal
but like I said at the beginning of this
video the Medicare is giving us a
preview of the second-generation Matic
Pro which one feel will be released in
the next 8 to 10 months I bet it will be
slightly smaller than the current
generation Matic pro have extra sensors
off to the side a larger camera sensor
that can probably capture 4k video at 60
frames per second and slow motion at
1080p 240 frames per second and if the
second-generation maverick pro can also
have a 30-minute flight time that would
be great hey if you enjoyed the video
