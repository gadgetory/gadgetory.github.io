the Super Bowl halftime show a few weeks
ago the new mr. Chancellor picking up
the new silver ultra boost ultra booze
and Ches and pure rules but a few days
ago adidas did a restock which sold just
as quick but luckily I was able to score
a pair of the silver ultra Busan cage
and now that they're here let's get into
the review the silver ultra boost and
cage currently retails for $200 which is
$20 more than you standard ultra booster
to point out finish line Cola has an in
stock as well they also have a non dyed
white navy colorway for one aid
basically getting a color boost means
paying to annouce more like for these
are the description below just like
other ultra boost shoes you get a
continental rubber outsole which offers
a lot of grip and durability just be
ready to squeak when walking and highly
polished floors there's also a torsion
system built-in which really helps with
arch support the website will also let
you look at the boost underneath which
you will notice is what personally I
would have preferred if the bottom of
the boost mask the sides but speaking
about boost the midsole on the uncaged
is identical to the ultra boost 3.0 and
just as you'd expect it's super
comfortable to walk and run what makes
boots so special is its characteristics
its softie its Brittany
which allows for very high energy return
when running since the boost Metroland
the silver ion case is painted only time
will tell if it'll start to flake moving
up the shoe we've got to all primeknit
upper it has a very static looking
design to it with a silver reflective
thread woven in the silver threading
gives a shoe the shimmering look in just
the right lighting the prime minimally
uncase is very different from the old
caboose it's flat and smooth instead of
the textured design like on the ultra
boost there are also ventilation holes
woven right into the toe box of the
shoes the adidas 3 site logo is also
placed on the toe box with this plastic
over there there's more plastic overlays
where the laces weave through the prime
minute and that's there for durability
and rigidity Dolce Gusto encaged also
has a sock liner that helps keep the
shoe in place when they're on feet also
the sock lining here is a little more
rigid than the sock liner you
when it comes to fit the ultra boost on
case is very snug the true to size but
snug they have the same heel counter
from the ultra boost 3.0 but this time
there's a little more padding on the
inside but just like a doll to boost
there's absolutely no heel slipping
adidas also built in some on delays into
the shoe to help with construction and
ensuring the secure fit and unlike the
TPU cage on the ultra boost when you
tighten the laces on the uncased it
really helps with lockdown if you really
need and finally we've got the laces the
laces have the same black and silver
stack design of the primeknit upper but
without the silver threading we'd then
they also have orange and purple
Aglets that give the shoe a random pop
of color the laces on the uncage are a
little thicker than the ones found under
the standard attributes paper now
overall the ultra Kusum case is a very
well-made shoe just as you'd expect are
very comfortable to wear the plastic on
the lace really give the shoe a solid
shape and construction that keeps your
feet in place at all times the primeknit
is very flexible and breathable and the
woven in silver threading gives the shoe
the shimmering look when they're in the
right lighting as always believe the
hype if you haven't already you've got
to get something with boost in it
