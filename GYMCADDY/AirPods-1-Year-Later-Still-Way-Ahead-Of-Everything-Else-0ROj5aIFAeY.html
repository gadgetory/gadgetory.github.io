thought it'd be a good idea to share my
thoughts on the Apple earpods after
almost a year of consistently using them
the market is starting to get flooded
with wire-free earbuds but even a year
later the Apple earpods are still way
ahead of everything else out there don't
forget to Like comment and subscribe and
you can watch my other videos here after
you don't want in this view when the air
pods first got announced last year they
were ridiculed for their design people
said they look like toothbrushes
sticking out of your ear and people also
said the case itself looked like a
dental floss dispenser and people were
also questioning if the 160 dollar price
tag was justified but honestly I don't
think the air pods look bad at all when
you put them on and they're well worth
the money they only look ridiculous when
people wear them with the stem sticking
out to the sides like just tuck them in
but I know some people have to wear them
like that so that they actually stay in
place but if you've never had a problem
with your standard ear pods that come
included with your iPhone then you won't
have a problem with the air pods because
they have the same shape the only real
difference is the length and thickness
of the stem and - the wire obviously the
case has the same finish as the air
Potter's themselves are glossy white and
even after almost a year of using them
the case really only has some minor
scratches the hinge still opens and
closes very smoothly and there's no
cracks or bumps on the case itself but
what I have noticed is that there are
some stains that just won't come out the
air pods themselves still almost look
identical to when I first got them but
after some accidental drops there are
some scrapes on the top portion of the
buds after they hit the pavement the
plastic is pretty soft on both the air
pods and the case itself and every time
I draw my ear pods and I find a new
scrape on them it really breaks my heart
cause I paid $160 for them and these
accidental drops have really only
happened when I first some reason missed
when putting the buds back into their
case very rarely have the air pods
fallen out of my ears the air pods have
really only fallen out of my ears when I
was in a full sprint or if they got
knocked out when I put on or take off a
hoodie or sweater and I forget they were
in but again if you have the right ear
shape then the air pod stay secure
almost all the time and personally I
find myself just leaving the air pods in
my ears all the time as well - super
lightweight so you forget you even have
them on and if you're not playing music
they don't obstruct any of the
surrounding sounds if you get a phone
call you just quickly
double-tapping answer the call right
there and if you chose double tab you
can activate Siri and ask her to do
something and personally I feel like a
cyborg when I have them on and just not
having a wire to worry about when you
have the air pods on just gives you the
sense of freedom that's really hard to
put into words now having a wire is even
better when you're wearing a jacket you
don't have to run it underneath or worry
about it snagging on anything but not
having a wire it does mean you do give
up the inline controller found on the
earpods
and asking Siri to raise or lower the
volume pods or skipper track does take
longer than it should it's not a
seamless or as convenient when the air
bus first came out double tapping either
of the buds would only activate Siri but
through the magic of software updates
you now have a few more options you can
now make double tapping on one ear but
do one thing and double tapping the
other ear but do another thing
personally I like to have my left ear
bud to skip a track and I have my right
ear but activate Siri when I double tap
and when you take either of the earbuds
Aldo automatically pause your music and
start playing again when you put them
back in now I just want Apple to
introduce a triple tap option I think it
would really make the arrow pots even
more useful for power users but one of
the best features of the air pods is the
w1 chip aside from being able to pair to
your Apple device is super easy just
being able to quickly swap from one
Apple device to another is really cool I
can quickly switch from my iphone to
macbook to iPad in a matter of a few
taps in seconds and more importantly
headphones that featured the w1 chip
like the air pods power beats three
beats X beats solo three and B studio
threes have the least amount of lag
between video and audio when used with
another Apple device which matters
lockers other headphones I've used like
the Sony 1000x and two bose qc25 or
Bowers and Wilkins px you can notice
some latency sometimes when watching
videos but for those who might need to
pair the air pots to a non Apple device
all you have to do is press and hold the
button on the back of the case and it'll
put the ear pods into pairing mode and
battery life on the air pods is good a
single charge will last you five hours
when they're out of the case and the
case itself
charges the air pods and on average you
can go about four days without having to
charge the case itself but after you're
abusing them I have noticed the case
doesn't hold your charge as good as it
used to so I do find myself charging the
case more frequently than before with
this
usage and traveling with the earpods is
convenient until their battery dies
there have been multiple times where
I've just been sitting on an airplane or
in an airport terminal just waiting for
my airports to charge after using them
for an extended period of time
but since they do have quick charging 15
minutes under torture will get you 3
hours of playback time if you get the
air pods is because of convenience that
sound quality right off the bat you'll
notice the air pods have significantly
more base than the wire ear pods they
get significantly loud but they do
produce a lot of sound leakage overall
sound quality is decent enough they
don't sound tinny but the meds do tend
to get overpowered by the bass now
officially the air pods aren't
waterproof or water-resistant but after
a year of using them and getting them
wet from the rain or sweating on them I
really haven't had a problem but keep in
mind anything was waterproof until
turning not so don't get carried away
and personally I would still recommend a
pair of power beats over air pods for
working out but one of my biggest
problems with the air pods is putting
them in and realizing they don't have
any battery in them because you forgot
to charge the case sure you can see the
battery status of either earbud and of
the case in the witness page but I wish
the iPhone would send you a notification
when the case is low on battery I wish I
could make it so when the air pods case
is that 20 percent battery I'll get a
banner notification on my iPhone this
way I know I should charge the case but
it's not as intrusive or as annoying as
a pop-up notification you get when your
iPhone gets below 20 percent battery but
I really do enjoy the fact that I can
charge the air pods case with the same
cable I charge my iPhone thanks to the
Lightning port on the bottom and just to
jog your memory Apple did quietly
announce that this year's iPhone 10 and
iPhone 8 keynote that there will be a
new air Potts case with the wireless
charging and an LED light on the front
but there was no mention if this case
would work with all the air pods or if
the case would be able to supply you
with more battery over the 24 hours the
current case offers another thing I
dislike about the air pots is how much
Gont they pick up from your ears it can
get pretty nasty and it's not that easy
to clean out I have to get really
creative in order to get into those
crevices I found the best method for
cleaning air pods is using the corner of
a folded paper or using a toothpick if I
happen to find one line
I just wish Apple would include a
cleaning tool to clean your air pods
because again you're paying $160 for
these things but ideally I would really
like to see Apple redesign the air pods
so that they don't store as much gunk I
just want to make the extrusion so deep
that perhaps an oleophobic coating would
help as well now for those wondering yes
find my iphone does work with the air
pods but only when they're outside of
the case and in a wireless range of your
phone through the app you can have the
air putz play a distinguishable ping
sound if you happen to drop them in your
car or if they fall under something then
you can locate them a little easier but
if the air pods are inside of the case
or out of wireless range from your phone
then you will not see them on your Find
My iPhone map nor will you be able to
ping them and I know a lot of people are
going to use these to take phone calls
and the air pods have one of the best
microphones in a Bluetooth headset all I
met when I first got them they used to
drop a lot of phone calls but now their
connection is people and clear and what
the air pods you can have both or just
one in at a touch and this audio clip is
being recorded by the microphone on the
ear pods so you could be the judge of
that the air pods had a shaky start they
were delayed they were hard to get and
they were ridiculed at the beginning but
after getting so used to them using your
basic wired your pod seems almost
barbaric to me at times a lot of people
have accused Apple of not being as
innovative as they used to or that
they're just playing catch them now just
look at the home pod it's a meth looking
smart speaker that has already been
delayed but Apple really this set the
new standard for a while is earbuds with
the air pods because other wireless
earbuds out there just aren't as
convenient boses and Sony's offerings
are huge and the pixel blood are still
connected to a wire sure these current
air pods are probably gonna have to be
replaced in a year or so but the
convenience and ease of use is well
worth 160 dollars every 2 or 3 years or
so if you haven't gotten the air pods
just bite the bullet and get them for me
they're one of the top pieces of tech I
can't go without just don't lose them or
else you're gonna have a really bad time
if Apple is working on in air pods -
there isn't much I would change from the
overall design ideally I would like to
see about a quarter of an inch come off
of the air pod stem I would
to make the air pots too small because
then handling them might get a little
harder actually taking the air pods in
and out of the case is when you run the
biggest risk of actually dropping them
the overall footprint of the charging
case is fine it's easier to find and
hard enough to lose but I would like to
see it get a little thinner I just think
it's too noticeable when it's in my
pocket and I don't know how long it's
gonna take Apple but I have a hunch
they're going to stick a heart rate
monitor in there that might be the
selling point for the air pass 3 hey if
