every budget out there but the g5 60s
are logitech's first official gaming
speakers set up with a very different
approach to RGB lighting now I don't
have too much time these days for gaming
but I can't appreciate the g5 60 for
their sound quality and RGB goodness so
let's see how they stack up the Logitech
G 560 light sync PC gaming speakers
currently retails for 200 bucks that's
$50 more than the Dyson hair dryer
looking razor normal chroma which i've
personally been using in my setup for
the last few months they sound
surprisingly good and they're very
compact which I really like and the g5
60 cost less than half of the still yet
to be released
razors normal Pro if you're gonna pick
the Logitech G 560 up I'll have a link
at the description below and if you use
the link it really helps out to channel
check them out cuz you never know when
these speakers might go on sale the g5
6c is a two point one speakers setup
that comes included with two satellite
speakers and a downward firing subwoofer
the subwoofer also acts as a central hub
and you plug it into a computer via a
USB port now you can use an ox Jack but
the g5 60 doesn't come included with a
3.5 millimeter audio cable so you're
gonna have to use your own the satellite
speakers are both rockin 2.5 inch
diameter drivers and the sub has a 6.5
inch diameter driver regarding build
quality I'm not too worried about the
woofer tearing but the center does feel
like stiff cardboard but the satellite
speakers themselves feel much more
rugged than the Razer Naga chroma when
it comes to the g5 60s RGB lighting
setup each speaker has two sets of LEDs
that can display colors independent from
one another there your front ones that
face you and then there are the real
ones that act more like a floodlight and
in order to get the most out of the g5
60s your gaming setup should be up
against a not too cluttered wall and you
might have to play around with where you
place the speakers for optimal results
if the speakers were too far away from
the wall or if they just don't have a
surface to shine off of then these
speakers aren't good to look as epic as
they could through logitech gaming
software and it's pretty good you can
cycle through a few different lighting
modes you can turn certain LEDs on or
off and you can change the color of
these speakers to whatever you like if
you play one of the support games and
unfortunately the
is kind of short then you can use light
sink and experience game tripping
lighting effects but personally since I
mainly use these speakers for listening
to music I like using the audio
visualizer setting to get the lights to
flash to be there with music kind of
like my new Sony XP 41 but on a larger
scale on top of the right speaker
there's a volume rocker and a G key out
of the box this G key is going to cycle
through the RGB Lighting's brightness
but through Logitech software you can
remap this blind to do whatever you want
partially I'm in a super-psycho through
some of my equalizer presets and on the
back of the speaker there's a headphone
jack your power button and a Bluetooth
button the g5 60 is rocking with just
for that one so you can pair your phone
with them and play your music through
there when you're playing music through
your computer the g56 he gets
unnecessarily loud personally the max
volume II I can go up to is 75% volume
anything louder than that then the
speakers become unbearable but when
playing music through your phone I feel
the g5 60 doesn't get loud enough when
set to max volume
obviously through this video you're now
going to be able to feel the wall
shaking and chest-thumping bass the
subwoofer on the g5 60 gives off if
you're playing a game you're gonna feel
those gunshots and explosions and if you
live in an apartment and your neighbors
are gonna feel them too but if you're
gonna listen to music with these
speakers then the bass can get
overwhelming the satellite speakers have
very good mids and highs but the
subwoofer just overpowers all of that
straight out of the box what if you go
into lines of circuits gaming software
you can easily adjust the g56 ccq
settings and after lowering the base and
pushing the mids and highs forward the
g5 60 sounds remarkably good there's
really no attending at how our volumes
and the g5 60 does a really good job of
preventing any sound distortion
something that was very prevalent on the
Logitech z6 23 even though if you the
Logitech G 560 is a pretty good buy for
both gamers and just people like me who
like RGB stuff you do have to be ready
to live with the g5 60 the satellite
speakers themselves and subwoofer take
up a good amount of space I had to
rearrange my whole dust to cram the g5
60 in and I still had to put the
subwoofer between my feet if you're
planning on getting the g5 60 just make
sure you have the room for it your setup
also has to be just right for you to get
the most out of these speakers and in
order to get the most out of your
speakers you also have to play one of
the lights things to put in games but
hopefully that list will grow the g5 60
is a much cheaper alternative than
paying for the Razer Nomo chroma gaining
a few Phillips hue lightstrip sand bulbs
and getting them all to work through
synapse 3 it's not as good or as
flexible but it is a cheaper alternative
for people who want their games to
expand beyond their screens for not that
much money if you made it this far I
guess you enjoyed the video so hit that
