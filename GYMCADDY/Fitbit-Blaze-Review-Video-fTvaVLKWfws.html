king of the fitness tracker industry and
Fitbit has a fitness tracker for almost
every style and price point although
almost a month all now the Fitbit blaze
has received numerous update since
launch and it has helped to stay
relevant this hyper-competitive space
just as you'd expect this world will
contractor calories burn steps taken
distance want flights climb monitor your
heart rate and it'll even track your
sleep let's see what 199 95 gets you
just like the newer Fitbit charge to the
blazes boxes easy to get into inside you
see the blades itself front and center
some documentation and a charging cradle
that looks like a treasure chest you
only get one wristband included in the
box so make sure you select the right
size if you decide to buy one of these
it's obvious Fitbit went with the unique
silhouette for the blaze so I can stand
out from all of the other round and
square face smartwatches on the market
it's their sort of way of saying hey
we're different and we want you to know
it personally I like the hexagonal frame
and it helps with air circulation the
wristband itself is similar to other
Fitbit products it's made out of
silicone with the softest feel to him
and it has a raised such a design on it
it doesn't pull on here and it wicks
away sweat the frame itself is made out
of stainless steel unfortunately Fitbit
did drop the ball when it comes to the
side buttons they tend to wiggle a bit
and have a dissatisfied click to them if
you want to have multiple wrist bands so
you can mix and match with different
outfits Fitbit has you covered you can
get multiple different wristbands made
out of premium materials on Fitbit site
in order to remove the screen you just
push it out of the frame and in order to
charge it you just place a screen into
the included treasure chest and plug it
into any USB slot you've got Fitbit
advertises a five-day battery life but
after normally use it's more like four
days the screen on the Fitbit blaze is
large invite enough to be read in
various conditions but it does have
rather large bezels unlike the Fitbit
charge to our autumn the blaze has to
traditional touchscreen like your
smartphone as then it reacts with the
conductivity of your fingertips this
makes the screen super easy and
responsive when it's dry but if the
screen is covered in sweat it can be a
little harder to use and since this is a
fitness tracker at its core that's meant
to be worn while you work out this is a
little problematic the favorite place
has a gyroscope built in and it allows
it to turn on every time you lift your
wrist up you have a few watch faces you
can choose from and you can select which
is best for you from the Fitbit app on
your phone you can swipe left and see
your stats for the day you can swipe
left again
and initiate a workout now the Fitbit
blaze is able to automatically detects
or and exercises and start tracking them
on its own but we found it's best to
initiate it yourself for how your
accuracy if you flip left past the
exercise screen you'll be sent to fit
storm-fit stories fitbit's way of
putting a personal trainer on your wrist
it will walk you through three simple
routines that you can do literally
anywhere without any equipment that's
great if you're brand new to the gym
after fifth start you'll see the
stopwatch alarm in the settings tab the
Fitbit blaze is a little more capable
than the Fitbit charge to to recap they
can both count your calories burn track
your steps distance walk monitor your
heart rate and track your sleep the
Fitbit charge to can notify you and give
you a small preview when you get a text
a phone call or calendar reminder with
its small black and white screen the
place can do the same but with a little
more detail you can even control your
music from the blaze screen just like
other Fitbit products the real star here
is a Fitbit app itself all the data is
collected by the blaze is sent over to
the mobile app we can get all of your
stats the Fitbit app does a great job of
laying out all of your information
beautifully yet it can still show you
more technical performance data in an
easy-to-read matter the Fitbit app also
does a great job of keeping users
motivated with challenges to complete
and medals to earn although the Fitbit
blaze has a color touchscreen and it is
a very capable fitness tracker it's hard
to recommend when the Fitbit charge to
is fifty dollars cheaper has the same
features and comes in a more compact and
sleeker package if you're in the market
for a fitness tracker and are
considering the Fitbit blaze I highly
urge you to take a look at the Fitbit
charge two before you buy well if you
made it this far and leave us a like it
