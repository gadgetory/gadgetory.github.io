Newseum smooth for smartphone gimbal and
it was a good reason the hardware is
amazing this is definitely the film
makers gimbal but I feel that the
software still has a lot of growing up
to do here's what I like what I don't
like and what I would change on the new
ji-yoon smooth for smartphone component
the GU smooth for currently retails for
$139 that is the same as the new DJI
Osmo mobile - but I feel each gimbal
targets a different segment of the
market
which I will get into in the verses
video if you want to pick this gimbal up
and make something much more amazing
than me I'll have links in description
below and if you use the links it really
helps out the channel first let's go
over what you get with the smooth for
the smooth for comes in a hard styrofoam
carrying case that's very similar to
what the Osmo mobile 2 comes included
with you also get a foldable base
adapter that screws into the universal
mount found on the bottom of the gimbal
and you also get a USB a 2 USBC cable
for charging the gimbal itself is made
mostly out of plastic and weighs in at
750 grams with an iPhone 8 + installed
and 820 grams with the base adapter
attached the gimbal is definitely on the
bigger side compared to other smartphone
Gamble's out there but the smooth force
should be compatible with almost every
smartphone out there given that it has a
match payload of 210 grams for
comparison the iPhone 8 plus weighs in
at 148 grams the iPhone 10 weighs in at
174 grams the pixel to excel weighs in
at 175 grams and the Galaxy S 9 plus
weighs in at 189 grams ji-yoon also
advertises the battery life of 12 hours
on the smooth floor and it charges via
the USB C port on the side but the
battery life here is very variable
because depending on what phone you're
using how well you have a balance and
how much you're moving around will all
play a factor in how much of a battery
life you'll actually get unfortunately
you can't use the USB C port to charge
your own phone instead you have to use
the micro USB port found on the tilt
axis of the gimbal and personally I
don't have any micro USB to USB C cables
or micro USB to lightning cables or any
of that
for that matter I feel the smooth force
should have came included with a USB 8
port instead or at least let you charge
stuff you have the USB C port because
right now I think it's going to be very
hard to charge your own phone using the
gimbal and if you decide to shoot in 4k
with your phone you're really going to
need to constantly recharge your phone
now if you do decide to invest in a
gimbal obviously it's going to smooth
out your video but it's not going to be
perfectly smooth out you're still going
to get a little undulation but you can
always just smooth that out even more by
adjusting the way you walk and hold the
gimbal gu and zy play app also lets you
choose between having electronic image
stabilization on or off for the most
part I've been using it with a is turned
on but if you use it with a is turned
off then you're going to get a slightly
wider field of view but the smooth Ford
does a really good job of keeping your
phone on access no matter how much you
move around very rarely has a gimbal
messed up my shot because of how I was
holding the gimbal or because I moved in
a certain direction it also requires a
good amount of torque to reposition your
shot which I personally really like I
also really haven't experienced any
overheating issues with the motors
either and the gimbal itself manages to
stay very quiet so you're not going to
get a lot of squeaking in your shot but
keep in mind
unlike the smooth cue the smooth four is
not a 360 degrees gimbal but the biggest
feature the smooth four has to offer are
the manual controls and the zoom whirl
like I start at the beginning of this
video the smooth four is the filmmakers
gamble because you can manually adjust
all of your settings using the physical
buttons personally one of the things I
hated about the Osmo mobile 2 was having
to use the touchscreen to adjust my
settings and of the process messing up
my shot with the zoom wheel you can also
precisely adjust the zoom and you can
also pull focus but unfortunately even
though there is a slew of physical
controls to control your camera settings
there is no joystick to tilt or pan the
camera you have to do it manually and
personally I was surprised at first
because I assumed there was a joystick
and there have been multiple times where
I would have liked to have had a
joystick and I think gee you
should bring some tilt and pan
functionality with a software update
but maybe quickly double pressing the
flash blind in the center and using the
center dial to precisely adjust your pan
movement and maybe double pressing the
crosshairs so you can use the zoom wheel
on the side to precisely adjust a pan I
don't know there's just so much you can
still do with the hardware here but I'm
still amazed terrorist's no joystick and
in order to get the most out of the
smooth for you're better off using G you
ncy play up or else you're not going to
be able to use the physical controls for
the most part the zy play AB does a good
job of getting good image quality from
your camera the image quality is much
better than what you would get using the
smooth Q's app but I did notice the
image quality wasn't as clear when you
zoom in on something compared to the
iPhones native camera app just like most
other Gamble's the smooth four can also
be used to capture various panoramas but
unfortunately I found that I only worked
75% of the time and that's me being
generous and finally let's talk about
the active tracking it's mostly useless
the tracking feature loses a subject
very easily and you can't move the
gimbal too fast but since this is
software I hope she UHN will address
these issues with future updates but
finally let's talk about the handle like
I said at the beginning of this video
this is a pretty big gamble and in most
cases it's a two-handed gimbal but I
can't get over how much I hate the
handle it's not ergonomic it's really
just a rounded or rectangle and the
gimbal never rests comfortably in the
hand and the plastic itself is also very
slippery so like I recommended with the
Osmo mobile tool you better jerry-rigged
a wrist strap to this guy or else you're
gonna have a bad time when you
inevitably drop it so here's my verdict
on the ji-yoon smooth war it does what
it's supposed to do very well and that's
keeping your phone on axis no matter how
much you move around without almost
never snagging or adding unwanted
background noise when the motors are
working the physical control buttons let
you quickly and easily adjust your
capture settings on the fly so you can
get the best shot but I do feel there is
still room for improvement and
refinement and the zy play we need
better at stability and better active
tracking I also think ji-eun should give
us physical pan and tilt controls
through a software update but if you're
a mobile film
Aker the smooth war is still a great
tool I have
