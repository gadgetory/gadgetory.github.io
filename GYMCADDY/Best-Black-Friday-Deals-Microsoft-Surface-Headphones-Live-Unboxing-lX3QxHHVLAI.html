another live unboxing if you're new here
this is a series where I unbox a product
live because there have been times where
I've been completely blown away or
disappointed the first time I've unboxed
a product
case in point let's call candy venues
when I first unboxed those headphones
they were pretty disappointing and
overall I just don't like those
headphones and I still get a lot of hate
for that in the comments but it's
whatever but on the other side of the
spectrum there's the Skoll candy crusher
360s I absolutely love these headphones
these headphones have a lot of bass and
their build quality is actually very
impressive also since we're doing it
live you guys are going to get my real
first impressions and a reaction
something that I just can't recreate
because I'm not a good actor and also
too awkward for that alright so what's
next
and also since we're doing it live you
guys are gonna be able to interact with
me through the chat you can ask me
questions about the headphones or
whatever product you guys can ask me
about tech news or whatever but today's
livestream is extra special because
we're going to be talking about a lot of
Black Friday deals that I feel that you
guys need to know and also going to be
switching it up with live streams I
actually have a few pre-selected
questions from you guys that you guys
asked in some of my recent posts now for
today's victim we have the Microsoft
Surface headphones honestly I did not
see these headphones coming and I am
dying to know how these headphones
perform up against the Sony 1000x m3
which I think are the best ANC
headphones on the market right now
period so that actually segues us into
our first subscriber question and that
is since the Sony 1000 X and twos are
current or going to be going on sale for
$200 on Black Friday should they pick
these headphones up how do the 1000 XM
choose compared to other ANC headphones
like the bose qc25 series 2 and or
should they just save up and get at the
1000x and 3's for their full price
because right now it doesn't look like
these headphones are going to be going
on sale so that is the first subscriber
German Aryan question and honestly that
question was so good that I actually
that I sat down for an hour just like
debating it and think and thinking it
and I actually thought about making a
dedicated video for that but um I think
this is gonna be good enough now
remember if you guys want to pick
anything up mention in this live stream
I'm gonna have those things let link
down below again it helps me out at no
cost to you now certain 1000 X some
choose so these headphones like I said
for Black Friday are going to be going
for $200 out a lot a lot of places like
I said in the full review when we got
the 1000 X and threes I honestly did not
expect to get these headphones so so
short though for me the 1,000 X and twos
I thought these were going to be Sony's
flagship agency headphones for at least
another year because these have the best
performing technology in them they block
out more noise than the Bose qc3 5
series 2 which also are only going to be
going on sale for $300 and those came
out around the same time as these did I
think the 1000 X and twos sound better
than the bose qc25 because you can go
into the our app and adjust the EQ and
you can bump up the bass up a lot a bit
and not just a little bit and they also
have the better battery life now the
problem with the 1000 X them too that a
lot of people you know like to point out
and you know I'm not disagreeing the
1000 exim twos aren't as comfortable to
wear as the both QC 35 is a Bose QC 35 0
ear cups or much bigger and they're much
deeper so if you have larger or ears
that stick out a lot and you're better
off going with going off with the bose
qc25 but with the 1000 X I'm twos if you
have medium ears or ears that don't
stick out too much you you'll be fun
you'll you will adjust because you know
I use these headphones for over a year
and you know I got used to it now
another thing about these headphones is
that the Sony 1000x is the original one
the MDR 1000x
those headphones got like a very bad
reputation of their headband cracking
all the time now I when I have the MT
1000x I didn't have that these have been
my personal 1000x and chews and you know
I've you I used these day in and day out
until I got the 1000 X and threes they
they have it they're not like worn out
during out ruined you know I have I've
had no build quality issues with the
1000 XM twos and then that's also
another reason why I made that video
we're featuring the 1000 X and choose
one year later now so so yeah if you go
if you get the 1000 X and choose I think
you're going to be in good hands because
the 1000 X M 2 s have the better
performing technology the better ANC's
sound the longer battery life but their
build quality there looks and your fit
isn't you know not as good as the bose
qc25 so that's something you might want
to take into consideration what's up
we'll get into speakers later ok so so
that's my answer as to how these
headphones compared to the Bose qc3 5s
and I think and I also feel that these
are better than the Sennheiser pxc 550
and those headphones they're like almost
2 years old I I'm very bullish on on son
Heiser announcing the new PXE 5 50s at
CES 2019 so you know I'm very bullish on
that now when it comes to these
headphones compared to the 1000 x m3
okay hold on so like I said I would have
been perfectly fine if these were Sony's
flagship headphones for at least one
more year and but those sony 1000 XM
threes they have a far superior fit
their ear cups
or way more spacious compared to the
1000 xm2 give me a close-up on that yeah
okay so the 1000 X + 3 0 cups are way
more comfortable than the 1000 X and
twos but they're still not as
comfortable as the both QC 35 so again
if you have larger ears that stick out a
lot both you see 35s may be your best
bet but again those are going on sale
for 300 dollars instead of 200 like the
1000 x m2 now I know that some people
you know it's hard for them to justify
dropping 350 dollars on a pair of of
headphones but if you you know you want
to spend the 2 million dollars to get
the 1000 X and twos um you know one of
the things the biggest difference
between these headphones and these
headphones is their fit build quality
and looks when it comes to their
performance the one that I can actually
actually can't hear anything the
performance on the 1000x m3 is just a
little better than the performance on
the 1000 XM - these block out a little
more noise they sound a little better
and they have a little bit more bass and
what else they have the same battery
life the the only battery life
difference between these headphones and
these headphones is that these
headphones get you 10 minutes of fast
five hours of fast charging from a 10
minute charge whereas these these are
only good for one 10 minutes one hour so
fast tourism is important this is
something to take into consideration
we'll get there we'll get there he's
just very excited to show you the new
setup so what else what else
and also the looks these are built
better than the 1000 X and choose the
headband is much more low-profile hold
on the headband is much more low-profile
the ear cups are a little bit more
low-profile I think these look just
overall better because Sony finally got
rid of the leather ear cups I I've never
really been a big fan of the leather ear
cups on the 1000 X and twos I like this
some soft hood survived they've got
going on here so so yeah if you if your
budget is $200 for a pair of anc
headphones you're going to be in a
really
really good hands with the 1000x on Tues
but if you have the money to spend on
the 1000x and threes in the long run
you're going to be better off with these
guys again there there's the the
performance is slightly better but more
importantly their build quality their
fit is way better than the 1000x m2 so
that's my answer for our first
subscriber and generative question now
for the second question that we just got
from the live chat actually segways in
pretty good caramel show me this setup
over there okay
so say hello to this new setup so the
question was something about the charge
for unfortunately the charge forum isn't
on sale right now and you know it kind
of makes sense because they only came
out like a month and a half ago but the
JBL boombox is actually on sale for like
$380 the JBL extreme 2 is down to $250
and the JBL post 3 camera man give me a
close-up on the post 3 yeah the one with
the lights if that guy is down to all
the way to $120 now the post 3 when at
retail is $200 it's been forever on sale
for 170 and now for Black Friday is down
to 120 if you want like a good speaker
for like your dorm room or your bedroom
or whatever and the post 3 is going to
be a great option and so let's see the
it's like I said the extreme 2 is down
to 250 which you know that's $50 saving
from $300 the original retail price I
don't think those headphones are going
to be going I mean not have fun I don't
think the extreme 2 is going to be going
any lower than them and then we have the
Big Daddy boombox over there that
speaker retails for $450 and is down to
$380 now the last time that speaker was
down to $380 was back in the summer and
you know it was down to $380 I've never
seen it go past $380 so if you want to
pick up the boom box or the extreme to
all the poles through I think right now
is
very good time because for a comparison
cameraman look over there left corner
the og extreme because for a comparison
that little guy over there is currently
on sale now for $200 but honestly I
wouldn't pick it up because that that
speaker does not and will never have
JBL connect Plus unlike the JBL charge 3
which if you buy it you can get a
firmware update and you can get JBL
connect plus and so yep ok can i man
look at me look over there
now look at me now kidding it was a bit
okay so we have any questions or can we
get into the unboxing or the church 3 um
exchange first like I just said get the
charge 3 because the charge 3 it's I
think it's an on sale now for like $100
120 but more importantly you can get
that for more update and get JBL connect
plus so if you want to get other JBL
speakers in the future in the near
future then the charge 3 is going to be
the better investment than the extreme
one because that the extreme one if you
get that speaker that's it I mean the
extreme one can only be paired up to
older speakers like the pulse what is
this the pulse 2 and this has JBL
connect you know the original one so so
yeah that's my answer to that if you're
if extreme one or charge three get the
charge three okay uses loss it was that
a good question why you losing good
questions well yeah because we're trying
to get this live stream oh yeah like I
don't even have them here right now but
like if the crusher crusher Oilers are
here crusher 360s these things these
things are just I don't know this is
this is just every time I put them on I
can't I can't stop smiling these things
or just they the only problem they have
is that they don't get to allowed but
the bays the thumping bass if you just
want to have
a good time if you're having a bad day
and you need to cheer up these
headphones will do it for you and again
you know like I said on the full review
which for some reason the algorithm just
isn't giving it any love because it only
has like 8,000 views the build quality
amazing for like $300 $200 headphones
great I love their design they fit well
and they sound very good
the only issue is they don't get too
loud but the bass if you want bass if
base is all you want and mean these are
these are the guys you gotta get it
doesn't matter it doesn't it doesn't
matter they both get the difference
between the charge to end the charge for
really there isn't a big difference I
mean they both the the the the only
difference between torch 3 and charts
for is the bass the choice for has just
a little bit more bass than the charge 3
but it gets just as loud it has the same
battery life I mean it's it if I were
you if you're tight on cash get the
charge 3 save yourself some money so the
boombox one more time the XP 40 100k
that actually sucks ways it's to another
question community your legs days ok so
another thing is since we're talking
about the sony xba-40 one all of these
guys here are basically like almost well
not 50% off the XP 41 right now is going
for 150 the XP 31 is going for our
hundred bucks the XP 21 is going for
like 70 bucks now I am NOT a big fan of
the XP 21 I do not like this speaker at
all it sounds this this is a genuine
downgrade from the sony xba-1 a small
speaker you know this this size 70 bucks
I think you're gonna be much better off
going with the JBL flip for so I
wouldn't even consider picking the
speaker up now sony speakers
these were decent if they're on sale and
you just want one speaker even though
you know I've been very vocal about this
I love Sony's headphones Sony is killing
it right now with headphones there's
speakers on the other hand they need
they need some work um especially when
it comes to like audio clarity their
Wireless party chain feature that's a
nightmare and what else and their
battery I absolutely hate that when
you're playing music with these with
these speakers if they get down to 20
percent battery they're gonna cut your
music they're gonna say please charge
and then you can't raise your your
speaker's volume past 50% it's a 50% it
might be lower so those are some of the
things I just hate about Sony speakers
in general but since these two guys
since these two guys are on sale 150 100
and you just want one speaker and if you
want a speaker that can do it all goes
battery life super rugged you can take
it anywhere and you got that life strip
that's gonna you know look good in your
dorm room or if you go to a party then
then these these are good but they're
not going to be as good as the JBL
extreme 2 for the XP 41 or the torch for
this isn't going to be as good as the
charge for it what is it what's up thank
you for the super tab by the way one
charge for or two flip Ford's one charge
for or 2 flip floors what well what do
you need it for I actually sometimes
depending on your situation sometimes
it's better to have a few small speakers
just placed around an area covering or
large area of music where at lower at
lower volume then have it one big
speaker just like blaring your music if
you can get to to flip fours for the
price of one charge for I think I would
get the flip
or three or flip or charge three charge
hmm charge three I mean it depends on
you money if you can see if you can
spend the money on the charge three get
the charge three but if you but if you
want to get to flip fours or one charge
three I would get to 4/4 yeah 250 have
you been I just mentioned that I just
did like a whole thing it's right over
there
253 80 120 all right let's get over to
these guys these things have been
sitting on my desk
well is this a desk my table my thing
these things I've been sitting here okay
okay so these things have been sitting
on this table since Monday the funny
thing is actually when it's morning went
to go pick them up since I'm so
dedicated to this live stream they
actually had a model on the showroom
floor and actually I had to like go I'd
buy like this I learned I can't see the
headphones cuz I need the real reactions
of first impressions for the live stream
and the guys the sales guy was like oh
oh come here just try them on you know
you're gonna love them right no no I got
this thing to do over there I can't I
got to go just give it a thing bye all
right so anyway let's get these things
out of the box like I said I did not
expect these headphones at all these
were a genuinely big surprise which is
kinda you know kind of different these
days cuz all tech products get leaked
some way or somehow I didn't see these
coming and so yeah let's get this thing
out of the box you know I think when I
first posted about these headphones the
first thing I thought was these look
exactly like the bang and all of sin h
9i but these have like this here is like
a little angled up so that's one of the
biggest differences between the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen audio is okay right I mean we
don't have any audio issues in the chat
chat let me know if you have any audio
you're unboxing down are you able to
review the beats pill mm no no I mean
right now B Apple Apple is kind of Oh
actually Apple is kind of you know like
taking it very slow with Beats right now
and that actually is actually another
great segue for another oh look at that
okay that's the case this case this is
very similar to Sony's case texture-wise
okay so yes so just like the 1000 XM
threes this guy has a fabric body but I
can tell you right now the Microsoft
Surface headphones don't fold up they
only fold down flat so you know it kind
of sucks I like it when headphones can
do both this and this so it looks like
this can only do that alright but
actually this segues up it segues into
another topic I wanted to talk about
real quick
cameraman at me awesome well this is
awesome okay so talking about beats an
Apple bought beats and ever since that
happened the only new products we've
seen coming out of Beats or if the beats
X the beats X the Beats Studio 3 the
beats solo 3 and we haven't seen any new
speakers from them yet but every time
Apple sells an iPhone they would like
for you to use their Beats Studio 3
which they're not good but Samsung
actually has like a similar setup to
that now because they got a cagey and I
was actually planning on doing a live
unboxing with these headphones and the
new AKG and 700 and see they were
supposed to arrive today but apparently
Samsung doesn't know what expedited
shipping works like so I was gonna have
those headphones here but they're not
here but that video is coming because
for some reason the press hasn't been
those headphones any luck so I'm
genuinely interested to see how those
headphones perform so that's gonna be on
the channel and there's gonna be a big
video with the 1000x m3 is these
headphones and the AKG alright what's up
for 100 euros if 100 euros is like a
hundred bucks absolutely on it's not
it's like 120 yes like 120 so so I
posted last week these things went on a
flash sale for 98 bucks if you picked it
up if you follow my advice and pick it
up that's great right now they're back
to 200
I think these headphones will be going
back on sale for 98 bucks between Black
Friday and Cyber Monday I really really
do think these are going to go on sale
again for 98 bucks if they do I say take
advantage of that sale because the last
time these headphones were on sale for
98 bucks it was on prime them after
prime day till last week they they be on
sale for like 150 130 I think I saw them
for like 120 once so that's up to hung
it all the price and these if they hit
that price pick them up as soon as you
can because you're not going to see it
again until like prime day or something
and you know overall these are a really
good pair of budget headphones even
though the Sun highs were 4.5 OB TNCs
they look better and they have the
better build quality these I think are
better because they have more features
you know you can adjust your EQ you can
they have you can adjust their ANC they
have the better agency and another thing
is these headphones got the Google
assistant for more updates so now if you
know you use them if you want you can
change this nc button which is a button
that you usually use to turn on ambient
mode on not a note a and C on or off you
can use it to invoke Google assistant
and again keep in mind Google assistant
you know having Google assistant right
on the product versus pressing and
holding to activate Google assistant
it's two different things having Google
assistant is faster you can ask her more
questions
more convenient hmm
the base on the 360s is like I can't I
mean if the base on the 360s is like
having just like this semi-truck just
like it's like it's like being on the
George Washington Bridge New York right
in the middle of George Washington
Bridge with gridlock traffic on the one
side and then you just have like all the
semi trucks just just rolling across and
you feel the bridge just like jump and
just up and down up and down this is
that this these headphones are just
there I don't know of any other pair of
headphones that have more bass than
these headphones a lot of fun okay
anyway let's get back to the when
Microsoft Surface headphones for some
reason I always want to call them the
Windows headphones what's up like
explain it I mean I have a video
dedicated just to that show well I'll
post that up here it'll come out but
either but anyway I mean I think the hmm
the best JBL speaker to get right now if
you want something that looks nice and
it's going to be used mostly at home
pulls three if you want an all-around
you know good sounding speaker charge
three having charge four or three charge
three or fourth and then if you're
trying to decide between the boombox and
extreme to I think most people will be
okay with the extreme too especially if
you want to take it on the go somewhere
but the boombox you know that one has
the most bass and but but that was only
really good if you have the room for it
that's most importantly and you know if
you're gonna be using mostly at home and
then just take it on the go from time to
time but yeah I have a dedicated video
on that you see the numbers you see this
you see the sound comparison so just
check that one out
so let's actually do the first reveal on
these headphones okay all right so let's
go
oh oh oh that's this doesn't happen me
all the time yeah I promise it's never
happiness hold on exactly okay hold on I
don't I do not like this case this is
why we do this okay hold on let's try
that again
maybe ezel needs to be broken in yup
okay all right mmm not a fan of that
zipper all right ready and oh oh they
smell it still smell like the factory
whoo all right hold on let's see what we
got here
now another very important thing that I
definitely want to test out on these
headphones is their touch sensitivity oh
they actually have to touch patch okay
um so just keep in mind whenever I do a
lot of unboxing I don't watch any
reviews I don't read anything I try to
go in here as blind as possible just to
make this a little bit more interesting
so yeah this thing actually has two
touch pads we're gonna have to see how
the touch pad accuracy is on this
because Oh actually that's what reminds
me uh cameraman the audio technica seven
a and C 700 B T the audio technica has a
pair of $200 engine C headphones those
headphones are now down to 150 I still
wouldn't recommend those headphones
because their touch pad is just very
very bad I wouldn't recommend those
headphones those are the ones with the
ANC now I am aware of the new audio
technica MX 50 BT or MX 70 BT the new
ones that that video you know I'll get
to that video once I'm done with these
big boys but that videos are also coming
but just want to let you guys know about
audio Technica's and c headphones even
though it's down to 150 i want to pick
them up so let's see what we got here we
got a USB C to USB a cable very long USB
a to USB why is this so long this is
this is way longer than it has to be
is that bad I mean it's not bad but it's
just way longer than it has to be
alright and let's see oh when mike
microsoft this this this audio cable is
so so so so so flimsy you know why is
this thing here or it's a mic this audio
cable is song flimsy one of the things
about the 1000 X and 3 is that I don't
like is that even though those are 350
all the headphones there are audio
cables so bad so what I do now is that I
use the 1000 X on Tuesday do cable and I
use that with my with my and 3's I don't
get why these premium headphones are
coming with such cheap audio cables
because hold on oh my god nuts in here I
don't get why these premium headphones
are coming with such cheap audio cables
I mean at least the surface headphones
that audio I mean it's yeah the surface
headphones audio cable isn't is half as
thick as the m3s audio cable I mean
these are premium headphones I want a
premium cable because you know for
content creators and whatnot I still I
still use a wired connection on a daily
basis what does this go with this it was
in here and we can drop that over there
so let's oh wow this is like a little
soft and whatnot and let's see actually
and we got the case ok so I these are
light these are very light oh and
there's a sticker zoom up on the stick
around then oh that was oh that was it
oh no that wasn't that wasn't right okay
okay so oh there's more stickers over
here why does this thing have so many
stickers so that what is this
can we get a lie arm waxing no okay hold
on let's see let's see
oh wow these are very very light but
there's very little padding up here okay
all right
all okay so the good thing about these
headphones when I first saw these
headphones I was kind of worried if that
since they were circular headphones
personally I
I always think oval ear cups are more
comfortable than circular ones but they
actually had the foresight and we
actually have a good oval cut out so
this is just about styling and you know
padding on this it's pretty decent but
it looks like I can already tell right
now that these headphones might suffer
from overheating just cause they have a
lot of padding in contact with your head
so we're gonna have to see how
overheating plays on these headphones
let's see you left right and we're gonna
put these on for the first time I'm
gonna see if these are big at approved
and yes and they're very late
wow that is light beyond these hardware
wise hardware wise is nice and then okay
so there's a die oh yeah is this okay
this thing has two down so we're gonna
have to see what these owls are all
about how do you power these on let's
see you know for those who might be
Angela said there's the product case
okay touch area titanium playing next
previous activate Cortana answer and
call the client call to set up to set up
and configure your headphones go to
surface calm for / headphones god damn
it Microsoft why why can't I have a
thing oh wait there it is there's more
things down here hold on so
this is the case this is a very big case
this case is I would argue larger than
the case that came included with the
Skullcandy venues and oh it's actually
wedged look at it okay so let's see how
do you power this on all right while I'm
getting this out of the box comment we
have any interesting questions on the
chat away all right activating noise
cancellation speakers I think so but I
like recent speakers I don't I don't
think so
maybe um I know I know
the Skullcandy push wireless earbuds
those leak that I posted on my my time
line a few days ago maybe scroll candies
gearing up to announce a few products at
CES 2019 so we're going to see the
wireless earbuds in at CES 2019 probably
I want to be shocked if it they also
announced like a new speaker turn on a
surface that comes up press and release
the power button quickly to okay okay so
look here are the control buttons here
this is very very flush but this one's
raised and we got a USB C and an audio
jack which is good okay okay oh I can
feel the anc working already
okay so ANC is on there is no cabin
pressure say something something say
this is the test say something else
something else say something for real
your hairy herbs awesome um we're gonna
have to test the ANC here because right
now this ANC isn't blocking too much
we're gonna have to look into that but
first impressions on these is the
hardware feels good what is this doing
there's like some beeping there's some
beeping going on okay I know it okay say
something something okay now this is
ambient mode is on but there's a lot of
like it's obviously picking up
everything that's going on around me but
it doesn't feel it doesn't sound right
so you say something else something else
hmm
quote your favorite prequel meme I held
the high ground yeah this there's like
some echoing going it doesn't sound
right okay now use these back on how do
I turn off a and C ambient sound
amplified and that's all hmm we're gonna
have to suss that ambient mode in and
see because it's kind of not what I'm
used to right now so we're gonna have to
check out the tech on these but the
verdict on the first impression verdict
on these is amazing hardware this
actually looks very very nice and it
feels good if there's like this this
like stone finish to it is like slate
it's not plastic it's like textured it's
soft touch but not so soft I like it um
design-wise I like the design and you
know I I think I think this here is what
what what is that there's like static I
don't know I was just talking there's
like static or not I don't know I think
I think let's see the headband I think
this is going to be a little polarizing
because it kind of looks like you have
piggy tails on or something I've yeah
your static hold on why is there static
am i touching the A&amp;amp;C mic or something
all that but no that's not doing it all
right well we're gonna have to try this
out so software is a little questionable
right now but constructing fit these are
big had approved overheating we're gonna
have to try that out because the there
is a lot of surface area in contact with
your skin and that's usually what causes
more overheating on headphones than
others build quality I'd like to build
quality but we're gonna have to see how
that a and C and ambient mode performs
because I'm a little mmm if you um
that's right now what's up we have any
other questions here but actually that
act I actually have one more user
generated a question and I also got one
PSA another USA so another user
generated a question that I got was now
that the LG pk7 is on sale for like 150
and we're like 170 something along those
lines I don't I don't like the zipper
should you pick it up no I wouldn't pick
I want to pick up the LGP k70 up for
$150 Eva I'm not a fan I remember when I
tested that speaker I mean last week it
was so bad I got rid of it I remember
when I tested that speaker the XP 31 was
getting louder than that speaker so you
know even though right now the ljpk 7 is
on sale I wouldn't pick that up even
though the audio technica ANC 700 BT I
think that's the name audio technica ath
ANC 700 B team since those are on sale
for like 150 right now for Black Friday
I you wouldn't put those headphones up
either because the touch controls are
very finicky and so yeah but another PSA
is what I would pick up now this deal
was so good I actually couldn't I got it
myself I couldn't ignore it kind of man
give me that box
obviously the
the TV itself isn't here it's downstairs
but I picked this this TV up for over
for like a total land of cost you know
shipping taxes and everything 400 bucks
the Samsung UHD TV it's a 4k 43 inch TV
120 Hertz Smart TV since my xbox is died
I needed something so I can watch
Netflix and YouTube on so I thought you
know what it's time to upgrade you got a
TV all the research that I've done in
like comparing pricing and features and
whatnot I think this is one of the best
Black Friday deals you can get this sum
the seventh series now it's important to
keep in mind there was a six series and
the seven series I think the difference
between the six series and the seven
series is just a $50 difference and the
only performance difference is that the
seven series is actively help raising up
or raising all of your content from 1080
to 4k I don't really you know know what
the big like visually what the
difference is between the six and seven
series but you know if the difference is
fifty bucks just to be safe I picked up
the seven series and so if you're in the
market for a TV I think the Samsung
seven series that's a good that's a good
deal right there so good that I got it
myself so again anything mentioned in
the stream is linked down below if you
use those links it helps me out and no
cost to you cameraman we got any other
questions how do you turn these things
off those have phone watches over
comparing the watch the 702 the xB 950 n
ones is like comparing as like comparing
Skullcandy question 360s
to the sony 1000 XM threes this this is
your luxury sedan your luxury sedan so
I'm a car guy so this is your Mercedes 5
S Class 550 your BMW 7-series your Audi
a8 okay it's not a Rolls Royce listen no
it's not a Rolls Royce this is your
Porsche 911 you're maybe oh the new
attribute or supra does
come out let's say your your Ford Raptor
your BMW m2 this this is the these are
the pair of headphones you want to pick
up if you want to have fun so so I
wouldn't I want to compare these
headphones to that that the same thing
goes for the watch 700 end and the XP
950 n ones if you want a good pair of
anc headphones you know use them live
with them travel with them good if you
want a pair of headphones to have fun
with that's what these extra bass
headphones are for then I would get the
Indiana ones
now the XP 950 n ones went on sale for
like I think 120 last week again I
posted those I posted that deal on the
time line so I think a few people took
advantage of that good on you so if you
can get them on sale for like 120 again
if they go on sale on Black Friday or
Cyber Monday then yeah they're good
especially because like I really doubt
the crush of 360s are going to be going
on sale anytime soon because like these
these are three hundred dollars like
that's another thing I don't think I
mentioned even though these are great
these are $300 for bass headphones
that's a lot but given their build
quality and actually how much fun I have
I can justify them but right now I
really really do think the X we're gonna
see at CES 2019 we're going to see a new
version of the Sony here one two and a
new version of the Sony xb9 50 n1
because i like to think of these two
headphones like the new generation of
Sony headphones so the watch a 700 N and
the 1000 X and 3 and the reason why is
because they have this leather covered
headband so there's leather up top okay
and also this came out in the spring of
2018 this came out in August September
of 2018 so these came out relatively
backed you know together around the same
time and I'd like to think of the 1000
xm2 as the previous generation
headphones because these headphones you
know they don't have the leather up top
so like it has a different design
language going on so I really do think
we're gonna see a new pair of heel on
twos so the here on Three's at CES 2009
teen and I and and and we have to see an
updated version of the Sony xb9 fifty
and one because technically those are
called the sony MDR XP 950 n1 or are
whereas these the 1000 x and twos are
technically called the sony a w8 1000 x
m2 alright and all of these headphones
this is the wh CH 700 this is the wh
1000 x m3 so you have so you get like if
you look at the naming schemes this is
wh-wh this is also wh but the XP 950 n1
doze or the MDR XP 950 n1 so those are
like an even older generation so so
again I'm very bullish on seeing an
updated version of the XP 950 n1 at CES
2019 in the here on Three's SC s 2019
and Sony if you guys want to fly me out
and you know cover it I will try to do
my best I still have no idea what I'm
doing but I'm game we've got another
questions I don't know what Robin is but
I'll look into it
you know there's a lot going on but I'll
look into if the bobbin speakers ok so I
think we got everything
how long is it stream I think we're him
46 minutes oh man no wonder you like
wrap it up ok so guys oh one last thing
speaking about talking about speakers I
post it on the timeline guys check out
the my latest miss speaker comparison
video because the UE boom 3 is on sale
the post 3 is on sale the XP yeah get a
look at the post 3 the post 3 is on sale
