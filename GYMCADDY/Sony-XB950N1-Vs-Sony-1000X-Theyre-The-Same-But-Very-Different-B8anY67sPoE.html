the Sony xb9 50 n one on my go-to
headphones and if you watch my last
video you know i like the sony MDR 1000x
over the bose qc25 mainly because they
sound better and I really like the
ambient sound features but some people
have asked me if they should get to XP
950 and one what the 1000x so which
right for you we're about to find out
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and you can check out some of
my other videos here after they don't
watch in this video
almost everything in Sony's lineup is on
sale which is just awesome when they
first came out with the sony xba-40 n1
they retail for $249 for one hundred
seventy eight dollars but at the time of
this recording you can get them for as
low as 100 $24.99 that's insane and
you've got two colors to choose from
black or green the sony MDR 1000x it's
also on sale they used to retail for 399
and last week they're on sale for three
hundred twenty eight dollars but right
now now on sale for two hundred
ninety-eight dollars
i don't know how long these prices will
last but if you want to pick either
these headphones up I'll have links in
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deal
possible first orders let's adjust the
designs of these headphones they're both
mainly made out of plastic they both
have the same metal headbands the
material on the faux leather ear comes
and headband to feel exactly the same
they can both be laid flat and D both
fold up but you will notice the XP 950
and one on much larger and bulkier than
the 1000x the Sony xb9 50 n1 are so
large that you can actually see them in
your peripheral vision when you put them
on but what that has an X on the other
hand have a much more subtle design and
they're much more low-profile the Sony
1000 X basically are much more
professional-looking and although both
of these are very comfortable headphones
to wear I would pick the 1000 X over the
xB 950 n1 for two very small reasons the
first reason is because the cut in the
ear cup is larger on the 1000 X then on
the 950 n1 so they don't press on my
earlobes while I wear them and the
second reason is because since the 1000s
have much
less padding than the 950 and one they
don't warm your ears up as much but like
I said they're both very comfortable to
wear but I'm just being nitpicky and as
objective as possible another main
feature of these has folded back noise
cancellation and although the active
noise cancellation on the XP 950 n1 is
decent it's nowhere near as good as a
1000 X if you're going to be travelling
or commuting a lot the 1000 X is the way
to go they can handle airplane bus and
city noise much better than the XP 950
anyone the north cancellation on XP 950
n1 is only worth using in a quiet
environment like a coffee shop office or
at home and not to mention the 1000x
also feature ambient sound settings
there's ambient sound normal well the
headphones will pump in all the
surrounding sound in this is a good
feature to have if you're walking in the
city
then there's ambient sound voice the
hassles will block out the majority of
the surrounding sound and will only let
in people's voices this features good to
have if you're working in office and
your boss is asking you for those
useless TPS reports and then there's
your standard noise cancellation
settings well they will block out
everything whereas with the XP 950 and 1
you can only turn noise cancellation on
or off and with the sony 1000x if you
cover the touchpad on the right ear cup
the headphones will lower the volume of
whatever you're listening to and let in
all the outside sound in so someone is
trying to talk to you you can hear them
without having to take off your
headphones this by 4 is my favorite
feature in speaking of the touchpad you
control your music playback on the 1000x
by double tapping to play or pause your
music you swipe front or back to skip or
go back a track you swipe up or down to
adjust the volume and you can press and
hold to activate Siri it's easy to use
and it's very accurate in order to
control your music playback on the XP
950 n1 you just use the rock of found on
the right ear cup it's easier to find
and very straightforward as well I just
wish the volume rocker on the 950 n1 was
textured so it's easy to find
concerning tech specs both of these
headphones are using bluetooth 4.1 and
they both have a range of around 40 feet
with the right line of sight with your
phone when it comes to battery life that
XP 950 n1 is good for
two hours and the 1000x is good for 20
hours and that's when they're being used
wirelessly and with noise cancellation
turn on if you use these headphones at
lower volumes over the noise
cancellation turn off or with a wide
connection then you'll be able to get
longer battery like that of them but
just know both of these headphones take
a while to charge back up in order to go
from zero to 100 on the XP 950 and one
it's going to take seven hours while
with the 1000 X is going to take four
hours and neither one of them has fast
charging which is a bummer the biggest
difference between these two headphones
is sound quality the 1000 X are made for
easy listening and there's enough space
to keep the average person happy
compared to the 950 and one the 1000x
has a wider sound stage with more death
and less distortion in the highs the
sound on the XP 9 inches the N one is a
little more forward in the instruments
separation isn't as good but these
things are made for peace if they will
rattle your head and I love it they also
get much louder sure if you're looking
for something to really jam out with
then the xb9 choose the n1 are the way
to go and with the sony xba-40 n1 you
can control the bass through some these
headphones app and like I send the past
so these mobile apps aren't the best but
the headphones app is pretty stable
through the app you can raise or lower
the amount of bass 2xb 950 and 1/2 and
personally I like to keep mine on 7 you
can also change the surround sound
setting so you can feel like you're in
an arena club or concert hall but
personally I just keep this feature off
and you can also turn off noise
canceling on the headphones we can also
do that from the NC button on the head
full of themselves and finally the last
two main differences on these headphones
are already included carrying cases with
the sony MDR 1000 actually get a hard
shell carrying case and with the xb9 to
the n1 you just get a soft shell
carrying case obviously the hard shell
carrying case will offer more protection
than the soft shell 1 you also get a
plain adapter with the 1000x and you
also get a better quality audio cable
whereas with the xb9 50 and 1 you get a
slightly cheaper cable and no plain
adapter so which will raise for you well
if you want something with a lot of bass
and still sound great I would go with
the XP 950 n1 and not to mention there
is still at 125
but if you're going to be traveling a
lot and you need something with better
noise cancellation and something more
low-profile then get the 1000 X
basically the Sony 1000 X have far
superior noise cancellation and the XP
950 n1 are made for people who love bass
and listen to a lot of hip-hop rap R&amp;amp;B
and EDF
I just wish these headphones have quit
charging and I would like to see Sony
improve on the ear cuffs on the XP 950
n1 and make the ear cuffs on the 1000 X
more breathable but at the end of the
day the SB 950 n1 or still might go to
headphones hey if you enjoyed the video
