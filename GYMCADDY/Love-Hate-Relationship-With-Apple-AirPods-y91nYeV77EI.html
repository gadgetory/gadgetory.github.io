ran out to help keep me on track in my
videos but I think I'm just gonna freeze
out this one it's been three months now
that I've had these Apple earpods and
it's been a love-hate relationship and
since they're still hard to get ahold of
and people are still curious about them
I think a lot of you guys know about my
experience with them would be a good
idea first let's get the obvious out of
the way and that's two looks if they
don't look bad and people don't even
notice them when they're in your ear
matter of fact I make these look good
battery life is fine I've never had an
issue with them and since they charge
relatively quickly it makes everything
much easier when these earphones are
working properly they're all freaking
amazing and I love them but it's when
they don't work is when I get frustrated
with them and they tend to act up
somehow every single day I've used them
the most common issue I have with them
is disconnecting while I'm in the middle
of a phone call when I'm talking on the
phone I'm usually doing something else
which too I'll require your hands-free
what usually happens is I'll be in the
middle of a conversation
my air pod is disconnect from my phone
and keep in mind I haven't touch
anything if then three seconds later
they reconnect to the call again and the
person on the other line is asking can
you hear me can you hear me another
issue I've had with the air pods is that
if you're on a phone call and for some
reason your ear pod falls out then your
phone automatically hangs up the call
which drives me crazy
another issue I've had with the ear pods
is them just not one to connect to my
iPhone even after they've been paired so
this requires me to put the air pods
back into the case and take them out
again multiple times until they pair and
sometimes when they are pair to my phone
they still don't play sound even though
my phone shows it's playing a youtube
video or music and the source says it's
playing through the air pods now this
next problem is a little rarer it's like
finding a shiny pokemon but there have
been instances where I play music but
the left and right earbuds are out of
sync so everything sounds like an echo
or sometimes I just get this weird
beeping sound out of both earbuds
another issue I have with the air pods
is having to tell Siri to control your
music playback you've got to tell Siri
to skip or go back a track adjust volume
and even just resume playing your music
sometimes I know you can go into the
settings to change what double tapping
either earbud does but I still like
telling Siri to make a call or even
sound out the text
regular basis I just really think double
tapping one earbud should activate Siri
and tapping the other earbud in
different orders should control your
music playback or at least make it an
option for power users and I know I can
take my phone out of my pocket and
control my music playback but damn it I
paid $170 for these things and they're
supposed to be the future in the last
sister I have with the air pots is the
overall sound quality
these guys don't sound good they sound
very muddled and they have so much bass
of them for some reason if you get ear
pods it's not for the sound it's for the
convenience now look like I said in the
beginning of the video I love the air
pods when they work they give you the
sense of freedom that no other wireless
earbuds can give you but they act up on
such regular basis that it takes away
from the experience
now I've had these ear pods look that in
the Apple store and I've talked to
customer support on the phone and they
all just say mmm I don't know and
everything is updated it's not a w1 chip
issue because I have absolutely no
problems with my beats X or power beats
3 if you're still holding out for the
air pods
I think you shouldn't hold your breath
and just go for the beats X I'll leave a
link to my review in the description
