many people expected to Apple announced
a whole pot of smart speaker that
focuses on music and sound quality but
also takes on Amazon's Alexa and Google
home they also updated their whole
MacBook and iMac Leno I'm particularly
excited about the new MacBooks with
Kubelik processors they also released a
new 10.5 inch screen iPad pro that for
some reason isn't getting too much
attention and as you'd expect Apple also
previewed their upcoming Mac OS High
Sierra and iOS 11 but something that
completely came out of left field was
during new iMac Pro I don't think anyone
expected that from Apple and when Tim
Cook said this was going to be Apple's
biggest WWDC ever he wasn't joking
please remember to Like and subscribe
Apple has already admitted that their
current Mac Pro isn't the best and they
are working on releasing a brand new Mac
Pro that creative and power users are
going to love and I feel that I Mac Pro
is going to bridge the gap between a
fully stacked out iMac and a base level
next generation Mac Pro because it'll be
unfair to use the current Mac product
comparison and to be honest I think
getting an iMac pro is the definition of
playing with fire the starting price of
a new iMac pro is going to be four
thousand nine hundred ninety nine
dollars and you can't upgrade it and I'm
willing to bet self repair is out of the
question but to be honest I kind of
really want one but I'm not probably
supposed to start shipping in December
but like I said in my home pod first
impression video shameless plug go check
it out after this can we trust Apple to
not delay the release date like they did
with their last few products as right
now it looks like Apple is going to
start shipping their home pod I'm Mac
Pro and presumably their new iPhone in
December I just hope Apple didn't bite
off more than what they can chew okay
hold on here come the numbers so the
started configuration of the iMac Pro
the one that's going to retail for
$4,999 is as follows
obviously it comes in the same body as
your standard 27-inch iMac you get a
retina 5k display there's an 8 core
xenon processor which you can upgrade
all the way up to 18 cores you get the
all new radio and Lego graphics card 32
gigabytes of ECC memory which you can
upgrade to 128 gigabytes or one terabyte
solid-state drive which you can upgrade
to 4
vice for Thunderbolt 3 ports 1 SD card
slot a headphone jack and a 10 Gigabit
Ethernet for it the screen itself is
supposed to go up to 500 nits making the
screen 43% brighter and is going to hit
1 billion colors so you can make sure
whatever you're working on is as color
accurate as possible and if one 27-inch
display isn't enough for you you can
also plug in up to 2 5k displays through
either of the Thunderbolt 3 ports for a
total of 4 million pixels and I'm not
running all those pixels within the
hurdles just a few years ago and I think
that I'm Mac Pro is going to be the
perfect workstations for creatives and
professionals to just work they'll be
able to produce the best products and
results all while not having to worry
about building or maintaining a custom
setup and for me and I Mac Pro would be
perfect I'll be able to produce video in
4k something I can't do right now
because of my current set-up plug in a
5k secondary monitor and I'll have a
whole bunch of apps running in the
background without any issues all from
just one computer straight out of the
box and like mkbhd set a few weeks ago
not like all the things the space grey
finish on the iMac Pro the Magic Mouse
and the Magic Trackpad all look great
and not to mention the matte black full
keyboard what number pad is also just a
perfect finishing touch now I'm kind of
curious what a fully expect out iMac
probably look like I'm guessing maybe
around 12,000 or $15,000 but now I'm
also very curious about what to expect
from the next generation Mac Pro well
the base Mac Pro retail for slightly
more or less than the base I'm a pro
what kind of specs will receive from a
full respect out Mac Pro and how much
will it cost there are so many questions
and we'll only get the answers in
December hopefully but I think this
year's the Worldwide Developer
Conference is among the top 3 Apple has
ever had maybe number 2 because nothing
will be when Steve Jobs announced the
iPhone in 2007 it literally changed
their lives you're probably watching
this on an iPhone right now but comment
below what did you think about this
year's WWDC what was your favorite
announcement and are you going to get an
iMac Pro or if you don't have the money
would you at least want one let me know
