and Apple kicked off that trend when
they removed their headphone jack from
their iPhone and when they released your
earbuds and it's only a matter of time
where each phone manufacturer has their
own wireless earbuds that work best with
their own smartphone case in point the
pixel but although they work just fine
with any Android phone and are still
compatible with an iPhone Google has
stated that their pixel buds work best
with their pixel or pixel two smartphone
so let's see other picture books perform
and let's see how they stack up against
some other popular options out there the
pixel buds currently go for $160 which
is very much in line with everything
else out there on the market the Apple
earpods also cost $160 no beats X retail
for $150 the power beats three retail
for $200 and the J Brand X three retail
for $130 but the latter three can
usually be found on sale on Amazon I got
the beats X for one hundred and ten
dollars to power beats three for $130
and the J Brand X threes for $99 if you
want to pick either of these headphones
up I'll have links to the description
below with the best prices and if you
click on the links it really helps out
the channel unboxing the pixel bud is
identical to unboxing the air pods you
get your carrying case with a built-in
630 million battery the earbuds and the
USB type-c to a USB type a cable right
off the bed everybody's going to compare
the pixel boats carrying case to the air
pods carrying case and yes it is larger
it is thicker and I'm genuinely worried
that the top lid will eventually wear
out or just get ripped off
but the pics with buds carrying case is
still much more manageable than the
carrying case included with the beats X
power beats 3 or the tapered X 3 and
Google's design language is very
prominent on their pixel buds especially
with the fabric texture on the case yes
it does look good and feels great on the
hand but it does cause a minor
inconvenience I'm a guy and I wear jeans
on a regular basis but the fabric
texture on the case causes a good amount
of friction when taking it out or
putting it into your pocket it's not
like the air pods case which is
completely made out of plastic and
easily glides in and out of your pocket
I know this is a first-world problem but
it's something to come my eye googles
design language is also very prominent
on the earbuds themselves the first
group is
they're not completely wireless earbuds
like the air pods they still have a wire
connecting them like the power beats
three beats X or the jaybird x3 but
unlike the latter three which you saw
touch Comfort flat cables the pixel buds
have a braided cable which definitely
give it a leg up concerning quality and
design but the design of the buzz
themselves are also very similar to the
air pots first off they're meant to rest
on your ear not inside your ear like the
beats X power beats three or Jaybirds
also wrapped in silicone which help them
stay in place a little better the wire
on the pixel buds also acts like a
makeshift your fin like on the beach X
or j-bird x3 but unlike the beats X or
Jay bird which you essentially have to
deconstruct to swap out the ear fins but
makeshift ear fins on the pixel buds are
much easier to adjust on the fly and the
makeshift
ear fins on the pixel blood work just as
well as the silicon fins included on the
beats X and jaybird x3 but if you need
something that will absolutely stay in
place no matter white then you're still
better off with the ear hook design of
the par B's 3 now when it comes to
actually putting them on that's another
story with the air pods when you put
them in
you're good to go on the first try and
they stay in place very well but with
the pixel buds you do have to work and
find that sweet spot and you might have
to play around with the ear fins and yet
I do find myself readjusting the pixel
buds more often than I do with any of
the other earphones and the main reason
for this is the cable it's too short if
you move your head a lot the cable will
end up pulling on your ear buds and
another thing over to mention is that
the pixel buds don't create a good seal
so they let in a lot of ambient sound
compared to the air pots which some
people might like and some other people
won't on the back of the case you've got
your USB type-c charging point in
general when you open the case with the
ear buds inside and see a solid green
light then the pixel buds are fully
charged if the green light is pulsating
in the pixel bunch or charging and if
the pulsating light is amber then the
battery life on the pixel buds is
critically low but if the ear buds are
outside of the case then you'll notice
the light is that white 3 white light
means the battery of the case itself is
between 75 and 100% two lights means the
battery is between 50 and 75 percent one
light means the battery is between 25 to
50
percent and an amber light means go put
the case on the charger right now
and google claims the pixel birds are
good for about five hours of playback
time when fully charged and the carrying
case should be able to charge the pixel
buds about four to five times so battery
life on the pixel buds is pretty much
identical to the air pots but with one
major exception the pixel buds don't
have quick charging and for wireless
earbuds that are meant to be used to all
day and ready to go at a moment's notice
that's a problem the air pods beats X
and power beats three all have quick
charging if you put the air pods in
their case for 15 minutes it gets you
three hours of battery if you charge the
beats X for five minutes and get you two
hours of battery and if you charge the
power beats three for five minutes and
they get you one hour battery and since
quick charging is so important to me I
decided to do a few tests I place the
pixel buds in their case for 15 minutes
a few times and recorded their battery
percentage placing the pixel buds in at
5% battery for 15 minutes got it up to
33 percent placing them in and 19% for
15 minutes got them up to 25% placing
them in at 13% got them up to 19% and
placing them in at 5% again for 15
minutes got the battery up to 25% and
it's also worth noting that 25 percent
battery on the pixel but will really
only last you about 30 minutes of
continuous playback time and charging
the pixel buds from 5% to full took
almost two and a half hours I can look
past the pixel buzz flimsy and clunky
case but not having quick charging is a
major deal-breaker for me but when it
comes to sound quality dads where the
pics of blood shine for the most part
the ear pods power beats 3 and beats X
all perform the same they all have a lot
of bass and the mids and vocals are
little recessed but the beats X don't
have as much punching through bass like
the ear pods or power beats and the
highs and the air pods aren't as sharp
as the power beats and the J Brand X 3
which are universally loved for their
sound quality perform very well and you
can easily adjust the EQ through their
app but the pixel buds have a flat sound
signature and they also have a much
wider soundstage and that's what these
other earphones are lacking personally I
think the picks were but are the best
sounding earphones here now let's talk
about the capacitive touch pad on the
right ear but whether you're an Apple or
Android if you tap ones at your player
positive music and if you swipe it front
or back
you'll adjust volume one step at a time
and if you press and hold you'll
activate your voices obviously Google
assistant on Android and Siri on iPhone
and what Google is trying to do is give
you quick access to voices so you can
get more done quicker with your voice
and we got a taste of this with the boss
QC 35 series - a few months ago turn
this to be your lights on change the
studio lights to green change the story
lights to red
turn off the studio lights and although
having quick access to Google assistant
is great if you're a power user of
Google assistant the trackpad on the
pixel buds is not so great I just find
that it's too sensitive and you get a
lot of false positives most of the times
and I take the pixel buds out of the
case and put them into my ears my phone
starts playing music in the background
or Google assistant gets activated if
you go to adjust the ear buds a bit
chances are they'll put in some type of
command they'll either positive music or
change the volume but the most important
thing to take note of is since the
trackpad on the pixel buds is capacitive
they don't work if you have gloves on
something I learned while I was out
shoveling after the bomb cyclone whereas
the air pods which use an accelerometer
so double tapping on either earbud will
activate Siri or a guard less of what
you're wearing and if you're a power
user you can map double tapping on one
earbud to activate Siri and double
tapping the other to do another command
what's the world like for New York City
today regardless neither the air punch
or pig's foot buds have the perfect
solution to controlling your music
playback without relying on your voice
assistant to some extent an inline
controller like I'm the power beast
three beats X Reggie but actually is
still far superior to controlling your
music playback without having to rely on
your phone so what's the verdict on the
pixel buttons the touch controls on the
pixel buds are very accurate and useful
but you have to be mindful of them
having quick access to Google assistant
is great if you use it a lot like I have
been lately but will really sense the
pixel buts apart is their sound quality
I think they sound way for a wireless
but not having quick charging and the
large flimsy case is a major
deal-breaker for me I feel that these
type of wireless earbuds should have
quick charging so they could keep up
with you day in and day out whether
Google decides to get rid of the cable
and make their pixel budgets truly
wireless earbuds their top priority
right now has to be to shrink the
charging case change the material to
plastic
preferably with a matte finish and
introduce quick charging to the pixel
buds and I know we didn't touch on the
google translate feature cuz it only
works on pixel phones and quite honestly
there's no point to it hey if you
