have been my go-to anc headphones these
headphones managed to block out the most
amount of noise with little to no cabin
pressure the m2 is have the best
technology built in them but they do
fall short when it comes to comfort and
build quality but now we have the Sony
WH 1000x m3 and I'm gonna be honest I
didn't expect these headphones so soon
but man am I glad they're here here's
what I like about the sony 1000 x m3
here's what I hate about the sony 1000 X
and 3 and do you need to upgrade if you
already have the Sony 1000 X and - the
Sony 1000 X and threes or new for 2018
and they're already gunning for the
title of the best ANC headphones of 2019
the Sony 1000 X and twos or an hour
year-old since they came out in
September of 2017 and I feel they were
the best ANC headphones of 2018 the
newer 1000 X 10 threes are currently
retailing for $350 the same as the
enthused when they first came out and
the price of the m2 s has been reduced
if you want to pick either of these
headphones up I'll have links for
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel I
highly suggest you check them out
because Sony headphones routinely go on
sale so you might get lucky and also
check out the demurrer shelf down below
first let's talk about the accessories
that come included with the 1000 XM
threes cuz they've also changed the hard
shell carrying case of the m3s is
slightly bigger than the m2 s and
instead of a faux leather front it's now
fabric I like both cases but I do like
the m3 is more because there's a little
storage compartment on the inside for
your cables one of the most obvious
upgrades to the m3 is the use of a USB C
port instead of a micro USB port like on
the m2 s you get a USB C to USB a cable
for charging but I hate the fact that is
so short compared to the m2 is charging
cable but it's not like you're going to
be using it all that much the entries
also come included with
3.5 millimeter audio cable and
unfortunately it's much cheaper compared
to the cable that comes included with
the m2 s
it's much thinner and it's much shorter
I know we're moving towards a wireless
future and the majority of smartphones
don't have audio jacks anymore but as a
content creator I do use a wired
connection to edit my videos on a
regular basis and unfortunately I'm more
the Embry's included audio cable is
going to wear out much faster and says
it's not as long I don't have as much
slack compared to the M twos this is one
of the minor things that peeves me about
the M threes but you can always just get
another cable now with all of that out
of the way let's talk about the
headphones themselves in a lot of ways
the entries are very similar to the M
twos they have the same basic shape they
can either be lay down flat or you can
pull them up they both have a touchpad
on the right ear cup and they even use
similar building materials but the
entries have some very significant
differences on the outside from the m2s
overall the build quality of the m3s has
been improved there's much less creaking
and squeaking tolerances almost tied on
the m3s and the majority of the ear cups
are now covered in soft touch material
which actually feels very nice every
time you reach to put these headphones
on the headband on the entries also has
significantly more padding than the
headband on the M twos which is
something I didn't even realize I needed
till now the only two physical buttons
on the m3s have also been upgraded from
the M twos they're much easier to find
they're easier to tell apart and they
have much better tactile feedback but
perhaps the most important upgrades to
the m3s or the ear cups the ear cups on
the m3s are much more spacious than the
ear cups on the M twos and since there's
less padding in contact with your skin
the ear cups on the m3 is overheat much
less than the ear cups on the M twos and
even though the ear cups on the m3 Zoar
more spacious than the ear cups on the N
twos the entries still manage to be a
little more low profile than the M tubes
even though both of these headphones are
big head approved the sony 1000 XM
threes are significantly more
comfortable to wear than the 1000 XM
two's all of the physical upgrades on
the m3s really add up they feel better
on the hand there's more
the headband ear cups are no longer
cramped and since the m3s or 20 grams
lighter they're a little less noticeable
when it comes to extended wear now when
it comes to tech specs both the N twos
and M threes are rocking 30 hour battery
lights and for me the m2 usually lasts
me about two weeks in between charges
and that's with me using them with anc
turned on whenever I'm commuting with
them or if I'm using them with a wired
connection to edit a video but with
ambient mode turned on so it's like
editing with open-back headphones but
the big difference between the m2 and m3
is is that the m3 is have far better
fast charging if you plug these
headphones in for 10 minutes from a dead
battery the m3 is all gonna get you 5
hours of playback time which is a big
step up from the M twos because these
headphones would only get you one hour
playback time the entries have also been
upgraded from Bluetooth 4.1 to Bluetooth
4 to both of these headphones have
stable connections that don't cut out
but both of these headphones do have a
little bit aaliyan C so they aren't the
best for watching YouTube videos but it
is doable but one major thing I hate
about the m3 is is that you can still
only connect to one device at a time
just like the M choose which means you
still can't hot swap I know a lot of
people including myself we're looking
forward to connecting to multiple
devices at a time but you can't it could
have something to do with Sony's dsee
and all that technologies but that's
just a guess but now let's talk about
the 1000x m3 is active noise
cancellation because believe it or not
it's actually been improved from the
1000x m2 both of these headphones have
an atmospheric pressure sensor which
first came out on the M twos last year
but new to the m3 ziz Sony's dedicated
HD noise canceling processor which they
called the Q and one and this processor
does two things it analyzes the ambient
sounds so in theory it can block out
more higher frequency sounds like
chatter it also has a built-in amplifier
so there's less distortion in your music
and I have to say the 1000x m3 does in
fact manage to block out more noise than
the 1000x and twos all while having very
little cabin pressure and no hissing
the background it's not a huge
difference but you do notice the
difference across the board if you use
these headphones back to back now if you
notice during the agency test the
entries were able to block out a little
more noise than the M twos which
honestly is rather impressive but what
are my favorite things about the agency
on the m2 s and M threes is that they
actually pick up very little wind noise
and this is a big deal cuz with a lot of
other agency headphones if you use them
in a windy environment you start hearing
some playing at the background of the
music the ANSI microphones on these
headphones are located in the same spot
but since no recess in the body then
they greatly reduce the chances of
annoying wind noise getting interior
music and speaking of music I'm actually
very happy to report that sound quality
has also been improved on the 1000x and
threes from the 1000x M twos most
notably the bass the bass on the 1000x
m3 is able to get much deeper than the
bass on the 1000 x m2 and it takes a lot
more for it to bottom out but when it
comes to soundstage clarity and
instrument separation those
characteristics are still very similar
to the 1000 x m2 and that's not a bad
thing both the m2 zm3 sound good but the
bass on the m3 is deeper and cleaner but
just like the M twos the 1000 x m3 also
connect to Sony's headphones app and
from this app you can either go in and
select from a few pre-made EQ settings
or you can make your own so you can make
the 1000 x m3 sound however you like
depending on the type of music you
listen to but just keep in mind the 1000
X M 3 and M 2 are mostly suited for easy
listening even though you can prank
bass up all the way to 10 if your bass
said you're still better off picking up
the XP 950 anyone or the school candy
crusher 360s Sony's app also allows you
to mess around with surround settings
and you can also control the sound
positioning of these headphones
personally I don't even touch these
settings because all they do is destroy
your music but Sony's app also allows
you to calibrate both the M twos and M
threes she can get better noise
cancellation out of them and from
personal experience I found that this
calibration process does in fact work
and finally so nice headphones app also
allows you to pick how much ambient
sound you would like to live in when
you're wearing these headphones and this
is a great feature to have if you're
walking around the city but the cool
thing about the ambient sound setting on
these headphones is that it's still
selective of what sound it lets in it
limits the amount of noise pollution in
Letson and instead focuses and voices
and if a random sound like a siren comes
along the headphones will still
completely block them out so you don't
have to worry about jump scares or just
going deaf like I mentioned earlier both
of these headphones have touch pads on
the right ear cup you double tap to play
your positive music you swipe up or down
to adjust your volume and you swipe
front or back to skip or go back a track
and the accuracy on both of these
headphones is the same which is good the
touch controls on both of these
headphones are very easy to use once you
get used to them and very rarely are
they are unrecognized inputs but perhaps
my favorite thing about the touch pad on
both of these headphones is quick
attention if you fully cover the touch
pad then the headphones rolled over the
volume of your music and they'll pump in
all of the ambient sound so you have to
talk to someone you can do so without
having to take your headphones off
but even though I really do like the
upgrades found on the Sony 1000 xm3 I
think Sony really dropped the ball by
not adding a dedicated Google assistant
button on your new headphones both of
these headphones have Google assistant
integration and the rest of Sony's
headphone lineup will soon follow
but in order to use Google assistance
you have to sacrifice your NC ambient
sound body so you're not going to be
able to manually cycle through your
noise cancellation settings like this
noise canceling ambient sound
ambient sound control ah
not having this functionality can get
pretty annoying because I switched from
ANC to ambient sound mode on all regular
basis now I'm fully aware of that if you
press and hold on the touch pad you can
summon your voices system but pressing
and holding and then talking isn't as
efficient as having a dedicated Google
assistant Boyan where you just press and
talk like this chick-fil-a is normally
open at this time on Mondays and closes
at 10:00 p.m. but these hours may be
affected by Labor Day so what I'm
getting at is I do like that both of
these headphones have Google assistant
integration but I wish the m3s had an
extra physical button so we don't have
to sacrifice the NC ambient sound button
I feel that Sony should have had the
foresight to add the sexual button on
the entries like Bose did on their QC 35
series too and if you don't want to use
Google assistant maybe you can use the
extra button to toggle between
pre-selected EQ settings oh no I'm just
spitballing here but but Sony come on
and finally the microphone on the Sonia
1000 xm3 has been improved from the M
twos I've actually been able to take
phone calls with these headphones
without having people complain about the
audio cuz for comparison here's the
microphone on the Sonia 1000 XM -
there's a lot more static and a lot more
echoing going on so overall I personally
feel the new Sony WH 1000 XM 3 aren't
just an incremental upgrade from the
1,000 XM to the 1000 XM threes are all
whole new beast that has been redesigned
from the inside out even though the
design is familiar the 1000 XM 3 have
better build quality and are much more
comfortable to wear than the 1000 XM -
because if the redesigned ear cuts and
padding they look better on your head
cuz they're more low-profile and the
fact that they manage to block out
more noise than the 1000x m2 is truly
impressive and I'm personally really
enjoying the fact that the base on the
entries is deeper and cleaner than the
m2 but still the sony 1000 x m3 aren't
perfect the lack of multi-device
connections is a bummer for power users
like myself and i feel a dedicated
google system plan on the m3s is sorely
lacking
but nonetheless the sony 1000x m3 is are
still a very solid pair of anc
headphones that have been improved from
its predecessor where it matters most
the old quality and fit if you already
have the original sony and your 1000x
then it's definitely time for an upgrade
and I feel that if you already have the
sony 1000x m2 you don't really need to
upgrade but you'll be really happy if
you did I don't think I could be able to
go back to the m2 is from the m3s if you
made it this far I guess you enjoyed the
video so hit that like button and get
