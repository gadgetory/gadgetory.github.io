welcome to our third live unboxing now
if you're new here this is still a new
series that I'm still testing out but
hopefully this live stream won't be a
complete disaster now if you're new here
the premise behind this series is I
personally find a boxing videos pretty
boring I get bored just watching
somebody unbox a product and then just
read off of this spec sheet but I think
this has the potential to blow more fun
if we do it live since we're doing a lot
of you guys can interact with me through
the chat ask me questions about the
products or about other products and
since we're doing it live you guys are
going to get my real first impressions
and Robb reactions cuz there have been
times where I've been completely blown
away or completely disappointed by a new
product the first time I unboxed it case
in point the Sony 1000 XM threes I love
these headphones and I was completely
ecstatic the first time I tried them on
because they were infinitely times more
comfortable than the previous 1000x and
choose which used to be my daily drivers
until these came along or when I first
Sun box to sudden eyes were 4.50 B T &amp;amp; C
headphones I was blown away at how good
their build quality was 480 dollar
headphones so with all that out of the
way today's victims are the iPhone 10's
max now you guys know what this thing is
you're your sub box has it probably been
inundated by these videos but more
importantly we're also going to be
unboxing these gold candy venues now
these are school candies first a.m.c
headphones now there is a lot of hype
behind the new sony 1000 XM threes and
it's with good reasons they're not
perfect but they're pretty damn good if
you don't watch any videos featuring
these headphones I'm gonna have links up
here somewhere I'll just I'll just add
it in post but I know that dropping 350
dollars on a pair of Eanes the
headphones just isn't an option for some
people so maybe this goal candy venues
could be a good option for people on a
tighter budget now I just wanna make
something perfectly clear this is not a
full review so don't get upset if I say
something dumb or
something wrong about either of these
products expect a full review on the
school candy venues in about a week or a
week and a half I want to get to know
these headphones first before I make a
video so I can tell you what I like
about them
but more importantly what I hate about
them so let's actually get you unboxing
some of these things we're gonna start
off with the iPhone 10's max because you
know the unboxing this is I'm pretty
pretty straightforward just so you guys
know I picked up the gold iPhone 10's
Max and I'm still a little iffy about
the color like obviously I've seen the
iPhone 2 gold iPhone on video and on the
computer but I still haven't been like
completely sold on the gold on this new
iPhone because you know the iPhone eight
gold it looks very looks very feminine
to me so I don't know we're about to
find out so there's gonna be the first
time I actually see the gold iPhone in
person so we're about to find out if I
made the right decision or a horrible
horrible mistake and if I were sponsored
by a brand then this is the time where I
would say hey listen if I don't like the
color then I'll just cover it in a D
brand skin so the brand the red if
you're listening I reach out to me
sponsor me cuz chick-fil-a has it
reached out yet but withal with all that
out of the way let's get a close-up on
the iPhone here we go okay so okay this
is normal all right oh and here it is
there it is oh oh okay okay I like it
okay I like it I like the broadband this
is very very gold I'm a little iffy on
the backplate oh but I do like it
but I do like it hold on we need a
moment of silence hold on moment of
silence okay we're about to D we're
gonna unwrap the iPhone here we go hold
on we're gonna get close to the mic
right ready oh okay okay
okay I like it I like it it's cool oh
shoot oh okay all right
oh wow this is it's this is this is a
heavy heavy boy I mean I've been using
an iPhone 6s for since I first got it
when I first released and I got the
iPhone 6s reluctantly because before
that I had the HTC One m8 and when it
came to upgrading I wasn't gonna get the
galaxy the Samsung Galaxy s6 cuz you
know I had a galaxy before the HTC One I
mean and I just hated TouchWiz so I
wasn't about to get it so this is
actually the first time I get two
iPhones back-to-back cuz usually I
switched from iPhone Android iPhone
Android oh man but oh this is this is
nice this is nice and this this iPhone
is also going to live its life naked
like my iPhone 6s plus and all my other
phones I really don't like using cases
on my phones cuz I don't know you you
don't feel like you have the future in
your hand when you put like a case or a
rap on it that's just me that's just me
okay so inside the box we still have
this five watt power adapter um I kind
of hate that you still got to pay money
to get fast charging you know it's like
it's like an $80 upgrade you know Apple
I mean we need to get some fast charging
standard with these um thousand plus
dollar iPhones
well that's whatever okay so iPhone out
of the way
now we're gonna unbox the school can be
venues like this now the school county
venues there are two color options there
was the whites with like maroon accents
and this black option and I'm kind of
starting to regret getting the black
Skullcandy venues I kind of I kind of
wish I went with the white ones because
they kind of grew up grew on me hold on
so I'm gonna open this you ready okay
oh oh that's a really big case oh okay
oh this case is huge but actually it's
huge but sturdy very sturdy and not fat
at all actually
give me a favor
get get you get that case behind you
it's that's four six o'clock
the other one that one yeah there you go
okay
woof this thing is this thing is big
look at that but it has the same you
know like design going for like the new
1,000 xm3 case what is this okay so
we're gonna actually go ahead and take
it out ready oh all right all right Wow
I'm just well I'm really impressed by
just the accessories in this case is a
step up from the 1000x in threes case
whoo okay but one thing I can already
tell you these headphones
yeah the venue's don't fold up okay
okay the venue's themselves are a lot
lighter okay that feels a little that
feels a little flimsy but it does feel
it does feel a little better than the
watch 700 ends these feel heavier than
the watch the 700 and the watch a 700
ions or also these are $200 headphones
these are sony's cheapest E&amp;amp;C headphones
if you guys watched my here on 2 vs 1000
XM 3 video you guys will know that I
think not the watch on 700 and in the
here on and the watch o 7 underline and
the 1000 X and threes are part of Sony's
new design that not design but
generation of headphones
ok so we got we got about a mostly
plastic body a little bit of padding on
the only headband your cups or looking
built quality on these has me a little I
don't hate it I don't love it we're
gonna have to see how these headphones
perform we got a little bit of plastic
buttons here tactile feedback is a
little don't know if you are just
powered them on do we have any juice in
here ok wait actually we're gonna try
these headphones on real quick ok with
your big head of proof
I see if these are big head approved
let's see all right let's see let's see
let's see ok cuz like what I when I had
the school candy crushers like two years
ago those were not big head approved
those were those were tight
and just so you guys know the new school
candy crushers 360s those are also on
the way but um but let's see how the the
venue's are doing here we go here
hey okay
they they're a little firm but not but
not like the Skullcandy crushers and not
like the Bowers and Wilkins px your cups
a little cramped they're not they're not
as spacious that like like let's say the
bose qc25
or the 1000x and threes or the watch 700
n but there is a kind of they're kind of
like the 1000 x m2 so so I can already
tell you if you got out if you have a
big head or big ears that stick out a
lot these might not be for you shake
your head shake my head these are these
could be good for running because I know
some people like to workout with
headphones personally I'm a powerbeats
guy because two reasons one I sweat a
lot into I just don't like having
headphones on the way especially well
like I'm on the bench press or when I'm
one of the squat rack because I get it
just gets in the way but I think these
would be good for running okay there's a
good amount of creaking and squeaking
here kind of yeah build quality on these
you have build quality on these I don't
know so gotta get to know these
headphones but I'm but I but I think
build qualities on these is a step alone
the watch has 700 ends or or on the same
level
okay let me just turn on the CC cuz I'm
already gonna come already glisteny
alright so let's see if we can release
power on yeah okay we're gonna go ahead
we're at 12 minutes we're gonna break in
the time we're gonna pair these up real
quick see if we can get a quick AMC test
going how did you do that people are
asking you over you the party box
oh yeah probably one thing that I did
learn about it recently was that the
party box isn't going to have JBL
Connect plus so it's not going to be
able to connect you're like the boom box
or the charge for
or what else to flip for anything else
so the party box is going to be like its
own thing and I think JBL did that on
purpose so it doesn't compete against
the boombox but they still have that big
light up speaker to sell hold on can we
get this thing totally pair this up
well the popular GBL which is do you
recommend extreme one or extreme to
extreme tuned because of JBL connect
plus if you plan on getting newer
speaker if you get played on getting
more JBL speakers in the future then
yeah definitely the extreme - because
with the extreme one you can't get
upgraded to JBL Connect plus like the
JBL charge 3 then because the extremes
choose whatever hardware or antennas it
has or whatever Bluetooth protocol
that's using it just can't get up
upgraded to JBL connect plus so we need
to what is let me do this
I got a pair this up out of all these
help of you have one is no wonderful
table yeah which one do you think is the
best what that is I like some threes
until those put something out or
Sennheiser I'm team 1000x and threes
like I said they're not perfect they
have their prop have a few problems but
I love those headphones because they
block out the most saying they block out
the most noise with little-to-no cabin
pressure battery life is is really
really long on these especially with
that new fan sourcing these also have
fast charging on the storm the same
level as a 1000 xm3 I think 10 minutes
it gets you five hours hold on it's here
somewhere I'm over here trying to do
like three to three things three things
at the same time what do you guys listen
okay so these have a 24 hour battery
life and 10 minutes gets you five five
hours
do you know those headphones have grease
adjustment I don't know I don't know um
the school okay it's connected okay
Harlan we're gonna do a quick quick
little AMC test I think these have like
touch controls or something
oh man I'm kind of iffy on the build
quality on these yeah yeah build quality
on these is nowhere on the level of the
Sennheiser they sound like they're gonna
snap well build quality on these has me
very at the end all right so what are we
doing we were is anc turned on I don't
think so because I don't feel anything
and I hear everything
hiring pairing mode how long well then
let me get this stopwatch open again all
right 15 minute mark uh volume up volume
down wait so if this thing has physical
buttons does they have does it have
touch controls or not I thought I had
touch controls hello
okay okay there's the ANC
yeah okay this has an ambient sound mode
to it like the like the 1000x and fries
and JBL's Everest elite 750 mcs or
whatever it is I don't like JBL has
headphones I love their speakers their
headphones need to go okay yeah there
there's the AMC there is a bit of cabin
pressure
alright so we're gonna do a quick little
emc test my own headphone users
we're about to go into a road noise
simulation so we're gonna that's going
to start off in three two one don't say
I didn't warn you here we go
yeah
okay okay so here's a problem I have no
idea what I'm present
it's outside
okay so what's it looks like there
and handsome but there's no like just
off which could be problematic if you
want to see that because if you use if
you use those features off how we're
gonna kind of
all right so yeah that ANC's has them
and do anything with the road noise but
hold on it's doing an okay job of
blocking out the AC but when I first
tried the 1000 x m3 is for the first
time I didn't hear that ANC at all here
we can still hear a little bit mmm high
school can be venues it's making a bad
first impression and that's why we're
doing this series yeah man it plus like
I said I can't I have no idea what I'm
pressing yeah I think if I remember
correctly this is the power button over
here these are the control buttons but
there's no like there's no like texture
to them so you don't know if you're
pressing if you're if you have the plus
or the minus button oh man I man I had
high hopes for these no no you failed
spoke into you
you failed me I think oh man I think
Skullcandy spent too much money on the
accessories and then I'll focus on the
headphones on the add-on be have phones
all right let's see so we got a 1 we've
got a 3.5 millimeter audio cable we've
got a micro USB to USB a cable should
have been USB see oh man I think the
best I think the best thing here the
case what's the case
oh man you can use this case as a weapon
man this thing oh man I'm probably gonna
have to start using this case for my
1000x m3 but he's in here real quick Oh
how's the oh no it's not gonna fit nope
nope these are these are gonna fit I
wonder if the what jaws will hold on
one of these don't pity their powers
just a weapon so far it's just a weapon
oh you know ah Skullcandy Oh Skullcandy
let's just let's hope let's hope the the
Skullcandy questions 360s are better
because those headphones you're selling
for $300 which is what double the price
of what those original scope well like
last year of skull candy crushers were
going for oh man but these we're gonna
have to see how sound how they sound by
first impressions on these yeah look at
the ear cups hey you see you're a little
you're gonna this is boses those has the
biggest ear cups in the game right now
just to comparison 1000x and threes okay
you know what these your cups are kind
of similar to that here on choose hold
on and if you watch my 1000 X and 3
verses here on to video like I said do
not pick these headphones up right now
because they're probably gonna be a new
version in a few months do not pick up
the here on twos come in and I don't
know it's cold candy just made a very
iffy first impression with these let's
turn these off let's show off the iPhone
again want to show up the iPhone game in
here
okay here's the thing it has like voice
notifications like it tells you but you
can barely hear it I don't know if I
have to go in and adjust the volume but
you can barely hear it set power off
with like a British accent you can
barely even hear it hold on is this is
this it yeah that's it okay alright
goodnight sweet prince
um hold on just just hear you feel that
just listen to it listen to this okay so
- I haven't even turned this thing on
okay one thing ah man what thing is that
everybody has been talking about this
lack of symmetry I just want to know why
I don't care I kind of do care but I
want to know why that is so unhappy like
okay so many times gonna look down there
oh okay so here we go gonna power this
song oh man then that's not I wasn't a
fan of the knots before I'm still not a
fan with a notch now but I'm not just
here to stay
we're gonna power that on okay so
it's not bad at all this is very nice
but it is but it does feel it feels
heavier and thicker do the iPhone 6s
okay and that's like telling me till I
go through the setup process you know
what Oh seventy into place oh okay you
know what I don't think everybody wants
to watch me you set up or I set up a
thing so are there any questions before
we cut the livestream now we wait duty
be extreme to is we're surprised yeah
because you can use it indoors and you
can take it outdoors you can me like you
can you can use it at home and it's
super easy to take on the go with you
like I said in in a few other videos the
boom box the boom box is great but it is
a pain in the neck to like take with you
somewhere cause it's just so big and
it's so heavy and I feel the boom box
needs a carrying strap more than the
extreme two so I think that if you wanna
like travel with the extreme 200 regular
basis but also use it at home get the
extreme two if you're just want to
speaker for home and it's just gonna
stay at home and you're gonna like once
in a while take it on the go with you
then then get the boom box
but I'm the extreme - even though it is
even though I did expect a little bit
more from it it's still a good speaker
it's it's I've done a few like sound
comparison I compared the extreme to -
the LG pk7
I don't know where all the hype is
coming from for that speaker but that
speakers sucks like just flat-out sucks
and it's super quiet
so yeah just go go look for those videos
but the extreme - sounds way better than
the pk7
sounds better than the sony xba-40 one
I'm gonna be getting that new Marshall
Kilburn speaker or whatever it is it's
it's it's Marshalls and you 300 speaker
that come that you know it's kinda and
of what the extreme two is so I'm gonna
make a video on that and then I'm gonna
compare it to the extreme two as well
but um yeah the extreme chill what the
money all right so the iPhone X mic
works money no what did you call it and
it says the iPhone X yeah okay uh held
on I don't get why people call it the
iPhone access the iPhone 10 it's like
you don't say I'm you know I wasn't
really excited about Star Wars Episode
III X but I really have high hopes for
star wars episode IX you say it's Star
Wars Episode eight Star Wars Episode
nine is all right so what about it says
what does a $1100 going to do what are
600 to 700 perform can honestly it's
just pretty you know I I'm I don't
really like I'm not really like
engrained into the phone thing because
like I'm still not at that level I'm not
at that level where I can get a new
phone like every every three or six
months and just review all of these
phones like I said I had the iPhone 6s
for like three years almost four years I
think so honestly I got it cuz I like
Apple you know the iPhone 6s all the way
up until iOS 11 I loved him and then
when iOS 11 came around it Apple just
ruined it and I was actually planning on
getting the pixel 3 Excel but then the
pixel 3xl came out with follow me with
all those leaks and that indent not so I
was like basically like ah I'm just
gonna get the iPhone 10's max cus with
iowa's 12 even like when my iPhone 6s
got uh I was 12 I was he actually even
considering not getting the iPhone 10 s
max cuz I was 12 is doing wonders for my
success but you know sake because if
Apple is going to like start doing all
these software out these I'm actually
keep it running smoothly from now on
then
might as well as a stay in the Apple
ecosystem and that also for me it's kind
of like a workflow thing because like I
have so many Apple devices it's easy for
me to like screen recordings and like
move files around from one computer to
another and and video and whatnot
whenever I'm making these videos so I
got the 10s max cuz again more of a like
a workflow thing but like I said I I
can't really speak on phones cuz I'm not
at that level yet I'm doing headphones
right now and so you know maybe I
should've gotten a $600 phone maybe but
for me right now it's more like a it's
nice and a workflow thing so so I know
that doesn't really answer any questions
but yeah any good wired headphones under
$150 that's a video that I'm that I'm
still planning on making I know audio
technica is coming out with a pair
they're coming out with two pairs of
headphones they're coming out with a two
hundred dollar pair and a hundred other
pair and a few in a few weeks they have
the same body I think the difference is
one has agency while the other one
doesn't so maybe that could be a good
option as for a good pair of wired
headphones I don't know I don't have any
any of that coming off the top of my
head right now
I mean if you're looking for $150 and
see headphones just look on Amazon
because a watch at 700 ends dos even
though they retail for 200 they
constantly go on sale for like 140 150
on Black Friday that we're going for
like 98 but same thing with the
Sennheiser 4.50 BT NC so just just
refresh Amazon and just wait all right
so is that it
I think we're done yeah which is load
your party books or boombox I don't know
I don't have the party box yet all right
so are we good we're done I'm see any
more questions all right how many people
are here today do you do you have any
experience with the Sony a a p1 hundred
I so I think we're gonna call the wrap
it up right there thank you guys so much
for joining me on the livestream today
again keep an eye out for ya okay so
just keep an eye out for the Skullcandy
venue review now it's probably after
we're gonna have to see how it performs
cuz build quality on this has been very
iffy so keep working on your head yeah
they're gonna break on my head
especially so just keep an eye out for
this in about a week week and a half and
you know I'm probably gonna make make my
phone my first phone review maybe next
month cuz you know everybody's making an
iPhone tennis max video right now so
there's really no point in washing it
now so our problem this is probably
gonna come out in like a month or so
maybe three weeks but it could be a
little bit more interesting because
there's gonna be from a perspective of
somebody from an iPhone success jumping
all the way to an iPhone 10s max because
like a lot of people you know they
haven't upgraded from their iPhone
success or iPhone 7s cuz you know from
from the seven on the only thing worth
upgrading to was the iPhone 10 and
that's if you know you were cool with
having the smaller phone because the
reason I got I
at the iPhone 10 was because you know
I've gotten so used to using the iPhone
6s plus I didn't want to go to a smaller
phone so now that the tightness max is
here then I said you know what F it's
gonna upgrade but other than that guys
again thank you so much
one final question what's up all right
what would you recommend the Sony 1000 X
or the 1000 X - are you are you saying
1000 X + 3 or 1/5 window they're like
like the first generation you just get
the 1000 X them - because I'm the 1000 X
and 2 has even though they have the same
body 1000 x + 2 has way better specs as
in battery life and I think sound was
the same I I sold the 1000 X shortly
after I got the 1000 X + 2 but
definitely the ANC was weight is way
better on the 1000 xm2 than the og 1000
X and plus the og 1000 X you know you do
run the risk of suffering from the
headband cracking issue all right so
we're good we're done sup yeah alright

right next to my hands but either way
