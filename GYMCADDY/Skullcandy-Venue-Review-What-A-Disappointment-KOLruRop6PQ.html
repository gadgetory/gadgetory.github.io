currently the best ANC headphones on the
market right now but I know some people
just can't afford to drop 350 dollars on
a pair of headphones
so when Skullcandy first announced their
first day in C headphones
let's call candy venue I'm just actually
pretty excited because up 200 other ANC
headphones are actually pretty good now
but even though the Skullcandy venues do
have a few good things going for them
overall I'm still kind of disappointing
them I found that sub $200 ANC
headphones can be very hit or miss and
in this case the Skullcandy venue or a
miss they retail for $180 so the venue's
would definitely appeal to someone on
the tighter budget but with other better
performing options out there in the same
price range or even below it namely the
Sony watches 700 I nor the Sennheiser
4.50 BT NC it's hard to recommend the
Skullcandy venue so if you want to pick
up a good pair of sub 200 or ANC
headphones I'll have the Sony's and
Sennheiser's link down below and if you
use the links really helps out the
channel and I highly suggest you check
them out because both of those
headphones routinely go on sale and if
you want to learn more about either of
those headphones then watch their full
reviews first let's talk about the
accessories because Skullcandy has
always outdone themselves in that
department the venue's come included
with a very nice carrying case is going
to protect whatever is inside like no
one's business and it's easily a much
nicer case than what comes included with
$350 ANC headphones like this only 1000
X and 3 both QC 35 and Beats Studio 3
the 3.5 millimeter audio cable and micro
USB cable are also pretty nice 480
dollar headphones but given that is late
2018
I would have preferred if these
headphones came included with the USB C
port instead now let's talk about these
headphones design fit in build quality
right off the bat I can tell you these
headphones or not big head approved in
order for me to get a somewhat
comfortable fit I actually have to
extend the headband basically all the
way out leaving only two extra clicks
and every time I go to put these
headphones on I'm afraid to go into snap
because they creak a lot compared to the
Sony watch oh 700 or many other
headphones out there
now when you actually put on the school
candy venues you're going to notice that
they have a lot of clamping force which
do make them pretty uncomfortable to
wear for extended periods of time
they're not as bad as the powers of
Malcolm's px but no matter how much I
shifted them around I never managed to
get a comfortable fit with the venues
where as both the Sony went to 700 iron
and Sun hyzers have a snug fit but they
are still comfortable enough to wear for
extended periods of time but clamping
force aside the shape of the ear cups on
the venues are also pretty cramped
compared to most other over your
headphones my medium-sized ears just
barely managed to fit inside them but if
you have larger ears or ears that stick
out a lot then these are a hard pass I
feel the venues are only going to fit
two grown adults with smaller heads or
teenagers that still have some growing
to do when it comes to the active noise
cancellation on these headphones
honestly I'm not impressed they block
out less noise than the Sony watch 700 N
and they do so with more cabin pressure
it's not as bad as the JBL East 65 is
but you're definitely gonna know when
it's on and there's also a good amount
of hissing now the hissing goes away if
you're listening to music but if you're
listening to a podcast or some videos
you are going to hear some constant
hissing and the background of whenever
somebody's talking
and the active noise cancellation on the
Skullcandy venues also takes a toll on
the sound quality of these headphones
with ANSI turned on the soundstage on
these headphones is a little narrow but
the EQ changes so there's an emphasis on
both the trouble and bass but what ends
up happening is that if the highs really
get going then these headphones start to
sound very bright but also if you're
listening to hip-hop rap or anything
with a lot of bass then these headphones
are going to bottom out a lot way more
than what I feel is acceptable these
days but with anc turned off the
soundstage all these headphones opens up
a little bit but the emphasis on the
bass and trouble goes away now even
though there's a lot less crashing in
the bass and the highs don't get as
bright with a and C turned off I still
can't help but notice that the
instrument separation and clarity of
these headphones is overall pretty weak
and you don't get all that loud so
unfortunately since the Skullcandy
venues foolish tour for me when it comes
to fit sound quality and anc performance
i just can't recommend these headphones
over other headphones but like I said at
the beginning of this video the venue's
do have a few cool things going for them
first up I think it's awesome these
headphones have tile integration
straight from the tile app you can
locate your headphones and you can make
them play a troubling sound and for high
school or college students this is an
awesome feature to have maybe you're on
a hurry to get to your next class and
you end up reading and headphones in the
mess hall or library or if someone
steals your headphones you have the
option to chat them down another cool
feature these headphones have over other
sub $200 headphones it is their
monitoring mode which is very similar to
Sony's quick attention mode on the 1000
xm3 if you're playing music and if you
press the a and C button the headphones
will lower the volume of your music and
pump in all of the ambient sound so you
can talk to someone without having to
take the headphones off
I guess the start when I want that one
she got my friend I love and when you
press the NC button again the headphones
will go back to normal I love when
headphones have this type of feature it
comes in very handy if you're traveling
or commuting when it comes to battery
life the venue's have an advertised
battery life of 24 hours with a and C
turn on and even though a 24 hour
battery life is pretty average for
wireless headphones these days what's
not average is they're fast charger if
you charge these headphones up for 10
minutes from a dead battery they're
gonna get you 5 hours of playback time
which is the same as the 1000x m3 and
finally I can't deny the Skullcandy
venue or a good-looking pair of
headphones they have a very clean and
minimalist design that's going to look
good
everywhere you wear them the buttons on
the back of either of the ear cups are
very easy to find and they have a good
amount of tactile feedback and the
battery gauge is also a nice touch I
just wish the plus/minus and ANC Tech's
were raised so they were easier to
teleport and I know this is just me but
I just hate that you have to press and
hold the plus or minus button to skip or
go back at Jack it just takes so long
but if you double press the center
button you'll activate your voices
system and finally here's the microphone
test and long story short I just want to
say phone calls with these headphones
but this audio clip B has been recorded
by the microphone on the Skullcandy
venues so overall even though the
Skullcandy venue has a few cool things
going for it like tile integration
ambient mode and some very impressive
rapid charging for me they fall short
when it comes to fit sound quality and
active noise cancellation and these are
the top three things to take into
consideration when choosing ANC
headphones with the way they fit and
sound I can't help will feel the
Skullcandy venues were made for kids so
if you want a good pair of sub $200 ANC
headphones I would recommend the Sony
wotcha 700 on or the sennheiser 4.5 opt
NCS
over the Skullcandy venue the Sony's
have the better built-in tech because
they have a longer battery life they
have an app which allows you to adjust
the EQ their base is deeper and puncher
and since your ear cups are much more
spacers that are more comfortable to
wear
if you want that timeless minimalist
design like the venue then the
Sennheiser's might be more your style
those are also a very good pair of sub
$200 headphones with some really amazing
build quality if you made it this far I
guess you enjoyed the video so hit that
