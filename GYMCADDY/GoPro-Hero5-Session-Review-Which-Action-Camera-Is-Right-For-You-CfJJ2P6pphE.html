action camera you might be considering
the gopro hero session it's small
water-resistant and very capable but
then you ask yourself what's the
difference between a gopro hero session
and a GoPro Hero 5 session they look
exactly the same well don't worry I've
got you covered at the time of this
recording you can pick up a GoPro Hero
session bundle that includes a 16
gigabyte microSD card and a handle grip
for 139 on amazon link is in the
description the newer GoPro Hero 5
session currently retails for 299 on
amazon and i'll update that link if i
find it the ilanic for you keep in mind
the hero 5 session doesn't include a
microSD card both sessions or one and a
half inch cubes that have tiny black and
white screens on top that you interact
with by pressing either one of the
buttons found on top on the back of the
device both sessions come included with
the housing USB cable and to bouncing
surfaces so you can attach your GoPro
one is flat while the others curved both
of the cameras have built-in batteries
that will last you between 30 minutes to
two hours depending on capture settings
if you have Wi-Fi or bluetooth on or if
you're using the voice control feature
more on that in a second both sessions
have a side door that opens up and
reveals this connection port in micro SD
slot the hero session uses a micro USB
port while the hero 5 session uses a USB
type-c port the USB type-c port lets you
plug in this cable in either direction
and also allows for faster transfer
speeds as long as the side doors close
shut both sessions are waterproof down
to 33 feet underwater any deeper and
you'll need a waterproof case on the
front of the camera you'll notice there
are screws going all around the lens
you're not just there for looks those
screws allow you to replace the lens in
case it gets scratched or banged up if
you want to adjust the settings of
either session or switch between photo
or video mode you first press on the
bottom button you then cycle through
your options by pressing the bottom
button again and make a selection by
pressing the shutter button there's a
learning curve when it comes to using
these GoPros well you'll get the hang of
it after a while thankfully these
cameras can connect to your phone via
the GoPro app you can adjust all of your
settings from your phone and you can
also use it as a viewfinder to help you
set up your shots or even see what the
camera is recording in real time now
let's get into the technical stuff the
hero session can take photos at eight
megapixels and it can take time lapse at
10 frames per second the hero session is
capable of recording 1440p at 30 frames
per second or 1080p at
or 30 frames per second if you're
interested in slow motion the session
can capture wvga at 120 frames per
second with a wide field of view the
hero 5 session on the other hand can do
everything the hero session can do but
better the hero 5 session can take 10
megapixel pictures and can even record
up to 4k video at 30 frames per second
also the hero 5 session can record
slo-mo video at 720p at 120 frames per
second now the hero 5 session in the
hero session have way more capture
settings but I think these are the stats
that are going to interest your average
consumer most it is worth noting the
hero 5 session has way more field of
view options at various resolutions and
capture speeds than the hero session
which means if video quality is of high
importance to you and you want to
prevent a deal with video distortion or
having that curved looked in your videos
then you should opt in for the hero 5
session but if having perfect video
isn't super important to you or if you
don't have a computer that can render 4k
video for editing then you should opt in
for the hero session instead and save
some money aside from video quality the
sessions also differ when it comes to
sound recording the hero 5 session has
improved microphones that lets it get
clearer clearer is that is that correct
I feel we are saying it the hero 5
session has improved microphones that
lets it get clearer sound it also has
increased audio range by 10 decibels the
hero 5 session also features image
stabilization which does a great job of
smoothing out your video the image
stabilization on the hero 5 session is
taken care of by built in software
unlike the optical stabilization found
on other action cameras or phones but
keep in mind if you choose to use the
image stabilization it'll drain your
battery a little faster the hero 5
session also features the voice controls
which will allow you to tell your GoPro
to start recording take a picture or
stop recording is it a gimmick sure but
it's a well-made feature that is highly
accurate it's even more accurate than
series sometimes but just keep in mind
just like the image stabilization
feature it'll drain your battery a
little faster if you choose to use it
now if you're looking for a GoPro
because you're going to get the new car
madrone keep in mind the hero session
isn't compatible so that means you have
to get the hero 5 session hero five
black or hero4 so let's answer that pest
question from the beginning of the video
which one should you get if you're an
amateur that just wants to catch some
video of yourself snowboarding riding
your motorcycle or on your dirt bike or
what have you and video distortion isn't
a big deal and you want to save some
money get the hero session you can
always stabilize your video with any
video editing software on your computer
if you're trying to capture higher
quality video you understand what flv
means and you routinely record
fast-moving objects and you should get
the hero 5 session because of the higher
framerate capabilities personally I've
been using the GoPro Hero session
whenever I go out to play paintball it's
small enough that I can tuck it away
anywhere and I'd have to worry about it
catching a straight people it's
water-resistant so i don't have to worry
about it when it starts to rain mid game
and the video quality of captures is
just 5 for me well if you made it this
far and leave us alike it really helps
if you like videos like this subscribe
