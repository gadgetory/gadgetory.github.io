requested so here it is these are the
sony here on - noise cancelling
headphones and aside from their awful
name there are more playful and slightly
more affordable version of the sony
1000x and two headphones aside from
their designs they do have some key
differences and perform differently from
their more premium counterpart don't
forget to Like comment and subscribe and
if you want somebody who is here after
watching this video
unlike the Sony 1000 XM to search only
come in two colorways the Sony here on -
come in three colorways Twilight red
moonlit blue and grayish black and two
more colors are supposed to be released
as well Verizon green and pale gold the
Huron twos are Sony's attempt at going
up against the Beats Studio threes but
the here on - are slightly cheaper than
the studio threes retelling for to
$99.99 but actually got these for -
$49.99 if you want to pick these
headphones up I'll have links to
description below I'll keep them updated
so you can get the best deal possible I
suggest you check out the links because
Sony products routinely go on sale and
it also helped us channel the Sony here
on to come included with the color
matching carrying pouch and audio cable
and II come included with a micro USB
cable for charging but if you plan on
traveling a lot with these headphones I
suggest you invest in your own hearts
little carrying case the pouches now go
in to protect your headphones these
headphones also don't come included with
an airplane adapter which I personally
don't think is a big deal
the old quality is just as good as the
sony 1000 XM - they're mostly made out
of plastic and they have the same
stainless steel headband and synthetic
leather covering the ear cups and
they're heavier than I expected weighing
in at 291 grams I'm also assuming the
Huron shoe is using the same plastic on
the underside of the headband as the
1000x m2 which I want to point out that
after three months of heavy usage still
having cracked which was a pretty common
problem with the Sony and the or 1000x
so hopefully the sony here on 2 won't
have a head neck cracking issue either
the ear cups on the huron to have a good
amount of range of motion but they don't
pivot or swivel as much as a 1000 x and
twos and unlike the m2 is that here on
tuesday flat you can only fold up on the
left ear cup you get your NFC touch
point power button noise cancellation by
in micro USB port an audio jack and yes
these headphones can be used passively
my only gripe with the physical buttons
is that they were very hard to find I
just
raise more or textured just like the
Sony 1000x and to the Huron to also use
touch controls on the right ear cups our
control your music playback swipe front
or back to skip or go back a track
double tap to play or pause and swipe up
or swipe down to raise or lower your
volume and pro tip if you swipe up and
then hold the volume will continue to
rise until you let go and the same goes
for lowering the volume and if you tap
and hold you'll activate your voice
assistant I can't wait to see what Siri
gets wrong this done the touch controls
are pretty intuitive and very accurate
I've never really had a problem with
them even with wet fingers when it comes
to design and comfort I personally
prefer the look and some of the design
elements of the here on to over the 1000
xm2 first a you have something here on
to you aren't covered in synthetic
leather like the amp tubes which just
give them a cleaner look but they do
stick out to the sides a bit not as bad
as the Sony xb9 50 n ones but you might
look like megaman with these on they're
just that as low profile as the 1000 x
and twos but the biggest design
difference between the 1000 x + 2 and
the here on - or the ear cups the ear
comes on the huron to do a far better
job of engaging your ears and give your
ears more room to breathe which also
means less sweat and heat build up after
prolonged use sessions the ear cups up
to here on - are very similar to the ear
cups found on the bose qc25 and BN wpx
they're not as comfortable to wear as
the bose because they do have a little
more clamping force and the padding
isn't as soft but they are more
comfortable than the PX because they do
have more padding I feel that here on -
are going to fit just fine for most
people if you have a bigger head the
clamping force isn't going to cause you
discomfort in the jaw area and if you
have bigger ears the padding isn't going
to rest on the ears like - 1000 x m2 or
Beats Studio 3zu battery life on the
Sony here on - is almost as good as the
Sonia 1000 x m2 with noise cancellation
turned on I've averaged 20 and a half
hours of playback time and when noise
cancellation turned off I've averaged 35
hours of playback time I mean these
headphones still have a better battery
life than the bose qc25 series - or the
Beats Studio threes with noise
cancellation turned on but they're quick
charging is pretty weak if you plug them
in for 10 minutes then you'll only get
65 minutes of playback time these
headphones are also using bluetooth 4.1
the range in connectivity is very
similar to the 1000 xm2 they have a
range of about 30 feet very little delay
so audio and images are sick too in
watching videos and they have a stable
and clear connection but just like the
1000 x m2 the here on - you cannot be
paired to multiple devices at the same
time so you can't quickly switch from
one device to another as easily as you
would with let's say both headphones
that can be connected to two devices at
the same time or beats that use apple's
w1 chip so you can't hot-swap so
switching from your phone to your laptop
with the Sony headphones isn't as
seamless like with other headphones
which does get annoying after a while
but if you have a premium Android device
you can also take advantage of the apt X
HD audio which is nice when it comes to
sound quality the hero on two sounds
identical to the 1002 and they get just
as loud they're both closed back
headphones and they have the same at one
point five seven inch dumb drivers and
to hear on twos connect to Sony's
headphones actually you cannot just you
EQ depending on the type of music you
like they have a wide soundstage a good
amount of instrument separation and they
have a good amount of bass but not as
much space as the Sony xb9 50 n1 i mean
i feel these headphones sound better
than the B studio threes or bose qc25
series twos but if you're looking for
something with even better sound quality
then you might want to look into the B&amp;amp;W
px or something more high-end but the
noise cancellation under here on - is
pretty average compared to other
headphones out there first off that you
comes themselves do a poor job of
providing passive noise isolation so a
lot of sound still manages to get in and
you get a lot of sound leakage the noise
cancelling mic on these headphones also
like to pick up a lot of wind noise just
like the Bose or studio freeze but at
least they don't have any cabin pressure
the noise cancelling on these headphones
is really only worth using in an already
quiet environment like at the office or
at home and they do an okay job went on
a bus
these headphones also allow you to pump
in some ambient sound in so he can be
aware of your surroundings if you're
walking around in the city
and these headphones also have my
favorite feature from the 1000 X and 2
which is quick attention if you cover
the touchpad on the right ear cup the
headphones will automatically lower the
volume of whatever you're listening to
and pump in all of those surrounding
sounds so this way you can talk to
someone without having to take your
headphones off and when you take your
hand off with the touchpad they will set
everything back to how it was quick
attention is by far my favorite feature
and you even have to sometimes explain
to people but you can still hear them
even with the headphones on now let's
talk about Sony's headphones app for the
huron - it's pretty solid and well laid
out from here you can turn noise
cancellation on or off and you can
choose from noise cancelling with noise
reduction and ambient sound i've already
demonstrated noise cancellation and
ambient sound for you and when setting
the headphones to wind noise reduction
yes the mics won't pick up that dreaded
wind noise but then they don't cancel
out any sound unlike the 1000x and twos
these headphones don't have an
atmospheric pressure sensor and you
can't calibrate the noise cancellation
to better fit your surroundings in
general you don't have as much control
over the noise cancellation as you would
with the 1000x m2 but you can adjust the
surround sound setting on these
headphones but partially I just keep
that off because all it does is distort
the sound and you also have your
equalizer settings you can either choose
from a few pre-made ones or you can make
your own and like I said they have a
good amount of bass if you set the bass
to 10 then they'll have more bass than
most other headphones on the market but
they don't have as much space as bass
heavy headphones like the Sony xb9 50 n1
or the Skullcandy crusher okay and
here's the microphone
test on the sony here on - it's not the
best microphone out there but it does
get the job done it doesn't sound as
good as the 1000 x time - but when i
spoken to people on the phone they
really didn't have an issue but this
audio clip is been recorded by the
microphone on the 1000 x12 so you can be
the judge of that
Sony's here on - noise cancelling
headphone
performed pretty average when it
actually comes to noise cancellation
compared to other headphones on the
market but they do sound identical to
the Sony 1000 XM 2 and that's a good
thing they sound good
personally I prefer to the design of the
here on to and I would really like to
see the Sony 1000 xm3 to adopt some of
this design language what I really like
most about the here on - is the earcup
design I really like the extra breathing
room and openness of the ear cups
without having the pads actually rest on
my ears I really think the Sony here on
- are a great alternative to the Beats
Studio threes they cost less they sound
good and their noise cancellation is
slightly better
