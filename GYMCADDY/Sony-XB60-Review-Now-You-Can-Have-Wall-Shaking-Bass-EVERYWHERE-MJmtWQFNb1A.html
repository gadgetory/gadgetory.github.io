headphones last week they also released
two new portable extra bass speakers
this is the Sony gtk xB 60 and if you
ever thought hmm I like the xB 40 but I
wish it was larger and louder then the
xB 60 is your answer so how does this
new speaker perform or about to find out
but it's like comment and subscribe and
you can watch some of the videos here
after you're done watching this video
and there will be a sound test at the
end of this video to like most Sony
speakers the Sony GT kxb 60 come in
multiple color ways you can either get
it in black or blue the Sony Xperia
tills for 340 to $9.99 and it's just
$100 more than the xB 40 but unlike the
xB 30 and the xB 40 which also have $100
price difference between them but only
slightly minor performance differences
the jump from the xB 42 the xB 60 is
much bigger if you want to pick the
speaker up I'll have links in
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deal
possible
slowly speakers routinely go on sale so
you might get lucky the sony xba-40
riyals as the sony xba-1 the majority of
the body is being out of textured hard
plastic and on the back there's some
more paneling no rubber pads on the
bottom and on the side so you can stand
the speaker upright or lay it flat and
there are handles on either side that
really make transporting the speaker
much easier just like all other Sony
extra bass speakers the XP 60 has a
metal grille on the front and a built-in
light feature the XP 60 has a height of
21.73 inches and a width of 10 point 3 9
inches and the death of 10 point 7 1
inches and it weighs in at seventeen
point six four pounds or for my
international peoples this speaker is
point five five meters by 0.26 meters by
point two seven meters respectively and
it weighs 8 kilos and a good chunk of
that weight is due to the rechargeable
batteries but for those wondering know
this speaker is not waterproof so don't
get away concerning speaker setup the
Sony eyespace 60 has dual 50 millimeter
or two inch tweeters in the center and
dual 130 millimeter or five inch woofers
you have a ringing or full color LEDs
stroll lights on the top and bottom and
single color lights that
the woofers themselves on a tablet
speaker you'll see there's your power
button volume control buttons and
thankfully they added a play/pause
button and this is a big deal because
I'm the sony xba-4 in XP 7 there was no
play pause button so if your phone or
the included remote wasn't nearby you
couldn't control your music playback and
for those wondering the XP 60 does not
have an included controller but honestly
I don't care and you'll also find other
buttons like the function button to
cycle between your audio sources and the
add and party team button you can also
use the party team button to turn off
the light feature by pressing and
holding if you have to Sony XP 60s you
can pair them together and have them
play in stereo mode or if you have other
XP speakers like the XP 30x p40 or the
larger XP 90 you can pair up to 10
speakers together and have them all play
in sync and thankfully Sony streamline
the panic process on the XP 60 and XP 90
all you have to do is press the party
chaim button on each speaker and you're
done it's just like JBL speakers a
little further up you'll also see a slit
where you can rest your phone or tablet
and even more up you'll find an NFC
touch point on the back of the speaker
you'll find RCA ports so he can daisy
chain more speakers together a USB port
in the mic input but Sony did not
include a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
which is a bummer through the USB port
you can charge your own phone and play
mp3 WMA and wav files on most devices
but you can't play music through the USB
port when using Apple devices so you're
stuck with only a Bluetooth connection
but like I've said in the past Sony does
a really good job of having a really
clear wireless audio connection on both
their speakers and headphones so
personally I don't need an audio jack on
the XP 60 but I know for some certain
users it's a must have concerning tech
specs the Sony XP 60 is using bluetooth
for that too and can be paired up to
three devices at the same time and
you've got a wireless range of around 40
feet with the right line of sight and it
also does a really good job of keeping a
solid connection through multiple walls
when it comes to battery life the box
says it's good for 14 hours with an
asterisk you can get 14 hours of
playback with the life feature turned
off and at a low volume but weald world
use with the life feature turned on and
the speaker at a moderate volume
I've averaged the
seven hours but when the volume is at
Maxim with a light feature turned on
I've averaged four hours of playback so
if you plan on taking this somewhere
remember to pack the charger cable new
to the XP 60 and the xb9 t is stamina
mode and basically what it does is that
reduces the output of the speakers so
there won't be as much bass it won't get
as loud and the sound isn't as crisp but
you'll be able to squeeze out about two
more hours of playback time and
thankfully Sony got rid of the police
charge feature that was on the XP 40 +
XP 30 when the battery on the XP 60 gets
below 20% it'll simply say please charge
in flash a few times and that's it but
it will no longer nag you to put it back
on the charger or limit volume like the
XP 40 and the XP 30 and for those
wondering if you press and hold the
stamina button on the speaker it will
tell you the current battery percentage
controlling sound quality this speaker
is all about bass and loudness and Max
volume this thing averages 82 decibels
but it's also a very directional speaker
if you stand off to the side or behind
it all you're gonna get a sub bass so
placement is very important with the
speaker for the most part I like how the
speaker sounds but I think there's still
room for improvement when it comes to
instrument separation and the highs it
just sounds like everything is too close
together and it's hard to pick
instruments apart and the highs like to
resonate a bit but the speaker has
almost zero sound distortion and max
volume which was a problem with the
older Sony XP 7 but through Sony's music
center app you can either select from a
few pre-made eq's make your own or you
can just use Sony's clear Audio plus
setting and what clear Audio plus does
is that it automatically adjust the
speaker settings depending on what
you're listening to
there are also some DJ effects but all
those do is distorts a sound so I never
touch those so a Music Center you can
also just a light mode on the sony xba-4
rave chill a rave moment without the
strobe lights hot or only reds and
oranges will flash cool or only blues
and greens will flash their strobe and
then there's also a few commons as well
but i don't know what's going on with
sony's app development teams so nice
headphones app is solid it works most of
the time the UI is good enough and it's
easy to toggle to sudden
of the 1,000 XM to Sony's music Center
app only works half the time and from a
UI standpoint it takes too many steps to
get to the EQ or I get to the light
settings or even just check the battery
life I don't know why the app layout for
the XP 6e isn't linked to 1000 XM - and
then there's Fiesta Bowl which is just
an eyesore but you can adjust the color
of the light feature on the XP 60 after
you selected one of the previously
mentioned light modes so if you want
blue strobe lights feasible can make
that happen
but regardless Sony needs to step up
their app game the biggest pet peeve I
have with the sony xba-40 is that when
the battery on either those speakers get
below 20% the speakers will abruptly
lower the volume repeatedly say please
charge and one with the volume go above
20% so you have no other option than to
put the speaker back on the charger even
though you still had 20% battery
thankfully the XP 60 doesn't do that but
it still has a weird quirk every time
you plug the XP 60 to charge after you
use it even though the speaker is off
the speaker will go into demo mode and
continuously cycle through the light
modes so every time you plug it in to
charge you have to wait a few seconds
and then press and hold the party
chamber to turn off the light feature
even though the speaker is off to begin
with it's just annoying if I have the
speaker off I want it completely off I
don't know why Sony does things like
this it's like they actively sabotage
their own products it's not the
microphone out there but at least it
gets the job done but this audio clip is
been recorded with the microphone on the
XP 60 so what's the verdict on the sony
xba-4 all about bass and loudness then
for its size it's pretty good but like I
said the highs end instrument separation
could be better it's pretty versatile if
you want to take it with you on the go
or hook it up to your TV you can do
either of those things even though there
is a built in battery don't forget to
power cord for a $350 portable bluetooth
speaker the XP 60 is all about sound and
looks is not as durable as let's say the
JBL extreme and it is tailor
on the edge of is this thing too big to
look around but it is small enough that
it will fit in most places and the
carrying handles make it liking this 18
pound brick easy enough personally I
think the speaker is perfect for campus
life if you're in college and here's the
Santa's I'm gonna cycle through some
speakers of the same size and as always
all these speakers will be playing at
the same decibel level streaming from
the same device and at the same distance
away from the same microphone so
hopefully the only difference is sound
quality
Green
exceed
