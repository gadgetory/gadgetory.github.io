the AirPods 2 are finally here.
And if you’re an iPhone user looking for
truly wireless earbuds, then the AirPods 2
are still the best ones you can get period.
But even though the new AirPods 2 bring new
features like wireless charging if you decide
to get the $200 version and always listening
Siri, I think Apple could of and should have
done more given that other truly wireless
earbuds are starting to catch up and surpass
the AirPods 2.
Now one of the biggest rumors that was going
around about the AirPods 2 was that the charging
case was going to be slightly larger than
the original AirPods case to accommodate the
new wireless charging coils.
But to everybody’s surprise, especially
mine… the Airpods 2 charging case with wireless
charging is the exact same size as the original
AirPods case.
And you know what, I gotta give credit where
credit is due…
I think that’s very impressive.
And over all to the untrained eye the AirPods
2 look identical to the original AirPods.
The only physical difference between the new
AirPods and the old AirPods is all in the
case… the battery indicator light is now
on the outside, the hinge isn’t chromed
out anymore, the bluetooth pairing button
has been moved up a bit, and the case with
wireless charging is now 2 grams heavier than
before… which you’re not even going to
notice.
Now wireless charging on the AirPods 2 is
pretty neat.
And its going to work with any wireless charger
that supports the Qi standard.
So if you already have a wireless charger
for your iPhone, then its also going to work
with your AirPods.
But if you don’t already have a wireless
charger then you’re going to have to charge
them the old fashioned way.
But I found that due to slow charging rates
and constant over heating, it took my AirPods
5 hours to go from 0% to 100% battery while
on the wireless charger.
Where as when charged with a cable my AirPods
went from 0 to 100 in just one hour.
So from my experience if you need to quickly
charge your AirPods from a dead battery then
you’re better off just using the cable.
But still, even tough wireless charging on
the AirPods 2 is cool and all I don’t think
its a much have feature right now.
The reason why wireless charging on the Galaxy
Buds is so awesome is because if im ever caught
out in public with completely dead earbuds…
and it happens a lot, I can just turn on wireless
power share on my Galaxy S10 and charge my
galaxy buds from there.
But unfortunately with the iPhone you just
cant do this.
So until theres an iPhone that supports power
sharing or until the Airpower comes out if
it ever does especially since apple just canceled
it or if you already have a wireless charger...
I think you should just pick up the standard
$160 non wireless charging airpods 2...
You're not missing out on much.
Now when it comes to tech specs the airpods
2 have the same battery life as the original
airpods.
And that's not a bad thing.
They have a combined battery life of 25 plus
hours where the buds themselves can go for
5 straight hours and the case can supply an
additional 4 or 5 charges.
They even have the same fast charging where
if your airpods die if you drop them into
their case for 15 minutes they'll get you
3 hours of playback time.
The only difference is the airpods 2 get you
3 hours of talk time where as the original
airpods are only good for 2 hours of talk
time.
But this is where we get back to when I said
I wish apple had done a few things differently.
The airpods 2 are using the exact same batteries
as the ones found in the original Airpods.
Now airpods in general have spectacular battery
performance.
But that performance is short lived due to
battery degradation.
When my airpods were brand new I could go
about 5 days in between charging them.
Then after about a year and a half I could
only go about 3 days in-between charging them.
And now that my original AirPods are over
2 years old I have to charge them every other
night.
Thats why I got these new AirPods.
And since the AirPods 2 have the same exact
batteries as the original AirPods I think
we can expect similar battery degradation
unless Apple’s new H1 chip is taking a significantly
different approach to power management.
But I doubt it cause I think if apple can
make you buy a new pair of AirPods every 16
months or so, they’re gonna wanna keep doing
that.
But Apple’s new H1 chip found in their new
AirPods bring a new and in my opinion more
useful feature than wireless charging and
thats always listening Siri.
With the original AirPods, if you wanted to
talk to Siri you would first have to double
tap on one of the AirPods, wait a second,
and then tell it what to do.
But now if you have always listening Siri
turned on, you can simply just say Hey Siri
and tell it what to do all with out having
to tap anything.
Like this…
And the most crucial thing here is that when
you say “Hey Siri” you don’t have to
wait for a beep or something, you can just
give it your command right away which just
feels much more natural and intuitive.
Cause for comparison the Surface headphones
also have always listening Cortana, but before
you can give Cortana a command you first have
to wait until she’s ready for you
like this.
And for me having to wait in between saying
the hot word and my command feels very janky
given that I’ve gotten so used to not having
to pause when talking to my smart speakers.
But another thing Always on Siri gets right
on the AirPods 2 is that it only responds
to your voice.
So you don’t have to worry about someone
running up to you and say Hey Siri call my
FBI agent and just running away just cause
they wanna troll you.
And having always on Siri on the AirPods 2
means that you can change what double tapping
on each AirPods does giving you more physical
control over your music.
Personally I like having Play and Pause on
one AirPod and Skip forward on the other AirPod.
But still, even with always listening Siri,
touch controls on the AirPods are still very
limited compared to the robust touch controls
found on the galaxy buds which essentially
give you full control over your music thanks
to their on board touch pads.
I just want AirPods to support triple tapping.
Now when it actually comes to listening to
music with the AirPods 2, if you didn’t
like how the original AirPods sounded then
you’re not going to like how these new ones
sound cause they sound exactly the same.
Now im not saying AirPods sound horrible,
but I feel AirPods do put an emphasis on the
bass to make up for the fact they have very
weak mids and instrument separation.
But at least they don’t sound tinny, so
I say AirPods sound good enough.
But just keep in mind, I rarely use AirPods
to listen to music…
I mainly use them to watch videos, listen
to podcasts cause theres no latency, and to
take phone calls.
When ever I’m actually going to listen to
music I use headphones.
But for those of you that plan on taking lots
of phone calls with AirPods like I do, rest
assured that these have one of the best microphones
in the game.
And unlike a lot of other truly wireless earbuds
out there, phone calls do come in through
both ears.
Which is good.
But finally, I wanna talk about a feature
that I'm just dumbfounded that apple just
didn’t include on their new AirPods 2.
And thats the inclusion of an ambient mode.
A lot of new truly wireless ear buds like
the Galaxy Buds have an ambient mode where
you can set them to pump in the sound around
you so you can still be aware of your surroundings
while you’re listening to what ever you're
listening to.
Having an ambient mode is extremely useful
if you’re walking around in the city, or
waiting for your name to be called while you’re
sitting in a waiting room.
And I just don’t understand why apple just
doesn’t include an ambient mode on their
AirPods when their AirPods already have the
necessary built in microphones.
I mean apple already came out with live listen
mode, so I don’t get why they just wont
push out a software update for an ambient
mode on their AirPods.
It's a feature thats becoming increasingly
common on all other earbuds and headphones.
But over all, like I said at the beginning
of this video… if you’re an iPhone user
looking for a pair of truly wireless earbuds
then the AirPods 2 are still the best ones
you can get.
I just personally recommend your save yourself
some money and get the non wireless charging
version unless you already have a wireless
charger.
Personally I think wireless charging on the
AirPods 2 will only actually matter once theres
an iPhone that supports power sharing, if
that day ever comes.
And I think always listening Siri is a bigger
deal than wireless charging on the AirPods
2.
I feel that if you already have a pair of
airpods that are less than a year old who’s
batteries are performing just well, then theres
no need to rush out and upgrade.
But if this is your first time buying a pair
of AirPods just keep in mind they’re probably
going to last you for 2 years.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
