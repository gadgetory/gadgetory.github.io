that I really like Audio-Technica’s $200
ATH-SR50BT headphones…
And if it weren’t for their crappy touch
pad, I think they would be the best $200 headphones
on the market right now.
So when Audio-Technica announced their new
ATH-ANC900BT Quietpoint headphones at CES
2019, admittedly I was pretty excited.
But after getting my hands on them…
its just pretty hard to recommend these headphones
in today’s super competitive Premium ANC
Headphone market.
Now one of the things the Audio-Technica Quietpoint
has going for them is that they retail for
$300, which is $50 less than everybody’s
favorite, Sony 1000XM3 and Bose QC35.
But I just feel you end up compromising a
lot with the Quitepoints when you’re trying
to save 50 bucks.
And I just feel the $300 Quitepoints don’t
bring the same per dollar value compared to
the $200 SR50BT’s.
But if you want to pick any of the headphones
up mentioned in this video i'll have them
linked down below.
The first major compromise on the ATH-ANC900BT
is the lack of USB C charging on these headphones.
As of early 2019, USB C on headphones is currently
reserved for companies newer higher end models.
And given that these are Audio-Technica’s
top of the line ANC headphones it would have
been nice to see USB C here.
But the reason USB C is a big deal is because
I want to be able to charge my phone and headphones
with the same cable and USB C also allows
for better fast charing.
But rounding out the accessories list, these
headphones also come included with a 3.5 to
2.5 millimeter audio cable and an airplane
adapter.
Now one of my biggest critiques about these
headphones is their build quality, design
and fit.
Right off the bat I just wanna say these headphones
are comfortable to wear, they have very little
clamping force and they’re big head approved.
Their ear cups are also very spacious and
its obvious Audio-Technica took some inspiration
from the Bose QC35’s.
Im even willing to admit the Faux leather
on the Quitepoints feels nicer than the synthetic
leather on the 1000xM3’s which even after
6 months of heavy use still feel very plastic.
But when it comes to the Quietpoint’s build
quality thats another story.
When we go from Sony’s $200 headphones to
their $300 or $350 headphones we see a major
improvement in over all build quality and
design.
But we just don’t see that when we go from
Audio-Technica’s $200 headphones to their
$300 headphones.
They’re using the same plastics, they have
the same stainless steel headband, and they
have the same exposed screw design.
And when it comes to how they look when you’re
actually wearing them, the Quietpoint’s
just look silly and dated with their not so
low profile headband.
Cause for comparison, the SR50BT’s have
a much more low profile headband which just
make them look over all better.
And just like the Quietpoints, the SR50BT’s
are comfortable to wear, they have spacious
ear cups and they’re big head approved.
I just feel that since these days headphones
are becoming more popular, looks can be just
as important as performance and features…
thats why newer headphones like the 1000XM3
and surface headphones have both a stylish
and low profile design… and I know Audio-Technica
is capable of doing better cause their SR50BT’s
are a pair of good looking, low profile headphones.
But when it comes to tech specs, thats another
story… the Battery life on the Quietpoints
is actually pretty impressive.
They have an advertised battery life of 35
hours which is a little more than the Sony
1000XM3’s so these should last you a little
over 2 weeks in between charges.
But unfortunately these headphones don't have
any official fast charging numbers.
But the Quietpoints are also using bluetooth
5.0 and they’re good for watching videos
cause they have very little latency.
The only exception is that they do have like
a quarter second delay when watching youtube
videos on an iPhone, but other than that they
have very little latency across the board.
But unfortunately these headphones can only
be connected to one device at a time so you
can't hot swap if you’re a power user.
And when it comes to the Quietpoint’s Active
Noise Cancelation there is an obvious performance
improvement over the cheaper SR50BT’s, but
it still pales in comparison to the Sony 1000XM3’s.
Like you may have just heard, the quietpoints
are able to block out considerably more noise
than the SR50BT's but not as much noise as
the Sony 1000XM3's...
The active noise cancellation on the quietpoints
actually perform similarly to the Bose QC35's
which is pretty cool.
But just like the Bose QC35's the quiet points
do have some cabin pressure.
It's nowhere near as harsh as the Bose, but
i do find myself having to pop my ears every
now and then with the quietpoints and there
is a noticeable amount of hissing if music
isn't playing when the ANC is left on.
Audio-technica also allows you to adjust the
noise cancellation on their quietpoints, but
personally I can't tell a difference between
the 3 modes so I just keep the quietpoints
on airplane mode all the time.
But Audio-technica also baked in a transparency
mode into their new quietpoint headphones
called hear through where they'll pump in
the ambient sound around you so you can know
what's going on if you're walking around the
city or working in an office.
But the problem with Audio-technica's hear
through mode is that it pumps in everything,
so if a loud sudden sound like a dog barking
or if a bus rolls by all of that sound gets
pumped in as well.
Where as the Sonys which have a similar feature
called ambient mode are smart enough to block
out that unwanted noise pollution saving you
from sudden jump scares.
But the quietpoints also have quick hear through
where if you press this button they'll mute
your music and pump in all of the ambient
sound like this.
And this feature is useful cause you can have
a quick conversation with someone like when
you're ordering food or checking your boarding
pass.
And im always a big fan when headphones have
these features cause they’re extremely useful
and you miss them when you don’t have them
anymore.
Now when it comes to these headphones sound
quality… just like Audio-technica's other
Headphones the quietpoints have a neutral
sound signature...
And unfortunately you can't change the EQ
on these headphones from Audio-technica's
app.
But that's not a bad thing, these headphones
sound very balanced and clear, they have good
instrument seperation, and they have a wide
soundstage.
And that sound stage gets wider if you listen
to these headphones with their ANC turned
off.
But this is where we circle back to when I
send the $300 Audio-technica Quietpoints don't
bring the same amount of per dollar value
as the $200 Audio-technica SR50BT.
All of the hear through features found on
the quietpoints, are also found on the SR50BT...
And when it comes to sound quality, the Quietpoints
sound no better than the SR50BT.
They even both have the same touchpad controls
on their left ear cup, which I personally
wish Audio-technica would get rid of.
Since they're on the left ear cup as a righty
I find them very hard to use and they aren't
the most accurate touch pads out there.
So instead of being sleek and intuitive they're
more of a hassle that I just end up not using.
So if you're considering getting the Audio-technica
ATH-ANC900BT quiet
Point headphones, here's my advice.
I highly suggest you just spend the extra
50 bucks and get yourself the Sony 1000XM3’s,
they're just overall better.
If you can't spend more than $300 on a pair
of headphones cause your budget wont allow
it then get yourself the SR50BT'S cause they
have basically everything the Quietpoints
have but in a much better looking body and
you save yourself 100 bucks.
The only thing the Quietpoints have over the
SR50BT’s is better active noise cancelation.
But if you really need a pair of headphones
with potent active noise cancellation on a
budget then I would try to get the Sony 1000XM2's
which are typically on sale now.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
