reviewed that SB 950 n1 headphones and
the XP 40 wireless speaker I was blown
away I was so impressed I decided to get
that so many XP 20 try this is a small
wireless speaker that goes up against
the JBL foot port in the UE one ago so
the Sony SB 20 with the money let's find
out
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe so like most speakers in this
category the sony xba-4 colorways
black blue gray and red they currently
retail for $99 and they go on sale from
time to time if you want to pick the
speaker up I'll have links in the
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best you as
possible so packaging is pretty standard
you get the speaker in a micro USB cable
for charging but no wall board the SB 20
is basically a smaller rounder version
of the XP 40 there's soft touch material
all around the body but front grille is
made out of metal and there's the same
buttons on the top of the device just
like the XP 40 well next to XP 20 stand
out in the 100 dollar small speaker
category is that it has a light of
feature on the front of the device but
unlike the XP 40 which can flash in
multiple colors backstreet 20 can only
flash in one color personally I don't
mind it and if you want to turn off the
lights and save some battery life you
just have to press and hold the extra
base by month time but the light-up
feature makes the XP 20 look great in
your bedroom when you're listening to
music and on the back of the device
you'll find that mic USB port for
charging and an aux jack
concerning specs sony advertises the XP
20s having a 12 hour battery life but
realistically what the light feature
turned on the music set at 70% the extra
base feature turned on we're looking at
about a for around 9 hours it's not the
best but it's okay the Sony SB 20 is
also using Bluetooth 22 so it can be
paired to three devices at the same time
so switching between your phone and your
laptop like I do it's super easy
it also has a range of around 40 feet
and I did notice the connection this
struggle window or multiple wall between
the speaker and the phone there's also
an NFC touch point on the top of the
device so if you have an Android device
pairing it super easy
there's also an Add button on the top of
the device so you can pair another song
you speak it together and get some
stereo sound goes or you can chain up to
10 so many speakers together and get
them all tying music at the same time
when it comes to sound quality the XP 20
phenomenal for small speaker I actually
think it sounds better than two JBL put
forth the speaker system majority of its
sound through the front of the device
but there isn't opening on the back for
the base so the SP 20 sounds best when
it's pointed towards you and against the
wall just like the sv40 the soundstage
is very wide and there's a lot of depth
to the sound the base on this speaker is
very punchy and the mid are very clear
the highs are also very clear but if you
create the volume up on this speaker the
highs will tend to ring but that's
normal for a speak of this size just
like other small speakers in this
category the XP 20 has no problem
getting a little wet but unlike the JBL
flip for or the ue wonder boom which are
ipx7 certified the XP 20 is only IP x5
certified which means the XP 20 is
splash resistant but you might have a
problem if you submerge it on the water
perhaps the XP 20 isn't fully waterproof
because of that line of feature on the
front sony also has an absolute Orion
speaker called music center it's gotten
a little better over the past few weeks
here you can do things like switch to
source group without their speakers
adjust to EQ and select between
different lighting modes personally I
like to keep on chill cuz I feel the
other modes are just little too much one
downside about the app is that it
doesn't tell you the speaker's current
battery state on the front page you have
to go digging for that information in
the settings menu sure to speak over
verbally tell you its battery percentage
if you press and hold the phone line but
I would much rather have a gauge on the
speaker itself aside from the extra bass
feature the xB 20 also has clear Audio
plus in my seem insignificant but here's
the thing
it is very hard to tell when the xB 20
is streaming music wirelessly or through
the oxygen which means better sound
quality overall and there's also a
microphone on board so you can take
holes or talk to Siri from uxb 20 reo
quality is decent at 5 feet but you're
better off taking your phone call
directly from your phone so what's the
verdict on the Sony XP 20 I really like
it
it sounds great and the light features
nice if you into that sure we're looking
at a will do a battery life of nine
hours and it's only IP x5 certified but
the XP 20 is great if you're looking for
something for personal listening and if
you're not going to be taking with you
all the time it's ready to go and fill
it in your room it has no problem
filling a small room but it does from
when it contours but all small speakers
do I think I like the XP 20 more than
the JBL foot for but we're gonna have to
