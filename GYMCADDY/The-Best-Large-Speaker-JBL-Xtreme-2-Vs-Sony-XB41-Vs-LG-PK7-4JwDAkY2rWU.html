portable speaker you might be looking
into popular options like the Sony XP 41
or the JBL extreme - or you could be
looking into the LG pk7 which is
essentially a mash-up between the XP 41
and the extreme - you got a built-in
light feature and a similar speaker
setup to the extreme - so let's see
which one of these speakers is actually
worth your money all three of these
speakers are in you for 2018 both the
Sony XP 41 nlg pk7 we tell us for $250
and the JBL extreme 2 does carry a
premium because it retails for $300 if
you want to pick either of these
speakers up I'll have links to
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel I
suggest you check them out coz both
Sony's and LG speakers routinely go on
sale so you might get lucky and if you
want to learn more about either of these
speakers then watch their full reviews
and check out the new more shelf down
below both the JBL extreme to you and
sony xba-40 one or rockin fabric outer
shows which I personally really like
they're able to stand up to bumps and
scrapes without any problems
where else dlg pk7 has a plastic body
that does get scratched easily if you
plan on taking the speaker on the go
with you the PK 7 is also the biggest
and heaviest speaker here weighing in at
six point three pounds even though the
PK seven does have a built in carrying
handle this speaker wouldn't be my first
choice for taking it on the go with me
if you're looking for a speaker to
routinely take on the go with you then I
highly recommend the JBL Xtreme - even
though it weighs in at five point three
pounds the detachable shoulder strap
makes carrying the speaker around super
easy there's even a built in bottle
opener that does come in clutch and
finally there's the XP 41 which is the
smallest and lightest speaker here
weighing in at three point three pounds
traveling with the speaker also isn't
that bad because you can just throw into
your backpack and it's not going to take
up too much space next before the one is
also the most rugged speaker here since
it has an ip67 certification so you can
submerge it in water and you don't have
to worry about getting dirt inside
whereas the extreme two has an IP x7
certification so
water isn't going to be a problem for
the speaker but you should avoid getting
dirt or sand in the exposed passive
radiators and finally there's the pk7
even though it looks like it's the
toughest speaker here cuz it looks like
it fell off a tank it's actually the
most fragile speaker here cuz it only
has an IP x5 certification so a splash
of water isn't going to be a problem but
you shouldn't submerge it and overall
I'm not a fan of the looks of the pk7
it's big and bulky whereas the extreme 2
and XP 41 are much more minimal so when
you're not using them they just blend
into their environment now let's talk
about ports all three of these speakers
have an audio jack for Wired listening
and all three of these speakers charge
via a DC input but you can also charge
the sony xba-40 one via eights of mic
USB port as long as you have a 5 watt
power adapter and I really like this cuz
if you take the XP 41 to a friend's
house and if it runs out of juice you
could just borrow one of your friends
chargers so you don't have to worry
about walking around with the charging
cable all the time and finally both the
XP 41 and extreme to have a USB out
which you can use to charge your own
devices whereas the ljpk 7 doesn't even
have a USB out when it comes to battery
life sony advertises a 24 hour battery
life on the XP 41 but with real world
use with the light feature turned on and
with the music set at 80 percent volume
extra 41 is good for about 12 hours of
playback time LG advertises a 22 hour
battery life on the PK 7 but under the
same circumstances this speaker is good
for about eight hours playback time and
finally there's the JBL extreme 2 with a
real-world battery life of about 9 hours
of playback time now let's talk about
speaker setups because all three of
these speakers sound very different the
sony XP 41 has the least amount of
hardware going for it and as dual front
were firing transducers and dual passive
radiators in the center that should at
the front and out the back of the
speaker whereas both the JBL extreme to
UNL gpk 7 also have fun with frying
transducers and they also have dual
passive radiators but their passive
radiators shoot off to the sides but
both the extreme 2 and PK 7 also have
dual
Twitter's which is something the XP 41
is sorely lacking we're about to jump
into a sound test where we're going to
hear the XP 41 and PK 7 in their various
listening modes and the extreme two is
running the 1.6 firmware update
first off I'm just gonna plainly say it
I hate live sound mode on the XP 41 I
never use it I used to listen to the XP
41 in extra base mode or I'll just use
my own EQ setting but when it comes to
overall sound quality though when easily
goes to the JBL extreme to the extreme
to has a neutral Sano signature with the
right amount of bass and trouble but
what makes the extreme to stand out here
is its clarity wise soundstage and
Istomin separation both the XP 41 and PK
7 sound a little muffled compared to the
extreme - but I feel the XP 41 still
sounds better than the PK 7 the vocals
on the P case have an or much more
pushback than on the X P 41 and a sound
stage is a little narrower and when it
comes to the bass the X before the one
still beats the PK 7 but sound quality
aside the PK 7 is also the quietest
speaker here when all three of these
speakers are playing at max volume and
playing the same section of the same
song the PK 7 struggles to get over the
hundred DB mark and this means this
speaker isn't good for the outdoors and
my Labor Day cookout people kept asking
if we could raise the volume on the PK 7
whereas the X P 41 is the latter speaker
here but there is a good amount of
distortion at max volume so the happy
medium here is the extreme - it gets
almost as loud as the xB 41 but it's
sound quality stays together at how our
volumes and keep in mind if you were to
use the extreme 2 with a wired
connection it's going to get a little
louder which is good now when it comes
to pairing these speakers to other
speakers LG is the most limited here you
can only pair this speaker up to one
other LG speaker whereas with both Sony
and JBL you can pair these speakers up
to 100 other speakers but like I've said
in the past you don't really need that
but if you do plan on carrying multiple
speakers together on a regular basis
then I highly advise you invest into
your JB hos ecosystem you literally just
press one button on each speaker and the
speakers will figure out the rest of
themselves
it just works it's not like Sony where
you have to do
we think perfectly and if you mess up
you're gonna have to start all over
again and finally let's adjust the light
features on the PK 7 and xB 41 hands
down the light feeds from the xB 41
looks much better than the life feature
on the PK 7 a light feature on the PK 7
just isn't as bright as the xB 41 it's
not as capable and it doesn't perform as
well in brightly lit environments the
lighting modes on the PK 7 is also very
limited compared to the xB 41 with the
xB 41 you can choose from a few
different lighting modes that will
better fit your mood personally I like
using to the most but with the xB 41 you
can also choose the feasible lab to
customise the light feature and even
though Sony's app always aren't the best
you can also go in and tweak the EQ
settings on the xB 41 so you can get a
little bit of performance out of it
so in conclusion like I said on the full
review I can't recommend the LG pk7
I feel LG saw the success of the sony
xba-40 and JBL extreme and decided to
combine them and made the PK 7 and they
somehow managed to fall short in every
category I feel that Sony XP 41 is a
good option if you just want a single
speaker and if it's on sale I would
absolutely jump on it but if you want
the better audio fidelity then the JBL
extreme 2 is the way to go and like I
said if you plan on pairing multiple
speakers together on a regular basis
then JBL connect plus is a huge added
benefit if you made it this far I guess
you enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
