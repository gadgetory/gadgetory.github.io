a retail store chances are you'll be
able to get the sony xba-4 less than the
much smaller JBL extreme and with the
recently leaked JBL boombox i wanted to
see how the sound on the JBL extreme
compared to the sony xba-1 and get an
idea of what to expect from the JBL
boombox when it finally releases don't
forget to Like comment and subscribe and
you can check out my sony XP 7 review
here after you doesn't want in this
video and there will be a sound
comparison at the end of this video as
well so stay tuned for that
for the most part the JBL extreme
retails for to $99.99 at most stores but
I've managed to find it for as low as
228 98 on Amazon when the Sony XP 7
first released it was selling for 3
$49.99
but since most of Sony's lineup is on
sale you can actually get it for 2 2844
directly from Amazon as well which is
straight-up amazing if you want to pick
either of these products up I'll have
links to the description below and I'll
keep them updated so you can get the
best deal possible ok so let's go over
form factor and speaker setup first
the Sony gtk XP 7 weighs in at a
whopping 26 and a half pounds or 12
kilos and is twenty five point five nine
inches tall by twelve point eight three
inches by thirteen point three nine
inches the JBL extreme on the other hand
weighs in at four point six six pounds
or two point 11 kilos and is 11 point
one four inches wide four point nine six
inches tall and has a death of four
point eight inches the sony xba-1 has
two six and 3/8 inch woofers and three
two inch tweeters the JBL Xtreme has two
two point four eight inches past
radiators on its side two 2.4 inch full
range speakers and two one point three
eight inch tweeters and according to
leaked specs the JBL boom box is said to
be 20 inches wide and 10 inches tall
just the main body and not including the
handle and weigh in at 11 pounds
basically it's going to be double the
size of the JBL extreme but still
slightly smaller than the XP 7 will
weigh half as much and rumors have it at
around $500 more
you can bet I'm gonna be making the JBL
boombox vs. Sony xb7 video like I said
the main focus for this video is
comparing the performance of these two
speakers I want to compare their sound
quality and loudness after downloading a
decibel reader app on my iPad I got to
get on some measurements and really
annoying my neighbors first I placed
both of these speakers outside and stood
ten feet away from them and 50% volume
with the JBL Xtreme I got an average
reading of 60 decibels at 75 percent
volume the JBL extreme was getting an
average reading of 77 decibels in a 100
percent volume the average reading was
at 81 decibels then I did the same thing
with the sony xba-1 at 50% volume the
average was at 77 decibels at 75 percent
volume the average was at 83 decibels
and at 100 percent volume the average
was at 93 decibels and when I did the
same test indoors the data set was very
similar to one another when it comes to
sound quality obviously the sony xba-1
is gonna have way more bass like you can
feel the bass push the inside of your
chest but when it comes to the mids and
highs the JBL extreme does a really good
job of keeping up in the sound quality
under JBL extreme has much more depth
while the sound under sony xba-4 forward
but I did notice the xp7 had much more
separation than the JBL extreme the
punchy bass on the xp7
is its own entity whereas with a extreme
if the bass really gets going it's gonna
motor the sound a bit but even though
the sony xba-1 can get much louder than
the JBL extreme when the xb7 is at 100%
volume there's a lot of distortion going
on and there's a lot of roll off from
the bass which models the overall sound
in most cases I feel it's unusable
I think the sony xba-1 sounds best when
it's at 75% volume which means it's
going to achieve the same loudness as
the JBL extreme at 100% volume with an
average decibel reading of 81 to 83
decibels and at 100% volume the JBL
extremes suffers from much less
Distortion even though the sony xba-1
completely Dwarfs the JBL extreme the
JBL extreme can still stand up to the
Sony XP
seven when it comes to pure sound
quality yeah obviously the Sony XP seven
gets louder but at those higher volumes
there's a lot of distortion it's not
usable for personal listening but if
you're having a pool party or a big guy
together it'll get the job done
but if you were to compare these two
speakers at the same decibel level the
sony xba-1 does have better instruments
separation and a whole lot of bass in a
good way but then you have to ask
yourself is the sheer size of the xb7
worth it compared to the JBL extreme
which is significantly smaller and has
less bass but still sounds pretty good
compared to the XP seven but does this
mean JBL is gunning for the sony xba-1
with their JBL boombox
well the JBL boombox be able to achieve
a loudness of around ninety three
decibels without suffering from so much
distortion like the sony xba-1 and will
the JBL boombox have more or less the
same amount of base if JBL can match
sony xb7 performance level in a slightly
smaller and lighter package i would be
very impressed and it's supposed to be
ipx7 certified as well whereas with the
XP seven you can't get it wet but would
you be willing to pay five hundred
dollars for a larger JBL extreme comment
down below and let me know okay so
here's a sound test both of these
speakers are playing in the same room at
the same distance away from the same
microphone streaming from the same
source and playing at the same decibel
level so hopefully the only independent
variable is sound quality comment down
below and tell me which one you prefer
