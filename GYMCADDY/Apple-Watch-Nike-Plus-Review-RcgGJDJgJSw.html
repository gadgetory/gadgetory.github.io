legitimate reason to release this
version the Apple watch series - six
weeks after the initial release date
well we're gonna find out right now the
Apple watch Nike Plus has all the same
features as the Apple watch series - it
has a built-in GPS which you can track
your runs without having to carry your
phone it's water resistant up to 50
meters and spits out water from its
speakers it has a dual-core processor
which makes it very fast and has a very
bright and beautiful screen you get all
of this for three hundred sixty nine
dollars for the 38 millimeter case or
$399 for the 42 millimeter case getting
inside the box is exactly the same like
the normal Apple watch
except it's black this time you'll
notice the design by Apple in California
phrase is now replaced with designed for
athletes by Apple and Nike inside the
sleeve you're going to find some
documentation a set-up guide in a small
wristband if the pre-installed one is
too big under the sleeve you'll find the
actual Apple watch itself and under that
you'll find a magnetic charging cradle
in a wall board on first inspection of
the watch you'll notice the star of the
show here is the black and volt
wristband it's made out of silicone like
the base Apple watch but it's perforated
all around for better air circulation
aside from looking like a black and
lime-green octopus tentacle the
wristband looks pretty cool there are a
few other color combinations to choose
from Apple site also if you look on the
back of the watch you'll notice this is
a Nike Plus logo the Apple watch Nike
Plus Edition does feature two exclusive
watch faces that you can customize but
don't worry you also get all the sander
ones as well just as you'd expect the
Apple watch Nike Plus can connect your
iPhone to show you notifications and do
certain functions and tasks right from
your wrist
it puts Siri right on your wrist you can
get things done faster if you're always
on the go there's a built-in heart rate
monitor that's fairly accurate and you
can take calls right from your wrist you
can even store up to two gigs of music
directly on it so you can listen to them
while you go for a run and like I
mentioned earlier it's water-resistant
so you can swim with it to just be ready
to charge this guy every night and even
sometimes twice a day if you're a power
user
the Apple watch Nike Plus Edition is
meant to be targeted towards runners and
should be used with the Nike Run Club
app the app itself is pretty basic you
get a feed where you can read advice on
how to be a better runner get motivated
and even get accurate playlist you'll
even see Nikes latest product release
leave a like if we should review the
Nike Air Max 2017
your runs are all logged under the
activity tab so you can track your
progress the app has a built-in coach
that can help you get
running help you become a better athlete
or even help you prep for an upcoming
race you just have to tell it how often
you can run how many miles are currently
running over the course of a week and
your height and weight
just like other competitors in this
space thankee has also included as a
social element to their running app
where you can share and compete with
friends one unique thing you can do with
the Apple watch Nike Plus Edition there
you can't deal with the Apple watch
series - it started run via Syria all
you have to do is say series started
form or run for example in a countdown
will start but really are these minor
changes enough to make you think that
Apple needed an extra six weeks to
release this product not really don't
get me wrong the Apple watch is great at
being a small watch but not so much to
dedicate a fitness tracker if you're a
young professional that constantly gets
emails calendar reminders phone calls
and text messages from work then the
Apple watch can certainly help and if
you're considering getting an Apple
watch for those reasons then you should
just go for the Nike Plus Edition
because they're the same price but they
come with the cool wristband you can
then get a professional leather
wristband for work and this way you get
two different styles from just one watch
but if you're looking for a dedicated
fitness tracker because you want to
monitor your health or track your runs
then you should look either into a
Garmin GPS watch or Fitbit Church -
although the Apple watch is a great
SmartWatch it still falls short as a
fitness tracker it even suffers from a
design flaw due to the digital crown
hermia if you decide to wear this watch
while you work out exercises that
require you to bend your wrist like
push-ups or barbell squats will cause
you to accidentally press down on the
crown and activate Siri if you listen to
music while you work out then activating
Siri and pausing your music mid-set will
drive you crazy
in conclusion the Apple watch is a
decent smart watch but this is not the
fitness tracker you're looking for well
if you made it this far and leave us a
like it really helps if you like videos
like this subscribe there's more to come
if you're looking for more product
