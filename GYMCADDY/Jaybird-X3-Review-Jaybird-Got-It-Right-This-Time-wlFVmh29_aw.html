expect from a pair of wireless earbuds
that retail for one $29.99 well that's
how much these guys cost this is Jim
Carrey's review on the all-new Jaybirds
x3 the Jaber learned their lesson
let's find out packaging is identical to
the more expensive zebra freedom you'll
first see the earphones front and center
under that you're going to find some
documentation and a carrying pouch
inside the carrying pouch you're gonna
find three sets of compliant your tips
three sets of silicon ear tips three
sets of redesigned your friends cable
management Clips charging cradle and
micro USB cable nothing out of the
ordinary here the irbaz themselves are
smaller than the previous version or
made out of plastic with the soft touch
feel to them the cans themselves are
angled down ever so slightly to help
with fit these earbuds are much larger
than the ones on the freedom but that's
perfectly fine the cable itself is flat
and also has a soft touch field coil
they like controlling the X threes it
looks similar to the ones on the freedom
but has been improved first off it's
lighter since it's made completely out
of plastic it has the same three buttons
on the front but they now have a
satisfying click to them and on the back
you're gonna find the contact pins used
for charging if the ear fins that come
included with the expertise are a little
different from the ones that come with
the freedom aside from the larger ring
needed to fit the larger earbuds
there are now contoured a little to help
get a better fit when inside the ball of
the ear just like we mentioned in our
freedom review you can spend hours
customizing exactly how these earphones
fit in your ears thanks for all that
your friends and your tips are given to
comply your tips are the way to go since
they help create a seal once inside your
ear canal for those who don't know
comply your tips are made of hydrophobic
memory foam material that helps keep the
ear buds in place and block out ambient
noise and if you're loud fan with the
complied tips you can always still use
the silicone tips that come included
these your flows are sweat and water
resistant as they should be you don't
have to worry about them falling apart
or getting crushed thanks to the
adorable build they have an eight hour
battery life and don't require an
external battery pack like the freedom
they also sound great and you can
customize how they sound through
Jaybirds nice sound app they still
require a proprietary charging cradle
but that's fine if it means you get a
smaller controller the jaybird X reads
don't suffer from the heavy inline
controller design flawed the freedoms
did since the control of this time
around is much lighter the writer but
doesn't fall out when you're running or
doing anything active so the batteries
are now housed in
earbuds themselves these earphones truly
have an eight hour battery life and
don't require an external battery pack
like the freedom's do these are big
pluses it is worth mentioning these
earphones don't have any fast charging
features like the power beats 3
personally the fast fuel feature found
on the power beats 3 is great because I
always forget to charge my earbuds we
also noticed there was some random
choppiness here and there when it came
to playing music on the Xperia's
in conclusion this JBOX 3 is an amazing
product for one $29.99
an eight hour battery life should get
you through a few gym sessions without a
problem the ladder in like controllers
and your ear fins mean that your buds
will stay in place the low profile
enough you can wear them with the helmet
beanie or hats overall you can't go
wrong with these guys and it's no one
that they're flying off shelves well if
you made it this far and leave us a like
it really helps if you like videos like
this subscribe there's more to come if
you're looking for more product reviews
