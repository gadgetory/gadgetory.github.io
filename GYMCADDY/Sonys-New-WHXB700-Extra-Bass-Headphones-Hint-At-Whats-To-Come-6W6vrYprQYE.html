Sony XB22 and XB32 portable bluetooth speakers…
And I also expect a Sony XB42 is also on the
way.
Cause over the last few days Sony has been
updating their companion apps for their Headphones
and Speakers to support unspecified newer
models.
But now Sony Asia has officially announced
their upcoming WH-XB700’s.
Now I’m going to tell you what the WH-XB700’s
are all about and also what it could mean
for upcoming yet to be announced products.
So like I’ve been saying for awhile now,
I love my Sony 1000XM3’s… but I think
its time for Sony to update and redesign their
H.ear On 2 and XB950N1 headphones cause they’re
just huge compared to newer headphones out
there.
And I think the Sony WH-XB700 are the beginning
of that.
Now first off the Sony WH-XB700’s are going
to be part of Sony’s Extra Bass Headphone
line up.
So they’re going to be for Bass Heads that
like a lot of bass in their music.
So you shouldn’t go comparing them directly
to the Sony WH-CH700N’s which are Sony’s
entry level Active Noise Canceling headphones.
Cause the Sony WH-XB700’s don’t have Active
Noise Cancelation.
They do how ever have an advertised battery
life of 30 hours, they charge via a USB C
port with fast charging rated at 10 minutes
gets you and Hour and a half but most importantly
they have a new more subtle low profile design
which is a huge plus over Sony’s other,
older Extra Bass Headphones.
The Sony WH-XB700’s are slated to be released
in Asia this month, and they should be released
in the states in April for around $175 or
$200.
But this is where the speculation begins.
Sony follows a pretty basic naming stature
when it comes to their consumer products.
Their most premium headphones are denoted
by having a 1000 in their name and as the
product moves down in price that number decrease.
So for example, the Sony WH-1000XM3’s are
Sony’s most premium ANC headphones retailing
for $350.
Then theres the Sony WH-H900N which are Sony’s
slightly more affordable ANC Headphones targeting
a younger crowed that retail for $300.
Then theres the WH-H800 which are an on ear
version of the previous headphones that retail
for $230… and then theres the Sony WH-CH700N
which retail for $200.
Hopefully you’re kind of seeing the pattern
here.
So its my guess that the Sony WH-XB700’s
are Sony’s new entry level Extra Bass headphones
and we could see a similar looking but improved
pair of Sony WH-XB900’s or WH-XB1000’s
to be the true successor of the current Sony
MDR-XB950N1’s extra bass headphones.
Personally I think WH-XB900 is more likely.
But I think we could see an asking price of
around $300 but with it see some major improvements
over the WH-XB700’s and the XB950N1’s.
Since the WH-XB700’s are a pair of on ear
headphones I would like to see Sony’s higher
end Extra Bass headphones to be over ear headphones
with more spacious ear cups than the current
XB950N1’s.
I also think the Sony WH-XB900’s would have
improved active noise cancellation over the
current XB950N1’s but not as good as the
1000XM3’s.
And in order to keep costs down, I think the
WH-XB900’s will have physical control buttons
instead of a touch pad like the 1000XM3’s.
And obviously I think USB C is a given but
think the WH-XB900 will have better fast charging
than whats found on the WH-XB700.
So to wrap everything up, the Sony WH-XB700’s
look like a cool pair of new budget friendly
Bass Head headphones that I will be reviewing.
And Sony did exactly what they needed to do.
They have great battery life, they have USB
C charging, but most importantly they look
much sleeker.
Cause you gotta have more courage than apple
to walk around with the XB950N1’s in public.
But I highly doubt these are the true successors
to the XB950N1’s so I wouldn’t go directly
comparing the two.
I think Sony has little extra something in
the pipe line… but this is a good start.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
