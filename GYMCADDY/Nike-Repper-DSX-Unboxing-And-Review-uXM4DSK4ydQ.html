three training shoes and after working
out done and reviewing them I found that
they were a great shoe for aerobic
workouts for the most part and now Nike
has released their mekin TSX rapper shoe
at a slightly more affordable price than
the mic on three so how do they stack up
let's find out the nike make on TSX
rapper is slightly more affordable than
the nike make on three they retail for
$100 compares to the Meccans $330 price
tag but just because they're less
expensive than the make on three it
doesn't mean they don't perform just as
well
the DSX rapper also currently comes in 4
colorways and no Nike I bet there are
more on the way I'll have links in the
description below if you want to pick
these up comment below and let me know
which colorways your favorite although
these are basically the Meccan threes
little brother I actually like these a
little more the nike nikon d sx rapper
shares an outsole that is very similar
to the nike mecca to the rubber is very
sticky and the tread pattern doesn't
allow for any slipping like the trackpad
on the mic on 3 do the outsole also
comes up the side of the shoe so they
can get a little bit more traction when
you rope climbing one big difference
between the Meccan 3 and the Meccan VSX
rapper
is the omission of the TPU heel clip on
the back that allow your feet to glide
on a wall if you're doing handstand
push-ups although the v sx wrapper has
grooves in the forefoot area of the shoe
they aren't nearly as flexible as the
Meccan 3 but when it comes to fit these
shoes are very true to size they fit
much better than make on 3 there's
absolutely no heels lipping and there's
no squeaking when you walk in them
2 major criticism to make on three and
make on to have right now
developer the shoe is made of a woven
material it's not like he's flying it so
it's not as stretchy but it's still very
breathable
there are overlays all around the shoe
to help with construction and durability
as well you will also find a nike
flywire system which has always really
helped with the compression when you
tighten your laces unfortunately nike
still insists on using this paper-thin
tongue that gives you zero padding so if
you really tighten your laces all you
get is a lot of pressure on the instep
of your foot but at least it doesn't
shift around when you're running or
walking in the deus ex wrapper the DSX
wrapper also has a lot of padding the
ankle area of the shoe and unlike the
make on 3 they actually give you lots of
ankle support like I mentioned earlier I
kind of like to make on the sx wrapper
more than the Nike makan three sure they
could use some upgrades like a more
breathable mesh upper and maybe bringing
back the TPU heel clip like imma make on
three but overall the Meccan TSX wrapper
is a much better rounded shoe than the
make on three it's always pad and in the
four runs and Sprint's but it's still
stirred
enough to feel stable when doing light
to mid weight squats an overhead press
share these shoes aren't the best for
Olympic list because of their soft sole
but they shine in a WOD which I think
these shoes are really intended for
overall I believe the make on DSX
wrapper is what the Meccan 3 should have
been a training shoe that performs
fairly well in almost every aspect of
training whereas the MEK on 3 really
favored on more aerobic self-training
the DSX wrapper does well when you run
or sprint and then does just as good
when you lift in them with moderate
weight like I've mentioned in the past
training or classic shoes really have a
tough job to do they have to be padded
and flexible enough for runs and
Sprint's but sturdy and stable enough to
do heavy lesson them and for the most
part training shoes are only okay at
both of these further Meccan bsx repre
is no exception to this but they still
do very well in conclusion the mccarthy
sx r effort is a very well rounded shoe
that performs right in the middle of the
training spectrum i don't even know if
that's a thing but they perform equally
well for one's lives and plyometric
training the woven mesh upper gives you
a lot of breathability and give you a
very secure fit there like an icon to
derived outsole gives you the traction
you need but has been slightly
redesigned for slightly more flexibility
if you're going to pick these up
you'll be fine going through the size
