attempt 10 active noise-cancelling
headphones and for the first try they
did well the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px sound
phenomenal it looked like something
franker the architect would have
designed but they do have their quirks
so the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px right for you
or about to find out don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe and you can
watch some of my other videos here after
you know what's in this video let's talk
money the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px retail for
$400 so they're slightly more expensive
than the Sony 1000 XM 2 and the bose
qc25 2 well you have two colorways to
choose from space gray and soft gold and
i have to say they both look great if
you want to pick these headphones up
I'll have links or description below and
I'll keep them updated so you can get
the best deal possible unboxing the
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px is very similar to
unboxing an Apple product you slide the
lid off in front and center or the
headphones underneath you'll find a
diamond weave carrying pouch that looks
just as good as the headphones
themselves but if you plan on traveling
a lot with these headphones I would
invest in a hard shell carrying case
inside the carrying pouch you'll find
some documentation an audio cable and a
USB type-c cable and speaking of USB
type-c the BMW px or one of the first
headphones to actually use the new port
instead of a micro USB port like Sony
Bose and beat stood on their newest
headphones and they should have known
better next to the USB type-c port
you'll find a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack a little further up you'll also
find the power button that you selected
turn the headphones on or off and if you
press and hold it you'll put the
headphones into pairing mode and above
that is your noise cancellation button
and you'll also find the larger
independent volume up and volume down
lines and in the center is the
multi-purpose button to control your
music playback single press to play or
pause double press the skipper track
triple press to go back a track and
press and hold to activate Siri although
they are very raised and have great
tactile feedback they can be hard to
tell apart at times personally I would
have preferred if they were textured as
well the overall design and build
quality of the bow and welkins px is
just superb by far these are my favorite
looking headphones they look very
elegant and people have stopped me to
ask me what headphones these were you've
got a stainless steel body type
ballistic nylon around the ear cups and
headband and a braided cable running
down the sides of the headphones there a
pair of very sturdy and well built
headphones the ear cups pivot and swivel
very gracefully and
headphones can be laid flat but
unfortunately they do not fold up
regarding the leather around the ear
cups in headband when I first got them
it felt very cheap and plasticky but
after a few days the leather did get
softer and smoother but your peasants
elves are magnetically attached oh
they're super easy to remove and clean
and they're just as easy to put back on
they literally just snap back into place
regarding comfort these headphones are
not for everybody especially for people
with big heads like me right out of the
box these headphones do have a lot of
clamping force almost a little more than
the Beats Studio threes but after
wearing them for a while they do break
in but even though depending on these
headphones is plush there isn't enough
of it so after a while of wearing them I
do have some discomfort in the jaw area
but that's just me if you have a smaller
head you're probably gonna be just fine
then your curves themselves are very
similar to the bose qc25 twos they do a
very good job of encasing your ears and
having very little surface area in
contact with your head when you have
them on the padding also doesn't rest on
any portion of your ear like the Sony
1000x and twos or B Studio 3s do and
overheating isn't a problem now let's
talk about tech specs these headphones
are using Bluetooth 4.1 and can be
connected to two devices at the same
time which is good but since B&amp;amp;W decided
to use USB type-c on their headphones i
think i would have been cool as well if
they decided to use bluetooth 5.0
instead but anyway they're good for
about 40 feet of range but unfortunately
for Android users these headphones don't
have NFC but they do have a PTX HD audio
which I feel is more important since
Google just announced fast pairing and
these headphones also connect to an app
which I'll go into in a minute
while testing these headphones I did
notice there was about a half second
latency when watching YouTube videos
with them so lips weren't perfectly in
sync but it wasn't anything too bad when
you powered these headphones up and they
connect to your device don't put a time
but unfortunately there are no voice
prompts or times to tell you when noise
cancellation is turned on or off
regarding battery life it's pretty
average with noise cancellation turned
on I've averaged about 24 hours with
noise cancellation turned off I've
averaged about 30 hours and
unfortunately these headphones cannot be
used passively so even if you want to
use them with a wired connection they
still need to be powered on and
unfortunately there's no official quick
charge so basically don't get caught
these headphones with the service and
battery the PX also features Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins our own noise cancellation
technology and it's okay it's very good
at blocking now constant low-frequency
sounds like AC units fans or road noise
while you're on the bus but everything
else still manages to get in even when
the noise cancellation is set to the
highest level but when you're playing
music you're still in your own little
world
but these headphones do have a very
little cabin pressure and no hissing
which is good for people who might want
to use them without playing music and in
my testing these headphones picked up
almost no wind noise even while I was
out on the George Washington Bridge
getting b-roll these headphones picked
up no wind noise which is amazing
because for comparison the bose qc25 s
are very sensitive to wind noise now
when it comes to sound quality dads wear
these headphones shine first off they do
require a breaking period but afterwards
they do live up to the height that were
very even sound signature which is what
audiophiles for her they have deep bass
very well defined mids and the highs are
very crisp and there's no noticeable
sign distortion at higher volumes a few
these headphones are best suited for
jazz R&amp;amp;B or pop or easy listening in
general but not so much for rap or EDM
even though they do have a lot of bass
you can't really feel the music like you
would with the 1000 X and twos or the
studio threes but nonetheless they do
sound really good and when the low winds
kick in combined with the encase ear
cups my ears are constantly picking up
when I listen to music with these but
these headphones do sound very different
with noise cancellation turn on or off I
try to listen to these headphones with
noise cancellation turned off as much as
I can even though these headphones still
sound really good with noise
cancellation turn on you will notice
their soundstage isn't as wide in the
lows aren't as deep if you're an
audiophile you'll notice but if you're
casual user you probably won't care the
Bowers and Wilkins px also feature where
since technology which were proximity
sensor is right in the center of each
ear cup the idea is that when you put
the headphones on they'll automatically
power on and start playing music when
you take them off and place them on your
desk or around your neck they'll
automatically go into low-power state
and if you're listening to music and you
take one of
here cups off to listen to someone
talking to you they'll automatically
pause your music and will only resume
playing once the ear cups are back on
your ears even though this is very cool
and as when I suggested to be studio
three should have had it's not perfect
sometimes if you just want to adjust the
headphones they will pause and play your
music there are some instances where the
headphones will randomly start playing
and pausing your music even though you
clearly have them on and even sometimes
in the middle of these instances they'll
go into their low-power mode even though
you have them on and even if I adjusted
the sensitivity of the where sensors in
the app I would still run into the same
problems so I just ended up using these
headphones with the wear sense turned
off but maybe it could just be me maybe
my ears are too small hopefully this
isn't a hardware issue and maybe Bowers
and Wilkins can fix this with the
software update in the future like I
mentioned earlier these headphones also
have their own app and the app is pretty
basic you can see your current battery
status toggle where sends on or off and
choose from various noise cancellation
settings just like the Sony 1000 XM to
the PX allow you to specify how much
ambient sound you would like to let in
and you can set your own default for
each setting but unfortunately there is
no equalizer in the app itself even
though these headphones do sound great
it would have been nice to at least have
the option okay and choose the mic test
personally I don't think it sounds
amazing it sounds very tinny and the mic
likes to get blown out a lot especially
if you talk very loudly but again this
audio clip is being recorded by the
microphone on the bottom of this px so
you could be the desert that overall I
feel the Bowers and Wilkins px or the
Aston Martin of headphones they're
beautifully designed and great at some
things but they do have their quirks
they look amazing and they're all about
sound noise cancellation is good and
there's no cabin pressure or hissing but
they're not number one the wear sensor
is cool when it works but hopefully
it'll get better with a software update
remember these aren't the best for
people with bigger heads but if noise
cancellation isn't your number-one
priority and you just want something
that sounds really good and looks unique
you can't go wrong with the Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins px for their first try they did
very well but for the px twos I would
like to see some more petting on the ear
cups and headband less cramping force
textured volley buttons voice prompts
and an equalizer built into the app
maybe improve the battery life and quick
charging wouldn't hurt either hey if you
