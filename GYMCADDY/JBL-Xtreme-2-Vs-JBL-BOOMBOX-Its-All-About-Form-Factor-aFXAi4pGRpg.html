the JBL extreme tomb when for not that
much more you can just get the JBL
boombox and to that I say it's kind of
like choosing between the iPhone 8 or
the iPhone 8 plus galaxy s 9 or the
galaxy s 9 plus sure there are some
improvements when going with the plus
model but when it comes to preference or
needs form-factor can play a big role
when choosing between these two speakers
here the main differences between the
JBL extreme 2 and JBL boombox let's see
which one's right for you just so we're
clear this isn't a full review on the
either of these speakers I'm just trying
to point out the most important
differences between them so I can help
you with your purchase decision if you
want to learn more about either these
speakers then watch the full reviews the
JBL extreme 2 is the newest of the two
speakers here and currently retails for
$300 the JBL boom box was released in
the fall of 2017 and retails for $450
but it routinely goes around sale for
about $380 if you want to pick either of
these speakers up I'll have like sort of
scripts in below and if you use the
links it really helps out to channel I
suggest you check them out because you
never know when these speakers might go
on sale or you make a lucky design wise
the boom box is just a plus size extreme
2 they share the same basic shape they
both have fabric mesh covered bodies
they both have control buttons up top
they both have USB output so you can
charge your own devices they both charge
via an AC port and they are both ipx7
rated so they're both waterproof and
they both float but obviously since the
boombox is bigger than the extreme 2
it's also heavier the extreme 2 weighs
in at 5.3 pounds whereas the boombox
weighs in at 11.6 pounds even though the
boombox is marketed as being this ultra
portable in rugged plus size speaker
every time I've taken the boombox with
me somewhere like the park or a friend's
house I've always thought this as a
bigger hassle than it needs to be the
built-in carrying handle on the boombox
is nice but due to its weight in size
you're just going to be switching the
boombox from one hand to the other and
this can get very annoying if you have a
long walk ahead of you or if you have
other stuff to bring along like a cooler
chairs or a tent if you put a boombox or
an extreme 2 in front of me and say pick
one to take to the park
always going to go with the extreme to
because if it's lower weight and
carrying strap and believe me do not
underestimate how handy the carrying
strap is you can just swing the extreme
to over your shoulder and get going and
like I've said in the past I feel the
boombox should have had a removable
carrying strap as well and plus the cash
strapped and the extreme tool also has
the added bonus of a built in bottle
opener now I'm not saying you can't take
the boombox with you anywhere but if I
have the option I'm gonna go with the
extreme - every time but the boombox is
bigger size means you literally get a
battery that's double the size of what's
inside the extreme - the JBL boombox is
rockin a twenty thousand milliamp hour
battery whereas to JBL extreme - is
packin a 10,000 milliamp hour battery
and like I mentioned earlier they both
charge via
AC ports but the extreme twos power
break is slightly smaller than the
boomboxes both of these speakers have
multi-day battery life is depending on
how you use them JBL advertises a 24
hour battery life from the boombox and a
15 hour battery life on the extreme -
and in my testing with the volume set at
50 percent the boombox average 22 hours
playback time all set to indoors mode
and the extreme to an average 16 and a
half hours of playback time and with the
volume set at 80 percent the boombox
average 14 hours playback time in the
extreme to average 10 hours of playback
time it's not bad for either one now
let's talk about speaker setups because
they aren't that different they're just
bigger the extreme tool has dual 70
millimeter diameter woofers dual 20
millimeter diameter tweeters and do all
the 85 millimeter diameter passive
radiators on each side the boombox on
the other hand has larger 101 millimeter
diameter woofers the same 20 millimeter
diameter tweeters and larger 130
millimeter diameter passive radiators on
each side now before we get into the
sound test
just know that the boom box is going to
be switching between indoor and outdoor
mode
please
let me you're not in this century to
wake me up this your testicles
my
both the extreme - and boombox share the
same sound signature but the boombox is
set to indoors mode they both have a
flat sound signature with just the right
amount of bass in trouble which should
keep most people happy they both don't
suffer from any distortion and they both
sound pretty clear which is good but due
to the boom boxes its sheer size it has
much more thunderous bass because its
passive radiators are able to push
around much more air and as a result you
can sometimes feel the bass in your
chest which is something to smaller
extreme - just can't do when it comes to
max volume both of these speakers get
pretty loud but again not obviously due
to the boom boxes size it also manages
to get louder than the extreme - the
boom box is rated as a 60 watt speaker
wall plugged in and 40 watts while used
with just its battery whereas the
extreme - is rated as 40 watts when
plugged in and 20 watts when used with
justice battery and even though the
boombox can already easily get louder
than the extreme to a max volume it can
still get a little louder if you switch
it into outdoors mode and what outdoors
mode does on the boombox is that it
lowers the bass and puts an emphasis on
the mids in trouble so the boombox
sounds louder and so that the sound
travels a little further and again this
is ideal for when you're outdoors and
like I said in the full review I would
have liked the JBL included and an
outdoors mode button on the extreme shoe
as well but no matter which of these two
speakers you pick they both have JBL
connect plus and like I've said in the
past
JBL connect plus is the easiest and best
way to pair multiple speakers here there
you literally just press one button on
each speaker and the speaker's will
figure out the rest by themselves you
don't have to mess around with any
Bluetooth settings and you don't have to
mess around with any other apps it just
works
like all these speakers here right now
they're ready to rock and roll and I
feel that having multiple small speakers
paired together at the park at the beach
or at a get-together with friends is
more useful than having one big speaker
like the JBL boom box playing in the
corner if you have an extreme - paired
up to a few other smaller speakers then
you'll be able to cover a larger area
with your music without having to blast
the volume
with all that being said I feel that the
JBL boombox is a great speaker if you
plan on keeping it at home most at a
time and only plan on occasionally
taking it somewhere with you don't get
me wrong it's portable but it can be a
pain in the neck sometimes literally but
if you plan on taking either of these
speakers with you on the go on a regular
basis I feel you are much better off
with the JBL extreme 2 because if it's
smaller size and the convenience of the
carrying strap and you'll also have to
take the boom boxes size into
consideration if you're like me I just
don't have room for it in my room and
that's why the boombox lives in the
studio again it all comes down to form
factor and what your needs are but no
matter which of these speakers you pick
I feel that pairing either one up with a
pulse 3 is a great combo you get great
sound a paired with a very good-looking
light feature if you made it this far I
guess you enjoyed the video so hit that
like button and get subscribed it helps
