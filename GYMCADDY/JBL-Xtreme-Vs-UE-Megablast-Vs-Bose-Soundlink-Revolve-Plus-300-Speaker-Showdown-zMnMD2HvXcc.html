big-name speaker on the market right now
and what makes this speaker so special
is Alexa integration and its 360-degree
sound but I thought it'd be a good idea
to compare to another popular 360-degree
speaker the Bose Soundlink revolve Plus
and the extremely popular JBL Xtreme
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and you can watch some of the
videos here after you're done watching
this video now remember this isn't a
full review on either of these speakers
I'm just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with your purchase decision
one of the main reasons I want to
compare these three speakers is because
of price they all retail for $300 but
they're all drastically different from
one another the UE mega blast is the
most advanced the Bose Soundlink overall
plus is the most elegant and the JBL
extreme is the most versatile and you
can actually get the JBL extreme for as
low as 212 dollars on amazon right now
if you want to pick either of these
speakers up I'll have links to
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best view
possible first up let's go over design
the bose sound of evolved plus is the
smallest and most elegant speaker in
this lineup the majority of the body is
made up of metals of milled holes and
our soft touch rubber end caps on both
the top and bottom there's also a
carrying handle which makes taking the
speaker with you on the go super easy
this speaker screams classy the JBL
extreme and nuit mega blast are pretty
similar they both have nylon weave
bodies and soft touch plastic end caps
but the JBL extreme is the largest
speaker in this lineup and has exposed
passive radiators on each side and you
can also either lay it flat or stand it
on its side and if you plan on taking
the speaker with you somewhere you can
easily attach a shoulder strap to it
whereas the UE mega blast doesn't have
any kind of handle on it so carrying it
around can get a little awkward at times
you can also only stand it up straight
but it is a good-looking speaker
nonetheless I just find it a little
funny if you're going to charge the mega
blast you essentially have to stand it
upside down now I want to talk about
ports and buttons because I think it's
super important for a $300 speaker the
Bose Soundlink revolve plus has a full
set of very tactile buttons on the top
of the speaker you can manually control
the music playback adjust your volume so
it's from three audio sources aux jack
micro USB or bluetooth and if you press
and hold the multi-purpose button you
can activate your voice assistant of
choice and on the back you'll find you
my curiosity port for charging and
check if you want to use a wired
connection the JBL Xtreme has two USB
ports on the back so you can charge your
own devices also as an ox Jack and uses
an AC in port for charging and on top
you also have a full set of buttons to
control your music playback and activate
your voices system whereas the UE mega
blasts has gotten rid of its odds Jack
and you can't use the microUSB port as a
wired connection like the Bose and as a
result you can only use a bluetooth
connection on the mega blast which
wouldn't have been as big as a problem
if it at least had a PTX HD audio the UE
mega blaster also only has a volume up
and volume down button on the front and
a power button and Bluetooth button on
the top if you want to control your
music playback on the mega blast without
using your phone you have to do it by
telling Alexa but like I said on my
English review the Alexa voice commands
will only work if you're using a
supported streaming service and if the
speaker itself is connected to Wi-Fi so
if the mega blast isn't connected to
Wi-Fi or if you're streaming music from
an unsupported streaming service or a
different source then the Alexa voice
command so won't work and you can only
control your music playback directly
from your phone and I just feel the mega
blast is over reliance on Alexa if
you're not using it under the ideal
conditions or using one of the supported
streaming services then not having a
physical play pause button is very
annoying there just sometimes your being
able to pause your skip a track directly
from your speaker is the easiest method
and I don't understand what you eat took
away the tap functionality that the mega
boom had because I'm the mega boom if
you tapped once it would pause the track
and if you double tap it would skip a
track you ease mega blast over reliance
on Alexa only makes it suitable for
people who are heavily invested in the
Amazon ecosystem Alexa what's the
weather like in New York City today you
can look for mostly sunny weather with a
high of 38 degrees and a low of 24
degrees when it comes to connectivity
the UE mega blaster also drops the ball
it can only be connected to one device
at a time whereas both the bose and JBL
can be connected to two devices at a
time so searching from one device to
another is super easy and convenient but
when it comes to recognize two UE mega
blasts is the toughest of the group the
mega blast carries an ip67 rating which
means it's both water and dust proof
whereas the bose soundlink revolve plus
is only ipx4 certified which means it
can get a little wet and you shouldn't
drop it in water
and the JBL extreme is just a
water-resistant so again a little water
won't harm it but still don't submerge
it or let it get too wet when it comes
to battery life all three of these
speakers are pretty neck-and-neck both
the Bose and mega blast advertise a
battery life of 16 hours and the JBL
Xtreme advertises a bad life of 15 hours
but when it comes to real-world
performance the UE mega blast averages
about 10 hours so playback time even
with Alexa turned off whereas the Bose
Soundlink revolve plus averages 13 hours
of playback time at a moderate volume
and the JBL extreme / performs with an
average battery life of 16 hours now
when it comes to cell quality all three
of these speakers sound very different
now remember the UE mega blast and Bose
Soundlink revolve + or both 360 degrees
speakers and the JBL extreme only stood
out sound out the front
now like I said on my initial review the
Yui megablast has a good amount of base
but it also has some pretty we close and
mids and ear-piercing highs
whereas the bose has much more taint
highs how much money even sound
signature and has some better performing
lows but not as much thumping bass but
the bose really likes to push the mids
and vocals forward but some people like
another stone the highs on the JBL are a
little bit more present than on the bose
but they're not as harsh as the mega
blasts or in JBL fashion the extreme
does have a lot of trouble the mids and
polkas aren't as emphasized like they
are on the bose but I do feel the lows
under extreme or almost as good as the
Bose and I do feel the extreme has
almost as much space as the megabus
essentially the extreme is kind of like
a compromise between these two speakers
in a max volume all three of these
speakers get just as loud they all hover
around the low to mid eighties decibel
range but IMAX volume I feel the Bose
Soundlink revolve plus is the best
sounding in this group because that max
volume the UE mech blast has a lot of
roll-off from the base and the highs
constantly pierce your ears
and with the JBL extreme it's at max
volume it's really just pushing out a
whole bunch of trouble and there's one
more thing I want to point out about
each of these speakers and that's
pairing them to other speakers for
starters if you already have other UE
speakers and you were planning on
pairing the mega blast to them you can't
you can't even pair the mega blast to a
smaller brother the UE blast as of right
now which is just mind-boggling these
days it's a pretty standard feature if
you plan on getting the JBL extreme it
can only pair to all the JBL speakers
using JBL connect and nat JBL connect
plus so the JBL extreme can't spare two
newer JBL speakers like the JBL flip for
JBL pull 3jb old boom box for any future
JBL speakers that might get announced at
CES 2018 but the boss our evolve plus
can pair to most current bose speakers
so in conclusion I feel that UE mega
blast falls short in a few key areas
first off if you aren't heavily invested
in the Amazon ecosystem then the mega
blast won't work to its fullest capacity
the lack of basic functions like pairing
it to other speakers not having the
option of using a wired connection and
not having a manual way to control your
music playback is a major inconvenience
it comes to sound quality the megablast
is the worst sounding speaker in this
group like I said on my initial review
the mega blast over reliance on Alexa is
more of a handicap than anything else
the boats Islands revolve Plus is a
great option if you want something
elegant and if you want something for
easy listening I don't really have any
complaints about the Roffe plus it's a
great at-home speaker but I'm still a
really big fan of the JBL Xtreme it's a
very versatile speaker that looks good
at home if you're gonna take it with you
somewhere the shoulder strap really
comes in handy
the sound quality could use some
improvements but the extreme is still a
great option even after being on the
market for more than two years now if
you decide to get the JBL extreme it's
an all-around good speaker but I am
willing to bet there might be a JBL
extreme to announce at CES 2018 hey if
