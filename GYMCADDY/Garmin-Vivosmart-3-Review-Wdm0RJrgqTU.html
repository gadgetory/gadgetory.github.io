except for a few things like death taxes
Marvel superhero movies cliche intros
and smartwatches / fitness trackers and
the majority of these fitness trackers
are coming from Garmin and today we've
got the vivosmart 3 for review we're
going to find out what's new is a good
the bad and should you shell out the
cash for the garmin vivosmart 3 the
vivosmart 3 currently comes in two color
white black or plum looking purple it's
also very competitively priced at one
thirty nine ninety nine which is ten
dollars cheaper than the Fitbit charge -
or Fitbit Alta EHR I'll have a charge
two versus vivos from our three video up
shortly after this video so keep an eye
out for that one if you do decide to
pick this Garmin up just make sure you
get the right size for you if you want
to pick the peopleÂ´s for three up I'll
have links in the description below okay
so let's get this thing out of the box
Garmin has never really been good and
delivering of the unboxing experience
like Fitbit does and Olivos smart 3 is
no exception
inside you'll find the fitness tracker
our predator style charging cradle a
user manual and a tab instructing you to
download garments connect that on your
phone now I'll get into the app store
Lea but for now let's a look at the
hardware the garmin vivosmart 3 is a
well-put-together fitness tracker for
its price it's not as premium looking or
feeling like let's say the Fitbit Alta
HR instead the people score 3 is made
mostly out of silicone and has a very
minimalist design when the screen is off
it basically looks like you're wearing a
black dress pants when you double tap
the screen or raise your arm the OL LED
screen turns on honestly I'm a fan of
the LED screen it's bright and very easy
to read in direct sunlight I'll select a
resolution and give them the screen you
get slightly more detailed than other
screens found and other fitness trackers
one problem I do have with the screen
though is that it looks foggy for some
reason I don't know if it's because the
silicone layer over the screen or what
photo really takes away from the overall
experience
The Spinners factor has a five-day
battery life but if you're a power user
or you work out a lot you should get
around 3 or 4 days and this fitness
tracker connects via bluetooth and has a
range of 30 feet but overall the garmin
vivosmart 3 is a very compact and
lightweight fitness tracker it's
slightly smaller than the Fitbit charge
2 but manages to squeeze in a screen
that is able to show you a little bit
more information just keep in mind you
can't swap out dance so you stuff with
whatever you get which means if you work
in an office it'll stick out if you ask
me
garlis we're gonna show you the
government people's 1/3 does all the
things you'd expect the basics the
instructors should do these days it
tracks your steps distance walks floors
climb calories burn intensity minutes
and track your sleep so you can get a
better understanding the sleep quality
and with move like you it'll
automatically detect exercises and lock
them for you in the Garmin Connect that
this tracker also has a heart rate
monitor on the back which is also very
low profile but the garmin vivosmart 3
does have a few other tricks up its
sleeve first up is waterproof so you can
swim with it and it'll track your laps
which not all fitness trackers in this
price range or what this feature set can
do for example the alta HR or charge to
Gorman also claims the vivosmart 3 can
track your stress levels and display to
you on both the tracker and in the
Garmin Connect app is it something I
really need to know not really and
seeing my stress level climb above 80 on
my VMs my 3 on a regular basis does
nothing more than just stress me out
even more the Revo Zoomer 3 also has
guided breathing sessions like the
Fitbit charge 2 but again I feel like
it's another game it's not something I
look for in a fitness track one really
cool feature I do like on this fitness
tracker is the new rep counting
capability it's not 100% accurate and
doesn't work if you're using like
exercise machines like the leg prize leg
extension like curls and so on but if
you're somebody that does a lot of
full-body circuit training or CrossFit
then this feature can be pretty handy
you might have to go into the app and
make some Corrections but the concept is
there just keep in mind core exercises
and pull-ups don't get along too well
beaver this feature is more suited
towards full body or upper body boom the
government vivosmart 3 also has a few
features baked into it for starters you
can see the weather your smartphone
notifications and petroleum music
playback you also get a stopwatch
ever timer built-in so if you don't want
to take your phone out you have options
but I think my favorite feature is to
find my phone feature right from your
vivosmart 3 you can play a ringtone on
the phone so you can find it which is
great for me because I'm always losing
everything although the hardware does
have its pros like I said in the past
when buying fitness tracker you're not
just buying the hardware you're also
buying into the software and here Garmin
Connect is to Windows and sip its app is
to happen where fitbit's app is very
easy to use and has everything laid out
you in a very elegant manner garments
connect that can be a little harder to
navigate at times but those give you a
much more in-depth breakdown of your
workout especially if you're a runner
the garments AB will show you stats like
distance wasps complete quality weight
loss progress and will quantify your
heart rate readings and stuffable
measurements just to name a like I said
if you're a runner the Apple map out
your run and show you information
without in timing running dynamics
elevation temperature paced cadence
vertical oscillation and ground contact
I'm just a heads up for anyone
considering giving the Bevo's my three
to an older non tech savvy relatives be
ready to constantly want them through
this app because I'm still trying to
figure it out I just personally think
the user interface have some room for
improvements and I would like to see a
better summary page that shows you your
daily stats likes if it does so what I
recommend the vivosmart 3 if you need
something waterproof because you swim a
lot and you want something with the
hardware monitor built in or if you're
already used to using on the fitness
trackers and you haven't upgraded in the
one or if you're really into running
then yeah this one's for you just keep
in mind there is no built-in GPS on the
vivosmart 3 there probably setting that
for the first model later if you're
looking into your first wearable and
you're just getting into finish or you
want something really simple to you to
ever recommend you look into Fitbit
offerings like the charge 2 or Fitbit
Alta HR I'll have links to their reviews
