really heating up some us so Microsoft
jumped in with their new surface
headphones Jabra announced their new
elite 85 ATS at CES 2019 and most
recently it's even rumored that so knows
he's working on a pair of premium ANSI
headphones but as of right now I think
the Sony 1000x and threes are currently
the best agency headphones on the market
right now but I know dropping $350 on a
pair of anc headphones is a lot for some
people so today we're gonna be comparing
my top 3 favorite sub $200 anc
headphones as of q1 2019 we have the
Sony watch 700 on the sennheiser 4.50
BTN CS and the audio technica as our 50
BTS or as I call them the surfaces now I
like and have no problem recommending
either of these headphones but they all
have their own pros and cons but I think
this video is going to be pretty
interesting because instead of me
crapping on one pair of specific
headphones we're gonna be comparing
contrasting three pairs of headphones
that I genuinely like for different
reasons before I started using noir VPN
I would never use public Wi-Fi because I
didn't want to risk having my data
exposed which meant any time I traveled
or wasn't a dead zone in the city I
would have a little to no internet on my
phone but now with no one VPNs
military-grade encryption I can use
public Wi-Fi and know that my dad it is
safe from would be hackers Nord VPN can
do a lot more but this is one of the
main reasons I use them so you can enjoy
three years of online security for only
$2.99 a month by clicking on the link in
description down below like I said these
are my top three favorite sub 200 all
our ANC headphones the Sennheiser 4.50
BTN C's have a retail price of one
$79.99 whereas both the Sony watch 700
in audio technica 88's are 50 BTS
however retail price of one $99.99 if
you want to pick either of these
headphones up I'll have them description
down below and I suggest you check them
out because you never know when they
might go on sale so you might get lucky
ok first let's get the simple stuff out
the way here and that's the included
accessories and ports the audio technica
the surf fifties come
with a faux leather carrying pouch that
I think looks a little classy whereas
the Sunrisers come included with a
polyester soft shell carrying case which
I'm not a big fan of but at least they
come with something because
unfortunately the Sony watch a 700 n
don't even come included with a carrying
pouch or case but still if you plan on
traveling with either these headphones I
highly recommend you invest on a hard
shell carrying case cable wise all of
these headphones come included with a
micro USB cable for charging even though
it's 2019 if you want USB C charging on
your headphones you're gonna have to
spring for more expensive headphones
like the 1000x m3s or surface headphones
cuz USB C still hasn't made its way down
to cheaper headphones just yet and both
deserve fifties and watch s 700 N come
included with a decent 3.5 to 3.5
millimeter audio cable but just a heads
up the Sennheiser uses a 2.5 millimeter
audio jack instead but now let's talk
about build quality because it's one of
the main reasons I like the Sennheiser's
and surf 50 so much and it's one of the
Sony watch s and 100s of weak points
Sony has done a great job of packing in
a lot of features into the watch s 700
but I guess they had to compromise on
build quality when you flex the headband
there's a good amount of cracking and
squeaking it's not overly excessive like
some other sub 200 all the headphones
I've tested but I would definitely take
it easy with these headphones I mean
they're not gonna fall apart on you but
their build quality pales in comparison
to about the Sennheiser's and surf
fifties when you flex the headband or
extend the headband on the surf 50s
there are almost silent tolerances on
the body panels are very tight and if
you squint they even resemble the 1000x
in threes but we'll make some sort of
fifties special is that they can either
be lay down flat or fold up whereas the
Sony's can only be lay down flat and the
sign hyzers can only be folded up but I
think the best build quality award here
goes to the Sunrisers just like the sort
of fifties if you flex the headband it's
basically silent and all the body panels
are exactly where they need to be but
what makes the Sunrisers stand out here
is that dirt built like a tank if you're
looking for a pair of headphones that
you can throw around and not worry about
and the
Hauser's all the way to go but when it
comes to fit the Sunrisers are
objectively the least comfortable
headphones here now all three of these
headphones are bighead approved but both
the Sennheiser's and Sony's have a snug
fit they're not uncomfortable but you'll
never forget they're there but the main
reason the Sennheiser's are the least
comfortable headphones here is because
if their ear cups they're little cramped
compared to the other ear cups here and
they're only suitable for people with
smaller flushed ears whereas the Sony's
have the most spacious Jakob serum there
are actually more spacious than the ear
cups on the 1000x m3 but the most
comfortable word here has to go to the
50s the ear cups on the surf 50s or
almost as spacious as the ear cups on
the watch a 700 n but the main reason to
serve 50s are the most comfortable
headphones here is cuz they have a
little clamping force like the Sony
1000x m3 and bose qc25 and since the
surf 50s have a little clamping force
Dirk great for a long use sessions and
unlike the other headphones here you'll
forget you even have them on now when it
comes to battery life both the
Sennheiser's and surf 50 is performed
relatively the same the Sun Heiser's
have an advertised bed length of 25
hours and the surf fifties have an
advertisement life of 28 hours overall I
found that they're both good for about a
week and a half in between charges for
the way that I use them but the Sony
Watch 700 and haven't advertised bad
life of 35 hours which is way above
average and these are good for about two
weeks in between charges and when it
comes to Bluetooth connectivity all of
these headphones have stable connections
that don't cut out as they should but
unfortunately all these headphones can
only be connected to one device at a
time so you can't hot-swap from one
device to another as seamlessly as the
air pods the surface headphones or the
bose qc25
and it's my hope that in 2019 newer
headphones will have multi device
connectivity support because it's kind
of ridiculous that is 2019 and it's
still not a standard feature I also want
to point out that the watch a 700
islands do have a bit of latency when
watching youtube videos on an iphone
whereas the other two headphones don't
but that latency
goes away it does goes away but that
latency does go away if you're going to
watch Netflix on an iPhone but if you
use these headphones with an Android
device then they don't suffer from any
latency issues now regarding active
noise cancellation on all of these
headphones I just want to set
expectations first no matter what
anybody else tells you for right now
the active noise cancellation on sub
$200 a and C headphones is going to be
nowhere near as good as the active noise
cancellation found on more premium ANC
headphones and just so you can see for
yourself we're going to jump into an ANC
test noise reduction
[Laughter]
noise reduction
so like I said the active noise
cancellation on the sub $200 headphones
is nowhere near as effective as the ANC
on the 1000 xm3 and that's perfectly
fine but there are other metrics to
consider when judging the ANC on any
pair of headphones for starters all of
these headphones have very little cabin
pressure when ANC is turned on which is
good to see because some other
headphones out there might cause some
discomfort on your eardrums which on C
is just annoying and these headphones
also have very little hissing with ANC
turned on which is a common issue with
other headphones with crappy A&amp;amp;C so
overall even though these headphones
don't block out as much noise as more
premium headphones their ANC can be
useful to block out some constant
low-frequency sounds like road noise and
if you're in an already quiet place like
an office or a library they can block
out the constant rumbling of an AC unit
or a little bit of chatter and they do
so without causing any added discomfort
which is the most important thing to
keep in mind now when it comes to sound
quality and all of these headphones
perform well in the sense that their
base never bottoms out they have good
clarity and the highs never get tinny
you see with some other ANC headphones
out there if you use them with their anc
turned on their soundstage gets narrowed
and orang their bass starts to bottom
out more frequently when the bass really
gets going but in general if you want to
get the best sound quality out of your
agency headphones it's best to use them
with ANC turned off but when it comes to
sound signature 's both the Sennheiser's
and sir 50s have a neutral sound
signature but I do think the sir 50s
have better clarity and detailed and the
Sennheiser's but if you're looking for a
pair of headphones that have more kick
in their bass then you'll want to look
into the watcher 700 n the watcher 700 n
are the only headphones here whose app
allows you to directly adjust your EQ so
you can make them sound however you want
depending on the type of music you
listen to but no matter how much you
play around the EQ their clarity and
detail isn't going to be as good as the
other two headphones here so if I had to
rank these headphones from
best to worse sound quality wise it
would go first place sir 50s second goes
to the Sennheiser's and third would go
to the watch s700 n but now let's talk
about bonus features unfortunately the
Sunrisers are gonna have to sit this one
out cuz besides a and C they don't have
any other features to showcase besides
good build quality a comfortable fit and
good sound one of the other reasons our
surf Fifty's meter onto my current top
three list is cuz they are one of the
only sub 200 all our agency headphones
out there that feature both an ambient
mode and quick attention mode just like
the 1000 X and threes the surf 15 is
have a feature called hear through where
they'll pump in some of the ambient
sound around you so you can still hear
what's going on when you have your
headphones on this feature is useful if
you're walking around the city or if you
work in an office you can still hear
when someone calls your name the surf
Fifty's also have a quick here thing
where if you press the only physical
button on the left ear cup your
headphones will get your music and pump
in all of the ambient sound around you
like this
and I really like when headphones have
this feature cuz you can talk to someone
without having to take off your
headphones because unfortunately even
though the what 700 and or the 1000
except three little brothers they don't
have an ambient mode or a quick
attention mode they do however have
Google assistant integration it's 3:30
1:00 p.m. you don't have new
notifications right now the current
temperature in New York City is thirty
for sure
turning on two lights and as voice
assistants continue to get better and
get integrated into our daily lives more
and more headphones are going to have
direct voice assistant integration so
it's cool to see that the watch has
Simon and Jordan already has this so
we're at the tail end of this video and
I'm willing to bet that a good chunk of
people watching this might be
considering getting the serve fifties I
mean like I said they have good build
quality they're very comfortable they
sound great and they have very useful
extra features but they do have one
glaring issue and that's their touchpad
the surf fifties have a touchpad on the
left ear cup to control the music
playback
but unfortunately as a righty this
touchpad is very hard to use they even
after a few weeks and it's not the most
accurate touchpad out there so whenever
I used to surf 50s I just find myself
using my phone to control my music
playback so the surf fifties do lose a
bit of points when it comes to
convenience whereas both the Sony's and
Sunrisers have a dedicated volume rocker
and a switch so you can easily scroll
through your music all while keeping
your phone in your pocket but I do
prefer Sony's me to control buttons over
the Sun Heiser's cuz they're larger and
easier to tell apart so overall like I
said at the beginning of this video I
like and have no problem recommending
either of these headphones but if it
wasn't for the surf fifties crappy touch
controls on their left ear cup they
would be hands down my number one and
most recommended sub $200 anc headphones
so I would only recommend getting the
audio technica ath srf ear
BTS if you're willing to compromise on
those touch controls or learn how to
live with them but other than that I
love these doing at all the headphones
if you're looking for a pair of
headphones with more space use ear cups
or an adjustable EQ then the sony what's
a 700 N or a good option 2 and finally
there's the Sennheiser HD 4.5 OB TNCs
just like the audio Technica's they
sound great but they're definitely not
for people with larger ears but if
you're looking for a pair of
good-looking rugged headphones then
they're a good option too
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed your house on
more than you realize if you want to
pick another part except mention in this
