every situation but actually picking a
pair can get overwhelming and confusing
sometimes but we average consumer who
just want to overall good performance
than the sodium 1000 xm2 and the sony
here on - or two great options but they
only have a $50 difference between them
so what's the difference let's find out
just so you know this isn't a full
review on either of these headphones I'm
just trying to point out the most
important differences between them so I
can help you with your purchase decision
if you want to learn more about these
headphones watch their full reviews like
I mentioned earlier these headphones
only have a fifty dollar difference
between them the Sony 1000 XM - usually
retail for three $49.99 and the here on
- you usually retail for to $99.99 but I
got these for two $49.99 if you want to
pick either of these headphones up I'll
have links in the description below and
I'll keep them updated so you can get
the best deal possible I suggest you
check out the links coz Sony products
routinely go on sale and it also helped
out the channel first let's go over
what's the same on these headphones
they're both noise cancelling headphones
they're both closed back headphones with
1.5 seven inches dumb drivers they both
charge via on mercury's B point and they
both have a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
for wired listening and they can both be
used passively and they're both using
bluetooth 4.1 and they both have a range
of about 35 feet and unfortunately they
can both only prepared to one device at
a time so you can't hunt WAP which
honestly is pretty annoying given that
most of the headphones these days can be
paired to at least two devices at a time
and Apple's new w1 chip allows you to
seamlessly switch between eve of your
Apple devices they also have very
similar build qualities derp using the
same type of plastics on the panelling
the same type of synthetic mother and
padding for the ear pad and underside of
the headband and they're using the same
type of stainless steel for the headband
itself their build quality is good but
it's not on the level of the bose qc25
series - but the build quality of the
1000x m2 has improved from the Sony and
the or 1000x after three months of heavy
usage the headband number 1000 xm2
hasn't cracked which was a big problem
with the previous 1000x
so hopefully the huron to won't suffer
any headband cracking issues either
their first most obvious day
prince is their design I personally
think the Huron to look better than the
1000 xm2 especially the ear cups they
have a more defined shape and the
plastic paneling really let them play
with lighting and shadows whereas the
ear cups on the 1000 xm2 are covered in
synthetic leather and they just look
like this amorphous blob like I said on
the past I would really like to see the
Sony 1000x and three to adapt some of
the design language from the Huron to
but the Huron to are in as low profile
as the 1000 xm2 they do stick out to the
sides a bit but the key design
difference between the Huron to and the
1000 xm2 you are the ear pad designs and
how they rest on your head the ear pads
on the Huron to do a far better job of
encasing your ears and give you ears
more breathing room there's also less
padding in contact with your head so
this means less heat build up over time
the ear pads on the here on two are very
similar to the ones found on the bose
qc25 series 2 whereas the ear cup design
of the 1000 x m2 is a little more
cramped and they might rest on your
earlobes
both of these headphones are comfortable
to wear and the ear cups both have a
good amount of range of motion to
accommodate almost every head shape but
the ear cup design alone might be a
major deciding factor for some people I
personally find myself reaching for the
huron to over the 1000 xm2 when i'm
going to listen to music at home or when
i'm editing video just because of the
more open feel of the here on - on my
ears but the ear cup design on the here
aren't you does play a negative role
when it comes to noise cancellation like
I mentioned earlier both of these
headphones are or noise cancelling
headphones but the ANC on the 1000 X + 2
is far superior than that of the here on
to the ear cup design on the hero -
doesn't offer as much passive noise
isolation as the air comes on the 1000 X
+ 2 so a lot of sense still manages to
get in even with a and C turn on but in
general the noise cancellation on the
sony 1000 x MTU is the best on the
market right now whereas the noise
cancellation on the sony huron - are
more comparable to the B studio threes
the noise cancellation on the Huron - is
really only worth using and already
quiet - mildly loud environments like at
home or at the office but the noise
cancellation on the 1000 X + 2 does a
far better job of blocking
more sound and perform better in louder
environments the 1000x and two is are
the ones that I reach for when I'm
traveling or when I'm just commuting
in the noise cancellation technology on
either of these headphones don't cause
any cabin pressure or discomfort on your
eardrums when using them which is a
pretty common problem with other anc
headphones out there but one problem
with the anc on the huron - is that the
mice like to pick up a lot of wind noise
so if you're walking around and you get
hit by a breeze you're gonna hear it
when listening to music whereas the
1000x i'm - very rarely pick up any wind
noise and that's because the microphones
are recessed within the synthetic
leather the leather might now look good
but it does play a very beneficial role
and the m2 is give you a lot more
control over your active noise
cancellation settings
first up the m2 s have an atmospheric
pressure sensor built-in which allows
them to calibrate themselves for a
better anc performance while - here on
Tuesday and this isn't just marketing
fluff there have been multiple times
where I went through the anc calibration
process on the 1000 x m2 and notice a
significant performance improvement and
both of these headphones also allow you
to pump in some ambient sound for safety
reasons but only the 1000 x m2 allows
you to adjust exactly how much ambient
sound you will like to let in whereas
with the here on Tues it's a fixed
amount
when it comes to battery life the 1000x
time - manages to do just a little
better than the hero - when noise
cancellation turned on I averaged 32
hours of playback time and with noise
cancellation turned off I average 38
hours of playback time and when they
hear on to you with noise cancellation
turned on I have is 28 I was a playback
time and 35 hours of playback time with
noise cancellation turned off both of
these headphones have above-average
battery life and with noise cancellation
turned on but their quick charging sucks
if you plug either one of these in for
10 minutes then you'll get only about 70
minutes of playback time now I know I've
spent a lot of time comparing the noise
cancellation on these headphones and
that's because sound quality on these
guys is identical and they get just as
loud I have actively tried to find a
discernible difference in audio quality
between these headphones and I couldn't
and that's not a bad thing they both
sound really good they have a good
soundstage and good instrument
separation and there's no tinning in the
highs very rarely does the base model
out the sound and through Sony's
headphones that you can adjust the EQ of
either these headphones to better suit
your kind of music
without moving up to higher-end
headphones like the BMW px + up I prefer
the sound of the 1000x m2 and the here
on to over other popular options like to
boast you see 35 series 2 Beats Studio
threes JBL Everest elite 750 NC and so
on just keep in mind even though these
headphones have the potential to have a
lot of bass they're not going to have as
much space as the Sony xb9 50 n1 or the
Skullcandy crusher but i also want to
point out the 1000x m2 has sony's s
master HX audio amplifier system while
the here on tuesday which only really
matters if you're listening to high-res
music if you're streaming music from
Apple music Google Play Pandora Spotify
or whatever it's not really going to
affect you also these headphones are
using the same touch controls on the
right ear cup DoubleTap to play or pause
swipe front or back to skip or go back a
track and swipe up or swipe down to
raise or lower your volume and if you
press and hold you'll activate your
voice assistant the touch controls are
equally as
on both headphones and super easy to use
but more importantly both of these
headphones have my favorite feature
which is quick attention I love this
feature more than I love chick-fil-a
waffle fries matter of fact if you love
waffle fries comment down below with the
chicken and fries emoji so I know you
got this far but with quick attention if
you fully cover the right touchpad the
headphones will lower the volume of
whatever you're listening to and they'll
pump in all of the ambient sound so this
way you can talk to someone without
having to take your headphones off now
let's go over some minor but pretty
important stuff remember there's only a
$50 price difference between these two
headphones but with the 1000x time too
you get a hard shell carrying case
something super important to consider if
you plan on traveling a lot with either
these headphones the carrying pouch
included with the here on two aren't
going to protect your headphones also
only the 1000x m2 can fold up and be
laid flat which again can be important
if you travel a lot headphones that can
be laid flat or much easier to store in
my opinion whereas the here on two can
only fold up so it can be a little
harder to throw into your bag and
finally if you plan on taking lots of
phone calls with these the microphone
with the 1000 XM - sounds slightly
better than the here on - it doesn't get
blown out as easily but if you want to
hear a microphone test on either these
headphones then watch their full reviews
so if you're deciding between either of
these two headphones just know you're
getting the same sound quality the same
Bluetooth the range stability and
capabilities and you're getting the same
level of build quality the major
differences between these headphones is
the overall styling your cup design and
noise cancellation performance get the
sodium 1000 XM - if you plan on
traveling or commuting a lot with these
headphones they have the best noise
cancellation out there right now and
they're included carrying case and
ability to be laid flat make them much
easier to throw into your bag without
worrying about them but if you just want
good sound and you're a little more
style conscious then go with the here on
to the your cup design alone and how
they encase your ears and give them
much more room is a major deciding
factor for me like I said I would really
like to see the 1000 xm3 pick up some of
the design language from the here on -
regardless you can't go wrong with
either of these two headphones but if
you demand the best noise cancellation
then get the 1000 xm2 remember this
isn't a full review on either of these
headphones so I'm just trying to point
out the most important differences
between them so I can help you with your
purchase decision if you want to learn
