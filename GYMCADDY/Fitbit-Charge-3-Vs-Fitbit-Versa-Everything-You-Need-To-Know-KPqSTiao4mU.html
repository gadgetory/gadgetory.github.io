charge 3 which is currently available
for pre-order and should start shipping
sometime in October even though the new
Fitbit charge 3 looks very similar to
the current charge to Fitbit has managed
to pack the charge 3 with some pretty
good improvements here's everything you
need to know about the new Fitbit charge
3 and how it compares to the outgoing
charge 2 and fitbit's current crown
jewel to Fitbit versa first let's talk
money in classic fitbit fashion there's
going to be a base charge 3 and a
special edition charge 3 the base charge
3 will come included with a single
silicone wrist strap and will retail for
149 95 which is what the current charts
- retails for the special edition charge
3 will retail for 1 69.95 and will come
included with 2 sets of wristbands and
we'll have all of the same functionality
as the base charge 3 except it's also
going to have an NFC chip for
contactless payments personally I would
get the special edition charge 3 just
for the extra wristband because I think
Fitbit should have included and NFC chip
on both models if you want to pick the
Fitbit charge 3 up I'll have links to
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel
now let's talk design the charge 3 looks
very similar to the outgoing charge 2
but there are some key differences the
charge 3 now has cornering or the glass
3 protecting the screen just like the
vs. so the charge 3 should be able to
stand up to scratches better than the
charge - even though the screen under
torch 3 is still a black and white
screen like to charge to the screen
under charge 3 is now in Oh led
touchscreen that's 40% bigger than the
screen on the charge - and notice how I
said touchscreen the screen will charge
- is a hat - touch screen meaning it
doesn't respond when you swipe the
screen like you normally would do on
your phone in response to the force of
your tap so you have to tap it hard
enough for it to register an input but
since the charge 3 is now going to have
a touchscreen you can now swipe left to
right on it like you normally would do
on other touchscreen devices which is
gonna have to see how the new touch
screen behaves when you're trying to
navigate through the menus when you're
sweaty at the gym another significant
change on charge 3 is the new sideline
unlike the charge 2 or the Versa which
have big
cookie buttons which I personally like a
torch 3 has a brand new inductive button
similar to the home button on the iPhone
8 an iPhone 7
it doesn't actually move when you press
it but it does vibrate to simulate that
click and to let you know it received
the input and the reason flip it
upgraded the button under charge 3 was
so that they can now make a swim proof
something that the outgoing charge to
isn't so you can now confidently swim
the charge 3 in the pool or in the ocean
without having to worry about damaging
it another upgrade to Taurus 3 has going
for it is that it now has a claim
battery life of 7 days whereas the
charge 2 has a claim battery life for
five days and the Versa has a claim
battery life of four days but I'm
willing to guess that with real-world
use the charge 3 should be good for
about 5 days between charges and finally
the last major upgrade I want to mention
about the Taurus 3 is the addition of an
SP o2 sensor which is also found on the
Versa and this sensor allows for the
potential to estimate changes in blood
oxygen levels and help track new health
indicators like sleep apnea so those of
the major hardware changes coming to the
charge 3 a bigger brighter screen an
inductive button which allows for
waterproofing better battery life and an
SP o2 sensor but the charge 3 is also
getting some pretty significant software
upgrades as well the UI is going to be
revamped so it's easier to navigate and
you're going to have more robust smart
phone notifications similar to what you
were fine on the Versa or on more
expensive smartwatches like the Apple
watch and for the ladies watching the
choice 3 is also going to be able to
help with female health tracking just
like the Versa does and finally let's
talk about what the charge 3 doesn't
have the charge 3 still lacks a built-in
GPS meaning that if you're a runner
you're still gonna have to bring your
phone along because the Taurus three
still relies on connected GPS just like
the previous charge 2 and the fitbit
version and the reason fitbit didn't
include a built-in GPS onto charge 3 was
to save room for more sensors and a
bigger battery and just to keep costs
down and personally I feel that's
perfectly fine but what I am bummed
about is that it looks like the Taurus 3
still doesn't have wireless charging
personally I just feel the charging
clips that come included with most
Fitbit devices are just too clunky and
clumsy
so that's the Fitbit charge 3 I
personally feel it's a pretty
significant upgrade to the alkaline
charge - it has a new bigger and
brighter touch screen which should allow
for easier navigation through the menus
it has a new inductive button which now
allows to charge 3 to be swim proof it
has a new SP o2 sensor that estimate
changes in blood oxygen levels it now
has a claim battery life of 7 days and
its UI has been improved so it can be
more useful outside of the gym it's
still lacking built in GPS but I think
that's perfectly fine I think that just
like the Fitbit versum the Fitbit charge
3 is going to be another hit for Fitbit
if you made it this far I guess you
enjoyed the video so hit that like
button and get subscribed it helps out
more than you realize
