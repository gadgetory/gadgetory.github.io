that are $350 and below namely the Sony
1000 xm2 bose qc25 series 2 and the pay
studio threes alright that last one was
a joke but sometimes you just want
something nice you might want something
with better materials or you just might
want something with a better sound if
you go up and work a little bit but the
Sun highs are HD 1 Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px
and the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
89 I are all some popular options this
is a premium headphone showdown just so
we're clear this isn't a full review on
either these headphones I'm just
pointing out the most important
differences between them so I can help
you with a person's decision if you want
to learn more about either of these
headphones then watch their full reviews
the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px currently
retails for $399.99 and they were
released in the fall of 2017 there are
also the most affordable headphones in
this lineup the Sun hazard HD ones
retails for $499.99 and there are the
oldest headphones here now I decided to
go with the HD ones over the Sennheiser
pxc 550 because I feel those should be
compared with the Sony 1000 xm2 and most
UC 35 and then there's the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen h9 I which also retails for
$499.99 and were released in January
2018 if you want to pick either of these
headphones up I'll have links for
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel ok
let's get some simple button point stuff
out of the way first
both the PX and h9 I have a USB C port
for charging while the HD one has a
microUSB port cuz remember they are the
oldest headphones here and all three of
these headphones can be connected to two
devices at the same time so life is a
little easier if you constantly switch
from your phone to your computer on a
regular basis like I do all these
headphones have a wireless range of
about 30 feet but I noticed a wireless
connection on the HD one was the least
stable it would start from time to time
and the connection would be even less
stable with the single wall between the
headphones and my phone whereas the PX
and h9 I didn't suffer from these
problems but if you wanted to use these
headphones with a wired connection both
the h9 i and PX have easily accessible
3.5 mm audio jacks
while the HD ones have a not so easy to
reach 2.5 millimeter audio jack so
finding a real place
men or better quality audio cable for
the HD one will be a little harder for
the audio fellows out there that still
prefer to use a wired connection okay
let's talk about these headphones
materials and design let's start off
with my least favorite the Sennheiser HD
one with the HD ones you get a leather
headband with a very little padding a
stainless steel frame plastic your cup
covers and leather earpads I know design
is subjective but I just don't like how
the HD ones look Gordon Ramsay might say
that you look rustic but to me they look
like prototypes the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px
also have a stainless steel frame a tie
fabric weave covering the ear cups and
headband and leather on its ear pads and
underneath the headband and if you do
decide to pick up the PX keep in mind
the lever does need a bit of a break-in
period and the h9 eyes have cowhide
leather on their headband a brushed
aluminum frame traffic underneath their
headband and lambskin leather on their
ear pads
I think the ace nine eyes are the most
premium feeling headphones here but I
think the px are the best looking
headphones here the only thing I don't
like are those random cylinders on the
frame comfort is very important to take
into consideration when choosing
headphones and plainly said the px are
the least comfortable headphones here
I have to give myself a pep talk every
time I'm gonna put the px on they have a
lot of planting force so they are not
big head friendly they also weigh the
most here coming in at 335 grams the HD
ones are the lightest headphones here
weighing in at 260 grams they fit just
fine that I always feel like they're
going to fall off for some reason the
ear cups on the HD ones also apply some
pressure on the top portion of the year
which is something I've never felt
before with other headphones I've tested
I also noticed that every few minutes I
have to go in readjust the ear cups on
the HD ones and the ear pads on the HD
ones heat up the fastest here as well
the h9 eyes weigh in at 290 grams and I
feel there are the most comfortable
headphones here the aircraft apply even
pressure and I genuinely forget they're
there sometimes
the only drawback on the h9 I are the
low profile of circular ear cups if you
have bigger ears the new years might
feel a little cramped or the bottom
portion of the padding might rest on
your earlobes the padding does rest on
my earlobes but I don't notice that
after a few minutes the PX and HT ones
have oval ear cups so they do a better
job of in case in your ears and they
you ears a lot of room but the earcups
and the PX are much more spacious so
they give you ears that extra room to
twitch around with the music starts
tickling your eardrums but remember the
px will only fit people with smaller
heads
although the h9 I are very comfortable
they also have the worst battery life
here with anc and bluetooth turned on
the 8th side I typically average 20
hours of playback time with the ones
that add 50% under the same conditions
the HD ones get about 23 hours of
playback time and the bottom opens px
manages to squeeze out 24 hours of
playback time but with an C turned off
the h9 I get about 24 hours of playback
time and the Bowers and Wilkins px get
about 30 hours of playback time but the
anc on the HD ones can't be turned off
the only way you can use these
headphones without noise cancellation is
if you use them passively with a wired
connection when it comes to noise
cancellation on these headphones they
all perform differently but none of them
perform as well as the Sony 1000 accent
two seriously if ANSI is your top
priority get to Sony's the Sennheiser HD
one has the least amount of cabin
pressure here but it also has the
worst-performing anc here the ANC on the
px has a little more cabin pressure but
it does manage to perform a little
better as well the ANC on the h9 I has
less cabin pressure than the PX but they
also perform the best here the anc on
all three of these headphones do a
better job of blocking out constant
sounds like road noise but they all
struggle a bit when blocking out more
random high-pitched sounds like people
talking
but with the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px you can
control how much noise cancellation you
want if you wanted to you can make them
pump in all of the surrounding sounds
even while you're playing music so if
you're walking around in the city you
can still be aware of your surroundings
it's kind of like having
open-back headphones in the sense that
you can hear both your music and the
ambient sound recording sound quality
all three of these headphones sound
really good as they should but they do
have their minor differences the Sun
Heiser HD ones have more kick behind
their bass and they have a little more
emphasis on the trouble vocalist or
front and center with these headphones
the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px are all about
soundstage and they manage to have a
very wide soundstage without sounding
like you have your head in a bucket the
lows resonate a lot and they will make
your ear switch but the px do you have a
flat sound signature so they don't have
a lot of kick behind their bass and then
there's the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen h9 I and I
feel they're a bit on the warmer side no
matter how much I play around with their
app I can never managed to bring the
vocalist out as much as the HD ones you
can also adjust their soundstage through
their app but if you widen it too much
then everything starts to sound
they have more kick in their base than
the PX and the lows resonate as much as
the PX but you don't get the same ear
twisting effect like I'm the PX because
of the h9 I scrimped ear cups the ASA
nine eyes are headphones I tend to
listen to at lower volumes when I'm
getting work done
I think the PX has the best sound here
but I still like to listen to the HD
ones but I just want to jam out but I do
need to point out that both the PX and
h9 I sound very different when they're
noise cancellation is turned on or off
when their ANC is turned off their sound
stages or wider and their lows get
deeper when ANC is turned on their sound
stages tighten up a bit and the lows
aren't as impressive I typically try to
listen to these headphones with ANC
turned off but now let's talk about
these headphones AB cuz they're all very
different as well I start off with the
HD ones cuz they don't really have an
app Sennheiser recommends you use their
cap to nap but in 2018 it's mostly
useless it doesn't let you adjust any
settings directly on the HD ones like
their ANC or EQ settings if you play
music through the captain app you can
adjust the EQ and that EQ setting will
affect whatever device your phone is
connected to if I wanted to I could use
captain with the h9 eyes but captain
doesn't work with any streaming services
a site title and whatever songs you have
stored locally on your device the P X's
app allows you to table with noise
cancellation on or off and you can
adjust how much noise cancellation you
want as well and through the app you can
also turn the built-in proximity sensors
on or off but you can't adjust the EQ
settings of the px from here and for the
most part B&amp;amp;W zap has remained unchanged
since the PX launched and then there's
be a nose app which allows you to
control your EQ settings and that's
pretty much it
but I just feel both of these apps
should give you more control over your
headphones like Sony's app you should be
able to control your headphones EQ ANC's
settings and proximity sensor settings
straight from their app now both the
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px and Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
h9 eyes have proximity sensors built in
so when you take your headphones off
the automatically positive music and
when you put them back on they'll start
playing your music again now the
proximity sensor is on the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen h9 I work way better than the
ones on the bass and welcomes px on the
px I typically keep this feature off
because they'll randomly start playing
you're pausing your music sometimes and
it is very annoying when you're really
into a song and then matter nowhere the
PX just pauses your music now I've
played around with the sensitivity of
the proximity sensors but it still
happens now even though the proximity
sensors on the h9 I work well I still
keep this feature off because I just
don't want my headphones to start
playing music and max volume every time
I put them on both the h9 I and px also
have features that allow you to talk to
people without having to fully take your
headphones off on the h9 I when you
swipe up on the touchpad the headphones
will pause your music and pump in all of
the ambient sound this is that little
gesture I did in the last clip being all
caused this transparency mode and this
method is pretty sleek because both of
your hands are free and when you swipe
up on the touchpad again the headphones
will start playing the music again on
the PX when you left either of the ear
cups they'll pause the music and when
you put them back down there start
playing again but bmw's method is an
athlete because one of your hands is
full and in order for this feature to
work you have to keep the proximity
sensors turned on next up are these
headphones controls because they're very
different as well
all these headphones that you control
the music playback and it's just evolved
no problems there the h9 eyes have a
touchpad so you can also toggle your
noise cancellation and transparency mode
on or off with a single swipe up and
down the touchpad works well but there
are failed attempts here and there it
happens rarely but it happens the HD
ones have a toggle on its right ear cup
and it's very easy to find and it's very
easy to control the PX has dedicated
buttons and I love the way they feel
they look great they're easy to tell
apart and they have great tactile
feedback I just wished the center button
hand
and finally here are some small but
important features to take into
consideration if you ever noticed by now
the Sennheiser HD ones come included
with what I think is the best carrying
case here the PX and h9 I just come with
pouches and the battery on the h9 I is
removable so if you ever get to a point
where the battery on the h9 I can't hold
a charge anymore you could just simply
replace the battery instead of just
throwing out your $500 headphones okay
let's wrap this video up even though I
really do like how the Sennheiser HD one
sound and how lightweight they are I
don't think they would be the best
investment right now in most cases I'm
just not a fan of their design and their
and see isn't the best I think a bang in
all of us in h9 I are the safest option
here for most people they sound great
they're extremely comfortable in their
ANC is pretty good and they have the
most features here as well but I think
the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px are the best
sounding headphones here they're sell
States and sound quality is amazing but
their ANC isn't that good their
proximity sensors are very finicky and
again they aren't that comfortable to
wear that's why I feel the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen h9 I are the safest option here
