about two weeks ago and we've been
working on a review on it ever since
this is Jim Kelly's reveal on the Fitbit
flex - and $99 is fitbit's entry level
fitness tracker it'll count your
calories burned steps taken distance
what it'll track your sleep it's also
now a waterproof shoe you can actually
swim with it and it'll automatically
start counting your laps now this is
Fitbit second generation of their Flex
lineup and you can really tell they took
the original flex back to the drawing
board and we designed it from the ground
up and came back with a far superior
product inside the box you're going to
find a small wristband some
documentation a larger wristband which
I'm actually wearing right now and a
charging cradle this charging cradle is
how you actually charge your Fitbit
module you just throw it in here make
sure to line up those pins correctly and
you just attach this to any USB port in
your computer or in your phone charger
the wristband itself is made out of
silicone there is a soft touch feel to
it and there is a raised texture design
now this guy looks great inside and
outside of the gym it's super low
profile in slim so you forget you even
wearing the thing while it just silently
judges you now best part is it doesn't
clash with your outfit so if you work
inside in an office it's not going to
stick out like a sore thumb now on the
front there are a few LEDs that light up
when you DoubleTap the Fitbit and this
tells you how close you are to meeting
your daily step count goal if it lights
up all the way you've met your goal if
it lights up halfway you're halfway
there now you can adjust your step count
goal in your fitment a Fitbit mobile app
and we've said it before and we'll say
it again Fitbit has the best fitness
tracking app on the market hands down
it's super easy to use and it keeps you
motivated with rewards and challenges
and if you really want to get technical
you the Fitbit app
also help you out with that now the
fitness tracker doesn't just count your
calories burned and your steps taken it
also now connects with your phone so
it'll vibrate and light up when you get
a text message or a phone call since
there is no actual screen it doesn't
tell you who you got it from it just
tells you you got one now this is the
actual Fitbit module itself this is
what's doing all of the connecting and
all of the tracking now since this is
pretty small there it's only has a four
to five day four to five of a battery
life now that's okay
we have seen better but since this is
compact we can forget it at $99 this
thing does not have a heart rate monitor
if you're looking for something with a
heart rate monitor then you might be
interested in the Fitbit charge too now
that guy came out in the beginning of
September of 2016 and we have a review
on it which will be linked down below
now Fitbit does sell extra wristbands
and pendants and necklaces and bangles
so if you want options to stylize your
Fitbit you have a few things to choose
from you can also get some more stylized
wrist bands from the third third-party
market so for $99 what I picked this guy
up if you're doing aerobic exercises or
a lot of cardio and if you're new to the
gym and you want to know how many
calories you're burning how many steps
you're taking then yeah I would pick
this guy up for $99 it's um it's a great
tool to help you meet your fitness goals
if you're looking for something with a
heart rate monitor then I would
definitely go for the hospital for the
Fitbit charge to now just remember
you're not just buying the hardware
you're also buying into Fitbit mobile
app and we've said it before and we'll
say it again in this very same video
Fitbit has a V best fitness tracking app
so if you need something that will
definitely log everything
correctly and accurately and beautifully
that would definitely pick this guy up
either for yourself or as a gift</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
