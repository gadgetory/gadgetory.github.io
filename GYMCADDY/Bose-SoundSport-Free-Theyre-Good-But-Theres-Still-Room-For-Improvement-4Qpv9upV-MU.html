to review the bonus sound support screen
wireless earbuds is because I thought
$250 was way too much to pay for a pair
of sports wireless earbuds given that
there are so many options out there and
it looks like Bose finally caught on and
they lowered their price so let's check
out the bose sound sport free and are
they really better than air pods the bow
sounds for free will release in the
summer of 2017 and they initially
retailed for 250 dollars but now they're
going for the low low price of $200 in a
highly saturated market like the sports
wireless earbuds segment these are on
the pricier end of the scale if you want
to check these your buds out I'll have a
link in the description below and if you
use the link it really helped us channel
regarding what you get with the bose
sound sport free you don't really get
much you get the charging case which is
very well put together unlike your USB
cable for charging and a total of three
silicone ear tips that's it but first I
just want to say that I don't feel the
Bose sound sport free or other sports
wireless earbuds for that matter should
be compared directly to the air buds say
what you will about their design but the
air pods are tiny and meant to be used
day in and day out but they aren't the
best for the gym because they aren't
water-resistant and they let a lot of
ambient sound in compared to other
sports wireless earbuds
on the other hand sports wireless
earbuds are like the bose sound sport
free shouldn't be used outside of the
gym
have you seen guys trying to pull these
off while walking around in the city
wearing a suit the Bose sound sport free
are so big they basically make them look
like Frankenstein's monster walking
around okay now that I got that out of
my system let's get back to the matter
at hand even though the Bose earbuds are
very expensive both the earbuds and the
case has very good build quality if you
press the front button then the five
LEDs will light up and show you your
current battery status and if you press
even harder than the case will open up
and the lid has a very well designed
hinge the case itself is able to supply
the earbuds with 10 extra hours of
battery life and the earbuds themselves
are able to hold a 5 hour battery life
so the bose sound support free have an
advertised battery life of 15 hours I go
to the gym four times a week for two
hours and the both typically lasts me
six full workouts so almost every week
and a half I charge them up I mean
they're decent but the case isn't
without its problems first off yeah it's
pretty big but since I just
into my jet bag it doesn't really matter
my main issue with the case is that the
button is so hard to press since the
case is so smooth and since I have to
press really hard to open it up
I find myself frequently dropping the
whole case on the gym floor the front
button is just complete mush
I feel Bo's needs to go back and
redesign this mechanism so it takes less
effort to open and you get better
tactile feedback and I also feel both
should have used a USB C port instead of
a micro USB port for charging okay now
let's talk about the earbuds these
things are huge I found that each earbud
weighs in at 9 grams with the medium ear
tips for comparison
each earbud on the j-bird run and sole
xshot weighs in as 6 and 5 grams
respectively for the most part runners
say that the bose earbuds have a
tendency to wiggle out when they're out
training obviously I'm not a runner but
when I get on the terminal and do my
post workout cardio the both sound sport
free do like to wiggle out but when I'm
weightlifting the bow sounds for free
stay securely in place except for when I
touch down when I'm done doing pull-ups
or dips but when it comes to
customization options you don't really
have too many options to choose from
you only have three orphan sizes to
choose from and no matter which one of
the three ear tips you choose from the
bow sounds for free don't create a seal
in your ear canal they rest right
outside of it so they do let in a good
amount of ambient sound in some people
were like this for safety reasons and
other people like myself just want to
block everything out after gym but the
sound quality on the bow sounds for free
is actually pretty good the main thing
they have going for them is clarity
there's almost no tinting and the lows
get surprisingly deep I actually think
these sound better than the air pods and
power beats 3 but they won't sound as
good as the picture but they don't get
as loud as the power beats 3 but they
definitely get loud enough connection
quality on the bose sound support free
is also pretty good just keep in mind
the right ear buttons the master and the
left ear but is a slave so if you're
gonna talk to somebody on the phone
you're only gonna hear them through the
right earbud and this fear is gonna talk
to you she's only gonna talk to you
through the right ear but as well they
have a range of about 30 feet and I
haven't had any connection issues unlike
the Jane tour run but they do suffer
from a good amount of latency when
watching YouTube videos it's not as bad
as the tape and run but I do
expect the boughs to do a little better
but when you decide to go with wireless
earbuds you also sacrifice the
convenience and inline controller like
the one on the power beats 3 or de
protects three offers so with most
wireless earbuds alike the air patch or
tapered run you don't have full control
over your music playback so you either
have to rely on your voice assistant or
you have to wipe out your phone more
frequently both decided to put off full
set of buttons on their right ear buds
and this is great without having to take
your phone out you can adjust your
volume player positive music skip a
track go back a track and you can even
activate your voice assistant on paper
this sounds great but unfortunately the
buttons on the right ear bud are so hard
to press I just naturally end up
defaulting to using my phone again
pressing the planes on the right earbud
is a workout in itself Bose also
included another button on the left ear
bud and pressing this will only tell you
which device the budget connected to and
I think this is a missed opportunity on
Boza sport obviously bose needs to make
pressing ease of these buttons much
easier but I also think both should make
the left point on these earbuds activate
Google assistant just like the extra
button on the boss you see 35 series 2
does this way the button on the left
here but is way more useful the boat
sounds for free also connects to the
Bose Connect app and it doesn't really
do much you can update their firmware
adjust some settings and controlling
music playback but you can't adjust your
EQ or anything like that but they do
have a fine my buds feature as long as
you're in range you can ping each of
these buds so you can find them even if
they're into a case you can still pin
them which is a good feature to have but
other than that the both Connect app
doesn't really do much to these earbuds
ok and here's the microphone test for
the Bose sound sport free and keep in
mind only go right here but is actually
picking up your voice and I actually
think it sounds pretty good but this
audio clip is waiting recorded by the
microphone on the Bose sound for free so
you can be conscious of that
so to wrap things up the bow sounds port
free or good but I would still shop
around I'm glad to see they're selling
for $200 now but I would like to see
them come down to at least $170 mark
again I wouldn't consider getting these
over-the-air pots for day-to-day use but
if you're a weightlifter at the gym then
these are okay they have very good build
quality they sound very good and their
battery life is decent
but for the bull sounds port three
series two bows needs to shrink the bars
down flicks the buttons under earbuds
fix the button on the case and they
should integrate Google assistant hey if
