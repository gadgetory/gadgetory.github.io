Apple gave a sneak peak of their air
power charging that a wireless charging
meant I can charge multiple devices at
the same time and everyone assumed that
the air power would go on sale in early
2018 and some people including myself
thought we would see the air power map
again at WWDC 2018 but neither of that
happen now everybody is speculating that
we're going to see the air power again
at Apple's next iPhone event in
September but with a rumored price tag
between 150 and 200 dollars I think some
people will find logitech's new wireless
charger a little more attractive it does
have its drawbacks but it is decent
Logitech's powered for an iphone
wireless charging stand only comes in
white and we tell us for 70 bucks and
like I just said it's rumored that the
air power is going to cost somewhere
between 150 and 200 dollars and if
that's the case I don't feel like paying
an Apple tags just for a wireless
charger but we won't know a definitive
price until Apple actually releases a
thing but if you want to pick Logitech's
wireless charger up I'll have a link to
the description below and if you use the
links will help size channel and also
check with the numerous shows down below
regarding what's in the box you just get
the charging stand that has a non
removable five-foot cable and a pretty
big power adapter for the wall and I'll
address this power adapter in a minute
but besides that you also get a quick
store guide that's pretty adamant about
you not placing any credit cards near
the contact point the entire body
including the cable is covered in TPU so
everywhere you touch has a soft touch
feel to it which is pretty nice there's
an indicator light on top of the charger
that lets you know it's charging a phone
and the bottom has rubber feet
unfortunately from what I can tell the
angle on the stand is not adjustable
it's locked out of 65 degree angle after
living with the charger for a few days
and having a place on my desk I thought
that the angle is fine but I would like
to be able to adjust angle myself a
little bit depending on where I place it
and I also feel taller people are going
to want to push the iPhone back a little
bit personally I've never really cared
about wireless charging because you
can't use your phone and charge your
phone at the same time that's why I
still just prefer to use a cable but
I'm going to really like having this
extra wireless charging stand on my desk
when I'm gonna get some work done I just
dropped my phone into the cradle and you
can easily see notifications as they
come in and you don't have to worry
about placing the iPhone perfectly in
the cradle so the coreos line up you
just drop and go but what I really like
about this charging stand is that you
can place your phone horizontally on it
and you get a pretty good viewing angle
when you're going to watch a video and
no matter how much your phone vibrates
when you get a phone call or
notifications you don't have to worry
about it falling out of the cradle we're
going Tech Specs Logitech's wireless
charger is still your standard qi
wireless charger so you can charge any
device that follows the Qi standard if
you use a non iPhone device store
wireless charger is gonna put out five
watts of power but if you drop in an
iPhone 8 iPhone 8 + or an iPhone 10 no
wireless charger is gonna put out 7.5
watts of power instead and from my time
using a Logitech wireless charger and
from testing it with an iPhone 8 +
running the latest wise I noticed it
managed to charge the iPhone 8 + almost
as fast as a wired connection and this
is good the problem with wireless
charging is that it's not as fast and
much more wasteful than using a wired
connection but when using logitech's
wireless charger the iPhone and stand
still gets considerably warm so you're
still wasting some power but if you want
legitimate fast charging you're still
better off investing into Apple's USB C
power back in USB C - lightning cable
combo which is gonna cost you about a
five bucks overall it is expensive for
fast charging hopefully Apple does fix
that at their next keynote next month
and this kind of relates to my biggest
question I have about Apple's air power
it's just how fast will it be able to
charge an iPhone wirelessly again it's
rumored that is going to cost about $150
and we know it's going to be able to
charge multiple devices at the same time
and if that's the case I think it's a
pretty tough sell at that price
if charging your devices on the air
power still means a slower charge rate
than using a wired connection but if
Apple's air power is able to wirelessly
charge your iPhone and air pots - at the
same time and do so faster than using a
wired can
action then I think it would constitute
a premium price tag and it would also be
very impressive otherwise if you think
about it unless you're a die-hard Apple
user that has an iPhone air pods and an
Apple watch you don't really need the
air power I'm just talking for myself
here I rock an iPhone and air Potts
combo everyone charges their phone on a
daily basis but air pods when you can go
about four to five days between charges
so I've had no problem having one cable
to charge both of my devices so I feel
that unless the air Power has true
Wireless fast charging it's really only
going to be worth it for the group of
people who have the iPhone air pods and
Apple watch trifecta to invest $150 or
more into a wireless charger but I
personally think Logitech missed a
golden opportunity with their wireless
charger it's also heavily rumored that
the airport's two are going to be
announced at the next iPhone event and
the biggest feature they're supposed to
have is wireless charging and from the
looks of it it looks like this wireless
charger won't be able to charge the air
pods - unless you lay it down flat or if
you prop the air pods up with a pencil
or something I think there's one on this
charger would have been much cooler if
you could just drop the air pots to
there and get charging but another
problem I have with as well as charger
is is power break it's pretty big in a
world where we're constantly trying to
fit multiple power breaks on a single
power strip less is always more but I do
wish we had more of a power cable even
though this is a five foot cable from my
desk setup it's not enough i thinkin of
the foot would have been just right and
that's what she said
so overall Logitech's new wireless
charging stand is one of the better
third-party wireless chargers out there
it's very well built and it looks very
good I just wish we also had a black
option to choose from maybe even gray I
like the fact that it props your phone
up so if you have this charger on your
desk
it makes your phone look like an extra
screen I also like that you don't have
to go looking for the coil is every time
you drop your phone into the cradle and
I also like that this wireless charger
charges your phone almost as fast as
using a wired connection well for $70
this is definitely for somebody who
wants convenience over
everything else because personally I
would rather invest that money into
getting a USBC power brick from Apple
and get fast charging we're in 30
minutes
your iPhone gets a 50 percent charge
from a dead battery and I also think a
Logitech should've thought ahead and
taking the air pots to into
consideration given that they decided to
release this product in August but I
think we can still MacGyver something

enjoyed the video so hit that like
