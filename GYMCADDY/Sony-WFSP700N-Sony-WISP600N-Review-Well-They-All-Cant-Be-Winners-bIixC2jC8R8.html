a while now you know I absolutely love
the Sony 1000 accent 2 headphones and in
general I like Sony's headphone line up
so much that I actually dedicated a
whole video to it what you can and
should watch right here at emotional fan
of Sony's new XP 41 and XP 41 speakers
but I feel Sony could have and should
have done better with their new SP 600 n
+ SP 700 m sports wireless earbuds now
they aren't all bad but these headphones
have a few quirks which just make you
think Sony rushed them out the door
the reason I'm reviewing both of these
headphones together is because they're
basically the same product except the
ones completely wireless while the other
still has a wire connecting both of the
earbuds but gives you the added benefit
of the inline controller the sony WI SP
600 n retells for $150 while the
completely wireless WF SP 700 n we tell
us for $180 if you want to pick either
these headphones up I'll have lengths or
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel I
suggest you check them out because Sony
headphones routinely go on sale but I'm
also going to link some better
alternatives as well namely the J Brand
X 3 and power beats 3 if you can't go
wrong with either of those also check
out the new merch shelf down below
regarding what's in the box
both of these headphones come with
pretty much the same things they both
come included with a micro USB cable for
charging they both come with an extra
pair of a larger infants and they both
come with three additional pairs of ear
tips of varying sizes but what struck me
as weird is that the wired SP 600 n then
it come included with a carrying pouch
and there are no cable management clips
either the reason I'm mentioning the
lack of cable management clips on the SP
600 N is because wire itself is pretty
long and heavy with most other wire to
earbuds like this you can either taut
the cable or clip it onto your shirt for
a better cable management so it's not
constantly bouncing around but the cable
on these wired earbuds is pretty durable
and it has a built-in inline controller
the buttons themselves have good tactile
feedback and they're very easy to tell
apart and the controller also houses a
microUSB port for charging and yes this
micro USB port should have been
USBC port instead okay now let's talk
about what you're actually here to see
the completely wireless SP 700 N and
first let's adjust the current case it's
nice lightweight and feels like SATA
hand but it feels pretty cheap the lit
feels a little flimsy and I want to be
surprised if people accidentally snapped
it off and on the back of the case or
something like USB port for charging and
again Sony this needs to be a USBC port
come on but here's a problem with the
case the LED indicator light only shines
red when you plug it in and after a
while the red LED turns off but it
doesn't shine why tell me you know the
case is fully charged and there also
isn't a gauge telling you approximately
how much of a charge the case itself has
and Sony's app which I'll get into in a
minute only tells you how much battery
the earbuds have not the case and when
you put the earbuds end over bhalil ette
you know the current state of their
battery level but there is no way of
telling if the case is charged or dead
now when it comes to actually placing
the earbuds into the case the ear buds
aren't magnetically online you have to
watch them in which does feel a little
unnatural regarding the earbuds
themselves they each have a single
button and is not these big circle
things it's these little clear wedges
that stick out the left one controls
your anc settings and the right one
controls your music playback so you can
play or pause your music or skip a track
but you can't adjust the volume so
that's what are the benefits of having
an inline controller like on the SP 600
n or the power beats 3 you have full
control of you music playback while you
work out while with fully wireless
earbuds you only have partial control
without having to make your voice
assistant regarding fit these earphones
go in really deep into your ear canal
and they also form a very good seal
which provide a lots of passive noise
isolation both of these earphones will
also feature active noise cancellation
and ambient sound settings but even
though I feel Sony currently has the
best active noise cancellation on the
market I don't really feel like it's
really worth using on either of these
earbuds the ANC does block out Sun sound
but a lot of sound still manages to get
in but the ambient sound feature is much
more useful if you're someone who likes
running or biking on the streets like I
just said these earphones provide a lot
of passive noise isolation but with
ambient mode turn on the earbuds will
pump in all the
surrounding sounds and is like they're
not even there so he can still be aware
of your surroundings which is great for
safety regarding tech specs both of
these your phones are rocking an IP
export certification and they're both
using Bluetooth 4.1 the wired SP 600 n
has very little E&amp;amp;C so if you're going
to be watching any YouTube videos with
them they're okay
the SP 700 and on the other hand have a
lot of latency the connection doesn't
really stutter for me but these are
strictly for listening to music now just
keep in mind the left ear but is a
master and the right ear but is a slave
so if you're gonna be taking phone calls
with these headphones you're only gonna
hear sound come out of the left ear bud
when it comes to battery life it's not
fantastic the wired SP 600 and can hold
the six hour charge while the truly
wireless SP 700 n can hold a nine hour
charge the earbuds themselves can hold a
three hour charge and the case can
charge the earbuds backup twice but
neither of these two headphones have
quick charging which I feel is a must
these days and now let's talk about
sound quality if you think the power
beats three have a lot of bees then
these have way more and depending on the
US that's either a good thing or a bad
thing
the bass is very deep and the base is
very punchy but unfortunately I feel
Sonia all the focus on the base because
the mids are very shallow and the highs
of a returnee
the high zone these your phones are
constantly piercing yours
so these your phones are on a pleasant
to listen to so basically the music on
these earphones is just constantly being
drowned out by the bass but if you jump
into so nice headphones app you can
select from a few pre-made equalizer
settings but no matter which one I use I
found they all have way too much bass
and the high still remain
tinny personally I found mellow sounds
the best but unfortunately you can't go
in and adjust the EQ sense to your
liking you're stuck with the pre-made
settings also sony advertises google
assess and integration on these earbuds
but that feature isn't available yet so
in the meantime you can summon your
voices system by pressing and holding
the button on the right ear but on the
700 N or president holding the play
button on the SP 600 N and here is the
microphone test now it's not complete
garbage but long story short I still
want to take phone calls with the
your bites and keep in mind left your
buddy is the master so you're only gonna
hear stuff coming out of this your bud
and the microphone is located here as
well that this other clip is being
recorded by the microphone on the Sony
SP 700 n so you'd be the judge of that
so on paper I feel the truly Wireless SP
700 and some pretty cool but
execution-wise I think they fell short
first off I feel these are bad sounding
earphones with way too much bass the
carrying case looks nice but needs some
major improvements like a more durable
lid fast charging and a battery gauge or
a multicolored LED tell a you know its
current battery status there's been 700
N or very light stay in place very well
and the ambient sound feature is very
useful but I wouldn't pay $180 for them
the wider SP 600 and are a little better
but it's kind of hard to recommend them
over the jaybird x3 or the power beats 3
given that you can get either one of
them for less and the Sony's if you know
where to look if you made it this far I
guess you enjoyed the video so hit that
