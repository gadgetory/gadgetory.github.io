syxp 40 are two very different looking
wireless speakers but you want to know
with not so different the price
although the Sony S or s XP 40 is much
larger than the both end of the few of
the tricks up its sleeve
there's only $50 difference between the
two and if you're in the market for a
new wireless speaker these are fairly
new offerings unless you're interested
in the JBL post 3 which should be
releasing in a few days subscribe to the
channel so you can get notified when
that review dr concerning price and
colors both the sony s science actually
40 in the bose soundlink revolve plus
come in multiple color ways the sony
xba-40 comes in three colorways black
blue of red and retails for 248 over at
amazon the bose soundlink revolve plus
comes in two colorways triple black and
lux gray and retails for 299 over at
amazon i'll have links in the
description below if you want to pick
either of these pictures up and i'll
keep them updated the best I can so you
can get the best deals possible you
never know when these will go on sale
concerning form factor these speakers
are very different obviously the Sony
SRS xp for T is your classic pill design
and shoots music out in one direction
you can lay it flat or you can stand it
on one of its sides the Bose sound like
revolt plus on the other hand has a
cylindrical design and shoots music out
in all 360 degrees if you want to get
the best sound from the Bose you'll want
to place it in the center of the room
but concerning build quality in
materials the Bose Soundlink evolve is
the clear winner it has a brushed
aluminum outer with soft touch end caps
that don't just feel great to the touch
they also make the speaker bump with a
set and they also make the speaker look
great the Sony SRS X 340 also has a soft
touch outer casing and a metal grille
but the quality of the materials is
nowhere near as premium as Bose so
design and quality goes to the Bose
sound with of all plus when you're not
listening to music the Bose will look
great in any room
concerning tech both of these speakers
are using bluetooth for that too and can
connect to multiple devices at the same
time concerning wireless range the sony
xba-40 will give you around 50 feet
while the bose revolve will only give
you 30 feet 40 feet if you're lucky and
with the recline of sight
they also both have rechargeable
batteries sony advertisers with battery
life of 24 hours but with real world use
for looking at about
for around 15 hours at least that's what
I found those on the other hand
advertises a 16 hour battery life on
their speaker we're using it I've
managed to achieve an 8 to 10 hour
battery life these speakers are also
water resistant but the sony srs XP 40
is IP x5 certified walter boses ipx4
certified which means the boss will be
fine if it gets splashed on by a little
water but if you submerge it or if you
hose it down it'll get damaged you can't
submerge the XP 40 either but it is a
little more durable than the boat just a
little anchors running buttons both of
these speakers allow you to control your
music and user voice assistant what if
you want to see that in action check out
their individual reviews when it comes
to sound quality these speakers are also
very different like I said earlier the
Bose Soundlink revolved plus suits music
out in all 360 degrees and it does a
great job of evenly blanketing an area
it also has a very balanced sound
signature and for its size you can get
pretty loud the Sony SLS actually fully
under their hand only shoots sound out
in one direction and it's important to
note that it is a bass focused speaker
that's what the xB in the name stands
for what the extra bass feature turned
on obviously it's going to have a lot of
bass blood kin sound a little shallow at
times but if you're listening to hip-hop
rap or EDM the Sony f6x 840 will give
you a very satisfying thump if the bass
on the sound like revolve Plus does
leave you wanting more it's the same
issue I have with the QC 35 wireless
earphones so if you listen to music with
a lot of bass it's a no-brainer guess
it's only concerning loudness so Sony is
a little louder than the Bose but just
by a little bit but at higher volumes
the Sony does outperform the boat when
cranked all the way up the Bose
Soundlink Raval plus does sound with a
drowned out and when playing music out
of moderate volume the sony xba-40 does
have a lot more depth to it
the sound of the Bose is much more
forward and the vocal separation is
better and the highs are good what I
feel the Sony has more character to it
now I want to point out some major
differences between these two speakers
if you haven't noticed by marrows or
sony xox sv40 has built-in leds that
flash to the beat of your music and you
can adjust the light show from Sony's
app along with having a long battery
life the xB 40 also doubles as a power
bank so you can charge your phone if
you're out camping
the XP also has very clear wireless
connections so clear in fact that it's
hard for me to tell the difference
between a wired connection and a
wireless connection on the XP 48 with
the both I can tell exactly when there's
a wide connection and a wireless
connection but one plus the Bose
Soundlink evolved plus has over the Sony
is that it's mobile app actually works
and being able to remotely turn on the
both from your phone is the big plus I
would sex before he could do that also
the Bose sound we've evolved also has a
far superior microphone onboard which
allow you to take phone calls but with
all that being said if you're a college
student or if you're looking for a
speaker to use in your bedroom and take
with you to barbecues camping or to the
pool I would say go with the Sony SRX be
40 it's far more versatile has that deep
bass and it's a little louder and 50 L
is cheaper the bullet settlement
revolves is better suited if you're
looking for something elegant of place
in your living room or around the house
it'll have no problem filling a room but
if you want to get a party really going
it's going to struggle a bit festive
sound does drown at higher volumes
personally I prefer the Sony S or SSB 40
over the Bose Soundlink revolt plus it's
far more versatile slightly cheaper and
I prefer its sound over the votes but
keep in mind I listen to a lot of rap
EDM hip-hop and so on so depending on
your musical tastes the bose might
perform better also don't forget to
check out either of these speakers
