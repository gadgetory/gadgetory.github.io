earphones with the introduction of the
new w1 chip they also have a different
type of wireless earphone style for
almost every type of consumer but there
are some people that still prefer
wireless earphones or earbuds for a few
reasons
those reasons could either be for sound
quality not having to worry about
battery life connectivity issues or even
just price and today we've got the odd
boss DB 0 1 and DB 0 2 for review
disclaimer here
I bought this Cindy's over forgive you
but my review and thoughts on these
products are solely my own with that
being said you can pick up the DB 0 2
for 59.99 or you can pick up the DB 0 1
for $47.99
over at Amazon there are a few subtle
differences between the two and I'll get
into that in just a second like to pick
these guys up is in the description
unboxing both with your zero phones is
basically identical the packaging is
nice and once you remove the lid you're
greeted by the ear phones themselves and
two pairs of extra silicon new ticks
under all of that you'll find the hard
shell carrying case and inside the
carrying case you'll find another pair
of silicon ear tips and a pair of foam
ear tips all in all in either box you're
getting the wired earbuds a total of
four silicone ear tips one pair of foam
ear tips and a carrying case that puts
both beats by dre and jaybird session
from a design standpoint both of these
earbuds are gorgeous there's real metal
and wood on these guys the wire in the
other hand seems a little thin and likes
to get tangle a lot if you leave the
earbuds in your pocket for a while
both of these your phones also have the
same inline control around them it's
just this cool metal cylinder with three
buttons on the front and a mic on the
back the buttons themselves are well
laid out and they have a very satisfying
click to them and they work just fine
with both Apple and Android devices I
just wish they had a little separation
between them or a raised texture on them
so you can tell them apart a little
better by just touch well that these
guys come with the standard 3.5
millimeter headphone jacks sound quality
wise both of these earphones sound
really good there are very clear across
the whole spectrum and they have a very
punchy bass they're also very loud as
well sound quality between the DB 0 1
and DB 0 2 is slightly different the
soundstage on the DB 0 2 is a little
wider and the range is slightly more
dynamic both of these earbuds are in
your earbuds and create a good enough
seal that provides passive noise
isolation like I mentioned earlier you
also get a total of
four pairs of silicon chips you can make
them fit just right they also have foam
ear tips that create an even better seal
but just keep in mind these foam tips
are not as comfortable as to comply your
tips that come with Jaybirds and they
get a little itchy after a while the
design of the bottom of the DB 0 1 and
the DB 0 2 is also slightly different
the DB 0 1 have a simpler linear design
which managed to get deep into your ear
canal without any issues the DB 0 2 on
the other hand have a more refined
design
they're also angled which means the buds
can still get deep into your canal but
the rest of the bus sits better in your
ear which results in slightly more
comfort whether you decide to go with
the DB 0 1 or the DB 0 2 you still get
the same hard shell carrying case which
honestly is much better than the
silicone coin purse you get with either
the power beats 3 or the beats X and
it's also better than the carrying pouch
you get with the J Brand X 3 there's
also a mesh liner on the inside of the
case where you can store your lightning
to headphone jack adapter if you have an
iPhone 7 yes the future is Wireless but
there are still some kinks that need to
be worked out especially when it comes
to sound quality and the sound fidelity
Department which is why there are some
people that still prefer to use white
earbuds some people also just use white
earbuds because they don't want to shell
out a hundred and fifty dollars for the
beats X or the power beats and for 59.99
or $47.99
you're getting pretty solid sounding
earphones and not to mention they're
really good-looking the one grab I do
have about both of these earbuds is the
wired itself I'm just worried it's a
little too thin if a boss has a DB 0-3
in the works I would like to see
something with a durable rope and a
slightly revised in my controller hey if
