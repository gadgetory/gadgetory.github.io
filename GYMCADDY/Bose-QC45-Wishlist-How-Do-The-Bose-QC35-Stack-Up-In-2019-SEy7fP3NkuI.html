premium ANC headphones on the market
right now and there's a whole bunch more
on the way the most common question that
I get in my comments is when are the
bose QC 45s coming out now i don't know
the bose QC forty-fives are going to be
coming out next week next month or next
year but I thought I would make a wish
list as to what I would like to see from
the most QC 45s and showcase how the
aging both QC 35s stack up against some
of 2019 sanc headphones the original
bose qc25 s were released around june
2016
and then the both QC 35 series 2 were
released in September 2017 the only
technical difference between the
original bose QC 35 s and the series 2
was the addition of this action button
so technically the both QC 35s are over
two and a half years old now which from
a product standpoint is a long time
because Sony has been updating their
1000x headphones year over year and
we're currently on the Sony 1000x mark 3
so the first thing I want to see upgrade
on the bose QC 45s is the addition of
USB seam and I think this is pretty much
a given
right now most $350 ANC headphones are
coming with USB C now the reason USB C
is a big deal is if you have an Android
device you can charge your phone and
headphones with the same cable which is
super convenient but USB C is also able
to handle more power than a microUSB
port which as a result will mean better
fast charging right now the bose QC 35 s
have a rated fast charging of 15 minutes
gets you two and a half hours of
playback time whereas the Sony's get you
5 hours from a 10 minute charge so I
would like to see the both QC 45s at
least match or exceed the m3s fast
charging numbers but Bose has to step up
the QC 45 is battery life the both QC 35
s have an advertised battery life of 20
hours which is below average for 2019
but at least is better than the surface
headphones because these only have a 15
hour
battery life but I would like to see the
Bose QC 45s to have a battery life
between 30 and 35 hours cuz the Sony
1000x and three's have an advertised
battery life for 30 hours and the Jabra
elite 85 h's are slated to have a 32
hour battery life now when it comes to
design and comfort there are some minor
changes I would like to see from the
most QC 45s now one of the best things
to boast QC 35s has going for them is
that they are perhaps the most
comfortable ANC headphones on the market
the ear cups are super spacious and they
are without a doubt big head approved
obviously I would like to buzz QC 45 is
to keep the super species ear cups but I
would like for both to slim down the
headband and make it more low-profile
now something a lot of companies are
doing these days is that they're
throwing on touch pads onto the
headphones cuz it makes them look
fancier I guess and when they're
implemented well like on the Sony's I
don't mind them but I personally think
Bose should stick to having physical
buttons on their QC 45s
cuz for some casual users choosing
between physical buttons or a touch pad
could be a major deciding factor some
people just don't want to deal with
finicky touch pads or phantom presses
however I would like to see Bose to add
an additional action button on their
left ear cup when the bose qc25 series 2
were released they were the first ANC
headphones with Google assistant
integration and you could interact with
your voice assistant by using this
button now I'm fully aware that if you
press and hold on the multi-purpose
button you can talk to your voice
assistant but it's not as efficient as
having a dedicated button turn on the
studio lights and music sure turning on
to lights and now since more and more
headphones or getting voices integration
I think voice assistant integration on
headphones is here to stay you can even
choose which voice assistant you would
like to use these days but if you do
want to have voice assistant integration
on your headphones you end up
sacrificing some functionality on both
the Bose and Sony's you give up the
ability to manually
toggle between your active noise
cancellation settings so if you want to
turn your ANC up or off you have to open
up the app every single time which can
be annoying so this is why I would like
to both QC 45s to have two action
buttons one for your voice assistant and
another one so you can still manually
toggle your ANC settings you'd be
surprised that nobody has been able to
get this right yet and from a software
standpoint Bose desperately needs to add
a transparency mode to their bose qc25
almost every other pair of premium ANC
headphones has this feature Sony calls
it ambient mode and Microsoft calls it
enhanced mode but basically the
headphones will pump in the ambient
sound around you so you can still hear
what's going on if you're walking around
the city or if you work in an office and
also think Bose needs to add a quick
attention mode like on the Sony's so you
can talk to someone really quickly
without having to take off your
headphones like this
and I think Bose could do this on their
QC 45s by pressing and holding down on
the dedicated ANC toggle action button I
mentioned earlier but the most important
thing Bose needs to improve under Bose
QC 45 is their active noise cancellation
plainly said the active noise
cancellation on the bose qc25 struggle
to keep up with the ANC on newer
headphones and just so you can see for
yourself we're gonna do an ANC test with
the bose qc25 s the surface headphones
and the sony 1000x and threes running
the latest 4.1.1 firmware update if you
know you know
the both QC 35s just aren't able block
out the same amount of noise as the
surface headphones and Sony 1000 XM
dream across the board
so obviously the both QC 45s need to
improve the amount of sound they block
out but it's also crucial Bose reduce
the amount of cabin pressure in their
ANC for some people like myself we just
can't wear the bus QC 35 s for too long
because we feel this pressure on our
eardrums that sometimes leads to
headaches and these days cabin pressure
and ANC headphones is associated with
older or cheaper ANC headphones cuz
newer headphones like the 1000 X and
threes or surface headphones don't have
a lot or any cabin pressure at all
and finally Bose also needs to rethink
the positioning of their ANC microphones
since the mics on the most kisi 35s are
so exposed the Bose QC thirty fives like
to pick up a lot of wind noise whereas
the ANC microphones on other headphones
are recessed into you the body thus
dramatically reducing the amount of wind
noise their headphones pick up now when
it comes to sound quality the Bose QC 35
s have a mature sound signature where
the bass just isn't going to hit like
some other headphones and since sound is
subjective
some people prefer neutral headphones
over bass heavy headphones but I would
definitely like to see the both QC 45s
to have an adjustable EQ and again since
sound is subjective people want to have
the ability to adjust the EQ on the
headphones so they can make him sound
however they want but in general Bose
does need to improve the base on their
QC 45s because sometimes the base on the
QC 35 s does bottom out in bass heavy
music which I feel is unacceptable for
315 all the headphones I would also like
to see Bose improve the microphone on
their headphones for phone calls even
though the microphone on the bose qc25
is on the better side there can still be
a little bit of static or tinny miss
here in
there and since these headphones are
usually marketed towards professionals
working corporate jobs I think a quality
microphone for phone calls would be
greatly appreciated
but finally I also want to point out
poses multi device connectivity the both
QC 35s can be connected to two devices
at the same time which is great because
it means you can hot-swap from your
phone to your computer and effortlessly
even though this might seem like a basic
feature some headphones like the 1000x
and threes can do that which is pretty
annoying and I think it's a huge
oversight on Sony's part so obviously I
would like to both QC 45s to have this
feature but I would also like them to
improve upon it I think if the QC 45s
can get up to five simultaneous
connections
I think power users with multiple phones
tablets and computers would really like
that but overall that's my wish list for
the bose QC 45 and i think everything is
well within reason I'm not asking for
anything over the top and I think these
improvements would better position the
Bose QC 45s to compete against 2019
newer headphones cuz right now I think
the Bose QC fives are lagging behind the
competition cuz of their specs and
feature set cuz as of right now I'm a
little hard pressed to you recommend the
bose qc25
over the sony 1000x m3 unless you really
need those super spacious your cuts but
comment down below what other
improvements would you like to see on
the bose qc25

didn't you realize if you want to pick
