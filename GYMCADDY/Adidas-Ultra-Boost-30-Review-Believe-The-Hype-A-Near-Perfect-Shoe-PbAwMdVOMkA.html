really been moving up thanks to the
release of popular shoes like the easies
nmds and the ultra boots and if you were
to talk to any serious runner or sneaker
head out there they will tell you how
amazing the old shoe boots are they
routinely rave about how the shoulder
shoe is super comfortable how
lightweight they are for running or how
incredibly stylish they are let's find
out what makes the ocean blue 3.0 so
special and are they really worth the
180 dollar price tag you can pick up a
pair of ultra boost three-point nose
over a finish line comm link is in the
description so what do these shoes have
in common with today's supercars well
they both have continental rubber making
contact with the asphalt the rubber on
these shoes give them superb grip
continental also claims this rubber is
extra denser or last year while if you
go running on that just keep in mind
these shoes are only for street running
and they don't fare so well if you
decide to take them off road for some
reason moving up from the continental
rubber we have adidas now famous ultra
boost midsole
the Mitchell here is exactly the same as
the ultra boost 1.0 2.0 an uncaged if it
ain't broken don't fix it for anyone out
there who has never worn a pair of old
boots all I can say is believe the hype
after wearing these shoes for a few days
I now don't want to wear anything else
but ultra boost the one gripe I do have
with these shoes is the real overhang of
the sole obviously they're for runners
that are heel strikers but I did find
myself tripping over it if I didn't
raise my heel enough when walking but
that's just me every single person has a
different style of walking but that's a
topic for a whole different video next
up is a prime net out of all of the
ultra boots
this is my favorite iteration yet it's
super stretchy allows for amazing air
circulation and it's all one piece of
fabric the primary on the ultra booster
Plano is now somewhat reminiscent to the
easies as in it has a raised woven look
and it gives us the sense of motion gone
although 1.0 and 2.0 primeknit patterns
and in is this clean look that looks
great either if you're running on them
or just wearing them with a pair of dark
wash jeans the case on the ultra booster
ripper know is pretty much the same as
the 1.0 and 2.0 s except it's a little
more flexible and it's now a little
translucent your flexibility really adds
to the comfort of the shoe but they
still provide sufficient lockdown if you
want to keep your shoes in place if you
take them for a run the heel counter on
the back of the shoe is much stiffer
than the cage and really make sure to
keep your heel in place while you're out
walking just like the previous ultra
boost these shoes are true to size but
due to their super stretchy primeknit up
if you like a snug feeling shoe then you
should go down a size keep in mind these
shoes also have an extremely soft sole
which makes them great if you have a job
where you're walking or standing all day
or if we want to use them for running
but due to their super soft sole these
shoes should not be worn when doing
weighted exercise like to squat or
deadlift their sole allows for large
amounts of ankle and hip rotation and
knee adduction which will cause poor
form and lead to injury but that's also
another topic for another video
overall the adidas ultra boost reppin o
is an amazing shoe which really lives up
to the hype they're super comfortable
lightweight and the new Prime Minister's
ein makes them a very stylish shoe you
can wear just about anywhere adidas is
quickly becoming my new favorite brand
because they really do listen to their
customers they saw people on social
media uncaging their shoes and adidas
responded by releasing their own version
adidas also realize the OSHA boost
wasn't just appealing to runners but
also sneaker heads and average consumers
alike and they released a shoe that does
a great job of pleasing everyone if you
currently have a pair of 1.0 2.0 or
uncaged you don't need to upgrade to the
3.0 's unless you want to but if you
don't have a pair of ultra boost and
you're looking for something nice then I
say get them during your perfect shoe
well if you made it this far and leave
us alike it really helps if you like
videos like this subscribe there's more
to come if you're looking for more
