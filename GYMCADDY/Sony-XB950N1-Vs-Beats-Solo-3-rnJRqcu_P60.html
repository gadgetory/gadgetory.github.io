versus video between the Sony XP 950 n1
and the beef so no three a good friend
of mine is in the market for some
headphones and they don't really want to
spend more than $300
he's also a big fan of hip hop and R&amp;amp;B
so naturally the Sony xb9 to the n1 and
the beats solo 3 came to mind so let's
compare the two so money wise the sony
xb9 50 n1 retail for around $250 and
coming two colorways black or green to
be solo three coming eight different
colorways and when it comes to price
things get a little interesting Apple
site currently sells them for two
hundred ninety nine ninety five but I
found an awesome deal directly from
Amazon where the glossy black ones on
sale for one eighty nine ninety nine and
you can get most of the other colors for
$219 or less I'm not sure how long does
it last but I'll have links in the
description below so you can get either
one sure both the Sony xb9 fifty and one
in the beats solo2 are made mostly out
of plastic and they have very similar
build qualities but these two products
are very different from one another
and I believe they targets you very
differently so these two headphones have
two very different designs the Sony
headphones are on the larger side and
like I've said in past videos you can
still see them in your peripheral vision
when you put them on some people might
even say they still a little silly
walking around with them on in public
the Sony Xperia 50n one also have two
very important features to beat so those
three don't have in this noise
cancellation and an extra base feature
but the beats solo 3 also has two
features are certainly X being 950 and
one doesn't have and that's the w1 chip
and fast charging capabilities and not
to mention their smaller size make them
a whole lot easier to travel like I just
said I think Sony and beats by dre aka
Apple are going for two very different
consumers but also certainly headphones
are larger their ear cups go over the
ear which results in added comfort and
better passive noise isolation they also
have an extra base feature which is
meant for people who absolutely love
bake you can even adjust how much space
they have through their smartphone now
the Sony exponentially anyone also have
active noise cancellation which says a
very decent job it's not as good as the
Bose to see 35 but the noise
cancellation is still very good this
leads me to believe that Sony is really
trying to cave into audio files looking
for something relatively affordable
Apple on the other hand seems to be
catering for the average Joe everyday
user the beats all three have a 40 hour
battery life which just destroys the
Sony xb9 to the enones 22 hours a day
they also have Apple's new w1 chip that
just makes switching between either of
your Apple devices super easy sure the
Sony xb9 50 n1 has bluetooth 4.1 and
pair with up to two devices
simultaneously
but switching between different devices
just isn't as seamless as a beat solo 3
so if you're heavily invested into Apple
2 ecosystem the W 1 chip might matter a
lot the beats oh look we also feature
fast fuel which will get you 3 hours of
playback from just 5 minutes of charging
and if you're always on the go this
feature can really come in handy Apple
is really pushing there it just works
philosophy with ease sound wise beats by
dre have always been based heavy and to
be sold through your nose section they
sound a little better than the beeps
hello - but that's not saying the based
on the solos we can be a little
overpowering at times the high screen
your little tinny and sound stage isn't
as wide as other headphones in the $300
price bracket there's only XP 950 anyone
on the other hand sounds way better and
as the box implies these headphones have
a lot of basic but unlike the beats
total 3 the bass on the Sony SB 950 and
one isn't overpowering it's very clear
and they actually add to the listening
experience instead of reducing the
overall sound quality like I mentioned
earlier
traveling with the beats solo 3 can be a
little easier due to their smaller size
and they also come included with the
soft shell carrying case it doesn't do
much but I do prefer it over the pouch
Sony includes with their xb9 kpn one if
you do decide to travel with the XP 950
and one it would be a good idea to
invest in a third party hardshell case
overall Sounion Apple took two very
different approaches with the headphones
Apple decided to push their a chose
worse philosophy by giving the beats
solo three or four hour battery life SAS
feel in a w1 chip that makes switching
between your Apple devices agreed but
the beats all operate aren't the most
comfortable headphones out there and or
sound quality is just mad
Sony on the other hand is trying to give
premium features at a reasonable price
back to noise cancellation on the Sony
XP 950 n1 is decent and they generally
sound really good not to mention their
extra bass feature really
make them stand out but their larger
size and shorter battle age can be a
setback if you're always on the go with
them not to mention reverting back to
Bluetooth 4.1 after using the w12 for a
while can be a little annoying
first of all problem if I had to choose
between the two I would pick this only
SP 950 n1 hands down but get into gloss
black beats solo pretty from 180 999 is
a pretty solid feel hey if you made it
