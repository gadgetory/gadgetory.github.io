Mecca 3 or Reebok 907 that's why you
might be take right now if you're in the
market for a pair of new classic shoes
it's no Apple versus Android dilemma for
the dilemma nonetheless criticals it's a
tried and tested Reebok Nano or should
you go with the new kid on the block
Nike Mecca well it's not an easy answer
but I'll hold your hand and help you
through this life-changing decision at
the time of this recording you can pick
up the Nike makan free on Amazon for 130
with free shipping or you can pick up
the Nano 7 directly from Reebok for 1
$29.99 with free shipping as well look
for both shoes are in the description
below
ok first thing for if you're slowly
confirmed with style and comfort and
nothing else
the Nike makan 3 is your best bet the
Nike make up doing is leaps and bounds
much more comfortable than the Reebok
907 the make on three sole and upper are
extremely flexible compared to the Nano
7 and as I said it in my Nano 7 review
the nanos are extremely narrow in the
toe box and the Nano wheel on these
shoes doesn't flex all too well which
causes some discomfort so if you've got
wider feet you've got to go to Mecca on
three by default and it doesn't hurt
that the mic on three look pretty bad as
compared to the Nano seven red one goes
to MEC on now if you're looking for a
durable shoe then you'll want to
consider the Reebok 907 although the
Nano weave doesn't flex - well like I
just mentioned it's extremely durable
you can rub the shoes upper on any
surface and not have to worry about it
getting worn out or torn if you're
looking for something to run a Tough
Mudder in the Nano 7 is your best bet
the beautiful thing about saying this is
anyone can tailor the training regimen
to their exact liking if you're an
athlete that likes to do a lot of
circuit training bodyweight exercises
agility drills or plyometric exercises
then I think the mic on 3 is a good
option for you although there are pretty
low profile and don't offer much ankle
support the flexibility and Christian
drop in Mitchell's really help when it
matters most
there are also extremely supportive when
it comes to rope climbing thanks to
their outsole design don't get me wrong
the Nano 7th tread pattern and grip tape
helped but not as much as the Meccan 3
not to mention the main country also
featured the TPU heel clip on the back
which helped your heels slide on the
wall if you're doing wall standing
push-ups if you're weightlifter that
does dead lives jerks clean squats and
anything else in between the Reebok Nano
7 is better suited for you they have a
much surface stroke compared to the MEK
on three they also offer much more ankle
stability and support them
three so if you're looking for something
that will give you a solid foundation to
do your lift but still allow you to do a
few sprints or box jumps efficiently let
the nanos are for you but neither one of
these shoes are perfect first off the
Nike my country need improvement when it
comes to fit and lockdown
although the Meccan three feature nike
flywire system they allow a lot of heel
slippage it's almost like you're wearing
sandals I did find that we're in sector
socks did help the Makana stay in place
my advice is to redesign the TPU heel
wrap and make it one piece and make it a
little bit more concave so it has your
heel also better quality laces and a
padded tongue wouldn't hurt I would also
redesign the top portion of the outsole
to help with the traction for when your
sled pushing something along the lines
of Weddington nano 7 have stopped with
the stylized outsole Nike and make
something functional the Reebok nano 7
need improvement as well especially when
it comes to the fit the middle portion
of the Reebok 907 is extremely narrow
they also need to add some flexibility
to the Nano weave upper Reebok also
needs to go back and play around with
the stiffness of the Mitchell of the
shoe the still Mitchell is great for
lifting butter bad for plyometric
exercises or runs if I wanted a
weightlifting shoe I would have gotten
the lifter plus 2.0 so what's the
verdict if you apply metrics or ideally
to any kind of person than the make on
three or four you if you're more into
barbell movements can enjoy doing amrap
sets then go for the Nano seven
personally I prefer the Meccan three
over the Nano seven because you fit
comfort and style if you do decide to go
with the make on three go down half the
size if your goal with the Nano seven
they fit true to size lengthwise but
remember they are narrow and under lap
length for each shoes individual review
