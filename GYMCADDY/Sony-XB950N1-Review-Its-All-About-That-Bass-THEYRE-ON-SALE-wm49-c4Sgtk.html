things drop since they were first
announced back at CES 2017 and for those
who don't know these are the sony MDR XB
950 and 1 and what makes these earphones
stand out is their extra base feature
these your phones are made for people
who don't just like bass they're meant
for people who really love these so the
Sony SB 950 and one worth your money or
worth an upgrade
let's find out all right let's talk
money the Sony xb9 50 and 1 are the new
kid on the block and Curly retail for
around $250 they currently come in two
colorways you can get them in black or
you can also get them in green I
personally really like that green one
but I was only able to get the black one
if you want to take some cash you can
also get the Sony xb9 50 b1 for about
$50 cheaper you'll just be missing out
on features like noise cancellation
overall sound quality improvements and a
slightly longer battery life I'll have
links in the description below so you
can pick either one of these up unboxing
these actual earphones is really nothing
special once you lift the lid for the
box that came inside the box or the
actual earphones themselves under the
earphones you'll find some documentation
a soft carrying case and audio cable and
a USB cable sadly there's no Baldwin
included so you'll have to use a USB
slot on your computer or your own wall
board to charge these headphones up for
people out there who have never seen
this on the XP 950 and one or the XP 950
b1 in person just know these earphones
are huge for the most part over the ear
headphones are big but personally I
think the Sony xb9 50 + 1 + v1 just take
the cake they're so big that when you
put them on you can actually still see
them in your peripheral vision
concerning materials the majority of
these earphones is made up of plastic
there is some metal on the headband
which does limit the flexibility of that
such as you expect a padding on these
earphones is very soft
the padding also doesn't overheat after
long listening sessions the air comes
themselves swiveling pivots very
smoothly these earphones also now
foldable which is a new feature that
isn't found on last year's model
connectivity wise these reforms are
using bluetooth for that one and we'll
work to fly on with almost any device
range on these guys is around 30 feet 40
feet if you're really lucky and have
direct line-of-sight to whatever device
you're streaming also there's also an
NFC contact
on one of the ear cups so you can make
setup a little easier if you have an
Android device personally I would have
really liked to have seen these
earphones come with the w1 chip instead
being able to switch between either of
my Apple devices so effortlessly has
spoiled on the bottom of the left ear
cup you'll find the power button the
base effect button more on this in just
a second a micro USB slot and an audio
jack input and the noise cancellation
button on the bottom of the other
headphone Cup you'll find the volume
rocker aim a play/pause dongle this
little dongle does take some getting
used to but I really like this concept
and when it comes to battery life you
can expect to get around 22 hours of
playback time if you're using them
wirelessly and with those cancellation
on if you listen to them with noise
cancellation off and at a lower volume
you will get slightly longer battery
life
although these your phones are really
big there's still very lightweight and
comfortable to wear the sound quality of
these earphones is vastly improved from
the sound quality xb 950 b1 although
these your phones are meant for people
who absolutely love bass these earphones
still sound good period vocals mid lows
and highs all sound very clear and these
earphones also have a very wide
soundstage
and obviously when it comes to bass
these things sound like nothing out
there on the market right now the bass
on these things is just this clear and
clean thump that doesn't take away from
the overall sound quality
like other earphones do and when the
bass really starts going on these
earphones they're basically just a
massage in the side of your head the
best thing about these earphones is that
you can actually control the amount of
bass from your smartphone app personally
I like a little more bass so I've raised
mine to 7 the app also lets you change
the surround effect for your earphones
but after playing with it I'm just gonna
keep that one off
it really just distorts the sound for me
also are these earphones on a plane a
few days ago and found the noise
cancellation to be very good
everything from the airplane cabin noise
to traffic and even just people in
terminals was filtered out nicely I also
notice that the noise cancellation on
the XP 950 n1 didn't give me any kind of
headache after a while like the bose
qc25 do i have ax other people if they
get headaches from we're in the QC 35
and for the most part they said no so I
guess I'm just a special special
snowflake the extra base feature on
these earphones is not just great for
music but it's also just as good for
movies action scenes and explosions just
come to life and it's almost like you're
there except you're not getting shot
like I mentioned earlier these earphones
also came included with the carrying
case and audio cable and microUSB cable
if you decide to use your earphones
wired you can still benefit from the
bass boost goodness also in order to get
a full charge in these earphones it's
gonna take about seven hours
concerning the carrying case I am a
little disappointed you really just get
a bag that doesn't do much of anything
overall the Sony xb9 50 and one is a big
improvement over the xb9 50 b1 they
sound better their noise cancellation is
very decent and they have a 22 hour
battery life and being able to control
the bass level is a very welcome feature
a few critiques i need to point out are
the blinds on these earphones since
they're flush with the surface it can be
a little hard to know what you're
pressing i would also like to see some
type of quick charging feature on these
earphones and like i mentioned earlier i
would have liked to have seen these
earphones come to w1 chip instead but
besides that these earphones are great
for people who love bass listen to a lot
of hip-hop techno or R&amp;amp;B or like to
watch a lot of action movies these are
up there in my top three favorite
earphones hey if you made it this far i
