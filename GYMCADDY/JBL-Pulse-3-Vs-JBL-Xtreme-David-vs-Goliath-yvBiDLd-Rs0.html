it is JBL pulls three versus the much
larger JBL extreme the post three is the
newest product in JBL lineup and the
extreme is the most expensive portable
bluetooth speaker JBL has for sale and a
lot of people claim JBL extreme is the
best speaker it is segment so which is
right for you we're about to find out
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe
and you can watch my JBL posted a review
video here after you didn't watch in
this video I try to make my vs. videos
as fair as possible by picking products
in relatively the same price range the
JBL pulls three comes in two colorways
black or white and retails for 199 95
just keep in mind the white version
should be released in September the JBL
extreme we chose for two hundred ninety
nine ninety five it comes in three
colorways
black blue or red but I have seen the
JBL extreme on sale for as low as two
hundred twenty nine dollars over at
Amazon if you want to pick either these
speakers up I'll have links in the
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best deals
possible the JBL Xtreme is not just a
Beulah SMO spensive portable bluetooth
speaker it's also their biggest it
absolutely dwarfs the post 3 in the
charge stream it's also twice as heavy
as upholstery
weighing in at four point seven pounds
or 2.1 kilos the poles 3-ways 2.1 pounds
or 960 grams the JBL Xtreme is in the
same weight class as the sony xba-40
just like the JBL flip for in charge 3
the extreme is covered in a nylon mesh
weave that makes you really rugged and
it doesn't show them any stains the JBL
extreme also has the largest past
radiators in tables lineup what's the
diameter of sixty three millimeters
which is like two and a half inches the
extreme also has control buttons on top
that are identical to the charge three
you can play or pause your music
skip a track adjust your volume
activates here by pressing and holding
the play blade and you've got JBL's
connect by him one gripe I do have with
JBL speakers is that you can't go back a
track by triple pressing the play blind
like you can on other speakers
bottom of the extreme you'll also notice
it's about engage and on the back
there's a zipper that houses three USB
ports one of which is for servicing the
extreme and the other two can charge
your devices like a phone or a tablet
there's also an aux jack in a PowerPoint
the extreme has rubber feet so you can
rest a flat on the table but if you must
you can also stand it on its side it
even has some hooks and came included
with a very nice quality strap so
traveling with it can be a little easier
the debut post 3 has the same
cylindrical design as all of the other
JBL speakers it also has dual passive
radiators with a diameter of 45
millimeters or 1.7 inches the majority
of the body is made out of really hard
plastic and the bottom portion which
houses the 340 millimeter transducers is
covered in the same nylon mesh width as
the extreme on the back you'll also find
a battery gate and the same buttons like
the extreme which let you do the same
thing except the post 3 has a JBL
connect plus plain and there's a bind so
you can cycle through the different
lighting modes and if you watched any of
my other videos I really wish the
buttons with textured others were
organic you also find an ox Jack a new
micro USB port for charging
unfortunately you can't charge other
devices with the pulse 3 when it comes
to battery life obviously the JBL
extreme will last longer than the pulse
3 because it has a 10,000 milliamp
battery and it doesn't have a light
feature power JBL advertises a 15 hour
battery from the extreme when i've
managed to squeeze out a little more
than 17 hours of playback time with the
volume set at 50% the post 3 is rocking
a 6 thousand milliamp battery and
advertises a battery life of 12 hours
but in my testing what the volume set at
70% and the brightness of the light
feature set at 25%
I've managed to squeeze out 13 hours of
playback time and what the light feature
turned off I've managed to get 15 I
would play back time but the way these
speakers are charged is very different
you can charge the post 3 with the
microUSB cable but you have to charge
the JBL extreme with the supply power
brick if you take the pull story to your
friend's house you can use their micro
USB cables to charge the speaker on the
other hand if you take the JBL extreme
with you somewhere
you have to remember to take this
charging cable the post three in this
hypothetical situation does get a
convenience factor if you're going to be
taking either these speakers with you
somewhere
just know that JBL extreme is splash
proof if it gets hit by a little bit of
water it'll be just fine but JBL has
made it very clear that do not submerge
it under water what the JBL post three
is ipx7 certified you can get it wet
submerged under water and it'll be just
fine
it even floats and keeps playing music
like a boss but even though the post
three might be a little more resilient
than two JBL extreme just keep in mind
you do run the risk of scratching the
plastic top if you're too rough on it
but if Portability and durability is a
main concern for you then you might be
better off with the post three when it
comes to connectivity the JBL pulse 3 is
using bluetooth for that too it can be
paired to multiple devices at the same
time and it has a range of around 70
feet it also does a great job of keeping
a solid connection between multiple
walls in the house the JBL extreme is
using bluetooth 4.1 and you can also
pair it to multiple devices at the same
time what I did notice the range is
slightly shorter at around 50 feet and
it does struggle to keep us on a
connection between multiple walls there
is a quirk I want to point out about the
JBL extreme every time a video starts
doesn't delay in the audio like at the
beginning of this clip it's not late in
silicon the JBL charge 3 the audio in
the video sync up afterwards it's not a
big deal
but I just I should know about it ok
it's sound quality time like I said in
past videos and I've made a few the JBL
Poe story is the good sounding speaker
it has a good a metal base with the mids
and highs are very clear it has a wide
soundstage with a good amount of death
there's good instrument separation and
there's really little rasping as telling
this or distortion at higher volumes and
it's a 360 degree speaker and it does a
great job of evenly blanketing an area I
have no complaints it's good for
listening indoors and it's OK for
outside the day beyond extreme sound
profile is very similar to the post 3
but it has a lot more bass and it gets
significantly
this thing will rattle your walls if
your main priority is based and loudest
the dejay bill extreme is the obvious
choice it's no wonder is called the JBL
extreme just keep in mind it only shoots
out down to the front and if you play
music on it while it's plugged in it
will get a little louder and it will
have a little bit more face the JBL
extreme is great if you have a really
really big room to fill or if you're
going to use it outside both of these
speakers could also be paired to other
JBL speakers but here's the catch the
JBL extreme is using the older JBL
connect it can only pair with other JBL
speakers using JBL connect like to
charge three or poles to the pulse three
is using JBL connect plus which means it
can only be paired to other JBL connect
plus enabled speakers like the JBL sub
for another post three or future JBL
products I know it sucks but technology
has to evolve if you plan on getting
more JBL speakers in the future then the
post three is the way to go but if you
just want to get one speaker and you
don't have any plans to pair multiple
speakers together then you'll be just
fine with the JBL extreme both of these
speakers connected gpo's mobile app
setup is easy and you can do things like
manage settings check your battery
status and manage multiple speakers if
you have been paired together you don't
really have to use it that often but J
build zap is a little different for the
pull-string JBL is connect app allows
you to play with the light feature of
your pulse three four stories you can
adjust the brightness and obviously the
brightness of the light feature will
play a role in the speaker's fabulous
you can also cycle through the different
light settings they all flash to the
beat of your music but they each do so a
little differently there's ways jet
explosion equalizer Ray's rainbow fire
and you can even make your own and you
can change the color of each setting
either through color matching with your
camera or you can just use the color
wheel and if you flipped upholstery
upside-down the light feature will
orient itself personally my favorite
light setting is either jet or explosion
what I wish you could have more
customization options like being able to
pair you all two colors together
but at the end of the day which is right
for you if you want something a little
smaller a little more portable something
that's ipx7 certified then the poultry
is right for you
it sounds good it's great for personal
listening and it has no problem filling
your room and not to mention you get the
best life feature on the market and
it'll be compatible with future jbo
products but if you want something
really loud without all bunch of bass
that the JBL extreme is a good option I
would get to JBL extreme if it was just
going to live in my bedroom but just a
heads up I think there will be a new JBL
extreme announce at the next CES if you
want to learn more about the JBL post 3
