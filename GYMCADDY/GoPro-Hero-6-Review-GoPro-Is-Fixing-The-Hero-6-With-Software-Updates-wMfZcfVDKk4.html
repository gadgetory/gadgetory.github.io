of people were complaining about grainy
video quality and claiming the GoPro
Hero 5 was still superior to the hero 6
but through the magic of software
updates GoPro has fixed a lot of the
image quality issues on the hero 6 but
it's still not perfect don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe and you can
watch some of my other videos here after
you don't what's in this video for the
sake of this video you're gonna see
footage taken with the GoPro Hero six
Hero 5 session and a little bit from the
iPhone 8 plus and Sony Alpha 6000 with
the kit lens GoPro decided to go up
market a little bit by pricing new hero
6 at $499.99 and keeping the hero 5 at
the same $399.99 from last year the
cheapest GoPro you can get right now is
the session with the price of one $49.99
if you want to pick either of these
cameras up I'll have links in the
description below and I'll keep them
updated so you can get the best view
possible it really helps out a channel
from the outside the GoPro Hero 6 looks
identical to the hero 5 the only way to
know which is which is by looking for
the name on the left side of the lens
which it itself is hard to see in most
conditions and the text is super small
GoPro should have at least given the
hero 6 a different colorway but aside
that you've got your LCD screen on the
front that tells you basic info at a
glance in almost any lighting condition
it'll tell you its current shooting mode
available storage and current battery
status on the back you've got your LED
touchscreen which works fairly well if
you have smaller fingers on the right
side you've got your power slash mode
button and on the top you've got your
record button if you open the
compartment on the left side you'll find
a USB type-c port for charging and data
transferring and a mini HDMI port just
like the hero 5 and just like the hero 5
the hero 6 also has the same 1220
milliamp removable battery the hero 6
also comes with the same accessories as
the Hero 5 you get a mounting case to 3m
bases and a USB type-c to USB cable what
really makes the GoPro Hero six stand
out from the hero 5 aside from improved
image quality after the 1.6 software
update which was released on November
20th is GoPros custom does
gp1 processor the ability to now shoot
in 4k 60 frames per second which means
smoother 4k video the ability to shoot
1080p at 240 frames per second which
means super slow motion video in 1080p
HD or photo modes and the best image
stabilization I have ever seen on a
camera or smartphone
you also notice the screen on the hero
six is a little more color accurate than
the hero five the new processor under
hero six also allows for ever so
slightly smoother and quicker graphics
when navigating through the menus a
slightly more responsive touchscreen
experience and the hero 6 will start
recording and save files a little faster
than the hero five the hero 6 is also
able to transfer files faster to your
phone than the hero 5 the hero 6 also
keeps us to MU the connection with your
phone when you're using the GoPro app as
a viewfinder on your phone when you move
the camera there's much less of a delay
and it keeps a consistently smooth image
whereas with the hero 5 you'll notice
there's much more of a delay when moving
the camera and the connection fizzles
from time to time the hero 6 also now
allows you to digitally zoom in on your
subjects before you start recording not
during there are a few more features
that differentiate the hero 6 from the
hero 5 but I feel these are the most
important ones you should know about the
biggest standout feature of the hero 6
is its digital image stabilization when
I first saw the footage from the hero 6
I couldn't believe how stable it was for
comparison let's put the hero 6 up
against the iPhone 8 plus which uses
optical image stabilization on its main
camera right off the bat you'll notice
how much smoother the video is but more
importantly you see the GoPro doesn't
have any of that back and forth movement
that you can see on the iPhone 8 plus
you'll also notice the hero 6 has a
wider field of view while it's in linear
mode whereas the field of view on the
iPhone is much smaller in general you'll
also notice the hero 6 has a cooler
color palette while the iPhone has a
warmer feel to it when comparing the
digital image stabilization on the hero
6 versus the hero 5 it's a no-brainer
to be honest while I was reviewing the
video from the hero 5 I was worried that
I forgot to turn it image stabilization
on but I assure you it's on here you
also notice the image from the hero 6 is
slightly sharper colors are slightly
more vibrant and shadows are much darker
but although the image stabilization on
the hero 6 is incredible it doesn't work
when shooting at 4k 60 frames per second
or 1080p 240 frames per second
but all other shooting modes are fair
game and speaking of 4k 60 frames per
second and 1080 P 240 frames per second
you can only view those files in your
editing software if it supports HEV see
something I learned the hard way while I
was working in iMovie and the same goes
for a 2.7 K 60 frames per second in a
four by three aspect ratio and 2.7 K at
120 frames per second although the GoPro
Hero 6 has truly amazing digital in a
stabilization when you're shelling out
$500 for an action camera you're
probably going to expect amazing video
quality as you should but even after the
1.6 software they color accuracy is a
bit of a problem especially with the
color red first let's talk about the
Porsche Cayman gt4 and yes it's
pronounced Porsche I don't know what a
Porsche is it's clearly a white car with
red accents but the excessive saturation
on the hero six makes all of the red
sections look orange which is incredibly
weird because both the hero 5 and go
procession had no problem picking up
that they were red and this is also the
case with the red BMW on the hero 6 the
BMW looks orange in every single angle
whereas the hero 5 in session had no
problem picking up a more accurate red
color or from these video samples you
can clearly see the hero 6 has a much
sharper image a higher dynamic range it
has more contrast and it gets blown out
much less than the hero 5 or session but
again there's a lot more color
saturation going on which I personally
feel gives it more of a cinematic effect
but other colors like blues golds and
greens have no problem coming out
correctly hopefully this is just another
software issue that Goku will be able to
address in a future update
the GoPro Hero six also reduces the
amount of field of view options down to
three in most resolutions you've got
linear wide and super view to choose
from in linear mode the hero 6 has the
narrowest field of view but you'll
notice there's almost no image warping
lines stay straight and you get the most
realistic image in wide mode the hero 6
is able to take in more of the scene but
you will notice previously straight
lines start to curve inward this is your
classic action camera look and then
there's super view which takes in even
more of the scene
but you will notice there's even more
warping going on but super View is a
good option if you're going to be
recording in a cramped area like for
example if you're doing a car review and
you want to get as much of the interior
in a single shot or if you're recording
yourself while you're playing CQB
paintball or airsoft but if you want the
best quality from your GoPro then you
want to shoot strictly in linear mode
it's obvious the GoPro Hero six is
better than the Hero 5 particularly when
it comes to image stabilization and
image sharpness but there are a few key
areas with the Hero 5 outperforms a hero
6 like I mentioned earlier both of these
cameras have the same 1200 20,000,000
battery keep in mind battery life on a
camera varies a lot depending on which
shooting mode you're in but I noticed
that while I was out getting footage the
battery on the hero 6 drained about 13%
faster than the hero 5 and this was with
them at the same screen brightness and
screen off time and while shooting at
1080p 60 frames per second you would be
safe to assume the hero 6 has a better
battery life than the Hero 5 but as of
right now it doesn't again a few things
the possibility GoPro will be able to
address this battery issue in a future
software update after all the hero 6
does have their own in-house design GPU
and processor another area where the
GoPro Hero 5 outperforms a GoPro Hero 6
is the internal microphone right now
you're listening to me through the
internal microphone on the sony alpha
6000 now you're listening to me through
the internal microphone on the GoPro
Hero 5 obviously sound quality has been
reduced
but now you're listening to me through
the internal microphone on the GoPro
Hero six and the overall sound quality
has gotten even worse the microphone
picks up much less of my voice and
overall sounds pretty muffled I don't
know if this is a hardware issue or if
GoPro will be able to fix this through a
software update cuz right now the
microphone on the GoPro Hero six is
pretty bad just like the hero 5 the hero
6 also has voice commands you can tell
them both to start or stop recording
take a photo or turn off among other
things but now with the hero 6 you can
verbally tell it to turn on as long as
you have wake on voice activated so the
hero 6 will go into a low-power mode for
eight hours and still listen for the hot
word before fully turning off obviously
this will reduce your battery life but
while testing them I know this voice
commands were pretty responsive on both
cameras the biggest difference I noticed
was that the hero 5 had way more false
positives than the hero 6 the hero 5 got
a whole bunch of burst shots I did not
ask for GoPro start recording GoPro
stopped recording
GoPro take a photo
GoPro turn off
go pro turn on so let's answer this 500
dollar question is the GoPro Hero 6 with
an upgrade from the hero 5 if you're an
average Joe then no you can always just
stabilize your shaky footage from your
Hero 5 in post I'll be it it's now going
to look as good as a hero 6 I agree on
what Linus said the hero 6 is more of a
prosumer product a GoPro for
professionals or content creators that
want better image quality from their
GoPro the image stabilization alone on
the hero 6 is worth paying the extra
$100 over the hero 5 in order to get
that type of stabilization from your
hero 5 you're going to have to invest in
a gimbal image quality is better than
the hero 5 and I think it has the
potential to get even better through
software updates GoPro is probably
ironing out the kinks in your new GP 1
processor but keep in mind the hero 6
does take a hit in both the battery and
audio quality Department is this the
best GoPro ever it depends on who you
ask
if GoPro kept a price of the hero 6 at
$400 then it would have been hey if you
