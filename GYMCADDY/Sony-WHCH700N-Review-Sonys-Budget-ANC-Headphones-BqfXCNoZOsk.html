a while now you know how you absolutely
love to so many 1000 xm2 because of
their ANC performance but I know
dropping 350 dollars on a pair of
headphones is a lot for some people so
let's check out sony's newest and
cheapest ANC headphones the sony whch
710 and let's see how the anc on these
guys stacks up to the anc on the one
dozen XM - ok from here on out i'm going
to be referring to these headphones that
has the 700 ends these headphones come
in either black silver or blue colorways
and they currently retail for 199.99
like i mentioned earlier the 1000x and
two's usually we tell for $350 if you
want to pick either with these
headphones up I'll have links in the
description below and if you use the
links it really helps out the channel I
suggest you check them out cos Sony
headphones routinely go on sale so he
might get lucky
first let's go over what comes in the
box cuz I was genuinely surprised that
these headphones didn't come included
with at least a carrying pouch
regardless I still recommend you invest
in a hard shell carrying case if you
plan on traveling a lot with these
headphones these headphones do come
included with a 3.5 mm audio cable and a
short mic your USB cable for charging
and that's it these headphones will also
have a lot in common with the sony
xba-40 and one particularly when it
comes to the plastic body panels the
plastic on the 700 ends is more textured
whereas the 1000 X and choose plastic is
completely smooth the 700 ends also have
a stainless steel headband and synthetic
leather on the ear cups which is pretty
standard issue for Sony but they are
very lightweight coming in at just 234
grams whereas the 1000 X and twos weigh
in at 277 grams when it comes to fit
compared to the 1000 X and choose the
700 ends giveth and they taketh first of
the 700 ends fit very snug but keep in
mind I have a big head but the 700 ends
have the most clamping force out of
Sony's headphone lineup but they're not
uncomfortable since the ear cuffs pivot
and swivel a good deal you'll be able to
conform to most head types the only
bummer is that they don't fold up
depending on the 700 ends also isn't as
soft as a padding found on the 1000 X
and choose but again they still manage
to be comfortable but what I do like
about this
100 ends is dirtier Cup design they're
much roomier than the ear cups on the
1000x and choose but they managed to
stay very low-profile they also do a
slightly better job of preventing
overheating
these are borderline bighead approved
but if you want a looser fit with the
$200 budget then you'll be better off
with the audio-technica anc 700 bt like
for that review up above if we look at
the left ear cup you're going to see
your noise cancellation button to toggle
a and c on or off there's an easily
accessible 3.5 millimeter audio jack for
passive listening there's your micro USB
cable for charging and the power button
it is important to keep in mind that
these headphones do not have an ambient
sound setting like the 1000 X and choose
and like I've said on the past I would
have very much preferred if these
headphones used or USB C port instead I
thought only what have had jumped on USB
C by now the right ear cup houses the
control buttons which are very similar
to the control buttons found on the XP
950 and once there's a volume rocker so
you can adjust the volume and there's a
switch so you can quickly skip or go
back a track and if you press it you can
play or pausing music and I really like
these controls because you can quickly
and easily skim through your music even
faster than the touch controls used on
the sony 1000x and to which I'm not
hating on cuz they're very accurate but
not as fast as the physical rocker it is
also important to keep in mind that both
the 700 ends and 1000 X M choose will
support Google assistant in the near
future like the bose qc25 series to that
feature hasn't been released yet but
just know it is coming but in the
meantime you can summon your voices
system by pressing and holding the
rocker down just like the 1000s and
choose the 700 ends is using bluetooth
4.1 and they have a range of about 40
feet with direct line-of-sight the
connection on these headphones it is
very stable and there weren't many
issues even if there was a wall or two
between the headphones and my phone
these headphones are also pretty good
for watching video because dole AMC
isn't that bad but these headphones can
only be connected to one device at a
time so if you're a power user that
might be a setback it's one of the
things I hate most about the 1000s and
choose what the 700 ends have an
extraordinarily long battery life so any
advertised
about a life of 35 hours and with ASC
and Bluetooth turned on and with the
volume set at 50% these guys managed to
average 37 hours of playback time and
with AMC turned off these guys managed
to hit 45 hours of playback time but
even though their battery life is
impressive their quick charging isn't if
you plug them in for 10 minutes don't
get you one hour playback time which is
laughable compared to other headphones
out there when it comes to the active
noise cancellation on the 700 ends
obviously it's not going to be as good
as the ANC on the 1,000 XM 2 the ANC on
the 700 and matches to block out a good
amount of road noise when you're on the
bus but when it comes to blocking out
chatter the 700 ends don't really do
much but like a 1000 XM choose the 700
ends don't have any noticeable cabin
pressure
and like I mentioned earlier the 700
ends don't have the ambient sound
feature which allows you to pump in some
of the surrounding sounds and they also
don't have quick attention which is by
far my favorite feature found on the
1000 XM - when it comes to sound quality
the 700 ends have a surprising amount of
bass and through so nice headphones app
you can go in and adjust the EQ on these
headphones so if you want you can crank
the bass up to a 10 or you can bring the
mids out and put an emphasis on
vocalists but definitely these
headphones do not share the same clarity
and wide soundstage found on the 1000 X
10 - no matter how much I played around
the EQ under 700 N there just wasn't
enough instrument separation so
everything just sounds close together
and these headphones don't really sound
that different with ANC turned on or off
but if you're going to be listening to
music out in public just know these
headphones do have a considerable amount
of sound leakage like your bus partner
is gonna be able to sing along through
Sony's app you can also toggle a and C
on or off way you can adjust how strong
you want it and you can also play around
the surround setting all these
headphones but since all that feature
does is to start the music I never use
it okay and here's the microphone test
and it's not that bad if you're gonna
talk to somebody on the phone you might
have to speak up a little bit but this
audio clip is being recorded by the
microphone on the Sony whch 700 n so you
better do that
so for 200 rollers the ANC on the Sony
whch 700 N is really only worth using
for your bus ride commute to work or
school or in an already quiet office if
you're walking around the city or in a
much noisier environment like an airport
the ANC on the 700 ends isn't going to
do much I just can't stress how good the
agency on the 1000x m2 is but in general
the 700 ends are a pretty good buy
because they have good build quality for
200 headphones and they fit very well
just as long as you don't have a big
head they
had a very long battery life which makes
them great for everyday carry their low
latency make them good for watching
videos but they don't sound amazing just
good enough if you made it this far I
guess you enjoyed the video so hit that
like button and get subscribed it helps
