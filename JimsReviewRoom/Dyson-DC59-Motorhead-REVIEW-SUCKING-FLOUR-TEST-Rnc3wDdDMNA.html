review now this is the epitome of luxury
I have here the newest Dyson cordless
pack the DC 59 motor head the successor
to the previous generation beep Dyson
animal now priced at five hundred and
forty nine dollars retail as of this
video this Dyson cordless is the third
most expensive vacuum they have so
without further ado we'll see how this
performance
I gotta admit Dyson's just looks like
the future and it feels like a -
weighing under five pounds it feels like
quality glossy plastics with such a
super lightweight design the center
gravity is near your hand in turn
providing minimal to no stress to those
wrists the extending arm is made of
quality aluminum painted in Dyson's own
metallic or anodized pink / purple here
and the head itself with rotating brush
now has its own motor inside in turn
agitating and brushing more dirt and
dust into its suction hole hence the
name motor head and I got a mint all
accessories that came with a Dyson snaps
on ridiculously easy snapping into each
other almost at four listen cases just
reinforcing that feeling of pure luxury
the unit does come with a wall mountable
holder the holds of course your vacuum
but also the supplied accessories as
well and you can run the AC power
adapter into the base and have your unit
charge by hanging this on the wall and
regarding the accessories you have your
brush and crevice tool along with a
handheld brush which works great for the
stairs and also cleaning out the car
this puts my target back into shape and
like other Dyson cleaners Dyson relies
on its patented cyclone technology and
with a lot of other vacuums on the
market today that goes bagless they
still rely heavily on filters no Dyson
is minimalistic and only has one small
filter located top that states it only
needs rinsing once a month and there's
no need to buy replacements after
they're dirty now during my testing with
the DC 59 Motorhead surprisingly it's
more quiet than my upright vacuum
considering the motor inside the Dyson
spins three times faster than the
fastest motor on the market and
regarding its motor and a vaca Dyson
does feature a max button that provides
50% more suction power when toggled and
of course if you bring your battery a
little bit
more on the better test a little bit
later but with everything visually
appealing and feeling very refined how
does it perform the first test I'd used
flour to simulate fine dust and I hate
dust when at least my first apartment I
would vacuum every weekend and the
container would just fill up with his
fine powder and I only assumed I left
the windows open or maybe it was just an
area where I didn't reach before now
after several weeks of not opening
windows and vacuuming consistently a
quick new search yielded it was fine
dust mite feces and this was a newer
apartment as well but I have my own
house now and new carpet was installed
before but I guess live and learn now I
performed one pass up and one passed
down as I typically do in my own home
and I did the same with my upright
vacuum purchased from Target and
shockingly enough the little Dyson
picked up every bit while the upright
left some streaks of flour on the floor
the next test was on mid pile of carpets
I pour the half a cup on each side of
the carpet again and perform the same
test and you can see that Dyson actually
sucked up a bit more flour than the
traditional upright and also as a side
note with the fine flour while using the
Dyson flour did not seep through the
motor and expel out the exhaust as I've
seen this happen on some other vacuums
in the past now my next test involved a
bit bigger debris and sure enough I
found in my closet some honey nut
cheerios same test with both units and
eventually I realized the Dyson
Motorhead isn't adjustable it stays on a
low profile at all times and in this
instance it just pushed the Cheerios
around but for my carpet test
sure enough Dyson came through again
sucking more Cheerios than my uprights
but and there's a big but that DC 59
Motorhead doesn't handle big debris well
clogging right at the arm to canister
opening I tried getting some close-up
shots for you to see and looking at the
inlet with the arm removed sad indeed to
have this happen now taking an object
and poking it will free the blockage for
you
after your cleaning removing debris is
easily removable with a pull of a button
just to be sure to lower the canister as
low as you can go as you can see some
materials actually flew back onto the
floor and the last thing I wanted to
mention during my testing charging the
motor head from a dead battery takes a
whopping three hours and testing the
battery for endurance the battery
quickly died in 17 minutes in 31 seconds
to be exact during normal use and mid
grade carpet again that's continuous
news without stopping now I would
suggest timing how long it takes you to
vacuum your current house and see if
that 17 minute mark is just enough and
overall this thing is agile and because
it's cordless and lightweight it really
makes vacuuming at least seem quick and
subconsciously easier overall it works
very very well it's almost perfect but
the fact that I do have a newborn and
I'm certain Cheerios will be found in
the car sooner or later I'm afraid of
the clogging that would ensue and I'll
do admit depending on the size of your
home if you don't vacuum your home often
at a time you do vacuum the canister
that holds your dust it might be a
little bit too small but with those
shortcomings the performance of suction
the lightness and maneuverability of the
dc50 9 really makes cleaning that much
hassle-free after watching this review
