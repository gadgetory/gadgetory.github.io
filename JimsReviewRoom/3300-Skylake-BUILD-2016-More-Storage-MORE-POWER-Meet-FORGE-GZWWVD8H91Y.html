room I've built this computer system
maybe about two months ago or so and
it's been an absolute beast you guys
have been requesting for me to do a lot
more in gaming related reviews so I've
been downloading a bunch of games and
that's the purpose of today's video I
need to beef up the system not only for
my editing rig but also for the gaming
related stuff that you guys been
requesting for as well what I'll do is
I'll include almond links in the video
description below the links will give
you all the components that I have in
the system here the model numbers the
part numbers and also the most updated
prices for you guys as well so hopefully
that does help you out one last thing
about two months ago or so when I did
that computer build video I did state I
needed a name and this might sound
cheesy maybe not original who knows but
whatever I'm gonna call this thing Forge
and the reason why I want to call it
Forge and I know it's made out of
aluminum but it looks like steel the
colors on my channel has always been
yellow gold and orange as well and also
I keep talking about on my social media
channels about creativity and crafting
as well so all my ideas up here are the
visions that I have to try to portray
what I want on-camera goes into this
machine here and this machine forges it
molds models it crafts it and it's shown
onto your smartphones or TVs your
desktops or whatever it may be
this machine forges my ideas and it's
just basically puts out a video that you
guys see basically so hope you guys
enjoy that again it might sound cheesy
as hell but again from now on this is
will be referenced as Forge and enjoyed
today's edit alright guys I'll talk to
you guys later in 3 2 1
I hope you guys enjoyed that brief
segment there as you guys have seen
fantex did hook me up here with their
newest case the evolve tempered glass
model and it looks sleek as hell I know
the camera isn't doing much justice here
I also tried to reduce as much glare as
I could here but in person
the glass gives this extra look of
clarity versus my old case and not to
mention less obstruction so the sides
were that much more visible to admit my
wire management on the right side here
isn't that looking hot at all
but I'll need to upgrade the wiring in
the next computer build hopefully coming
down soon and if you guys haven't seen
my last build here I did install the new
in town 6700 Kay Corsairs h200 ICP you
look at cooling running with 32 gigs of
DDR 4 Ram at 3300 megahertz and also
Corsairs RM series power supply key from
the computer build a nice and clean
power draw but notably new on this
computer system here new in this video I
had taken up the old OCC solid state
drive and upgraded this with the newest
and latest in hard drive technology
that's M that too now the original or
previous solid state drive claimed
performance is usually around 500 to 550
megabytes in read speeds and with the MD
technology specifically the RT 400 model
that I have here this thing can read up
to 2600 megabytes a second hit right up
to 1500 megabytes a second and in real
world use this thing simply flies
especially when you're working with just
huge video files I do notice a
difference and the old hard drive was
480 gigs this M that to here that I have
is one terabyte so hopefully good for
video editing and also for the gaming
related stuff that you'll see in this
channel in my last build
I did buy to Western Digital platter
hard drives and both at one terabyte
each for backup storage I've taken those
out as well and replace them with the
HyperX savage Edition SSDs both are also
at one terabyte each making things a
little bit more efficient and faster and
last but not least here I've been using
my old tried-and-true Logitech keyboard
in MX mouse both great for everyday
casual use office work whatever it may
be but finally jump shipped and tried
out a mechanical keyboard for the first
time when with Corsair again with their
newest k70 RGB model made of aluminum
and all the lights that you ever need
I tried not to do anything too flashy
just keeping it as
Koller on the channel here but the
colors help give the room and other
background in videos some color as well
i also replace the mouse with the MM 65
pro it's targeted for first-person
shooters going to give this one a try
considering the new battlefield is
coming out later its fall and i've been
on over watching two minutes of reason
as well but this mouse is my first ever
mouse being made out of aluminum as well
and these both peripherals are just
really hefty really beefy it feels like
a serous step up from what i was using
before now the very last item here this
is my new go-to pair of headphones the
HyperX cloud revolvers that had just
reviewed for just $120 you can get a lot
of bang for your buck with these the
sound stage is very good for my test
here i do wish the inline controller
would work for consoles as well but i'll
be using this headset mainly for the pc
here on out so some of the things that I
didn't get though and more than likely
you'll see it in the next computer build
or upgrade here I know I've been
anticipating a 1080 GPU from Nvidia and
I kept going back and forth on it I
figured my current 980ti which is still
an amazing graphics card and I just
bought the darn thing about two months
ago or so and if I were to upgrade to
the 1080 I don't have a 4k monitor don't
film and watch my videos in 4k just yet
and being upfront with you guys in the
end I didn't want to get something that
would only be a wow factor on my channel
and not really serve a purpose so that
rounds up everything hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video here again links with
partners and pricing will be in the
description below and if you do purchase
of course that does help a channel out a
little bit now add me on to Facebook
Twitter or Instagram I have a new
personal account as well for anyone
interested in my personal life here and
that's basically it for this latest
computer build hope you guys enjoyed and
this is again Forge from here on out you
guys take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
