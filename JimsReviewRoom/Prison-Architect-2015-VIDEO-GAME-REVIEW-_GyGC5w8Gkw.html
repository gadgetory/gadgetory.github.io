for over a year why am I reviewing this
game considering it's not an official
release it's just that addicting and
I'll show you why I've had this for over
a year and it's one of the few games I
would go back and keep playing currently
available on steam for thirty dollars
and as of this video the creator's did
state they're pushing for this upcoming
fall to release the final version
version 1.0 so if they're practically
almost done now if you were into
management games like the original sim
city roller coaster tycoon or if you
have to enjoy on Netflix orange is the
new black this game might be for you
you've given a few workers to erect your
prison building from the foundation and
on up essentially you're managing
sleeping cells the cafeteria showers and
down to solitary confinement on the
surface the game looks very basic and
simple considering the not so serious
tone graphics and descriptions of each
cell mate but you would be amazed at how
deep and partially how realistic this
game can become but before discussing
managing your inmates the physical
building aspect is immersive in itself
you do have to install electrical
generators run piping for water not only
through the toilets in every shower head
but even to the kitchen area as well for
the sinks balancing the physical needs
of the building itself is a critical
task to ensure metal detectors security
cameras and just to keep the lights on
working as well and with my prison
clearly it was not built with logistics
in mind and considering every path and
quarter to other areas of the prison is
a serious must have and besides the
physical buildings you have to address
your sensitive pansy inmates I guess
being locked up for so long would drive
anyone insane now prisoners over time
will crave alcohol some with drug
addictions will start to freak out while
others will desire visitations with
families now you can set up drug
addiction programs rehabilitation hours
hi are psychologists help with the more
mental patients but when needs are not
met they fight with other inmates fight
with the guards and over time a riot can
ensue causing mayhem to break out in the
end requiring a riot squad to be called
in but besides the obvious needs there's
much that you as a player won't see
contraband will run
amp it in your prison has power tools
Forks cigarettes and drugs are found
when you perform a shakedown you can
bribe with inmates to narc and other
inmates to review schemed killings that
are about to happen within the prison
and just recently gang members are
introduced that will rival other gang
members within the prison holy crap now
for you to assist with balancing the
gameplay mechanics and unlockable
management tree is available to hire
armed guards and accountant or improve
your security but it's one of the few
areas where I felt it wasn't as deep as
other parts of the game and granted
there's no difficulty mode to adjust on
the fly it's really controlled by you
you can change if you want a combination
or just exclusive minimum or maximum
security inmates to enter into your
prison each with its own issues but each
class with a different payout now
learning the game in the beginning isn't
too difficult you just have to
understand what goes in first and what
pieces of furniture is required to make
a room of room say a kitchen or an
office yet all this will be disclosed on
this screen for you in the beginning I
would build rooms and it would always
say it needs to be in an enclosed area
but it looked enclosed to me but after
that a couple of hours the learning
curve is not so demanding but it is a
good challenge though overall it's a
good balance and the ideas that they put
into place for the game so far has been
very funny yet realistic to an extent
that's where much of the fun comes from
much of the replay value is found having
options and the consequences of each but
with that being said there's also that
alpha pre-build looming over and how bad
is it to be frank and honest it's not
bad at all I'm steam and nearly 13,000
individual user reviews placed its
rating as quote very positive again
despite being an alpha stage the
problems that I personally encountered
that was very much a parents are some
objects being stuck in the walls and
there's some workers that build walls
not from the inside than out so there's
actually a missing section and once in a
while inmates would die inside or become
stuck in certain walls as well now
there's also the odd habits of some
guards just hang out in front of the
prison while there's actually jobs like
they could be doing or a fight that they
can break up and for some odd reason
there's times when the shoe is widely
available but no inmates or s4
in those are the main bugs that I
particularly seem and they are more that
others on this team has voiced but
overall it's still a very much playable
and enjoyable game that's not repetitive
due to what you can create why there
whether good or bad and just to be clear
I'm not sponsored nor have I or whoever
built this game has been in contact I
personally played this from time to time
when I'm doing my other reviews here so
this is seriously a personal experience
that I wanted to share with you guys now
