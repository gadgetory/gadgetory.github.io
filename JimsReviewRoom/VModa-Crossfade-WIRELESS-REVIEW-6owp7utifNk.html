something from v-moda based on popular
demand from viewers like you
I order the m100 Wireless for you guys
just to see how they go they've priced
at $300 retail as of this video but for
updated prices and they have gone down
I'll place a link any vid description
below for you guys to check out so
without further ado my channel is here
to help you make a purchase decision
Jimmy with Jim's review room welcome
everyone to another review
going over the physical features as with
the original V Moto's these are built
rugged as heck
during my stress test these things
stayed intact and despite having a thin
metal arm for the ear cups and into the
headband the metal doesn't Bend
there's also minimal cushioning but
because these are so light coming in at
just under 300 grams wearing these for 2
to 3 hours straight here hasn't been an
issue with my jaw line from the pressure
the headphones clamping nor any pressure
on the top of my head and if you're not
familiar with V motors they try to
market the term mind the gap instilling
the lack of space between the band and
your head something you might take into
consideration and future headphone
purchases but getting back to the
physical bill the arms provide a very
cliquey extension which stays locked in
place with no accidental adjustments
when worn and moving down the m100
shields here the metal shields are
customizable and replaceable for your
needs through their website and moving
to the ear cups they're plastic with
metal trim now looking at the left ear
cup there is a microUSB port for
charging the set charging from a dead
battery to take me personally two hours
to do and v-moda does claim up to 12
hours of use and from my testing I was
able to achieve 12 hours and 11 minutes
to be precise moving to the right ear
cup there's volume up and down and in
the middle is for playback controls and
on the bottom is a 3.5 millimeter port
for physically listening to your audio
device and last here is the button to
toggle your headphones on or off and to
put them in bluetooth search mode now I
do admit this sliding button here is not
refined or smooth at all you will take
notice unfortunately regarding both ear
cups in general they don't swivel but as
stated earlier for the most part they
fit snugly around my ear pretty good as
for stowing they don't fold in or the
ear cups don't lay flat either if
transport is a must for you they're not
too bad when using their very cool
looking hardshell case but something for
you to keep in mind regarding what's in
the case there's tons of elastic bands
to hold everything in place for sure
there's enough stiff protection provided
to keep these from being damaged
now speaking of accessories in the box
you do receive a three and half
millimeter two quarter inch adapter plus
the USB cable and a three-and-a-half
millimeter cable for physical
connections other than that testing the
Bluetooth signal strength connecting
this to my currently being tested
Samsung s7 the signal has gone through
several walls and down through the first
floor here with no issues whatsoever now
wearing this with vemma pretty
moderately there is some sound leak
notice though so anyone around you may
be able to hear what you're listening
- and last is the audio test here how do
these sound first off these V motors
needs about three hours to burn in from
my experience here the first impressions
weren't as impressive but on the second
day of testing these comparing them to
others these do sound much better
starting with bass it's punchy and tight
not deep sub bass levels but it provides
a decent amount no I wouldn't constitute
these as being basically headphones so
bass heads I think should look elsewhere
but for a bass boost its signature I
think this is right at home for you now
regarding mids after testing a good bit
of headphones now I noticed the m100
just has this ever so slightly bright
sound signature I personally like this
as it does sound like the vocals and the
voices here are just pushed just ever so
slightly forward and the audio is clear
and crisp now regarding the high notes
it does sound just ever so slightly
mushy or jumbled together at higher
volumes the resolution isn't as clear as
I'd hope but if you don't have other
headphones laying around to critique or
do a direct comparison the average
consumer most likely won't notice but
more importantly here they didn't sound
tingey or ear ringing now listen to
these pair of headphones for about two
hours straight I didn't have any
listening fatigue whatsoever and they're
still really enjoyable to listen to
other than that regarding sound stage
after that burnin period the sound stage
did improve and you can hear a pretty
good amount of audio from the left and
right channels here but also above and
in front of you now at the end of the
day I really enjoyed the sound signature
and the crossfade Wireless does offer
good quality sound with a slight bright
signature and a bit more bass boost that
I think many would enjoy if you can get
these for less in retail
I would then highly recommend them at
that price point now if you were to
check out an alternative I would say
look at the parrot Zik 2.0 review that
I've personally done here and I should
give you a kind of a good comparison of
what's out there so if this review

guys take care and I'll see you in the
