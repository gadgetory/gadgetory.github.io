to test a product that shape a company's
future maybe even the industry james
dyson announced on march 6 you are no
longer design operate vacuums that means
smaller lighter and going cordless is
very similar to all the other headphones
and earphones that our review here on
youtube now gong wireless and
lightweight is where everything is
heading and dyson is making that
commitment dicing gave me the
opportunity to showcase their new vacuum
by sponsoring this video and let me
reveal the cyclone v10 absolute now this
has been completely redesigned compared
to their previous operating models my
biggest speculation was how big this
looked and what seemed to be heavy in
photos and once i received it in the
office it's smaller than I thought and
during my time testing this thing is
certainly light then when I weighed the
unit myself it was three pounds in 11
ounces according to the scale here at
the office now from my testing it's very
easy on the forearms here and it's very
easy to maneuver now what you get in the
box with the cyclone v10 absolutely
there's quite a bit of attachments with
my experience everything snaps into
place ridiculously easy and quite
satisfied the only area of critique for
me is this trigger button which is very
sensitive
it's basically trigger-happy sometimes
grabbing the machine a small bump will
cause the vacuum to turn on now not a
big deal it's most likely sensitive for
ease of use your finger won't be
fatigued from long-term use I get that
now Dyson is claiming more efficient air
flow stronger suction power all in a
smaller but more powerful v10 motor from
their previous v8 model just listen to
this thing before demonstrating the
suction power my biggest concern was
better life Dyson is claiming up to 60
minutes of use with three power levels
offered I tested their low mode setting
from a full battery to dead with a
torque cleaner attachment and going over
my carpet and occasionally the rug I
confirm thirty-six minutes of use
compared to my v6 animal reviewed a few
years back here and more recently my VA
absolute that I use at the office
this is the best before battery-powered
Dyson that I've used to date in addition
the recharge times have improved the VA
absolute takes five hours to recharge
its battery this one here takes only
three and a half hours now jumping into
performance I did a variety of surfaces
I'll show you how to screen here first
off where's the thick carpet for those
who like that plush field carpet is
where all that dust collects for me to
simulate dust as best as a can maybe
even a little bit thicker or tougher
here I simply use flour and running it
over with the brush head first pass did
excellent most of the flour got it
dropped after the sample was sucked back
into the canister
now for those with smooth surfaces like
linoleum or tile I did a similar test
setting up my review table here one
cycle going forward and back gets
everything for me as demonstrated
and last for those with hardwoods with
those cracks and crevices in between I
just used some cheaper laminate flooring
that I got at the local hardware store
here I poured some freaking kool-aid and
see if it would get stuck in between
those planks those gaps in that same
test once again the diced one is able to
get everything up now the last attempt
was to pick up bigger items like
Cheerios during the past once again I
didn't have any issues and use adult
cereal my honey here bunches of oats
here again no problems whatsoever now
the very last detail of b10 does
included a whole machine HEPA filtration
system on the back of the Dyson and even
though I was sucking a flower kool-aid
Cyril you name it as demonstrated in the
video here I didn't sense or smell it
after each test now cleaning it is
simply twists and rinsing off this thing
here and placing it back in when it's
dry now also this is Dyson's first dust
bin that points and shoots verses the
vertical open and you're up you grab the
handle and you gently pull down and pull
back to you trophy debris there's a
rubber grommet inside it helps to scrape
everything down now the bed over the v8
model is 40% larger making this the
largest handheld available from dyson at
the time of this video so that's it
