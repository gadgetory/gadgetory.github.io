room it's been quite some time here
since I did a budget review on these
Bluetooth speakers I had reviewed some
our cheer speakers in the past and
they've been okay but it did send me
their best-selling model the a320 to see
how this one goes or maybe this one will
fare better it's now retailing at 199
dollars but they always have them on
sale here on Amazon as of this video
it's going for 99 dollars I'll place my
links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time now
jumping right into this one
constructionwise this is built very well
frontside has real bamboo if you're into
that bob marley's speaker look the rear
is fabric which adds a nice and original
touch versus the many plastic models out
there and then back on the front
speakers they are exposed though so I
wouldn't recommend this so much for
travel well if you're looking for
something stationary maybe something for
around the house the speaker is
perfectly rugged for that purpose on top
are very tactile buttons with volume up
and down pause and play with on and off
to the far right on the rear very simple
with a 3.5 millimeter port for physical
connections and a microUSB port for
charging the speaker there's no wall
adapter that's needed for this case our
chair is claiming up to 11 hours of use
at 50% vine which is average too good
for a small speaker but based on its
size this is more on the mid-sized level
like the ue boom to bose soundlink mini
2 or the JBL charge 3 the better life is
someone on the lower end again when you
compare them to mid tier speakers
regarding Bluetooth signal its using
bluetooth 4.0 and having my phone on one
side of the house and the speaker on the
other no signal loss was noticed other
than that that's really it there's no
extra features there's no NFC no app no
charge out ports a very simple Bluetooth
speaker so let's see how the audio
sounds here I'll play several samples
and then I'll give you my verdict
afterwards
I am headed our side living the dream
yours and mine you for you inside it
come before the Stars full and dynamic
jewels behind that's wrong until the
night I love the dark fits you the sky
chasing stars all that we said all that
they are leggings inside this is the
start ing vision and ride random Gloria
you
in my head
keep me up at night
you
and there you have it folks of course
audio recorded on my end and then play
through your speaker so the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here now first up if you're able
to get this ad 100 dollars this does
sound better than many of the other
small Bluetooth speakers on the market
for $100 it's full-bodied it's warm has
a good amount of bass and clarity
loudness it's good for small to mid-size
rooms for sure still enjoyable in large
rooms but the immersion is a bit lost
afterwards
loudness is on par though with mid-sized
speakers and again considering how much
the speaker is going for that's still
pretty good the only downside though at
maximum violin on a very few select
songs you can hear a little bit of a
flutter in the bass or distortion in
general on the lower mid-range levels a
perfect example is when listening to
Adele Someone Like You you can hear the
lower end of her voice vibrate more than
it should again this is this really
happened though but it did happen
nonetheless also because it's a pretty
basic speaker at times the mids do get a
bit drone out now most won't be able to
tell but it's only when you do put them
side by side with another myth your
speaker that I just did in the review
sample now the mids in general though
are clear with that time the lows
crossing over as I just mentioned now
and the highs have some roll-off to
prevent it from being pinging or
becoming to screeching over I would say
if you don't need all the extra features
and you're comparing this to the big
names like the JBL flip 3ue roll 2 which
are $100 speakers as well the arch here
has a more pleasing sound signature I
say at that time it's worth the buy now
if you're in the market for a mid to
your speaker still get this if you're on
a budget if you're only spending about
$100 but if you can afford more if you
can pay more I would say look into other
brands at that time so that's it for
this review again I'm Jimmy with jims
review room and my channel is here to
help you make a purchase decision you
guys take care I'll catch you guys on
the next one
