hey everyone Jimmy with Jim's review
room welcome back to another one of my
vlogs has been quite some time and for
last six weeks maybe in up to two months
I have not been uploading more than one
video a week it's been a ridiculously
slow on the YouTube channel and I do
apologize for that but I have the
perfect excuse for you guys
behind the scenes I've been busting my
ass here as you guys can tell by the
title today is really one of the days
that one of my dreams have been
fulfilled just to check it off my list
here of some of the things that I wanted
to accomplish in life too later when
they tell my you know my daughter when
she grows up that you know there's more
things that her dad did you know so I'm
proud of that one of the things that I
been planning was when I first started
YouTube was about three years ago I
eventually want to build up Jim's room
to the point where I can't have office
space but the reason why I say is a
dream is a dream because I've had this
thought ever since I was in high school
ever since I found or realized that I
was an entrepreneur and heart and the
office space before social media exists
or anything the office space in my mind
was basically a foundation a place where
it can expand across my creativity my
design my work and further expand what I
love to do just keep in mind this place
is not big I know there's other
youtubers out there they're doing you
know have the massive office spaces
dries the Lambos and all that stuff good
for them they're at a place where they
have worked hard for it don't get me
wrong but for me like I said just humble
beginnings just last week two weeks ago
I was still filming in the in my bedroom
or in the living room actually in my
house so again everyone starts somewhere
and again this is my studio space this
is something where I feel like ah it's
just humbling to achieve so anyways
enough to be talking let me show you
guys what it looks like and we'll go
from there
all right
so I want to show you guys this perfect
moment room that actually get to have
access to it's my first very own
boardroom meeting room whatever you want
to call it pretty badass not too bent at
all you see here I brought me sit at the
end of this table and hold my
conferences maybe with one or two other
people so I don't know this is obviously
overkill but hey why not let me show you
guys what the office looks like this one
to drop in here real quick and show you
guys what this was all about the show
and there she goes nothing too special
man it is freezing out there holy cow
alright so let me show you guys around
there's really not much to show you guys
but let me turn the camera this way here
so it doesn't focus on my face my first
things first I'm going to literally wrap
this thing with matte black or some kind
of dark charcoal gray it's basically a
habit to go with the white and black
gray theme for now use your imagination
this is a blank canvas a blank white
canvas I might do that wall gray the
same grade that I have currently at home
that grant has been very iconic with my
channel and also with that end right
there and have my big-screen TV my two
Clips tower speakers right there and all
new furniture would have action chairs a
rug a new coffee table showcase some of
that stuff to you guys and as I do more
audio reviews maybe some TVs we'll see
how hopefully I can showcase I have an
area to basically test and show to you
guys so that's about it so moving a
little bit back here maybe planning some
that one area right there like where
after I put the chairs
it's probably a testing area reviews
other things that I'll basically
compare/contrast and like set the review
stuff its programming majority right
there moving back past that door right
here is going to be my office desks and
chairs for me and some of my workers
here and then just turning around here I
kinda just one big rectangle there's
nothing too special here
I got office chairs that I just bought
over the weekend I got there for now but
this law if I don't paint that other
wall gray it's going to be this wall and
then this wall will basically house all
of my equipment my testing products all
the other old products I reviewed are
ready so I can compare with new products
and if I have space maybe my gaming desk
and PC right there and of course matte
black or matte greatest doors well an
outdoors a glaring attack holy cow
but other than that that is about it I
know it's not much to show you guys and
like said this is going to be the
foundation to Jim's review room the next
step up you can say and trying to show
you guys some of the best concepts out
there and of course more importantly the
most reliable is the most honest and
hopefully the most thorough content that
expertise to you guys trying to help you
of course make that purchase decision
we're going to give away I didn't work
with me actually got in the car didn't
run out and get it if I am giving away
any Jabra sports part of it picture

add cool phone so this one I'm giving
away completely brand new sealed in the
box and it is an international giveaway

got to do is follow the directions I put
