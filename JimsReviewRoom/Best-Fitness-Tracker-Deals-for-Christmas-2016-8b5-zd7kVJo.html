room the channel that's here to help you
make a purchase decision now if you guys
have been following me for some time my
channel is pretty big on these fitness
bands and I've looked all over the
internet trying to find reputable
retailers here to find the best deals
for you that's going to happen next week
and some into the following month that
as always I placed my Amazon links down
below you're in the video description
click on my links and hopefully I'm
Black Friday and the month of December
here those deals will still be around
for you now first up starting with
Fitbit if you're new to them or in need
to replace your old or damaged one
normally $200 Walmart Target and Best
Buy here in the US will have the Fitbit
blaze for a hundred and fifty dollars
the very popular in charge - it's gonna
be $20 less at 130 and if you still want
to go small here but still retain that
screen the Fitbit Alta is normally 130
that will go for $100 even now all bands
are water-resistant comes with
interchangeable bands
so no more frayed or damaged bands from
normal wear and tear like the older
models then the blaze in charge HR it
does come with a heart rate monitor that
measures throughout your day right on
your wrist now moving on to Garmin if
you've been waiting for the holy grail
of Fitness watches making Garmin Fenix
3hr bet retails for $600 I have seen
them on sale for 450 on Amazon just to
be upfront about that but Best Buy will
have them for $400 even on Black Friday
the obvious they want something serious
and not willing to break the bank here
the vivo active HR is a perfect choice
that's normally $250 that would drop to
a hundred and seventy at Walmart Target
and also Best Buy
now last if you're looking for something
more generic and mainstream they diamond
Viva with smart HR that will only be $70
making this a better deal than the
Fitbit charge HR I've only found that
deal at Best Buy only but if you want
the GPS model target will have that for
120 and that's down from $200 retail so
it's a win-win situation either way now
voted as one of my best all-around
activity trackers as it has HR it has
media controls local memory to store
your music right on your wrist here it
has GPS full readouts of your
notifications and of course a beautiful
display now granted the battery life is
only a few days but what I'm talking
about is the Samsung gear fit - that
retails for a hundred and eighty dollars
which was
already a great value but best buy will
have this for a hundred and fifty
dollars I'm Black Friday and I couldn't
confirm if Target or Amazon would have
it at this price or not but again click
on my links on that day and hopefully
it's down there at that price now
although I haven't tested any pebble
products on the channel here the pebble
too is really simple yet still offers a
great value there's a char readings
notifications and always-on display and
it's worth looking into if you're on a
budget and looking for some smart
features on the wrist here and basic
fitness tracking options that retails
for $129 you can get this for $70
through Best Buy now last but not least
here this isn't really a dedicated
activity tracker but it's a perfect
hybrid offering both the SmartWatch
features and some fitness tracking I'm
talking about the Apple watch Series one
which isn't the new series 2 which does
offer GPS and a swim proof casing but
it's still a great price here on Black
Friday
now retails for $269 target will have
theirs for just 200 and if you're an
Android / Samsung kind of a person be
very new Samsung gear s 3 at retails for
350 you can get it for $300 direct from
Samsung's web site now that Smart Watch
is one that I'm personally looking out
for that's probably gonna be my personal
Christmas gift so that's it for this
list here I know this video is pretty
short here but that's a total of 10
different fitness trackers with two or
three hybrids is what I call it mixed in
here for those who are wanting
SmartWatch life features now again look
at my Amazon links in the video
description below
I'm sure Amazon will have similar prices
and if not I'm Black Friday I'm sure on
Cyber Monday and hopefully throughout
the month of December now be sure to
like and share this video if you can to
help support the channel here and help
others interested in smartwatches and
fitness trackers and follow me on my
social media my personal account is
Jimmy llama official and if you're
wanting tech it's Jim's review room I'll
