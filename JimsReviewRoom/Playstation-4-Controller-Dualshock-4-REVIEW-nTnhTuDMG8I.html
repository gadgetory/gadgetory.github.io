review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the DualShock 4 controller
and I'll try to go in-depth as much as I
can for those PlayStation enthusiasts
out there now if you guys have been
keeping up I'm still testing the ps4
right now and writing a review on that
so definitely subscribe or go to
facebook.com slash Jim's review room so
you can see more photos and be alerted
at that time and again this will be an
in-depth review so if you need to skip
around read the video description below
and the timestamps are listed there and
without further ado we'll get started so
the controller is a complete redesign
from what it has been in the past decade
or so the dimensions are as follows
below now showing the new controller
it's slightly bigger for the most part
and weighing in a little bit heavier at
7 point 4 ounces now overall every
aspect of this controller has been
scrutinized for ergonomics and I'm
certain competitive play as well during
my unboxing and the first time you lay
your hands on this controller you'll
feel the difference in length of the
handles now this controller makes the
old generation feel like a small plastic
toy or so the DualShock 4 extend a
little bit further so now your ring and
pinky fingers grips comfortably now this
is one of the most notable and probably
one of the most favorable changes to
control it for me personally now the top
part of the controller is plastic with
the entire bottom with a slightly
textured dark grey plastic the texture
is very subtle but from closely paying
attention the texture does provide more
grip during extended play when your
palms do perspire a little bit there so
overall the layout is very familiar with
such subtle refinements that goes a long
way
now starting with the dual joysticks
here now being dimpled in my thumbs no
question feels more securely in place
and has reduced slippage compared to
last year's model now the range of
motion is still the same it feels and
looks like it clicks and moves like it
should for the L 3 and R 3 buttons and
it still has the same feedback basically
now the d-pad also had some notable
changes as well the d-pad now feels
deeper and I'll say it again it just
feels deeper because of the beveled
edges right in the middle of the buttons
sigh buttons looks about the same
however like the joysticks the
indentation of the beveled edges creates
a physical and mental note and where to
keep your thumbs at all times
no similar to the keyboard with the F
and J keys typically having some kind of
raised bump to remind you where you are
on the keyboard again another design
improvement now moving over to the main
buttons square triangle circle and X
there really hasn't been any changes
that I've noticed now when looking at it
from a side view the buttons don't look
as raised as the previous generation
however as a user I didn't notice a
difference when playing though now on to
the next part here which is personally
my favorite all these shoulder and
trigger buttons now completely
redesigned l1 and r1 shoulder buttons
are slightly bigger actually in height
in which it didn't affect my gameplay
and it was as effective as they
DualShock predecessor with minimalistic
effort and tactile feedback now the most
notable changes are the trigger buttons
now Sony did acknowledge they no longer
skip a video when you place your
controller down and accidentally
fast-forward a scene or so so this next
generation has finger contouring and
concave trigger buttons it really feels
like a beefy trigger that's very
effortless depress now because of this
concave design the finger trigger rests
on there nicely and with every trigger
pull for games like you know called duty
ghosts' or battlefield 4 there's a
slight increase in immersion when you're
lighting someone up with an assault
rifle basically now the only issue I had
though and trust me I love this trigger
that I love this new design the concave
design basically tells your mind or
basically tells your fingers to rest it
right on that spot though so my fingers
are reached down further than what I
have been previously with with the Dual
Shock controller again this could just
be me or my muscle memory and placement
but I have accidentally pressed r1 and
l1 at times trying to aim and shoot it's
absolute something that I have to get
used to and it's not a design flaw per
se but it just a heads up for those who
might run into that one you receive your
PlayStation 4 so the next and biggest
feature is this new touchpad right in
the middle of the controller not only is
it a touchpad but it's also a button as
well you can press that in the clip
there's really no texture on this and
it's smooth all across what PlayStation
has done to showcase this touchpad are
games like Killzone where you can use
swipe commands to control a drone in the
battlefield now from the free game
warframe you can perform your special
move by swiping it in corresponding
directions it's a nice feature I would
assume the possibilities are endless but
we do have to wait to see you know more
titles come out and see how this button
and this touchpad is actually utilized
I've also tested the touchpad on
messages you can't use it to select your
letters or wording either so
unfortunately can't use it in that
aspect now moving on instead of the
traditional Select and start buttons now
share and options are presented on the
top of the controller options is
basically the start button back in the
day when you access your menu during
gameplay or out of game play the share
button is truly the unique new feature
on PlayStation now the ps4 automatically
records your last 15 minutes of gameplay
in any game and you can immediately
upload that to Facebook now you can also
save and share your screenshots as well
either on the PlayStation messaging
system or on Facebook and Twitter and
lastly with this button you can access
and livestream your gameplay and either
twitch or you stream with live comments
streaming in to you now the only
downfall that I saw from here was that
the video that you record can only be
uploaded to Facebook to share you can't
upload it directly to your YouTube
channel
so overall the share button alone is a
convenient way to show off content like
never before now the last few items on
the controller are a bit minor but
nonetheless PlayStation has put much
effort and thought into this now the six
axis gyroscopes in the controller from
you know new sources say it's much more
precise than its predecessor it's much
more fluid and accurate readings that
are taken now now I haven't yet found a
game that I've played to really utilize
this feature but just know it's there
though and for news in the future now
for messaging this helps a bit in typing
your words out instead of using the
directional pad to click over now
demonstrating here I tilt the controller
to the corresponding letter left right
up and down etc and it's very responsive
and spot-on and since an controller is
lit up here the ambient glow from the
troller is very similar to the place
they should move if you eventually will
get the PlayStation camera the camera
uses these colors to identify your
controller now in addition it does help
when you have several of your friends
over in the room and having color-coded
controllers it does help out a bit with
identifying you know which one belongs
to who then Leslie regarding those
colors it's a nice feature that
indicates when your controller is
charging as indicated by an orange glow
and even it changes color so while in
use actually when you are using the
PlayStation 4 you know it has an ambient
blue glow and again it's ambient so it's
not glaring and you can't even see it
actually in the corner of your eye when
you're actually playing the last item
here is the integrated speaker I can
understand from Sony it may elicit
deeper immersion such as when you know a
game is playing no dialogue or an ad or
might play right from the controller
instead of the TV and you might have to
place the controller next to your ear
etc but overall it's a nice feature to
offer but I don't see majority of
mainstream consumers eventually
utilizing this heavily the sound from
the controller itself is somewhat hard
to hear if I'm playing with surround
sound on and I typically play with a
full head set on so at times I would
miss the dialogue from a small speaker I
mean just you know me putting it out
there lastly is the new port besides the
microUSB charging port is the
three-and-a-half millimeter headset
connection now PlayStation does offer a
single inline mic and earbud to connect
with your controller just like the Xbox
has but the wire does seem very flimsy
they land thin but using it so far the
audio quality is very good I can hear my
friends and they say that they can hear
me very well the mic however is very
sensitive though so if you're moving the
microphones in-game your friends will
definitely hear the mic rustle around a
little bit there but if you are somewhat
into games I mean nowadays people are
purchasing a cheap headset in ways even
up to the very high end you know like
those MLG headsets you would even use
this thing but again it's all we
convened to have and I guess having it
offered just in case is always a plus
so on regarding the USB charging port
yes you can connect this to your
computer or laptop and it will charge it
for you actually charged on my desktop
so overall it's a very very good
controller compared to all the previous
generation dual Shack controllers you'll
definitely feel a huge difference in the
trigger as soon as you grab the
controller you feel the extension of the
handles again the control is a little
bit bigger so overall your hands are not
you know bunched up or squish together
you can say like I said you won't notice
it until you actually hold on to the ps4
controller and then compare it with the
PlayStation 3 so overall it is a upgrade
it's definitely a difference I'm pretty
sure down the road for the coming years
on the PlayStation 4 this will be a no
questions a very very good controller to
have so that's about it if you haven't
definitely subscribe to the channel as
I'm still testing out the ps4 at the
moment new videos of the PlayStation 4
should be coming out later this week and
if you can please click that like button
on this video as well that helps me
tremendously and I'll see you guys next
time this is Jimmy from Jim's review
room take care everyone bye
