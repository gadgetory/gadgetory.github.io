review by Jim's review room today I'm
reviewing the Poland pipi 1000 a it's a
edge trimmer attachment that touches
right to most popular branded weed
whackers and gas trimmers I just got
done working outside so look a little
bit rough right now but I just want to
show you what my lawn looks like before
the edging as you can see here and what
it looks like afterwards I've purchased
this particular attachment for $60 on
amazon.com shipping and handling is also
included because I'm a prime member for
non-members of course you do have to pay
shipping handling yourself I'll be
showing two areas one is my driveway and
in the picture you see here is my
sidewalk as well this is just pre
trimming and I just cut along but
haven't edged it yet so here's the
actual attachment separated and by
itself it comes with a 7 inch blade and
the depth you can adjust up to 2 inches
deep now my blade is a little bit worn
but you can always replace those for
about $10 and you can purchase those as
well on amazon.com here's a close-up of
the adjustment where you can change it
to a minimum a maximum of 2 inches or
less in depth for the trimming and I
just want to show you an overview and
I'm actually looking at my monitor in
the back yards playing the video while
record this here's my gas trimmer weed
whacker it's your standard Ryobi gas
trimmer and it's easily as unscrewing
the extension like I am yanking it off
and then just taking the poll on and
attaching it and screwing and tightening
it back together once that's together
and locked in securely all you have to
do is put some gas in her and pull on
her and she'll be ready to go and in a
minute here I'll show you exactly what
the results are now it does have a wheel
in the rear where you can walk along
with the poll on its trimmer as well now
the edge trimmer it works great if you
have edged it before like any edge
trimmer if you have done it before I'm
sorry
it's easier to go through if you haven't
done it before you may have to take a
little bit more time just trying to get
all that dirt out in between the cement
driveway sidewalk and your lawn as well
and I'll show you here this is my
driveway I have last time I've done it
last time I urged it was probably about
a week go a week and a half ago and as
you can see it just goes smooth like
butter and just creates that edge for me
and again my blade is a bit dull or you
can say very dull so I don't mind the
the blade there soon I'll show you and
probably a better image is the sidewalk
and it should be showing pretty quickly
here and this sidewalk like I said it's
only the lawn has only been cut but it
has been edged yet the right side it's
much easier as you can see I just breeze
right through it just a single pass
I found myself edging properly every
week and a half to two weeks I could
skip usually a week and then redo it
again
mmm the second side here as you can see
when I'm pulling the edger back and
forth back and forth a lot of the water
runs down on that side of the sidewalk
that's why you have a lot of dirt and
debris there I'll try a little bits a
little bit harder just to get all that
out blowing everything away and just
seeing the result so you can see there's
a clean crisp line right across the the
driveway or down the driveway and I'll
show you a before and after pictures
shortly here on what the sidewalk looks
like and you can see a clear
illustration of how well this works and
again it's a simple product $60 just
make sure that it works with your weed
whacker on the website it just says it
fits many brands I just took the risk in
attached you know bought it and attach
it to my Ryobi and it fits perfectly
they give it a shot you have a long bed
a lot of people with envy
most lawn professionals if not all of
them have the edge attachment and other
more complicated tools but for the price
and for the convenience of attaching it
to a existing weed whacker this is the
way to go as you can see the
before-and-after picture here and
you can definitely see the difference in
just a clean crisp look I love it it's
easy to use the constructions durable I
had I have had this for over a year and
haven't had a problem so that concludes
my review and if you like this video
please like it and or subscribe to my
channel I'll be doing much more reviews
in the future and again I appreciate
your time so much and this is Jimmy with
James review room take care bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
