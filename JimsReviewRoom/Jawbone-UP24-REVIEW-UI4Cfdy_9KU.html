review by James review room today we'll
be looking at the jawbone up24 now this
is an activity bracelet and not just a
pedometer this measures your calories
burned your sleep patterns throughout
the night and you can keep track of the
food and water you intake along with
some other useful items as well that
we'll touch base on as of this review
this item is priced at $149
while the original jawbone up is priced
at one hundred and twenty nine dollars
the pricing is the same across all sizes
small medium and large in regards to
size you can find your fit prior to
buying with the wrist measure right on
the front of the box now comparing the
up24 to the original up there are
several minor changes that really adds
up to possibly justify the $20 premium
and we'll go over this in detail with
this review so without further adieu
we'll get started so in regards to
aesthetics the jawbone up24 features the
same rubber exterior as the original up
but now it only comes in either black or
this reddish orange color which they
call persimmon it does have a slightly
different pattern compared to the zigzag
design found on the original now placing
the wristband on isn't bad at all
repeatedly doing this during my trials
and tests and firmly flexing the product
of my palm showed no signs of wear
damage or stretch it's been a very
durable product for my use the other two
features on the wristband is the button
located here to tell the band to go into
sleep mode right before you sleep in to
awaken the band once you're up the
button received a definite improvement
with smoother edges all around now
during my review of the original up that
bun if rubbed against your skin actually
scratched you leaving some decent and
unsightly red marks on your arm or leg
now this model does not do that a small
improvement but very much worth
mentioning now on the other side is the
cap that houses your two and a half
millimeter input for charging your up
with the supplied USB cord this unit
lasts seven days on a full charge while
the original off lasted ten days now
from a dead battery
the jawbone up24 can fully charge in
about an hour and 20 minutes for my
tests the unit as claimed is still water
and sweat resistant and I've been able
to shower with this on
but of course no water submersion such
as bathing or swimming with this now
we're in the jaw bone up on a daily
basis is very comfortable
though it's super lightweight and the
medium weighs in about 22 grams now
wearing this to the office to wearing
this outdoors while walking felt very
natural and at times I would forget that
it's even there now even when I'm
sleeping I didn't notice it on as well
now compared to its competitor though
the Fitbit flex and the Fitbit force I
actually prefer because of its super
thin band on the bottom now wearing the
up is like wearing a thick banded watch
you can say so when you place your palm
on the table you'll notice it then not
detrimental but again it's worth noting
now moving on into the internals the
biggest change in improvement is the
Bluetooth connectivity and syncing and
the original up you had to take off your
band and connect using the
three-and-a-half millimeter input every
time you wanted to upload and record
your data the up 24 does this all
wirelessly and I'll be honest at first I
didn't think it was too much of a big
deal by manually syncing with the
original jawbone but after having
experience with wireless it's a huge
convenience and to be honest I think
this should be a standard feature not
having to take it off and put it back on
you know after a jog to view my distance
and steps or taking it on and off just
in the morning or night to view my daily
progress is a huge help so that's a
that's probably or is the biggest
difference in for some might be worth
the extra $20 to get this the only
problem and this is detrimental though
the band only currently works with iOS
which means only the following devices
on your screen works with the up 24
which is basically all Apple products no
Android devices are supported at the
time this review however the original up
is Android compatible of course check
their website as there may be an update
for the up 24 though in the future now
all activity bands including this
jawbone up offers and requires you to
download their free app so you can sync
and monitor your information and I have
always preferred the Jawbone's
up app compared to the competitors
Fitbit because of the ups detail and
ease of information that is available
now as you can see I'm on the home page
right now and the tab gives me a quick
percentage of how close I was to my goal
for that day for both sleep and in
orange my steps and won't get into that
a little bit shortly here and I look
below that there's daily little tidbits
on health clues and inside
which I found beneficial and educational
directly below that is my up feed which
chronologically shows my progress and
achieved goals and actions mine is
pretty simple with my steps in sleep
with an occasional food diary to track
my nutritional intake again more on that
coming up in regards to steps I click on
the bar for that day and the graph opens
to breakdown my activity by the hour the
breakdown as you can see is stunning
with the amount of detail broken down
you can see active minutes idle minutes
calories burned and distance walked now
this is also the same with sleep as well
now right before you go to sleep press
and hold the button on the up band an
LED light and a small vibration on your
wrist will indicate it is now in sleep
monitoring mode when you wake up in the
morning
press and hold it again once you open
your free app the band will sync and
update your sleep information which is
as well very detailed information such
as light sleep deep sleep how fast I
fell asleep and what can be seen on the
screen as well now for both walking and
sleep charts you can also slide your
fingers across as I'm doing here to view
the exact time of day or night on your
activity and this is so beneficial and
it's a great way to monitor if you're
getting a good night's sleep and if not
you can adjust your thermostat maybe
adjust the lighting even sleeping on a
different mattress and comparing your
results to optimize your deep sleep and
for both items you can set up different
goals of how many steps or how much
sleep you would like on a daily basis
and besides tracking your steps and
sleep the free app also has a food
intake log now from the main page you
click on the fork-and-knife
icon here and from there you can select
generic items from the big and beautiful
photos as I'm demonstrating on screen
you can be more precise by looking at
the location on where you ate as well
for example here I'm going to Panera
Bread and ordering the Asiago roast beef
which is one of my favorite sandwiches
now I add in a quick drink and that's
basically it it's recorded and for my
test comparing what was available on
this app with the actual nutritional
values on the websites some were spot-on
while some were close enough though
lastly was the ability to actually do a
barcode scan which I thought was really
cool with your camera phone and tablet
the scan automatically logs in one
serving which
you can adjust right in the app now back
on the main page I can click on the now
visible green bar which again breaks
down everything for me for me it's
counting protein and sodium intake for
others their main focus can be carb
intake and sugar levels again very
detailed as you can see on screen or
pause the video if you like to read it's
very informational to make me a more
informed and health-conscious individual
the last notable feature was logging
your workout now from the main page
click on your steps tab again then click
on the upper right hand corner and here
you can select a variety of activities
that you may have performed and as you
can see there's also a variety of
workouts that you can select from from
plain walking to yoga to basketball and
even tennis after selecting my sweat
inducing activity I then select my
effort level by sliding my finger from
either easy to gut-busting and sweat
pouring then selecting how long I
actually did it for it will estimate the
amount of calories that you've burned
from the workout session as well now
other features that comes with the band
and can be found when you swipe to the
right from the home page is a power nap
mode basically letting you snooze then a
vibrating alarm will wake you up after
your set desired time the other feature
is idle alert that vibrates your wrist
to indicate if you've been sitting too
long and it reminds you to get up and
move and lastly the self explained
stopwatch and then from the main
homepage again
swiping left it gives you more features
like changing your goals a linear
lifetime chart of your progress trends
that breaks down your daily weekly and
monthly steps and sleep and a team
option so any friends or family members
with a job on up can view each other's
data to help either encourage each other
or set a competitive nature so all
together as a whole the jawbone up24 I
believe is a great product with tons of
information and I mean a lot the app
experience alone is worth purchasing
enough to help the consumer understand
and realize where weaknesses are yet
offering goals to keep you motivated
it's light weight and slightly improved
design over the original jawbone up and
now offering a wireless connectivity
it's a huge plus making the extra $20
worth it
now a few downsides
these activity bracelets are really
getting up there in price at $150 you
personally have to determine if you're
Wilma spend the kind of cash and utilize
all these amazing features at $150 the
other activity bands are now including a
digital clock as well so for the watch
where is out there you don't have to
wear both which obviously feels a little
bit awkward now the cap I was never
really fond of because I'm deathly
afraid of losing that little thing and
once it's gone
that two-and-a-half millimeter plug is
exposed and lastly and it's possibly due
to the technological limitation and it's
not John's fault this does not work and
Android powered devices however I did
notice that this is the same issue with
the newest Nike FuelBand as well which
leads me to believe it's possibly an
Android limitation and do subscribe as
I'm doing a review on the Nike FuelBand
in the next coming weeks if not I should
already have it on my channel so that's
it for my review on the up 24 by jawbone
