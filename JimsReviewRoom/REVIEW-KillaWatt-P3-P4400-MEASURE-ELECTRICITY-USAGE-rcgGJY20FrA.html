review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the kilowatt p3 model P
4400 well look into the kilowatts
construction of style specifications and
features and lastly my pros and cons on
its performance and usage I purchased
this specifically to see how much
electricity was being consumed on items
I left plugged in and unused such as my
computer or computer monitor cell phone
charger air purifier clocks TVs and
standby and that's just to name a few
there that you might use yourself so
let's get started here
I purchased this kilowatt electrical
monitor display from amazon.com for $25
I headed for over a year now and today
which is April 27 2012
it's about 17,000 50 Cent's plus
shipping and handling so the
construction itself it's a ugly gray
plastic and it does come with a non
backlit LCD screen display and it
features a AC connection with ground and
five buttons on the actual product
itself which you can toggle between
eight different readings in a product
self weighs about five and a half ounces
are 5.6 ounces the kilowatt features
readings for volts amps watts volt amps
power factor frequency in Hertz
kilowatts an hour and it also comes with
a timer as well you simply plug this
item into the wall and then connect your
item for testing into the kilowatt it
measures power ratings with a max
voltage of 125 volts AC and that's
common between US households you can't
bring this over to Europe or anywhere in
Asia where it's typically 220 or 240
volts out there now also you can't
measure the bigger appliances such as
your dryer if it's an electrical or
maybe a electrical hot water heater
those typically have 220 240 volts or of
course you when you try to plug it in a
won't fit and you just a different plug
so I'll start with the pros and cons
here and looks and feels to be built
fine and haven't had any physical
problems with it and its construction
the buttons are still working fine after
over a year of usage
testing I haven't read any complaints
either in that area as well so it's a
pretty solid product although it says
it's made in China it gives a wide
variety of readings again eight
different readings for your particular
usage you can calculate how much it
costs to keep a particular product in
use for a year and how I calculated that
was I just simply took a particular
product plugged it in look at the
wattage reading and then bring it to a
website which I found here it's
www.ctvn.org or calculator that HTM and
I'll put an annotation on the YouTube
clip here so you can click it and you
just need the wattage estimate or know
how many hours you use this product in a
day and also the cost of how much your
electric company charges you and you can
easily go to and I used to live in
western New York I had our Jeannie rush
there gas and electric and just go on
their website you can get the cost of
the electric rates and their website or
now I live in the southeast you can have
Duke Energy or progressive energy go on
their website look for the link for the
cost of electrical usage or their
electric rates and like I said just plug
it into that website and it will
automatically calculate for you how much
it costs per day or even per year of
having that item plugged in and used for
me I mostly used it to determine how
much electricity was being used for
items that I had plugged in and wasn't
using at the time now per the Department
of Energy 20% of our electric bill is
from items on standby so for example my
computer plus the two monitors when left
off not in use it actually still
consumes 20 watts of power and it adds
up so if you have kids or tons of
roommates or so not only just having the
computer I'm pretty sure phone chargers
I have my ear air purifier on sometimes
all that adds up like I said even
unsuspecting
small items like I said you just leave
charged in or just leave it actually
consumes power another Pro is desponding
I guess another news is finding which
outlets are not performing as they
should either when you plug it in there
either displaying it lower or higher
than normal voltage and which means you
might have to change the outlet and this
price especially for older homes maybe
the outlets getting a little bit too old
maybe the wiring the home is a little
sketchy if it's not displaying the
normal or correct voltage in your house
another news that I've seen people do is
compare all the products with new
products for example my old projection
TV it consumed about 350 400 watts or so
and then my new big-screen samsung LED
TV 55 inches it only consumes 55 watts
of power and there's a tremendous
difference in savings as well so there's
a lot of usage you can apply which one
you want and some cons after using it
for a year I didn't see any cons for the
nooses that I needed
the only thing possibly is a backlit LCD
screen would have been nice if I'm
working in tight corners such as behind
the fridge and I'm just too lazy to
bring out the extension cable but other
than that I didn't see anything wrong
with it and a lot of people have praised
this product for its usage so that's it
for the product today on the kilowatt p3
model P 4400 and I hope you enjoyed this
review now if you have not please take
your time to like and/or subscribe to
this video for future alerts to new
products and again this is Jimmy from
Jim's review room take care everyone bye
