review room hope you guys doing well out
there today we're doing a quick unboxing
my first ever unboxing actually on my
channel and the powerbeats2 from beats
by dre now this is me unscripted no
narrative and this is me talking about
moving so if ya make some weird noises
or movements or whatever from saying um
a lot I do apologize in advance but
we'll get right into this here this is a
wireless Bluetooth system perfect for
working out jogging the more active
lifestyle of course and I reviewed the
jaybird Bluebird X and also the dropper
rocks that bluebirds didn't do so well
for me they kept falling out of my ear
this is a little bit of a different
design here it does go the clips I
should go behind the ear here and hold
it in place and I'm not too fond of this
style since it doesn't do so well for me
but they do go in your ear canal
hopefully there is some spare ear buds
or ear pieces here that fits my ear
canal pretty perfectly so we'll see
about that
that's it does clip in it will come like
a wide formation here and this you can
actually disconnect here there you go
and it does have the inline controller
as well for valium or volume um sorry
I've been people have been getting at me
for saying valium on the videos for some
odd reason animal why I say that but
there is an inline mic as well for you
but let's see what else is in the box
here again hopefully this first unboxing
for you guys isn't too bad
like I said I don't know what I'm
usually more um you know doing reviews
and unboxings but there goes the case
here it's not a neoprene finish it's
actually a kind of like a hard plastic
cardboard reinforced material on the
inside but let's unzip it here nice
small little handy case here does have a
little small clip there you can say and
the inside is also to see materials well
kind of like that hard fabric or plastic
it's not even flat it's not even a
neoprene or a felt lining it's hard as
well but nonetheless small there's
really no clips or anything like that
or any kind of bands to hold anything
for you so that's that for the case I'll
put that to the side here hey let's see
what else is in the box I'm pretty sure
we got some extra ear pieces in here
somewhere
we got a USB cable a micro USB cable I'm
sure to charge the unit since they are
wireless now they do not connect with
via a three-and-a-half millimeter input
to your smartphone or tablet etc the
earpieces are right here and it is
actually glued or taped down here how
open those pretty shortly let's see what
else is in the box that you usually give
me a beats by dre stick or somewhere and
usually hold on to those maybe one day
I'll do it a quick little giveaway for
those beats enthusiasts out there let's
see what we got yep there you go another
beats by dre soon here goes the other
stick as I got from other reviews that
I've done I don't know why I'm holding
them or I just leave them right next to
me over here
that's a QuickStart guide I'm pretty
sure there's some features in here that
I'll be sure to read just to inform you
guys during the review if there's
anything useful and I think that's about
it and some warranty information and
safety information just in case you get
gonna quote me electrocuted by these or
something I don't know but let's see
here so we'll put this to the side and
put that in the box so I'm doing this
here I do appreciate for all those
subscribers they've been following me up
obviously my channels a little bit new
but it's been growing very steadily it's
actually if I last shape and growing
about 30 almost 30 percent
month-over-month which is excellent
let's see what we got in here all right
so I got the large tips medium tips and
I think these are the flange tips which
I definitely love I have those and the
chopper rocks and those worked
phenomenal let's see here so these are
looks like medium and these things are
huge I don't like the size of a that's
like an olive I don't know who can fit
those in their ears or maybe it's just
me I got smaller ears I guess you can
say so here these would probably fit me
the best a flange design but like I said
I'll give a try to all these here and
see how they go
and let's see here
and for those who are keeping up with my
channel I am still testing out the that
in-car monitor the in-car dashcam had a
little air on it and had a reformat that
the the the memory card which is very
unfortunate but I read some Amazon
reviews and they said you know a couple
people have the same or similar problem
as well which is very unfortunate but
all right so we're gonna leave that
right there and this is Mt we don't need
this and more than likely if you guys
have been watching my review I always do
a quick unboxing in the beginning of my
review as well and you can basically see
me doing it right here for you and this
will more than likely be in that video
once it's up so I'm just get this
organized so that's about it here first
impression I mean I guess a really
silicone rubber like material all around
except for this here where it says power
beats and the beats logo obviously it's
more plastic II it goes the micro USB
port right there and then of course I'll
charge these puppies pretty soon on one
large thing I saw that earlier I meant
to mention it let's see um the actual
box when I pulled it out I just saw it
words it's on here it says charge me up
obviously before he turned me on
but it says quick charge 15 minutes
equals 1 hour of playback so that's not
too bad at all if you need to get some
power real quick 15 minutes is all it
takes us to get an hour worth of juice
and on the back here it says six hours
of up to 6 hours of battery life which
is awesome sweat and water-resistant
adjustable ear hooks it comes with a
carrying case and the remote talk as
well wireless Bluetooth so pretty
interesting good so what I'll do like I
said I'll test these up for a couple of
days see how they fit as well that's
more important to me because a lot of
these don't fit my ears but I prefer
these styles if they're in your ear
canal and you get that passive noise
isolation and you don't get a little bit
more immersed into your sound so that's
it for the unboxing hope you guys
enjoyed that
I'll do a little bit more in the future
let me know what you guys think if you
guys appreciate this I think you guys do
I think it wasn't too bad
a little different style and that's
about it so you guys subscribe if you
have it's like this video leaving the
comments below what you think of this
and what you think of this unboxing
video as well it's nice to get a little
bit of feedback and positive criticism
but other than that I'll see you once
this review comes out again this is
Jimmy with Jim's review room you guys
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
