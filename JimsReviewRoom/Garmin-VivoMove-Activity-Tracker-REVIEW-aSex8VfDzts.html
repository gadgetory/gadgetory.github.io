firm Garmin just released a very stylish
very fashion-forward activity watch not
a SmartWatch as there's no digital
display there's no graphics there's no
lights it's your very traditional analog
dial and physical hand movements that
some would very much prefer the two
other brands that comes to mind that
attempts to be fashion-forward are the
weddings activity pop and the fossil
queue line the misfit shine too is also
the other option that's very fashion
focused but there's no hand movement
there could be more though but those two
or three there comes to mind at the
moment now I personally paid for the
vivo move sport model that you see here
at the price of $150 retail but I'll
place my Amazon links in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the real-time most
up-to-date prices as of this moment so
without further ado sit back relax and
welcome everyone to another review going
over the physical features first this is
the biggest selling point a very simple
elegant and modern design the fossil
watches looks great in their own way too
but if you're not into chronographs
either for their design or for their
function the vive move might be an
option at $150 the cheapest model comes
with the silicone band that I have here
meant for those intending on running
with us on or intending on getting their
wrist wet from time to time but it's
easily interchangeable here for other 20
millimeter wide watch bands quick
release pins are used on the back and
with your finger just pull it to the
side and that's basically it for another
50 dollars at the total of $200 you can
get leather bands and at the full retail
price of $300 you can get an all-metal
case and a leather band of your choice
now with the base model the casing is
made of some kind of plastic and I was
worried about this though at some
plastics with any slight bump usually
leaves a mark or an abrasion and for the
past two weeks with the V will move I
haven't noticed any marks or Nick's now
same with the crown of the glass window
as well now keep in mind at this price
point you most likely won't see sapphire
being used on any watch but it did call
two garment
what the window was made out of and how
scratch-resistant in maybe now after
being on hold with Garmin for a good bit
as they were trying to find out what it
was the rep eventually said it's simply
made out of glass with a protective
coating not much more detail was
provided so how will this hold up over
time we just have to wait and see
unfortunately they're rotating to the
back it is stainless steel and behind
here there is a traditional coin battery
being used so there's no recharge needed
and the coin better last up to a year
per garment web site very less the vivo
move is rated at 5 atm so you can wear
this into the bathtub or pool of course
wearing the leather band wouldn't be
ideal so regarding to looks here I think
it looks really good it's very much
visible during a day time it has that
bling eNOS factor and it looks really
modern and sharp just keep in mind there
are no luminous parts so nothing glows
in the dark
I do wish there was a date display on
here like a month in your day that would
have been very helpful but on the other
hand the value is of course in its smart
features on the left there is an
activity bar that fills up throughout
the day and keep in mind Garmin does
offer auto goal with its app which means
your step goals do change everyday based
on your previous day's performance and
the right is the move bar which Garmin
has been using on every one of their
vivo products when you are in active for
an hour
the first big red bar will show for
every additional 15 minutes of
inactivity a small red mark will show
revealing up to two hours of you not
really being active that's a little
reminder for you to get up and walk
around and after so many steps the move
bar will clear itself out now last
regarding the crown pull this out adjust
your time like a traditional watch push
this in for one second and this will
sync your phone to update your steps and
sleep hold it down for three seconds to
pair your vive move to your selected
device now with most analog or non
display activity trackers the vive move
is pretty similar to what it does track
like your steps and your sleep if you
decide to wear this overnight and that's
really it now sadly there's no vibrating
motor for alerts and no silent vibrating
alarm that's used to wake you up in the
morning
now considering how thick that case is
that little buzz that little vibration
motor again would have been a great
feature overall for the price the
styling it's not bad and it's a fair
value when you compare it with the
competition from
if you don't care for the bells and
whistles of other dedicated fitness
trackers that is and just need something
generic for general activity and sleep
recording the vive move would be a
consideration again the looks will be
your main priority and how to wait and
see how the glass window holds up since
the watch was just recently released so
that's it for this review here let me
know what you think below is this thing
going to sell or do you think it's going
to be too basic and be a dud be sure to
add me on to Facebook Twitter or
Instagram at both my business account
and my new personal account here at
jimmy long official you guys take care
and I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
