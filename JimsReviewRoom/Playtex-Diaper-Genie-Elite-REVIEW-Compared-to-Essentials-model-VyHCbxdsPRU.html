review room welcome to another review
now as some of you may know I'm a new
dad and venturing into really unknown
territory now everyone with kids said to
get a diaper Gd and I have both here the
elite and the essentials model priced at
$39.98 size for seven dollars so without
further ado we'll get started now a
diaper pail in this case the diaper
genies are meant to stow stinky diapers
away creating a more hygienic nursery
now at first the pail looks so simple
that I thought the genie was just a
gimmick the pail itself surprisingly is
just a big hollow case that holds
garbage bags inside but obviously I was
wrong in the end and it goes way beyond
that now we've used a regular trash can
and also placed a carbon filter on there
it retained the smell however when we
open the trash can on the next news it
absolutely rates it was horrible the
Genie pals have a clamping mechanism
that somewhat seals the bag temporarily
until you use the genie again and the
refill bag themselves have five layers
to them so no smell escapes through the
plastic now on the elite model if I can
put this into an analogy is kind of like
an airlock now one compartment opens and
once the diaper is in then it closes
compartment 1 you can say while the
diaper moves into compartment 2 below
which is where the main trash bag stays
now the essential model on the other
hand has just one compartment it looks
like and you have to manually push the
diaper through the odor sealing door in
both models that I've been using for the
past three months both performed as well
sealing and odor never once that I
smelled dirty diapers in the room and
when using the genie themselves and then
opening and closing the lid no smells
really escaped or escaped at all
now hover from my tests and experiences
I highly recommend spending the extra
$10 and getting the paddle pushing
taller relief model the essentials at
times would be
tough to push through and it felt less
sanitary since I do have to wash my
hands now you can say to get the diaper
through that door but other functions to
answer some common questions the trash
bag is one continuous roll it's not
perforated so there's no individual
compartments for each diaper which is
fine for my experience now either
getting these smaller essentials or the
taller elite they both hold a very good
number of diapers until the base is
filled so I don't think that would be
too much of a concern for you the bag
can eventually be cut anywhere at any
time so there's minimal waste you have
to tie a quick knot on both ends though
just to dispose the bag and while each
diaper is pushed down and in the trash
bags rolls out automatically so it's
okay to bump the plastic liner with the
back of your palm or hand accidentally
if that's the case much cleaner than
using a standard trash can so that's it
for this review I know it's a quick and
simple one here but I hope you enjoyed
it in some way and it did help you as
well please take your time to like and
