room welcome back to another review
we're looking at the HyperX elite alloy
RGB keyboard i have featured several
mechanical keyboards in my computer
builds in the past but I haven't done a
review yet now the reason being I want
to get as much experience with these
before speaking about them and I think
after a year of testing or using these
things I think we're good to go now
as always being transparent with you
guys HyperX did send us review units but
as always please watch the entire video
for both pros and cons I'll leave my
affiliate links down in that video
description below for you guys to check
the most updated prices also you never
know when these things might go on sale
those links should help you out
I'm Jimmy when Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
video
going over the physical features first
the alloy elite RGB looks flippin good
for a premium keyboard this does
represent its price point pretty
accurately in my opinion but besides
visually which we'll get into detail
shortly physically this entire keyboard
is plastic except for the solid steel
frame up top now this gives the keyboard
some weight and it feels beefy and hefty
I love that feature now the keys up tap
are sharp around the edges giving a
feeling of precision versus more rounded
off keys yet you might get on some of
the keyboards likey caps and wrist rest
here are satin matte black finishes with
an ever so slightly subtle of some
feeling of grip eNOS here both the keys
and wrist rest are far from feeling
cheap and if anything it feels super
premium but you also have titanium and
textured keys included for WASD and
different colored number caps that a top
left has three brightness level settings
the middle allows for your keyboard to
toggle through your saved RGB lighting
now I'll show you shortly as well but
you can save your color and animations
directly into the keyboard itself and
say you bring this keyboard to our
friends house your lighting profiles are
still there it doesn't matter if your
friend's computer has the HyperX RGB
software installed or not again it's
saved right in there and next up is game
mode which allows you to turn off some
keys so you don't accidentally bump
certain keys during play now sometimes I
hit the windows button or the tilde key
that brings up the command bar up top no
controls are on your right very
straightforward here which they offered
a little bit more resistant on the
Vaughn scroll wheel here but that's just
me being nitpicky now on the back you
have an additional port for a gaming
mouse or USB headsets a fixed massive
braided cord here that comes right out
the rear and last rotating to the
underside legs to prop the keyboard up
which was minimal but just enough for my
personal preference now getting into the
details this keyboard and like many
others that I've used so far for the
past year are for competitive gaming
many are familiar with cherry-red MX
switches which are linear provides no
tactile feedback and are typically
quieter a gamers prefer red switches due
to the fact that they have a linear feel
for speed and nothing holding them back
when competitive gaming less input lag
feeling
is crucial now with that being said the
LA elites RGB review unit that is sent
here has brown switches it's the same
actuation force as the Reds but brown
switches gives you ever so slight
tactile feedback for those looking for a
bouncing between reds and the very
cliquey blues Browns sits right in
between now it's a subtle press down and
then a click that gives you that feeling
of you cresting over a slight bump the
alloy elite does provide a very clean
feeling actuation and playing with brown
switches it's a very enjoyable
alternative that gives sensory feedback
that a press was engaged it's a matter
of preference but man it does feel good
and as a friendly reminder this keyboard
does come with red blues or Browns you
can find more at hyper XCOM now as for
keyboard performance zero ghosting on
the keys here you press 10 keys down at
all at the same time all 10 keys
oppressed nothing is missed the keys
don't sound that much louder from my
experience than the Reds and typing on
this specifically for work and not for
gaming in this case the affirmation of a
click does feel good and gives a sense
of accuracy the last but not least the
ingenuity software is very robust and
provides tons of options from my
personal opinion I don't know what other
websites are saying but I found the
software and customization for the most
part straightforward the only issue that
didn't make sense is selecting a color
from the color wheel and then the
requirement of then selecting the color
box to assigned a new color with course
here let's say the assigned color box is
already selected you pick a color on
that color wheel and then you're done
basically but it's such a small little
hiccup for HyperX it's not that big of a
deal to me now you have the option to
freestyle and select individual keys
that lights up as well you can have
jones
as you see on screen here you aren't
able to perform macros which works very
easily it's very straightforward to set
up and those colors they look very good
and vibrant if anything they were on the
brightest out there so during my gaming
experience it kind of wrapped this up
here overall the brown switches didn't
really bother me it was actually a
really reassuring way to ensure that
have accuracy or executed a particular
command movement and such I don't feel
like it hindered my gaming performance
again HyperX does offer three
different switches you can choose which
one that you want but in my case I love
this keyboard it was very responsive the
colors I get looks great playing certain
games that requires a lot of precision
for me it was a battlefield one
sometimes with the fast-paced action
where my fingers are going all over the
place with overwatch again this keyboard
hands-down one of the best that I've
used so far on this channel so in the
end colors I loved it the software I
didn't find a big deal with it it works
perfectly fine for me and found it easy
to set up and look great felt great
overall I highly recommend this
mechanical keyboard again I'm Jimmy
