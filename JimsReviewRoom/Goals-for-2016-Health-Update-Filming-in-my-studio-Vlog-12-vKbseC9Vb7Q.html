you guys are doing good welcome back to
another one of my vlogs here if you guys
watch my last one I told you guys I was
horribly horribly sick I went to four
different doctors in two weeks
and by the time I saw the third doctor
they finally gave me a chest x-ray
trying to figure out what the hell is
going on and there was a little bit of
fluid in my lungs and I don't know how I
got it they diagnosed me with pneumonia
and it's not like I went outside you
know without a shirt on or anything like
that
what are most fun I was working like
crazy during the Christmas season and
yeah it's been out of commission the
week after Christmas or the week before
New Year's and then in the two weeks in
Jan were the first two weeks in January
and for the most part I'm better now I'm
about I don't say 99% better I can't
speak for too long or exert too much
energy
I might start coughing a little bit
hopefully not in this video but if I do
you know I do apologize in advance but
today we are in my studio or not in my
car just want to discuss some things
that I want to accomplish in 2016
hopefully share that with you guys no
promises but they are goals it's
something that I want to work towards by
getting no promises and when I said let
me put this phone down real quick here
alright how does that look nothing that
looks good alright so for 2016 first
things first starting off real smaller
new shirt this is gonna be most likely
on most of the reviews it's kind of like
my uniform I don't like to switch up on
the shirt colors trying to match it with
a review and whatnot because I have to
try to find a shirt that looks good on
camera that has it look good on
post-editing and whatnot for me
this isn't like my uniform it matches
with my thing the greys in my channel
the blacks on my channel of course the
gold color as well so gray is in I
believe and I think this shirt looks hot
why don't you guys let me know
this is Banana Republic I got on sale
for about maybe 30 or 35 dollars the
week before Christmas before I got sick
and whatnot and I got a really good
discount they always sell these damn
jokes like eighty dollars which is crazy
I hate personally paying full price for
things I know I'm looking at my stuff up
you're on the right
I do still personally pay for a lot of
stuff that you guys see that I review
that's full price that it's a business
thing so I mean it is what it is but me
personally if I can get that unsound
props
I just love to you know try to get you
know the best bang for you buck
basically so I like this regarding try
and look for it right now I used to wear
my red plaid shirt a lot and you guys
see that my avatar my banner is my
social media channel and YouTube
obviously I need to update so you guys
will see that updated as well the avatar
the banners again give me a second let
me just show you that register just in
case you don't know what I'm talking
about because I really show myself on
camera but give me a second alright so
this is the red shirt here bought this
at Old Navy for like I don't know 18
bucks back in the day when I went to
Dallas Texas and been wearing this for
like the last two years three years on
the channel and it's been my little
signature color it's a little it's
obviously much more fitted when I
compared to when I first worn it so
again it's a little bit it still looks
pretty decent our price to wear it once
a while my camera's falling down all
right there that should look a little
bit better so anyways this shirt you
will see this less predominant again the
profile pictures that you'll see on all
my social media channels will have
eventually this gray shirt so moving on
to other things in 2016
regarding this camera here I'm recording
I need Nexus 6p
I tried recording with the LG v10 which
phone that I still love is the most
underrated phone for the latter part of
2015 into 2016 for the time being the
front facing camera surprisingly does a
horrendous job with white balance right
now you see a little bit of a warm tone
to my skin and the environment which is
great this has a very very white
overblown look if it especially you know
it's a little bit overblown right now
here on my face because the Sun and the
window coming in it's early in the
morning but the v10 which is doing a
horrible job but with that being said
with vlogs I'm still debating I don't
want to get another DSLR just
specifically from belongs I can't carry
my Nikon which I have behind me or
behind this camera it's just too it's
just too heavy a camera to hold around
it doesn't have image stabilization this
nexus 6p doesn't have interesting
as well so it's been pretty horrible but
I want to get maybe a smaller camera
maybe in the five or six hundred dollar
range maybe a sony a 5100 a6000 maybe a
sony NX mini something like that
we're just cheaper than a full-blown
DSLR cheaper than a t6 nod from Canon
whatever it may be but the same time it
does you know do some justice a little
bit better than a cellphone obviously
that's maybe I mean I you know of course
there's other expenses that I gotta you
know do regarding my computer back here
if you guys watching vlog number three
or four next week I will be making
another video asking you guys for help I
think I know about computers more than
the average person the next you know
co-worker that's in your office and
whatnot but I don't file I don't file
the specs of what's like hot right now
today I don't know what is the best bang
for your buck so I'll just make a quick
video this computer if you guys don't
know is running really really old stuff
the graphics card along the motherboard
alone runs on a PCI Express 2.0 so it's
not even Express 3.0 but that's been out
like forever nothing is running out
directs or was it DirectX 10 instead of
11 which is the current one who know
then that's one of me I don't know the
specifics so I am gonna make a video
next week hopefully and just say hey
guys anyone computer tech savvy out
there
write in the comments below you know
what what what I need and I'll give you
my budgets my price range and I also let
you know what equipment I'm probably
most likely transferring over I still
have a samsung pro SSD but I don't want
to get rid of there's two platter hard
drives and whatnot but anyway that's
gonna be the video next week so keep an
eye on that if you can't help me they
have to be very good you get brownie
points that's all I can provide right
now so we'll see about that
other things other things Oh
smartwatches I have been doing more
smartwatches that will be a new genre a
new area focus for 2016 once I get a new
computer once I build a new computer I
may
might do some computer peripherals
specifically gaming peripherals I know I
have a big gaming audience out there
when I did my polls on Twitter and
Facebook a lot of you guys said you guys
do game game maquette occasionally so
hopefully I can cater to that market as
well I've done some gaming stuff before
and but in most part it's it's done good
reviewing games themselves they just
take too much time like clean Metal Gear
Solid was like over 40 hours the last of
us you know you can if you guys played
that for PlayStation 4 that's it forever
and it just takes so much time of me
sitting there and I enjoy games don't
get me wrong but the same time at the
end day I still run a business I need to
put a roof over my you know my family's
head and whatnot other things and I get
this all 2016 so I'm really excited oh
one other thing if you guys obviously
have been following me the first week of
January
Sennheiser reached out to me and said
hey would you like to basically do a
giveaway for us to you know to help
promote them and of course hop my
channel as well
so we partnered up they sponsored my
video I didn't get paid anything I
didn't even get freed earbuds but they
at least they just reached out to me at
least we created that business
relationship and hopefully down the road
you know I may get some products from
them to review it does save a lot of
money from my pocket
but as always as you guys know on my
channel where they're upset pay for most
of my stuff still or some of the items
that I do get from you know review units
from companies
I still do an unbiased review of course
as you guys know if if it works it's
great if it doesn't work then you know
so be it I would rather get a full
rounded full review of not only the
product and its features and how it
works but also the user experience so I
mean you guys see my videos I don't need
to explain and defend or pump up my
credentials or something like that
my let my work speak for itself and
always been a you know big believer all
bad but yeah Sennheiser reached out so
I'm grateful for that I'm very grateful
and one thing I want to say like so I'm
trying to saying every one of my videos
after a hundred thousand subscribers
which was just last month in December
thank you to you guys I swear to God
doors have been opening like crazy
January even though I was out of
commission for the first two weeks but I
can still type you know what not vendors
have just been reaching out to me
which I'm very grateful for I'm humbled
by it because now we're getting some big
companies and reputable names it's not
like these Chinese companies from out of
nowhere reaching out to me but some good
names that said they just want to work
with me to see you know what could
happen what what can we do and I don't
thank you to you guys
ever since I hundred thousand
subscribers ever since you guys just
piled in onto the channel in December of
course the holiday season January has
been a great month
doors opening the channel I would assume
wouldn't become better as more quality
content quality products are coming in
and it does free up the pocketbook a
little bit where I can spend it buy
other products that I really want to
test there's the Samsung headphones I
want to test out there's the v-moda
Wireless and 100's and a lot of people
are asking me about B&amp;amp;O headphones the
pair of Zeke 2.0 I believe a lot of
people have been asking me and these are
things that I do have to pay out of
pocket
you know boats never sent me anything
and I do pay for those out of pocket but
anyways I always talk about this this
crap here you know thank you to you guys
the doors are opening up and whatnot
what I want to talk about is physically
with us to know this is not a studio
tour the room is quite a mess I just
never understood sometimes you have tech
reviewers where they show off their room
which is great you know you know each to
their own and the rooms are immaculate I
don't think my room my studio here I
don't think was ever immaculate ever if
it was clean
there's be tools or boxes laying around
and whatnot but anyways let me show you
what I intend to do for 2016 in the
studio this just real quick alright keep
in mind guys there's barely any optical
stabilization here on the Nexus 6p so
the camera might be a little bit wobbly
but first things first my old TV here
this is an old projection TV I don't
want to throw this way I don't want to
sell it and whatnot
because I mean if it still works it
still works it's been a great TV for the
time that I've had it is probably maybe
10 years old who knows and but I'll be
honest I'm a need for business purposes
but yeah for business seriously I may
need a new leb you know one of those
thin profile TVs to test and in 2016 I
might be doing more some bar reviews as
I've done in the past
I noticed those those have done pretty
decent and whatnot so I am trying to
have that done all of this will be
actually moved into another room here
which I'll show you guys out I guess
pretty shortly but these are my clips
are f82 2s
I love these speakers I bought this a
couple years ago love them just love I
know everyone has done a little
preference these were just great for me
also a clips sub-woofer and they got the
center channel down there and yeah
that's basically it like that I'm gonna
move it to this other room give me a
second let me show you guys all right
guys so this is my office my old studio
that actually you know I used to sit
right there and record my videos in this
room and you if you guys watched my
videos from like what a year ago or two
years ago you probably see the the foam
boards in the background and whatnot so
this is my old studio that actually
moved to the the other room now which is
a little bit bigger a little bit more
organized but as you guys can see here
this is my shipping room I know I need
to get this organized but this room will
eventually be the new was a home theater
entertainment testing area so I'm gonna
have a big-screen TV right there and
then I'm gonna have of course my clip
speakers but when I test other audio
products of course it's gonna be right
here on this wall so what do you guys
think really clean-cut and on the behind
the scenes it looks like crap but
hopefully over here it looks a bit more
professional and I want to emphasize
guys when I first started YouTube those
would have tripods that I used to use I
use them once in a while I probably
mount sometimes my microphones on there
but let me show you guys I'm telling you
humble beginnings you don't need you do
not need crazy high-end expensive stuff
to get started it does make your life
easier but it's more about the content
this freaking cheapo tripod I bought
from Amazon 25 bucks it's not even a
fluid head but I try to make it work
again 25 or 30 bucks on Amazon this I
actually I don't know where I got this
but I think Best Buy sells this brand
let me try to focus it for you guys Best
Buy sells this brand here
cheapo tripod it's a little bit more of
a stiffer head not a fluid head
obviously but this is what I this is
literally this built the foundation and
eventually I broke even I started I
confirmed that I was able to make a
living you know off of YouTube and this
this basically did it I didn't get the
Manfrotto tripods I didn't get those
what two three four hundred dollar
tripods
until afterwards until I said you know
what this is worth the investment let me
make my life a little bit easier and get
the video tripods I started with that
softboxes same thing this is what I
bought a set what a pair of these for
what 30 40 bucks on Amazon I still use
them you saw it in the other room like I
said you don't need expensive stuff and
you guys seen the quality of my videos
just go back a year ago yeah it doesn't
look as good the quality and that is but
you can still see the views the search
results are still there you know I don't
know I don't know what to say you don't
need really really really good stuff
thing get started all you need is to
start with an idea and bring something
new to the industry that's all I gotta
say but anyways this is a like I said
the shipping room is what I call it now
I don't play the piano
I bought it because I wanted to but I
never did but maybe for my kid I got to
get a little table for her so she she
can practice she's almost two years old
now and March she'll be two so that'd be
interesting alright so this is basically
the studio like that this is not a
studio tour but just trying to give you
guys an update these are the audio
engine HD eight-six if you guys you know
file some other youtubers they some of
them do have the audio engine a five
pluses they love them this is the
follow-up this is the or the next model
up that is
I love these things I tested them for
about an hour so far I didn't break them
in yet but so far they sound phenomenal
not indoors not sponsor anything like
that this is from my personal testing in
the review of course we'll see otherwise
hopefully they'll they'll hold up and
what now these I need a test I know it
showed you guys on social media that I
am working on these this will be updated
probably uploaded maybe the end of this
week if not this week and early next
week
I bought these before in December trying
to see if I can find some gaming time
after the Christmas you know holiday
season but I eventually got sick so I
didn't play but I don't know it was
getting really good guys it has a
reviewer
I don't read other people's reviews
especially if stuff that I'm gonna buy I
wanna especially games I just want to
see if it's good to me
sometimes you know back in the day you
play some games that were rated what 8.0
8.5 but in my eyes it was like what up 9
or 10 to me and of course Mario maker
again brand new haven't even played it
and have these for like a month now I'll
be honest with you guys I probably won't
even get a chance to play these things
just because I'm trying to catch up on
work I just miss so much work the first
two week in January I'm trying to catch
up my calendar is just booked all the
way to mid-february right now but some
Bluetooth speakers of course the LG v10
and this is a table that I fell might I
know it looks you know pretty messy
right now but I just leave my camera
right there the camera again the softbox
and I just aim everything down and I
just basically get right here and I know
it doesn't look anything like my YouTube
videos but like I said once you set up
the lighting you use the night kind of
camera and whatnot then it looks a
little bit better I know a lot of guys I
know a lot of people have been you know
some people like the distressed Hat look
some people say what the hell you need a
new hat I know I need a new hat guys
that hopefully will be on its way
so we'll see alright so that's it guys
those are my goals for 2016 again no
promises that I'll even fulfill any of
this but like I always believe you set
your goals high set them really high
and you try to achieve as much as you
can and by the end of the year for me by
the end of 2016 you'll accomplish much
more than if you didn't set up any goals
at all so that's my theory
again no promises but those are things
that I'm trying to achieve here at Jim's
review room headquarters world
headquarters on that I guess I'll leave
that you know leave it here for you guys
again next week
if next week or prior the following week
depending on the schedule I'm gonna put
out another blog I do need your help
seriously I it would help me to saves me
a lot of time if there are more PC or
tech savvy people that could just
basically provide their input for me on
the video about my computer that is and
so that way I can start buying parts
excuse me start buying parts and they
said get rid of this lagging computer
it's it's starting to slow me down quite
a bit so other than that I'm Jimmy with
Jim's Ruby room I have to go test
products and I'll see you guys on the
next one if you guys want to write some
questions down below and I'll try there
try to answer them in the next video
we'll see you never know but I always
love hearing from you guys follow me
Facebook Twitter Instagram and so you
guys to the next one you guys take care
