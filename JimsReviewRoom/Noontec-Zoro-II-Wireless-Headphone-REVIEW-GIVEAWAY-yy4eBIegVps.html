as I review more headphones I see more
viewers are desiring wireless versions
of their favorite brands and then the
several of you guys have also asked me
to review more budget-friendly options
rather than the two to three hundred ala
products I have recently been reviewing
well noon text sent me their newest
Zorro 2 HD wireless headphones to test
and these are priced at just $150 on
Amazon ends of this video and what I'll
do is I'll place a link in the video
description below so you guys can check
that and see what the most recent prices
are today so without further adieu I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
starting with the physical features
these are somewhat reminiscent to the
first generation Beats solos in regards
to style the entire unit offers a very
fingerprint prone but beautiful glossy
black finish here that extends down the
sides the cushion up top is minimal
however the lightness on these
headphones are one of the lightest I've
never used more than they comfort test a
little bit later though now moving down
towards the arms the retraction and
extending mechanism works perfectly fine
with holding its position firmly but
what I did notice is that the foldable
ear cups which are a plus did make this
loud clicking noise now looking closely
I notice the hinges where the pivots are
indeed metal but the locking design is
purely plastic now hopefully through so
many actuations the arm stays find after
so many uses
now the headphones do slightly rattle
bit similar to the original beat solos
again and when you do compare to a more
premium product you can hear the
difference nonetheless for a hundred and
fifty dollars the construction from what
I can tell still seems fine for use the
seams are all sealed of course no parts
are coming apart in stressing the band
and in general the assembly and
craftsmanship is good going over the
buttons there's pause employee that's
also used to check the battery levels
with two taps here holding down the same
fun powers and down the unit and of
course powers it up as well and the
right ear cup holding down either of
these buttons for two seconds or longer
controls your volume but a quick press
and release works great at skipping
songs and radio stations on my android
phone now on the bottom is a microUSB
port for charging two zeros and going
back to the left ear cup if for some
reason you don't want to use bluetooth
there is a three-and-a-half millimeter
port to connect with these supplied lay
flat cables now the cables are very well
made and despite not having a locking
mechanism to the headphones the wires
stay in very tight preventing any
accidental pulse from disconnecting the
unit the very last feature that I tested
was NFC or near field communication on
the side testing this with three
different phones with double checking
ahead of C and Bluetooth being on just
plain out didn't work very unfortunate
since NFC does become quite convenient
now regarding comfort and long-term
wearing the
and ear ear pads are a bit shallow and a
wuss offered a little bit more cushion
they didn't cause my ears to sweat but
considering a bit more plushness would
have felt better for long-term wearing
the clamping force on the head was good
there's some pressure but not tight for
my use and because the band up top is so
thin in the headphones being so light
with the fitness of the ear pads as well
in general they're really minimalistic
to offer any kind of nuance overall
comfort they of course don't feel like a
high-end pair of headphones but for the
price for casual wearing if they
actually worked out really well now
regarding sound leaking these do leak a
good bit though unfortunately with those
sitting next to you they're able to hear
pretty clearly of what again you're
listening to at 50% volume now to the
moment that you've been waiting for how
do they sound now the bass I'm glad
wasn't over dumb there's just enough
base in general to satisfy most general
listeners out there but for bass heads
the headphones don't hit that low bottom
at all now where these do shine in the
first characteristic that you'll notice
if you do try these on is how loud these
can get with some very bright and
forward mids the spatial sound is
actually present for a bunch of pair of
headphones here sound can be heard
distinctly from left to right but even
more impressive sound can be heard in
front of you and the back of you as well
and now regarding the high notes I
didn't hear much if any distortion where
the high notes would sound jumbled
together and the high notes were not ear
ringing or dinging as well so I would
say audio files that prefer a more flat
signature I will for sure say they would
desire a more refined sound these aren't
for you but if you are more of a casual
listener keep in mind though the audio
signature is pushed pretty far forward
and if you do like that these work great
for this price range now regarding
battery life in tech claims up to a
crazy 35 hours of working time and from
my testing leaving this out literally
all day 24/7 leaving this at 50% volume
just to get a median base these pair of
headphones died in 33 hours and exactly
37 minutes a very impressive number all
together beating briefly more expensive
brands out there so overall to conclude
the only crap that I really had with
these in my personal opinion is the
construction does feel slightly cheap by
God meant for the price for budget
seekers for general audio listeners the
sound signature works out well the
battery life is insane and the features
of offering wireless
for this price range is a huge plus so
now regarding the giveaway here look in
the video description now place a link
in there on ways you can enter the
drawing once you do that there's
additional ways to increase your chance
on putting as well all the directions
are in there of course the link will ask
you for your contact information so that
way I can reach you for your mailing
address the giveaway will be drawn one
week from the upload of this video so
good luck out there and for those coming
