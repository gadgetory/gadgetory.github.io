welcome back to another one of my videos
today we're doing is direct comparison
between the JBL flip for they have here
and also the ue wonder boom and both of
these were originally released within
three to four weeks of each other so
they're definitely competitors on the
marketplace right now what I'll do is in
this video here I'll go over the very
main important details the main
differences to basically help you guys
try to make a purchase decision after
this video and I'll first up here
regarding pricing both these do retail
for $99 which isn't bad at all as always
I'll leave my Amazon affiliate links
down in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time
indefinitely when these things might go
on sale by going over the physical build
first here there are two speakers on the
side of the JBL logo there are no
speakers coming out from the side here
or where the buttons are located
sometimes people who are new to JBL they
expect 360Â° sound because the fabric
mesh grille does almost wrap around the
entire speaker here unfortunately it
doesn't it is very directional just
basically comes frontward and out to you
with the ue wonder boom with a different
story here audio is blasted out here or
give the impression that is being
dispersed 360 degrees so where you put
this wherever you're facing you'll get
the impression that this is pumping
audio or write to you so that's one of
the biggest perks about the ue wonder
boom second regards ruggedness the JBL
flip for it is very rugged here it
doesn't have any of the drop protection
claims it is ipx7 rated which means this
can go underwater up to three point
three feet or basically one meter for up
to 30 minutes now one thing I do have to
throw caution at is these passive base
radiators I wanted to get and see that
hopefully could focus for you guys
JBL decides to make it a little bit more
shiny so sorry about that reflection
they tell you of course don't press the
on the base radiator before stirring my
testing
you kind of push it a little bit to see
it how much is give it provides I
haven't had any viewers on my channel
state that the Bliss product or even any
JBL products had any compromises on the
base radiator so that's a good thing but
if you guys want true goodness go with
the Wonder booms here I had dropped
tested as a drop rated drop tested up to
5 feet per Yui I dropped it during my
review several times if you guys seen it
just prove mud proof stain resistant
stain proof you can do almost anything
with this and this thing is nearly
indestructible basically also ipx7
radiant but again the biggest thing
between these two and this would affect
your purchase decision the flip for does
not float for some reason unfortunately
it does not
the you wonder boom it does float in
water gives you peace of mind if you
guys are on the lake you don't want this
to drop to the bottom of the lake here
and of course you're probably not going
to find it ever again so just keep that
in mind
so going over the connectivity both
these of course use bluetooth but with
the flip for there is a 3.5 millimeter
port on the back here that's right next
to the micro USB charging input with the
wonder boom there is no physical
connections it is just strictly
bluetooth that's it so again keep that
keep that in mind too that to
consideration both days Bluetooth signal
for the average consumer I tested this
in my house here I usually leave my
speaker of ones out of the house and in
a walk upstairs onto the other side with
my phone
both of these did not have the signal
cut out at all I be guys want something
superior or which one is the better one
the UE wonder boom does get a little bit
further range I did it precisely
measures but about sixty maybe even 70
linear feet I got with this with this I
definitely got about 40 to 50 linear
feet before a single start cutting out
with my pixel accel foam that is now
moving on here regarding connectivity
once again Jay Bell does offer this new
thing called JBL connect plus any future
JBL speakers will have this feature
viewers have suggested to me that
previous or older bluetooth speakers
from JBL will eventually receive a
firmer and hopefully
can work with it as long as your film is
JBL connect plus enabled or offer here
you can connect multiple speakers to
this even up to a hundred speakers or
more per GBL and have them all play at
the same time it's one of the biggest
selling point of having a JBL product at
this moment with the ue one a room would
be boom to you in the mega boom they do
have that party a feature that double up
feature and you connected multiple
speakers to it would be wonderful
unfortunately you're going to only pair
this to another wonderful speaker at the
moment and it's very easy to do you just
basically hold the ue logo but other
than that you can only pair this with
another wonder boom speaker so just keep
that in mind so eventually what we're
going to do is play several samples
several the audio clips for you guys you
guys probably have already heard these
songs before but this time I'm doing it
head-to-head comparison so just hang on
tight and I'll get back with you right
afterwards
are you talking to code no reason why
you got your whole zombie
I knew something was excited when you
left I wanna go all I wanna do is get to
tell you is to like to talk to something
for you but I did to make sure you get
the best but don't you remember I need
something like a play spending a lotta
fun don't you in me with a rake don't
need to make it a treasure find me at I
decided I'll be on my way but I don't
wanna wait
come on
you and I appreciate you and I
all right folks so that's it for the
sound patch again as always of course
audio recorded on my end and then play
through your speakers or have the best
depiction of audio quality but again
hence my comparison here in the end here
obvious I personally enjoyed me flip for
a bit more here and the reason being is
because it just sounded more colorful
it's not a handle like a little bit more
depth over the you you wonder boom bass
on this thing is much better in my
opinion here it does have a bass boost
it's sound signature it does give me a
little bit more immerse into my music I
do you appreciate that a little bit more
with the wonder boom it is a little bit
more neutral by do admit it during the
review I also mentioned this it sounds
as though for some basic tracks it
sounds like the Wonder boom is trying to
put or push bass levels on here and
sometimes you get a little bit of
distortion the mid-range is sometimes
does sound brighter and clearer on the
Wonder boom itself with the Wonder film
there is a little bit of grass business
also on the higher end as well so in
general or in the end here I don't the
audio quality on this compared to the
support that is it's not up to par I
guess you could say in regards to
quality if you do play that you know
moderate medium maybe 75% by me it will
still sound great to you but if you play
on either one of these speakers at
louder fine I felt as though the boot or
the Wonder boom does have a little bit
of difficulty keeping up with that same
immersion and quality that you get on
the flip 4 so in the end here I would
say this flip 4 and go for the audio it
does sound great I love the audio
signature from JBL in general I love the
sound of this thing but if you want true
ruggedness you want something that built
like a tank if you are outdoorsy person
if you have kids if you are planning to
go to the beach to the leg bring this on
a boat again it stresses on your jet ski
this thing is built like a tank
and if you're not intending on blasting
this thing fuldheim on time go with the
Wonder boom it gives you peace of mind
if you want through audio sound the
sound performer go with the flip for so
hope this comparison video again quick
but it is basically a quick rundown of
what the pros and cons are these on each
and it helps you make a purchase
decision again I'm Jimmy with Jim's
review but you guys take care I will see
you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
