and welcome back to another one of my
videos today we're checking out a
budget-friendly parentless sport
earphones you guys been tell me start
reviewing all this expensive crap here
do something for the budget-conscious so
I picked up the vivant move 28 it's
priced at just 34 dollars but more
importantly I'd noticed that had a
ridiculous amount of reviews over 1200
on Amazon and for some reason it has 4.5
stars out of five I had to check them
out and see what's so special about them
and to see if this is worthwhile for a
purchase as always I'll leave my links
down in that bitter description click on
those links for the most updated prices
as always I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
going over the physical features first
for just thirty four dollars an hour for
the earbuds themselves very premium
feeling here but more importantly and I
love this feature is it's magnetized on
the ends just like so when you're not
using them just basically snap them
together like that and they stay
together very well
if you continue running I've noticed
that they do not come detach the magnets
are pretty strong here moderately strong
for again a pair of sport earphones now
they are pretty sturdy here I did look
at the ends the wires itself or lay flat
tangle free cords and I'm gonna prove to
you guys just now you know put them in
hands get my nice little roll here and
then just hold about one wire and they
come apart just like so tangle free
chords now the inline controller very
tactile provides a lot of feedback lime
up-and-down going back and forward on
songs Google assistant in Syria is
available as well
the only issue the only caveat here
there's been times when I have to take
it off my head here and look at the
light and make sure that's blinking blue
and red just to make sure that it's in
pairing mode to eventually pair with my
device the other issue is it's not heavy
the air phones are very light and
actually very comfortable but the inline
controller because of its size it does
tend to pull to the right here and kind
of sag over over my right shoulder again
it's not heavy it's just because it's
it's just there on the side there's no
weight to it now they do include a clip
to clip onto the collar of your shirt
this does help tremendously here so be
sure you don't lose this and be sure to
utilize this clip here and they don't
basically make your wire taut and pull
it back a little bit and it will prevent
a lot of the movement for you so keep
that in mind
other that's these things are IP X 6
rated which means that it can be caught
in the rain here if you accidentally get
the sweat no problems at all i drench
the crap out of this thing as you guys
can see on video they're still working
perfectly fine today
now that sounds great how about comfort
these things omit and this is subjective
they do stick out of my ears a little
bit here I'm not too big on that but let
me know in the comment section below
what you guys think here if that looks
good or not the ear wings itself
they are gargantuan much bigger than
most other earwigs I've seen on other
sport earphones but dirt running dirt my
tests they do stay in the air very well
never once at a hand these earphones
fall out or feel loose during my time of
testing or vigorous movements and
activities now the next big question
with support earphones a lot of people
don't address this is their wire chatter
when you're running around when the wire
is slightly bouncing around hitting your
neck or so do you hear that kind of
reverberate or so through the earbuds
and you can hear it over your music you
do hear a little bit of wind cutting
through the wires and when you are
running as well so there is audio being
transferred from the wire itself into
the earbuds now I did test this as a
speakerphone option it does it is able
to take phone calls my voice didn't
sound absolutely clear and worked out
perfectly fine it does pick up
background noises it does muffle it a
little bit but when I'm speaking my
voice is usually in the forefront and it
is pretty clear so I do give it some
brownie points for that moving on this
does charge with a USB 2.0 cord it's
climbing up to nine hours of battery
life I did test this at the office
playing it at 50% by I'm playing a
variety of music here just leaving it on
from full to dead I was able to get 6
hours and 45 minutes now 2 hours on the
charger can recharge these earphones up
to a hundred percent again from a dead
battery movie on to Bluetooth technology
this has bluetooth 4.2 which is still
good in my book using my Samsung si+ I
left the phone back there on the shelves
walked all the way down the hallway here
and I got a total of 68 linear feet
worth of performance before these
signals starting to crack now moving on
to passive noise isolation this does
offer a moderate amount it's not the
best out there but it does block on a
pretty decent amount of audio it does
sound liek though unfortunately a 50%
vine which is very casual listening
casual volume you do hear a little bit
of chatter you're sitting right next to
me if you are listening at a loud volume
let's say 75% volume you're the person
that's sitting next to let's say on the
bus at the library or so they were able
to hear the melody that is playing and
maybe be able to basically pick out what
you're listening to now jumping into the
audio performance first up these do
loud enough for most people more
importantly the bass signature these
things do hit very deeper these are
basic earphones if you love bass if you
love listening to hip-hop with a lot of
thumpin residents this is it's hip-hop
EDM maybe some pop music these are your
go-to earphones and this price wrench
not bad at all
now they do model or or get into the
mid-range a little bit here it does
cause the mid-range to recess just a
little bit so you do lose a bit of that
Fordyce that clarity that you get with
the vocal performance and some
instruments but overall for casual
listening if you're in that $34 price
range it still does very very good the
high notes thankfully and this is what
you see with cheaper earphones it gets
sometimes ear ringing ear singing you
have listening fatigue over a couple of
hours of listening thankfully you don't
get that with Viva movie 28 the
soundstage again fair generic your
phones you don't have an open wide
soundstage but at least you do have
audio separation left and right audio
channels some songs for them or some
instruments you can hear in the
forefront and in the background you do
get a little bit of vent
so over up of course these are not close
to being audiophile earphones but for
$34 for being budget conscious at least
when you get these you know one you're
getting basic earphones into you're
getting pretty good quality here at this
price range and then wireless the
Bluetooth the battery life is good and
these things they're water-resistant and
for the most part they're the most
important part here that they are
comfortable and they do stain your ear
while running give these a shot again
