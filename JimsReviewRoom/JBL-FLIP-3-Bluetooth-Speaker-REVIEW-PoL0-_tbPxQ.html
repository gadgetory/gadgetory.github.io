reviewed almost every speaker that JBL
has recently released what I have here
today is the budget-friendly model a
bunch of you guys have been asking me
for it's the JBL flip 3 it's priced at
$99 retail as of this video and I did
personally pay for this
as always I'll put the link in the video
description below if you want to see
what the current prices are for today so
without further ado add me on to Twitter
Instagram or Facebook and be sure to
subscribe if you haven't already
I'm Jimmy with jims review room and I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review going over the physical features
first this is no question built like a
mini version of the JBL charge or
somewhat resembling the huge JBL extreme
to small enough to fit in the palm of
your hand or your bag yet still built
very rugged exterior is splash proof
like most of the other JBL speakers but
you can't submerge this in water like
some of the UE products currently
available the nylon braided grill is
very tough here with the ends offering
rubber grips to help this stand upright
and also protect the passive radiators
on the sides now going over the buttons
which to be honest with you I wish were
raised up a little bit higher like the
extreme just so I can find the buttons a
little bit easier there's bluetooth
pairing volume down and up and last is
the speakerphone button all of which are
very tactile and very clicky nonetheless
rotating a bit here coming from the
factory that braided cord is included in
comes attached moving over power on and
off and last is the JBL connect feature
which allows you to link with another
connect enabled speaker like the JBL
extreme pulse to in the charge to plus
offering two sources of sound
simultaneously for more room filling
music i tested this with my JBL extreme
and was able to get the same range as
the bluetooth range the flip three head
on my smart phone going about 40 linear
feet to the other side of my house here
and through several walls and even down
to the first floor ceiling overall the
range on both bluetooth performance and
the Connect feature worked out perfectly
in my testing now going back here
there's five white LEDs two
for me how much better is remaining
which I very much liked since other
Bluetooth speakers some home at least do
only show just three or so last under
this cover which is much easier to open
than the pulse to highs the three half
millimeter port for physically
connecting your phone in very last year
is a micro USB 2.0 port for charging
regarding battery life JBL claims up to
10 hours of use and under my standard
testing leaving this at 50% volume and
letting the music basic continuously
play the JBL died in 10 hours and 53
minutes now the one issue that I found
here more than likely due to cost
savings the flip three is missing a wall
adapter that's not a big deal since I
use my phone charger to charge this
thing but it's always convenient to have
the packaging only provides a USB cord
and now to the moment that you've been
waiting for the sound test I'll play
several samples and give you my verdict
afterwards
No
Oh
and there you have it folks
of course sound recorded on my end and
then played through your speakers are
not the best depiction of audio quality
but hence my review here JBL really has
a certain sound signature that's applied
to nearly all of its recent speakers for
the flip three it is fitting for most
chat rooms especially today's pop idiom
and more for casual listeners of hip-hop
for the small speaker category the flip
three gets very loud for its size for
sure filling up a small room and just
enough for medium sized rooms for
personal enjoyment due to its small size
the bass isn't heavy-hitting but
compared to other $100 speakers I've
tested you'll notice more bass here now
as for the mids I notice jbo has usually
gone with brighter mid-range levels
where most instrument characteristics
are present and where most vocals
resides now it's not as bright as the
charge 2 plus or the extreme but vocals
are still very distinct very clear and
slightly pushed forward for the average
consumer I think you guys will really
enjoy this as really high notes and when
you do turn this up to higher volumes I
do admit some songs do have a little bit
of distortion some of the snares hi-hats
and the S sound beats they do get
slightly jumbled and lose some of its
clean clarity it's not everytime and I
would say it's rare depending on the
song that you're playing then keep in
mind that's one volume is near Max or at
maximum volume now a spatial sound or a
soundstage isn't really here but to be
fair most if not all small bluetooth
speakers doesn't have much sound
separation at all and this doesn't
feature some of the bells and whistles
as the more expensive bluetooth speaker
has like the charge out port or even NFC
or near field communication but JBL does
make this up with being splash proof a
really rugged design to be honest with
you JBL connect and a sound signature
that is louder than most at this price
point for this price category I really
enjoy the speaker and what it has to
offer so that's it for this review so be
sure to add me on to Facebook Twitter
