review room this is the LG SK 10y LG's
best of the best sound bar at the moment
now not only do you get simulated
surround sound like others out there but
there's also height in your audio in
layman terms you can hear stuff going
over your head and I'm gonna demo it for
you as always being transparent LG did
send us over for review but my
assessment was not altered in any way
I'm gonna go over both pros and cons now
this one is priced at $1,099 but they're
going for 899 on Amazon right now and I
do have the two wireless rear speakers
that are sold separately for a hundred
and eighty which I do highly recommend
now this is a premium sandbar someone
commanding a premium price but comparing
to the competitors that offers a 7.1
points you set up the LG is actually
cheaper even at the retail prices as
always click on my affiliate link down
in that video description below for the
most updated prices in real time you
never know when these things might go on
sale I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
the first tip before buying measure your
TV stand the sandbar is designed to
complement today's 65 inch TVs now if
you have a smaller TV maybe a smaller TV
stand entertainment console this sound
bar is most likely going to hang over so
just make sure you double check those
measurements second it does come with
wall mountable brackets in the retail
packaging if you want to put this on the
wall instead pretty convenient now let's
take a closer look and see what this is
all about
there's modern brushed metal appearance
up top with zero flexing considering how
why this thing is here touch sensitive
buttons which looks fabulous in daylight
though but at night or when watching
that dark room and wish these button did
light up though and on the front is the
aluminum girl and also it goes or
extends into the sides this is a five
point one point two surround system
rated at 550 watts of total power
there's two drivers on either side one
driver in the center and is two on
either end that allows audio to bounce
off of the side walls so you get that
left and right audio channel and also
give you that spatial awareness
there's last
who up top speakers drivers that is for
Dolby Atmos the two speakers up top
fires audio at the ceiling and reflects
down hit you while you're sitting in
your chair giving that experience of
heights when watching Dolby Atmos
enabled movies more about that later
now the included wireless subwoofer is
identical but the speaker cloth is on
the front and on the sides and if you do
purchase the additional rear speaker
kits you then convert this basically to
a 7.1.2 surround sound system the rear
speakers do connect to this one receiver
here and then connect through the
supplied audio cables the rears do have
threaded mounts on the back and on the
bottom for wall mounting or speaker
stands respectively now although these
speakers are quite small they provide
very good identifiable channel
separation more of my audio test towards
the second half of the video now wasn't
that physical and built into the sound
bar you have Wi-Fi and with your home's
network and internet connection your
sambar works with a Google assistant
compatible device such as my Google ho
mini now through its built-in chromecast
capabilities inside that sound bar I can
tell the speaker through my Google mini
to play and stop music and adjust volume
with Google Music Pandora Spotify etc
those kind of apps now if I'm connected
via bluetooth though to my phone and
wants to play music off of my personal
playlist all I can do though is adjust
Viman if it plays my playlist I can't
tell it to stop and skip and go back on
songs and such like that from my testing
you also can turn on or off the sound
bar with your voice and I can't change
the audio sources it plays from for
example I can't tell the sound bar to
switch from Bluetooth to HDMI and watch
a movie on my TV now aside from music
I tested Bluetooth for video and
watching Netflix and play with no issues
on my Samsung I said plus but when I
played YouTube videos unfortunately was
out of sync lips were moving first
before you heard the video but I'm sure
you bought the sound bar or sort of
watch movies on your TV than on your
phone so it's speaking out your TV here
let's look at the connections on the
back of the sound bar you have an
Ethernet port three-and-a-half
millimeter in optical in HDMI out and
two HDMI inputs the latter two comes
with 4k pass-through and that's really
about it so after the audio test here
I'll show you the app and controller but
let's
some samples first be sure to put on
your headphones or earphones as I'll be
using by neural microphones giving you
the most accurate audio test that I can
give you guys here you go
and there you have it folks now while I
discussed the audio let me show you the
controller and the app in the background
now one feature LG is heavily promoting
is its partnership with Meridian audio
they contributed their expertise and
experience in to select LG products
including the SK 10 why in fine tuning
this to offer the best audio experience
as they can well with my testing with my
assessment now be sure to update that
sound bar over Wi-Fi over your internet
immediately in its fact settings from
the factory from the store a sound bar
is loud yet the vocals are quite
recessed and you can hear more
background audio than anything because
of how powerful might sound at first
once you unbox this thing average
consumers might find it sounding great
but after a while it gets quite
fatiguing listening fatigue that is then
the lack of vocals gets quite weird as
well you'll notice it eventually don't
get tricked but after that update a lot
of this fine tuning it does fix it it
does sound a lot better again be sure to
update before critic or critiquing that
is your own sound bar at home so the
first thing that you'll notice as soon
as you update this thing here in general
is how super wide that soundstage is
when I tested the Bose soundTouch 300
that was amazing don't get me wrong here
but this one the LG sounds not only
wider but more distinct where the sounds
were coming from this has been proven to
be better than my premium Bose
soundTouch 300 better than my clips RSP
14 and my Yamaha premium sound bars that
I've tested previously on the channel
even if you don't find the rear speakers
the main sambhar from LG itself is quite
impressive for audio separation and
spacial awareness but there's a great
bit of depth and layers in the
environment letting you hear vocals at
the forefront and the ambient
environment around you then you hear
subtle objects moving from your right to
left off in a distance etc but with the
added feature of Atmos LG did a great
job whenever these sound engineers
implemented action happening above you
it's somewhat of a surreal experience
for the first time the first time when
you hear it but no question it
compliments again that wide soundstage
here's the same scene from ready player
one with it on and then off
so at the end of the day if you want the
virtual surround sound experience
especially be purchased the rear speaker
sets LG hands down did great as for bass
and explosions there's a decent amount
but I asked it was hoping for a deep sub
bass even pumping up the woofer and bass
settings and the sound bar and still
wasn't as deep or thunders as I would
have hoped what you do get though is
punchy bass and enough resonance in
vocals but again a bit more sub bass
would have complemented the rest of the
audio spectrum last increasing that
sensor channel did help quite a bit
as the sound bar was still a slightly
recessed after that firmware update but
after that boost this thing does sound
more forward and clearer anything
directly in front of you on camera is
experienced but again I could have used
a little bit more as some of you did
really well and while some other movies
I just need a little bit of an extra
push but speaking on the overall
experience in this particular area
there's a good bit of fidelity in detail
in the mid-range then even when there's
scenes with a lot of complex audio now
what you did great here where it's
separated all these audio signals and
sounds where some sound bars is kind of
jumbled up together overall where the
speaker really does shine again is the
surround sound
aspect it's the best that I've tested so
far the studio and if you do buy those
rear speakers that bring the surround
sound level up several notches if you're
looking for a premium sound bar with
Dolby Atmos like I said earlier it's the
cheapest around at this price range
compared to the competitors I'd say this
is no question worth looking into so
that's it folks be sure to like and
subscribe if you haven't already follow
me on Facebook and Instagram those
addresses are on your screen and also in
the video description hopefully I'll be
getting more Atmos sound bars in the
future so stay tuned
I'm Jimmy with jims review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision you guys take care see you guys
