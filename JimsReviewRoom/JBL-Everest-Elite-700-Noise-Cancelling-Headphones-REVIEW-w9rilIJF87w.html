hey everyone Jimmy Wynn gyms review room
JBL just released their best headphones
in their Everest line the elite 700 now
with features like bluetooth 4.1 active
noise-cancelling sculpted ear cups for
comfort and much more the average that
leat 700 indeed sounds promising and
since they do have active
noise-cancelling I have to test these
against two other heavy hitters they
both qc25 and the Sennheiser momentum
Wireless that I have here in my studio
now these are 299 dollars retail as of
this video and I'll place a link in the
video description below so you can see
the updated prices at any time so
without further ado I'm here to help you
make your purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's review room going over
the physical features first these do
look quite beefy pretty Pro and built to
last up tap you have a matte finish
that's all plastic extending down the
sides the headband cushion is very
similar to the beats products offering a
thin but cool feeling when pressed more
in my comfort test a little bit later
going down the sides they are plastic
with reinforced metal for adjustability
retracting and extending the arms
provided a stiff lock with no accidental
movements while wearing that elite 700
does fold in for easier stowing which is
a plus and while the hinges are exposed
here looking deep inside I can see metal
being used as the locking mechanism
which is always reassuring compared to
plastics that wears down over time
regarding build quality these held
together perfectly fine here although I
thought had broken the top band here at
one point but it's just a band being
softer plastics and being hollow in the
middle this essentially caused it to
flex but once I was done in examining
just to make sure everything was okay
there wasn't anything broken the seams
are still all tight and nothing is
falling apart
moving to the closed back ear cuffs and
my comfort test the padding is super
plush here and quite unique
JBL designed these to offer a slight
contour around the rear of your ear from
my personal experience at first they
were not
though but just different from my
traditional ear cups that are flush and
that worked perfectly fine it's very
money but this takes a little bit more
effort in finding that sweet spot to
make the earpads feel comfortable as for
a way to compare to three other active
noise-cancelling headphones I felt these
to be slightly on the heavier side
they're not bad but those who are
sensitive at the crown of the head will
feel slight pressure from the weight in
addition when comparing to my personal
Sennheiser momentum Wireless and qc25
the clamping force and these are ever so
slightly stronger this didn't cause my
jaw line to hurt but the pressure was
indeed noticeable going over the buttons
these look absolutely great and they
feel clicky and very responsive on the
left ear cup you have your volume up and
down with an action button in the middle
to accept phone calls or pause and play
your music and the right is power on and
off that's also used to pair your
headphones and blow our buds to control
the next gen active noise canceling
feature more details once I get to the
sound test very soon one thing I did
notice the button placement seemed great
but when I first use these when
adjusting the headphones I would
accidentally press the vine or the ANC
button causing unexpected changes to my
listening experience not a deal-breaker
at all but something had to be aware
about and essentially change my habit as
for these phone calls here here's a
quick test with unedited audio hello hey
it's me again you get a few minutes yeah
all right so I'm coming on a new pair of
headphones right now it has a built-in
microphone just want to see how does it
sound to you
does it sound clear to some good what do
you think - very clear yeah okay there's
sound like a faraway bunny chance like
I'm on a speaker now now it sounds like
you're on a headset but for a headset
it's very very clear okay awesome
and any kind of static reducing with
that not really know very my new if
there is honey okay perfect that's all
needed thank you actually all right bye
last on the air cup going back to the
right side here has a two and a half
millimeter ports for the supplied audio
cable any micro USB port is nearby for
charging the headphones regarding
battery life JBL does claim up to 15
hours of use and from my personal
testing doing all of my audio devices
with batteries leaving this at 50%
volume to get a middle-of-the-road
results I recorded a full 15 hours and
17 minutes until the unit died now the
moment that you've probably been waiting
for how is the sound test quickly
regarding sound leaking these perform
good due to its thick foam and performs
similar to other headphones to be honest
with you and then getting into the
next-gen nose canceling feature that JBL
is promoting I try this in a variety of
settings tried-and-true tests here in
front of a noisy construction zone along
the city streets inside a cafe and other
very small areas the active noise
cancellation works well with blocking a
decent amount of noise and with volume
up this does block out almost everything
however when I did test this against the
bose qc25 s the best and active noise
cancellation I believe that JBL
unfortunately still doesn't match so if
you're a frequent traveler I'm still
very confident the qc25 are the best on
airplanes trains and the likes if
anything they'll eat 700 performed
nearly identical as my Sennheiser
momentum wireless but regarding that
button on the rear JBL is also promoting
a feature that allows how much sound you
want to come in there's three varying
degrees and it's ideal for those not
wanting to shut out the world completely
and remain aware of your surroundings
this button basically reduces the amount
of ANC working to allow sound in and it
works well when you do need it but
regarding sound signature the audio is
good these feel ever so slightly bass
boosted and just enough to be
appreciated for most people JBL is
offering those listening to pop and EDM
something to jam to but those looking
for deep bass these are not it those who
are familiar with Sennheiser's bass
levels this sounds almost like the
Sennheiser Momentum's that I have same
with the mid-range offering pronounced
vocals and a sound signature equivalent
to the bass levels and E high notes as
well really no sound fields are
dominating over the other regard to the
high notes everything stays intact as
there's no ear ringing or ear tameness
from my experience so listening fatigue
is really very much reduced or
eliminated compared to the bose qc25 s
they boast does offer a slightly flatter
sound signature sound stage on the JBL
is okay but compared to the other two
that i have they perform very much
similar there's left and right audio
separation but not so much forward and
back along with distance being perceived
in the audio in the end I would still
for sure recommend these to those
listening to rock pop EDM and even some
hip-hop but before finishing the sound
test JBL does offer the JBL headphone
app for both Apple and Android devices
the app is simple but it does a pretty
good job at providing the essentials
battery life is indicated on the front
true note is a unique feature that
somehow obtains data from the headphones
fitting around your ear then customizing
that audio experience to your unique
size now I'm personally tried it and
really didn't notice a difference to be
honest with you but backing out and
equalizer is offered which is a bit more
robust than others I've seen from
manufacturers but using a third-party
app seems more effective that changes
through the JBL app was more on the
conservative side even though I would
turn a frequency all the way up or all
the way down it still works nonetheless
though and lasts on the main page you
can manually turn on or off the noise
cancellation and change the awareness
settings to low medium or high in turn
letting more outside noise in at your
choosing and last before I forgets
regarding Bluetooth range these works
perfectly fine when compared to the
competition going to the other side of
the house going through several walls
and standing downstairs I never lost
connection and regarding any signal
issues from my personal experience I
haven't personally experienced any so
overall my test the sound works out
great the active noise cancellation
works as good as the more expensive
Sennheiser Momentum's but clearly not as
good as the bose qc25 s but I'll be
honest they kind of set the bar really
really high the comfort I'll MIT I
wished was a bit better more
specifically lighter in general and NFC
would have been nice to have but I'll be
honest with you in the end the sound
performance put overshadow its
shortcomings I would say try these on if
you can and see how comfortable they are
before you purchase so hope this review
