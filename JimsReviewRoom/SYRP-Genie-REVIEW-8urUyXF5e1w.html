Revere room the some of you may have
recently asked or stated how do I get
such smooth panning and sliding shots
well let me tell you a little secret
it's the genie from syrup it's another
Kickstarter company that I'm reviewing
that's been very successful in its
funding and I love working with startup
companies with genius ideas that are
practical priced at 889 dollars retail
from syrup code that's NZ or obtainable
from BH photo comm here in the States
this is one of those tools for the
beginners to the advanced pros so
without further ado let's go over its
pros and cons first things first what
you have on the screen is what comes in
the box and before really starting to
review when doing research on the genie
I noticed a lot of videos were promoting
time lapses which the genie looks great
at doing but my review is based on what
I personally use this for and uses for
real-time videography specifically
reviews on consumer electronics now in
the box they do provide a painting mount
which I use extensively which pans the
camera left to right and vice versa and
what makes this even more unique is its
ability to transfer to a linear mount
for a rail or slider shots right on the
fly the unit itself I gotta admit does
feel quite hefty I don't have a digital
scale but I feel like it weighs about
three pounds or so and because it's
built in such a nice tight box here the
weights concentrated making it feel
quite heavy that's something very
important to account for when you do
have to consider weight load limits on
either your tripod or video head
especially the small tripods and video
heads that are available now let's outer
shell is all metal with a fixed 3/8
thread to mount your video head to and
there's a silicone like material to
prevent whatever you attach from sliding
with a balance and bubble on top that
conveniently lights up when the unit
isn't use now starting with the side you
do have connections for your time-lapse
a USB port for firmware updates unless
is a 3 and 1/2 millimeter input for
unfortunately unknown purposes it wasn't
disclosed in the instructions
now the charging port is on the other
side and serve does send all the input
power adapters for
your country or region and it takes
approximately three hours to charge from
a dead battery and the battery lasts up
to seven hours per serie now from mine
usage I recorded video every other day
or every three days at maximum and on a
full charge using it for the past month
I've been only able to drain it just
half its battery so it's been very
impressive for my use now on the very
back is the locking and quick release
button to change from a painting mount
to a linear mount the mounts themselves
I literally just leave on my tripods
just by screwing them down with the
built-in handle and it's so easy to
unclick and move to the next location
again just by unclicking and snapping it
into place now the panning plate can
connect to a 3/8 or 1/4 inch thread
however the linear plate is only 3/8 in
size now going over its menu features
again the genie is really made for the
most basic videographers to providing
enough versatility for advanced
professionals now when powering on the
first option is time-lapse clicking okay
on the right reveals new recording that
you can perform and at the very bottom
are three presets already made for you
but showing the new recording since it's
identical to the saved ones here you set
the total time you want to record the
interval of when you camera will take a
picture which I have here set at every
five seconds and last is how many
degrees will this rotate and you can
save this as a preset and name it to
your choosing for future use and in the
Advanced Settings you can fine-tune the
shot delay and have features like taking
HDR photos again I don't use the
time-lapse feature for my business but
here's a clip from syrups website on
what it can do though now moving to
real-time video capturing specifically
panning you can fully customize this in
a new recording you select how long in
time you want to record for and in that
given time how many degrees do you need
your camera to rotate now save it as a
preset and it's as simple as that
you'll get shots like this as you see on
your screen and like I said I'd use this
mainly for reviews for consumer
electronics you can see how slow it goes
in a perfect smooth movement even
previously using a fluid head with
resistance my men frodo 5:02 HD which is
priced at $200 apiece without the tripod
legs achieved almost near perfection in
Japan's but again obviously not as
precise as a genie and for my testing
and review the penny each and every time
has been perfect and with the
flexibility of speed all penny needs
that you or I may have will be met
though but where you see the biggest
bang for your buck and that only does
pans but also slides as well it's based
on this linear plate that you attach
right onto your slider system the play
consists of a three meter or 9.8 linear
feet of rope that's supplied in the Box
a Velcro attachment goes on either end
of the slider and the rope is then tied
to each side again the same concept with
setting how long in time you want to
capture and how far in distance you want
the genie to travel now with these two
inputs this fully controls the speed in
what you want but a slider is just the
beginning and I personally don't do this
stuff but if you're handy enough you can
build these amazing at home rigs that
you can do over the air shots or what's
also featured on their website you can
install a 3/8 thread onto a board with
wheels or a skateboard in this matter
and you can have nearly an unlimited
amount of distance depending on how much
rope you can tie off now with the test
and review of the linear feature I
noticed once in a while there wouldn't
be enough tension on the ropes in turn
the motor would spin freely and can't
pull itself to either side now at first
this would happen once in a while but
eventually over time you'll develop a
better technique to make sure the ropes
are tight not a true issue as it
pertains to user error but again the
concept or design does rely heavily on
ensuring those ropes are set up just
right though now for all features
time-lapse panning and linear movements
you can set up auto start now for me
it's ideal to set up everything press
Start and then run into the camera shot
and after a few seconds this will start
the movement you can either set up a
countdown timer or you can set up a time
and date of when the movements are to
occur almost like a self timer but of
course the ideas are limitless the only
thing that I would could really see that
stood out and was a bothersome was the
buttons and it's software isn't as fast
as I'd like i press a menu button and
then I move on to the next screen to
fast it will become unresponsive but if
I move at a slower pace than it responds
and instead of showing my settings and
then to edit I have to go to a different
menu I wish I could just select the info
right then and there
and change it if need be and one big
question that people ask me can it do
both pan and linear movements and
unfortunately it cannot do that but to
be honest those are just suggestions on
a machine that does very very well at
its current build version the genie has
more features that a standalone motor
that sold by other motorized companies
has it's cheaper and the versatility is
much greater in my opinion it's only
limited by what you can imagine so
