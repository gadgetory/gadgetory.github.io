doing with their Bluetooth speakers
active noise-cancelling headphones and
TVs I think they might be on fire right
now the new WF 1000x
are active noise-cancelling truly
wireless earphones that I personally
paid for these retail for $200 but as
always I'll place my affiliate links
down in the video description below

you the most updated prices in real time
you never know when these things might
go on sale so without further ado I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
and before we get started guys this
video was sponsored by ramp out USB
cords and I personally use ramp out for
work as their fabric braided for
durability and protection and we have
them at the office for testing products

phone and I do keep one in the camera

C and lightning cables that are
available in a variety of colors they're
reliable dependable and featuring a
lifetime warranty for peace of mind use
my discount code in the description and
see how much you can save
ramp a USB cords are the cords for life
alright folks the WUF 1000x are slick as
hell here this resembles the classic
Sony design but offering a very modern
yet simple build
certainly understated elegance now
behind these Smoke plastics the antennas
are visible for the wireless connection
and the very fronts are microphones for
active noise-cancelling phone calls and
use with Google assistance in Siri more
on that a little bit later but both
earphones are very minimalistic the left
earphone has one button to power and
pair the earphones with single presses
you cycle through returning active
noise-cancelling on switching to ambient
aware or turning off all of these
features now for those who don't know
ambient aware it turns a handy
microphones and feeds your surrounding
noise into your ears as though you don't
have earphones in your ears now it might
be ideal for those who are commuting
biking or doing activities where you
want to be aware of your environment now
on the right side a single press answers
phone calls when they're coming in and
testing phone call quality my voice
comes across very loud and it wasn't a
bad thing though very clear during
speech but like most headphones like
most microphones that is it does pick up
background noises quite well during
music playback a single press pauses and
plays your music and with a long hold
down activating Google assistant or
serious as possible now because of how
small these are unfortunately don't
receive buns to adjust volume which was
kind of a nuisance here a little hike
inserting these Samsung icon X any drama
elite sport to other truly wireless
earphones have the ability to do so now
although these are not sport earphones
many other truly wireless earphones on
the market are also water resistance and
I'm not running with these on
would have loved the peace of mind now
getting into comfort the retail package
comes with a ton of ear tips both
traditional silicone and foam ear tips I
were the factory silicone that came out
of the package and they stayed in
perfectly fine j-bird runs I had the
most problems with the Jabra sport elite
were good and he samsung gear icon acts
were great I'm with the in-ear ear tips
so he provided I loved how they stayed
in and they were one of the best that
I've ever tested included with the ear
tips is your carrying case that doubles
up as your charging dock you drop your
earphones in press them down in place
and take about an hour and a half from a
dead battery to full
now as for a battery life so knees
climbing up to three hours of use with
or without ANC on and I'm confirming two
hours and 51 minutes on average now I
have three hours this is only very
low-end while everyone else is offering
at least or a minimum of four hours at
three hours there were times I did catch
myself with low battery and needing to
recharge and with the case at least Sony
offers some form of quick charging here
with 15 minutes being juiced up I was
able to get back an hour worth of
playback now moving on bluetooth 4.1
comes with the WUF 1000x testing this
with my samsung s a+ i was able to get
about 45 linear feet of range before the
signal started to cut out now the only
issue i know some other websites review
website that is who receive samples from
sony had connectivity issues between the
two earbuds the left ear phone would
work fine and once in a while the right
earphone would mute itself then come
back right away and with my pair and I
bought a retail unit basically ordered
it from the store I also had the same
issue once in a while I would have the
right side and disconnect and play no
audio and then it kicks back on it's
rare but it does happen though so
alright going over the active
noise-cancelling performance they have
adaptive noise canceling there's a tiny
little gyroscope inside the earphones
that can tell if you're stationary
walking running or on transit now it's
quite impressive and the earphones have
been smart enough to switch here now
each area offers a slightly different
outputs of active noise canceling
performance with my testing the Eames II
works quite well I do notice ambient air
or white noise being suppressed the most
well voices and other surrounding
experiences are muffled now it's not QC
35 or Sony WH 1000 X headphone levels of
blocking but for in-ear and
to be the only true wireless earphones
with ANC on the markets these did good
to block out noises that you have around
you so alright jumping into audio
performance first thing to do here
download the Sony headphone app I fell
victim to this but when I first tested
these I went straight into my music
player and volume sounded just okay I
was able to play the earphones at
maximum volume and it wasn't blasting
out my ears but I found within the
headphone app the vibe controls are
independent from my cell phone that once
I turned this up the Sony WF 1000x do
get loud second within the app there is
an equaliser I found it to be okay
living it off offer the best most
well-rounded audio experience so I just
left it as is so that being said the WF
1000x offered some light punchy bass I
would have enjoyed just a bit more to
have a bass boosted sound signature but
they are distortion free clean and well
balanced which may be suitable for you
now those looking for a more punchy
deeper bass experience the j-bird runs
might be your best alternative the
mid-range was great vocal performance
was not recessed or pushed forward but
very balanced once again accurate in my
opinion 1000x also identified left and
right audio channels but very easily
also sound placement can be heard
slightly above you with voc was
definitely in the forefront now if I had
a critique I found as though there could
have been slightly more resolution or
detail I felt there was an ever so
slight amount of sparkle missing and
it's possibly due to the lack of sting
or sharpness and the very high
frequencies so overall for the $200
price range you're getting active
noise-cancelling performance and that
alone justifies its price despite some
areas that are slightly lacking now if I
were you I'd probably hold off until the
prices dropped a little bit maybe down
to a hundred and eighty dollars and then
consider them for sure again I've placed
my affiliate links in the video
description go check them out you never
know when they go on sale I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room and I'm here to help
you make that purchase decision you guys
