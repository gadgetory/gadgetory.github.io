today's awesome video hey YouTube it's
good to be back again I'm excited about
this one I'm excited about these
headphones actually this might be the
game changer this might be the true
competitor to these Sony 1000x m3s I'm
talking about the Jabra 85 H it has tons
of bells and whistles and some of the
specs damn it might actually beat out
the king welcome back to my youtube
channel if you're new please stay the
entire time as I do many real world
tests for you at home to experience now
let's take a look at the unboxing in the
background while I talk about price real
quick here as always full disclosure I
personally paid for this at the retail
price of 299 dollars that's $50 cheaper
than the main competitors at the retail
prices I'll place my affiliate links
down in that video description below
click on my links for the most updated
prices in real time you never know what
these things might go on sale as a side
note I just moved out to California I am
loving it here but things are still new
to me so the new studio in the
background over here might be a little
bit off and I'm looking for new places
to film so later in this video
the video might not be as polished I'm
working at it guys
I'm Jimmy with Jin's review and I'm here
to help you guys make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
video
so going over the physical features
first I love the look of this thing job
R went with simply fabric is it durable
over time so far it's been good I have
been purposely not using their amazing
protective case just to see over the
past several weeks if the fabric starts
to show signs of abrasion especially
when I throw it into my bag it hasn't
but if those watching in the future here
help out the Jim's room community by
giving us an update hopefully it holds
up well now here's one of the biggest
reasons why I'm excited about the Jabra
85h the jabbers are rain resistant the
fans that been with me all these years
here no I'm not peeing on this video
clip right here it's only a spray bottle
but all seriousness Jabra on their
website says there's a nano coating on
the internal components I'm assuming
this is very similar to what j-bird does
with their products as well and with my
testing the fabric does retain water so
it does feel a little bit soggy you
gotta wait until it dries before putting
them back on your head but overall with
my clean water test the headphones are
still working I think for those who
commute a bunch takes transit or on that
one day that you get caught in the rain
here this gives so much peace of mind
and I'm putting this on my wish list as
a feature for future headphones
let's go Bose come on now taking a look
at the adjustable arms Jabra went with a
resistant or friction based adjustable
arm is that a ratcheting type it doesn't
have these little cliques or anything
like that very similar to Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
h9 eyes and these Sennheiser HD ones I
do like how they feel as it does
resemble something a little bit more
premium a little bit more refinement
here clamping them down isn't an issue
but loosening them while you're well
they're on your head here as you guys
can see it's very tough here let me
clamp them down and I'm trying to push
them up right now not easy not a
deal-breaker but something to be aware
about you gotta take them off slightly
adjust them a little bit easier as you
do it this way then put them back onto
your head now getting into my stress
test for those new to the channel I'm
not trying to break these here but I
want to hear and feel if there's any
kind of weak spot creeps or cracks and
does it retain its shape for
big headed people there is some minor
creaking at the hinge more so than the
competition but nothing that would see
that I saw or feel to be an entire side
of things and pulling these headphones
apart and then releasing them as you
guys can see they do retain its shape
now moving down to the ear cups and just
overall comfort the ear cups are plush
enough for me I found them comfortable
but they do heat up my ears in as little
as 30 minutes now in sunny California
when the temps recently been 75 degrees
and feeling like there's zero humidity
it's been amazing I can still feel these
warm up a bit I can't imagine what it's
going to be like in the summer time or
if I'm actually back in the south now
the ear cups are replaceable though so a
heads up on that if you would ever want
to replace these discus yank them out
there we go
now as for overall comfort I weighed
this I might trust the official Jim's
room scale also available at your local
Best Buy and Shaklee these are close to
300 grams to give you an idea of the of
what the best of the best offers at the
moment these sony 1000 X 3s are around
250 grams and they feel really good
the Bose QC 35 twos they're just the
best in comfort no question if you look
at the numbers they're around 236 grams
if I recall off the top of my head they
feel great for me the Jabra is on the
heavier side of things but Jabra did a
really good job of distributing the
weight the crown of my head
never had the feeling of being pinched
or feeling sore after several hours of
wearing the clamping force around the
jaw line has been perfectly fine
the headphones stay in my head without
sliding here and honestly with my
testing ice at the entire after doing
typing away and never felt fatigued
wearing fatigue that is which is why
shocked to find these weighed in as much
as they did what I'm saying they're
comfortable for heavier headphones
alright let's get a closer look the
buttons are all on your screen pause the
video if you need to but the one button
I want to talk about is the one on be
very left ear cup after each click
you're able to cycle through three
options of the amount of noise that you
want to let in first
one is completely off so nothing
synthetic it's purely passive noise
isolation the second is here through
which allows you to pump in your
environment through the built-in
microphones these works great
by not over amplifying your surroundings
but offering a very natural experience
as though you're not wearing headphones
at all the last feature is simply the
ability to turn on your a and see your
active noise-cancelling which I'll
demonstrate shortly now going back here
to finish up these physical features you
can answer phone calls which did super
well it's possibly one of the best
experiences that I've had on any pair of
headphones here's a quick sample so
here's the microphone test the job or a
dd5
ages guys things down below I'm sitting
outdoors right now a very slight reason
for the time being we've got some going
on and some people around me chattering
wanna take a quick walk they want to see
if it does pick up any kind of wind
noise and also any kind of noise from me
moving around as well here we go
all right folks beautiful day in
California so right now again still a
slight breeze I don't know if you guys
are picking that up right now also with
these vehicles driving by pretty soon it
goes one or two of them here and I don't
know down the comment section below let
me know what you guys think talk to you
guys later bye and last but not least
you do have the three-and-a-half
millimeter inputs for physical
connections and a USB type-c makes its
way around for 2019 now this should be
the norm for most devices if you're
spending several hundred dollars just
make sure that you have USB C to
future-proof yourself the Jabra 85 H has
fast charging Jabra claims 15 minutes on
a dedicated 500 milliamp wall charger
gives you five hours worth of music
listening back and better life
these things are impressive with 36
hours of playback claimed by Jabra and
that's with active noise canceling on
kind of in-your-face Sony know with my
test that 50% volume to get a
middle-of-the-road results and of course
ANC activated I'll leave that number on
the screen for you guys now such an
based on Bluetooth technology we're at
the newest version as of this video
which is Bluetooth 5.0 equal to the
best out there testing range I'm able to
get the full length of my apartment and
having the signal go through actually
several walls here with zero issues now
measuring maximum range with straight
line of sights perfect for those in the
gym I'm getting about 85 linear feet
before this signal starts to crackle as
per video playback my samsung s 8 plus
played both YouTube and Netflix
perfectly fine my iPhone
Netflix played perfectly in sync but
oddly YouTube was off by maybe a
nanosecond and last this is a big one
for many you can have two devices
connected at the same time with Bose you
can do the same thing with Sony you're
still unfortunately stuck with one no
oddly there were some connection
confusion at times the headphones would
see that I am paired as I am currently
right now and then out the blue the app
would disconnect me and say I'm not
paired and the only way for the app to
see these headphones again is to redo
the process in the bluetooth menu this
was a huge nuisance repairing the phone
wasn't too big of a deal but I shouldn't
be doing that anyways here's proof right
now the headphones are connected if you
look at my phone right now I'm gonna
bring this up show you the Bluetooth
connection it shows right there that it
says Jabra elite 84 or 85 H but on the
screen here on the app it says turn on
your headphones what's going on here I
don't know and I do have the latest
firmware updates alright moving on here
now jumping into the high tech features
this is where you might find a lot of
value first up this has Auto pause and
play when you take off your headphones
the job Rose automatically pauses your
music or video put them back onto your
head and it resumes once again this
function flawlessly and it was highly
convenient it's official second the jars
can't connect to your phone's voice
assistants like Google in Siri
but there's also Alexa available you
just have to press the button on that
right ear cup once and you can ask your
question and go from there this worked
intuitively third there's a find my
headphone option or feature if you ever
misplace these things again another
awesome piece of tech and I did confirm
it will relocate your headphones and
will reveal on the app where you last
place them forth Jabra is pushing this
thing called smart sound Cobras claiming
this is artificial intelligence that
analyzes your surrounding environment
several times a minute based on the
audio around you the 85h will switch
from either active noise-cancelling or
turn hear through on for you the
anticipation is the headphones should
intelligently determine when you need
these safety of hearing your
surroundings such as when you're walking
around the city you can always turn this
feature off with my testing it somewhat
works but doesn't get it every time from
my experience it's actually worse in a
somewhat quiet room the perfect example
let's say I have a and C on right now
but as I type on my mechanical keyboard
the ANC oddly just turns off I would
have to manually turn it back on within
the app here to keep it constant or just
basically turn off the feature
altogether now Sony on the other hand
although clearly not perfect either with
a very similar feature and I really use
that feature as well but honestly it
works better than Jabra it recognizes
motion I think it's how it works it's
able to recognize the times when I'm
sitting down moving in transit like on a
bus or so or when I'm simply walking and
that alone will Auto adjust again or
according to movements again not perfect
by Sony but again a little bit better
than Jabra keep in mind Jabra to say
that these are artificial intelligence
so it should learn over time it might
get a little bit better as time
progresses we'll see I haven't noticed
that yet after several weeks of testing
these but like I said let's see maybe
give it a 2 months or so let's get into
the audio test first up here's active
noise-cancelling please put on your own
headphones or earphones to hear my biner
old test that's the best way that you
can hear must be probably the only way
that you can actually experience it
again sorry for the weird angles in this
upcoming video but I'm new to the area
and I don't know if certain places like
Security's friendly or not and I don't
want to stick a camera in people's faces
so here again rural tests enjoy
we meet
me
just for that there's one has simple
romance that Denmark Netherlands from
what you tell how you feel as long as
you can show me a good time I don't need
promises honestly no big deal as long as
you can show me good
all right folks audio recorded on my end
and then played through your earphones
or headphones were not the best
depiction audio quality but the body
road-test it's better than nothing and
hence my review here starting off with
active noise-cancelling alone it was
good but it didn't beat out the best
here I was hoping so so we can continue
raising that bar but Jabra was still an
amazing experience this does black out a
very good amount of ambient air
suppresses a good amount of voice
chatter movement and some of that
background noise I usually hear in like
cafes and such like that and if you were
curious and how ANSI performs on these
before buying with my test here I would
say the ANSI test there's nothing that
would deter you from considering of
purchasing these but if you're looking
for the absolute best then yes the sony
did cut out the most though and boast
came in second the Jabra 85h let in a
little bit more bass and a little bit
more voice chatter in general as you
might have been able to tell in those
samples as for the music test the java
85 h has a very similar audio
characteristic to the truly wild
earphones that they usually have
starting with bass there's enough thump
in just punchy bass that's ever so
slightly above neutral keep in mind this
is in its stock form before making
adjustments on the job or equaliser
within the app it's okay there is more
bass added if you do adjust it within
the app but honestly it just sound a
little bit more droning at times and
other times it just it was a little bit
of an increase it just wasn't enough to
be satisfying now compared to these sony
1000x m3s sony was slightly bass ear vs
bose the QC 35 s has the least amount of
bass out of the three least deep bass
that is but it's honestly the cleanest
now if you're a bun that job or might
not have enough bass i actually think it
does but the 85 h does make it up in the
mid-range and the high frequencies the
audio signature goes a little bit
brighter and a little bit more forward
than Sony which I personally like as
much as I love the Sony 1000 xm3
headphones I did mention it in my review
a wild
and it's the same here Sony is just ever
so slightly recessed in the mid-range
compared to a good handful other
headphones out there again it's not a
bad thing and it sounds great for EDM
and hip hop bass your songs and it hits
most genres most mainstream music genres
that a lot of people listen to and it's
great in that aspect but if you prefer
something a little bit more forward or
brighter again the draw bros or maybe
even the boast
hits it right on the head now moving
through the high frequencies man you get
some snares on this thing and Jabra hits
it with authority every time without
being tingey or screeching out of the
three Java really shined by putting
authority on tambourine cymbal crashes
that sound you hear in the background
ergo just a nice snap each and every
time a jumper does great with left and
right audio separation you're able to
distinguish an instrument playing and be
far left and one maybe closer to your
right sound stage though was equivalent
to the competitors good enough for
headphones but nothing better or worse
in my opinion last these sony had the
least amount of sound leaking that Java
came in second which was still very good
here and Bose leaked the most out of the
three headphones when playing at about
75% volume now speaking of volume I
didn't get any kind of weird audio
fluctuations most of these headphones
here all three of these headphones
basically played around 60% in vibe for
very casual listening if I'm intending
on jamming out I've noticed I've been
listening to seventy seventy five
percent volume on any one of these three
so with everything that I've tested so
far
Jabra almost hits it on the head after
the hype died down and I'm back to my
unbiased test the Jabra did really well
and I really enjoyed them I really enjoy
their sound signature the better life is
nuts and just have any waterproofing
alone gives this a lot of value and
considering they're $50 less than the
competitors at their retail prices I'm
somewhat okay with not having the best
ANC out there also with the other high
tech features you get them on Sony and
Sennheiser but compare them to boast
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins and let's say Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen up top my head here the Jabra
still offers more
and is still cheaper so that's something
to take into consideration you got to be
ok with a slightly heavier headphone
though and I wish drawbar made that
Bluetooth connection a little bit more
solid those two things are probably the
biggest gripes that I have for the
headphones but other than that
everything on here it's definitely
definitely an alternative to the
competitors out there hey folks check
