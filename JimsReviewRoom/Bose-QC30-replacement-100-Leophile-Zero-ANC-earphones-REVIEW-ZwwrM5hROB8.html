room you know I do a lot of expensive
reviews and from time to time folks
asked me to do smaller named budget
items instead giving the little guys a
chance I'm reviewing the Leo found zero
over the neck earphones with active
noise-cancelling I want to give this one
a try to see how a hundred dollar pair
of earphones would stack up against my
two hundred dollar Sennheiser HD ones
and also my $300 Bose QC 30s this is not
a direct comparison as they're not
apples to apples but it would be
interesting to see how close a budget
pair of earphones would perform versus a
high-end model as always being
transparent with you guys Leo file did
send these over for review my assessment
was not altered in any way please watch
the entire video for both pros and cons
they're priced at $139 retail but for
the last several weeks I've noticed
they're going $4.99 as always I'll place
my affiliate links in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time so without further
ado my channels here to help you make
that purchase decision welcome everyone
to another review
going over the physical features first
the leather stitch neck man up top
reminds me of my $200 Sennheiser HD ones
very similar premium leather very soft
and supple to the touch it's hands down
very very good quality now below the
plastics are decent there's confidence
when handling these for the last several
weeks of owning them for $99 they are
perfectly fine but to compliment me
leather neck man the plastics could use
some texture or at least some visual
texture to match now as for the wires I
appreciate how light and free-flowing
these are but a thicker gauge wire would
give me a bit more peace of mind their
buds itself on the other hand feels very
nice though those do offer a slight
rubberized finish but before getting
into comfort taking a look at the
buttons and talking about its features
the buttons do offer pause and play
skipping going back on songs of volume
adjustments of course but voice prompts
are there to tell you when it's paired
and when the zero turns on or off which
is super helpful
unfortunately no voice prompts for
battery life levels last Siri or Google
assistance is available by holding down
that multifunction button now the zero
can take phone calls and with my test if
I'm stationary it's fine but if I turn
my head wire chatter is picked up by the
microphone and folks on the other end
can hear the scratching now looking at
the bottom of the earphones you have a
dedicated active noise-cancelling button
to turn it on or off the bonne Alma is
quite stiff turning on was fun but
turning it off required a bit of
pressure or pulling to do so last but
not least leo file are charged via a
micro USB port in the package they do
offer a 3.5 millimeter to micro USB cord
which is quite unique here if your ear
phones are dead plug this into your
phone or PC and you're able to have
audio play through the earphones instead
of using bluetooth very convenient now
regarding better life on the retail
packaging it's climbing up to 20 hours
of use while my Bose only offers up to
10 as with all my audio products I left
the earphones playing with active
noise-cancelling on at 50% volume from a
full battery to dead
this lasted 12 hours and 30 minutes to
be exact during my review of the bose QC
of these same exact tests I did for the
legal files
I still have 50% battery life remaining
that's why I do these tests
so you guys know now jumping into
comfort as proof on your screen they
weigh as much as my Sennheiser HD ones I
have to have around 50 grams the Bose QC
30s new way a little bit more slightly
above 60 and it's my new difference that
wouldn't be an issue for anyone but if
you want the lightest option the Lea
file zero surprisingly offers the
lightweight alternative now they stay in
the ear as well as my premium over the
neck earphones three air tips are
provided in the box and foremost they
will find the air phones to be fine now
will met the both QC 30 days do stay in
the ear slightly better now zero are not
water sweat resistant nor any one of the
earphones I have tested out in this
video here but although they're not
sport earphones some do run with regular
earphones and with my test they bounced
considerably more so than the other
options out there none of the
competitors are great but the zeros I
wouldn't recommend at all now for daily
wearing at the office or desk to walking
they stayed in the air very well they
are comfortable for my small ear canals
and physically they perform like the
other more expensive options out there
alright so to the moment you've been
waiting for
how is the active noise-cancelling and
how is the audio starting with anc
coming in with the right expectations is
key if these were priced at 200 or 300
dollars it did not blow me out the water
but considering it is $200 cheaper than
my Bose QC 30s I really can't complain
while I was on a business trip in New
York City I stopped by Times Square on
the busiest places in New York the $100
leo file suppresses audio by roughly 50%
the audible airiness car horns and
construction that was around me was
reduced the most now with voice chatter
that was more muffled than suppressed
know when wearing the most QC 30s Bose
blacks out about 75 to 80% of most
noises around me and does an impeccable
job as for the leo files wearing this
around normal city walking on the
trainer bus it's not BOCES level but it
performs very reasonable for its price
tag the biggest benefit if you do buy
the leo files and where do see value are
those air traveling this is where these
zeros really do shine
now while bose may suppress about 75 to
80% of that cabin humming and air
whooshing when you're flying the leo
files felt as though it was very close
to 70 to 75 percent in redux
of the same in-cabin air noise now the
travel experience in general is just
much more enjoyable so alright jumping
over to the audio performance here
switching between Maya QC 30s I'll be
honest I'm very impressed by the LIA
file they sound pretty darn good
the biggest difference though starting
with based allele files might not be as
deep or warm in sense as my QC 30s but
it's pretty darn close punchy bass not
necessarily bass boosted but again very
similar to the premium option and
although it's not bass boosted as I
stated earlier the only characteristic I
can critique here is once in a while the
bass ever-so-slightly
spills over to the mid-range very minor
the most average consumers will find
this to be an issue at all now out of
the 32 Sennheiser HD ones I felt had the
most base for your reference now jumping
into mid-range vocals in soundstage the
leo files did very well here clean clear
and very articulate i'm very impressed
by the detail and resolution that you
can hear a left and right audio channels
effectively but that soundstage it's the
widest out of the three beating the
boast QC 30's and again my sennheiser HD
ones the highs are not sharpened to need
to prevent listening fatigue however
they do have a hiss at very high volumes
but comparing to these sennheiser HD
ones the zero did sound cleaner the Bose
in the end did sound the best so in the
end here comparing my 300 to 200 down to
the leo file 0 $130 pair of over the
neck earphones zeros did very very well
for its price points they could use some
better wires and maybe switch up the
plastics to be a bit more premium the
better life is darn good the audio
performance is very good again for this
price I would say if you're on a budget
you understand that you're not getting
$300 most active noise-cancelling
performance but some performance that
reflects the 100 to 130 dollar price tag
the leo file zeroes comes highly
recommended so that's it be sure to LIKE
