Jimmy with Jim's review room welcome
back to another one of my videos today
we're checking out this this is the LG
pj9 Wireless floating bluetooth speaker
that had waited over a year to test this
has not been available in the u.s. in
the American market until recently and I
believe I'm might be one of the very
first ones to get my hands on this at
least on YouTube as well so I'm really
excited about this as always being
transparent with you guys LG bit sent us
over as a reviewing it for me to test
but watch my entire video to see the
pros and cons of the speaker as always
I'll leave my affiliate links down in
that video description below click on
those links for the most updated prices
in real time you never know when these
things might go on sale again
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
alright folks don't know the physical
features first we've been reviewing a
lot of badass-looking stuff this is no
exception
the pj9 does come in all whites but I
did elect to get the all matte black
finish this to fit with the review room
theme now the bottom part here this is
the woofer station there's a sub woofer
down at the bottom to give you that bass
irresponsible in that a little bit later
inside is a very strong magnet once
activated it will elevate this portable
Bluetooth speaker which I'll get to
shortly but this is the star of the show
here this is what floats and if you can
just grab it off of the power or woofer
station here but on top all metal
construction you have the grill that
goes all the way around give you a 360
degree audio bottom is hard plastic and
you have the buttons on the front here
you got power bluetooth pairing vibe
down vibe up pause play and then the
last one is basically a bunch of pair
this with another pj9 speaker and have
two of these base stations and two of
these speakers basically floating them
you've got two of these suckers that
look badass again it'd look pretty darn
cool but anyways analyst speaker here
you do have this flap here that prevents
water from getting in this is ipx7
certified which means that you can inch
this in water if you would like but
behind this flap you have a micro USB
2.0 port for charging I wouldn't use
this more of a nuisance since you can
wirelessly charge it with the roofers
station down below and also you have a
three-and-a-half millimeter input for
physical connections now close this flap
once again just push in there and use
basically set it on the base I'm gonna
show you how this levitates now one of
the things here is a very strong magnet
on the base itself but a very strong
magnet and the speaker itself as well so
you can literally just attach this to a
steel cabinet still case a desk some
kind of metal object and it will stay in
there quite well but again we're just
gonna show you how this is on the LG
base here now the magnet itself like is
it has to be very precise in the first
day or two once you receive this it
might be a little bit tough putting it
on as you can see it kind of slides if I
don't have it perfectly right in the
middle here but
sometimes it takes two hands in the
beginning after about three days or so
you basically get the hang of it you
know exactly where this goes kind of
like give it a little wiggle and it
stays right in center for you now
there's a bun right here is press this
button in the front and you might hear
in the microphones that's a little motor
that you hear it sounds like it's
raising maybe the magnet inside that
basically elevates or gets closer to the
surface and elevates the speaker up now
if you look at the pj9 this thing floats
perfectly fine it is wobbling just a
little bit here because I am probably
moving and breathing all over it
but in a very quiet environment they
stays perfectly perfectly stable
it might scroll around or spin around a
little bit because maybe some ambient
air I know with my hand gestures moving
back and forth the air does somewhat
pushes it gently now if you have this on
an end table and a corner of your room
or something like that I'm telling you
this will be a conversation starter this
in person looks very impressive you have
to look at this going up and down every
time I turn this on I have to spin and
just and make sure that I watch this
phenomenon go up and down anyways
besides that the movers stationed on the
bottom here it does have a volume max
switch a DC out which means that you can
charge a device that's connected to the
Whooper station below the only thing
that it's only 0.5 amps so it is very
low-power you're not gonna have any fast
charger and I think like that other than
that that's really about it once the
Bluetooth speaker is dead or drained of
its battery it will automatically lower
itself down and once it's fully charged
the pj9 automatically goes back and
floats up in the air once again now LG's
claiming 10 hours of battery life we
tested it here at 50% vibe and we got 7
hours and 45 minutes also this is a
Bluetooth speaker nonetheless we did
test this with our with my particular
Samsung si+ smartphone and I was able to
get 75 linear feet here in the office
and we walked out into the studio or out
of the studio here with a signal going
through about a wall or two and if I
didn't mention earlier this has
bluetooth 4.2 now some things missing
out here we don't get enough
we don't get a voice prompts we don't
have a true battery level indicator once
around there's a above the power button
is a LED light it might blink red for
you guys but other than that there's no
five white LEDs that indicate if it's
low power there's no app to tell you if
it's on low power or not but again it
does raise and lowers by itself so there
is some convenience in that aspect no
built-in equalizer so we do miss out on
some of those functions that we
typically find now and more modern day
and also mid tier to upper tier
Bluetooth speakers on the market so with
that big set let's get into the audio
test please put on your headphones and
earphones for the best audio experience
and then right afterwards
I'll give you my verdict all right here
it goes all right folks be sure to have
your headphones or earphones out I'm
gonna give this a shot here keep in mind
that you can play this speaker if the
speaker is down below or elevating up it
doesn't matter and also this gives off
even 360 degree audio so even though
this is spinning you should still hear
basically equal audio anyways here goes
press employee in three two one
all right folks hopefully you guys
enjoyed that audio experience but going
over my audio analysis starting off with
how loud this thing can get this would
be perfect for small rooms dorm rooms
bedrooms maybe a smaller living room or
so if you're looking to put this in a
small area then it'd be perfect beer now
with that being said base wise it's more
for generic listening it's not deep and
resonating it performs either at or
slightly below and in deep depth
resonating response compared to the
competitors regarding the mid-range not
bad once you get up to about 80% vomits
prior where the maximum limit is once
you go any higher
some songs it starts to get a little
raspy it does lose a little bit of
detail and clarity so just a heads up on
this with the high notes it's the same
thing as well it wasn't bad per se but
it didn't reach that high fidelity the
high details and didn't go all the way
up there too for me to really appreciate
some of the snare the snare drums
tambourines cymbal crashes those kind of
things where it was missing in detail
again it is a small bluetooth speaker a
portable speaker at the end of the day
but with this woofer station it does
supplement or provide a little bit more
bass in the household which does help
but again if you're looking for
audiophile status you're not gonna get
it here if anything like I said earlier
this no question is more of a physical
lifestyle conversation-starter
aesthetics kind of product and it is it
does look pretty darn cool it does
provide audio good audio but again don't
expect to it for it to compete against
the best of the best in Bluetooth
speakers out there so again this is
Jimmy with James Revere hopefully this
review helped you in some way hope you
guys enjoyed this demonstration like I
said it looks pretty badass I still like
it personally myself there are some pros
and cons to this guys down in the
comment section
let me know what you guys think of this
Bluetooth speaker if you guys had the
money would you purchase it yourself if
it went on sale would you purchase it
yourself just to have something really
futuristic and cool in your household
again I'm Jimmy o'james Revere
you guys take care and I'll see you on
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
