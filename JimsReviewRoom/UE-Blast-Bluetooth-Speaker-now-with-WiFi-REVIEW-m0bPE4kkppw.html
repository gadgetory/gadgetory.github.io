time for this finally Yui rose up with
some new Bluetooth speakers the boom and
Meg boom are still sold on use website
so they're not technically being
replaced but the blast and mega blast
that I have here are similar models now
with Amazon voice assistance now I'll
have the bigger speaker up on the
channel quite soon so be sure to
subscribe and have those notifications
ready as always being transparent you
didn't send these over for a review our
assessment was not altered in any way
please watch the entire video for both
pros and cons now this one retails for
$229 but as always I'll place my Amazon
affiliate links down in that video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things might go on sale so without
further adieu I'm Jimmy with gyms Revere
room and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another video
starting off I'm loving the minimalist
approach that you eat wheat and their
new speaker it's a slim cylinder same as
always but sharper lines on either ends
and it does help the blast has the same
super durable fabric grill is designed
to be stain proof dust dirt mud proof
waterproof even drop proof now I've
buried this thing as best as I could and
as you guys can see this thing is still
working and because it's ip67 certified
this can be placed in up to a meter of
water for up to 30 minutes and then also
I can hose this spray this thing down
here and it's ready to use I'm a
negative side the blast cannot float in
water so all right getting back into the
studio here back onto that black table
buns are very clicky and tactile here by
pressing these two now I didn't receive
any audio indication if I was at maximum
volume or not usually there's a beep
that tells me I can't go any higher also
on the older boom and mega boom speakers
you're able to press both plus and minus
signs up here right at the front you can
hear how much battery life is remaining
we lose that feature on the blast
now on the flip side and this is the
biggest highlight on why someone might
buy this over the boom or other
Bluetooth speakers on the market there's
Amazon Alexa built in and I'm gonna call
her Lex from here on out so I don't
activate everyone's speakers around the
world here now finishing up the physical
features you can't skip or go back on
songs there's no physical buttons on the
speaker itself to mute the mic so Amazon
or maybe the NSA so they can't hear you
pressing the minus button here and also
that bluetooth pairing button up top at
the same time is the only way to
physically do so now flipping to the
bottom of the speaker there's a small
little d-ring for attaching this to a
carabiner and such and underneath this
little flap here we have USB 2.0 for
charging the blast and Adly and I
mentioned this two years ago when I
review the UE boom it hasn't changed
here their port is basically too narrow
if I use one of my random power banks or
USB cores at home it basically doesn't
fit in the opening it's just too narrow
although it's USB 2.0 it's not as
Universal and most of the time they got
to use their supplied cord so make sure
you don't lose theirs now UE does sell a
docking pad that includes a replacement
d-ring this has a contact pin that
allows for charging the speaker without
using the cords basically having to plug
it in and out also you able use this
charging
that I have here my right hand to have a
speaker sit upright and listen to music
this way while it is charging now if you
do have the wire in there the speaker
would have to lay down horizontally or
across the table just like this a little
bit of a different audio experience you
do somewhat lose that 360-degree audio
sound but it is an alternative this is
like that and additional accessory for
forty dollars touching base on better
life you ease claiming up to twelve
hours of use which is only low-end for
Bluetooth speakers in this price range
now I was able to test this at 50% vibe
from full to dead and I got 8 hours and
37 minutes worth of use and to recharge
it takes approximately about three hours
to do so now as I mentioned earlier
there's no way to get battery percentage
and calling up Amazon Lex
she doesn't provide better levels which
was somewhat of a letdown the only way
at the moment is opening up the Yui app
ripping out your phone of course and
then checking there now finishing up our
final test bluetooth strength
outperformed much of the competition I
was able to walk a hundred and sixty
linear feet away from the speaker before
it started to cut out that's with my
samsung si plus when the pixel Excel I
got about a hundred and fifty four
linear feet so basically to test is to
confirm now I did this with phone calls
as well and oddly enough with these UE
blasts they don't have a speakerphone
apps and I can't take phone calls with
this thing now getting into Amazon's
voice assistant performance this is one
of the biggest selling points you have
the speaker as I mentioned previously on
the channel voice assistance like
Google's or series are going to be the
next big thing at least I think so now
for those who are not too familiar with
Amazon Lex there's about twenty five
thousand voice commands and grow some
capabilities include voice control your
smart thermostat lighting smart door
locks power outlets and switches other
features that doesn't require buying
additional hardware they're streaming of
audio apps since the speaker is
connected to your home's Wi-Fi and not
necessarily you don't have to go through
bluetooth you don't need your phone to
listen to podcast radio stations
streaming music apps etc but a speaker
basically can do it itself the voice
assistant like many other speakers on
the market you can get weather traffic
movie times and a list it goes on of
course look up Amazon for a list of
their features now some of the
limitations that I found here if you're
streaming through bluetooth
these can't skip or go back
songs let's say if I'm listening to like
I Heart Radio Pandora and such through
the phone itself again via bluetooth
it's not going to work now on the
opposite end if you are using Wi-Fi
through the Amazon Lex app that will
work instead that as mentioned earlier
and want to repeat this again you can't
get better life by calling up Amazon Lex
and asking for the battery life again
pretty much bummed out about that just
having to whip out your phone just to
see is kind of a nuisance especially
with today's Bluetooth speakers on the
market sorry before I touch base on the
audio test the Yui app is available for
both Apple and Android it's pretty much
straightforward and simple but at the
time this video we're missing something
good two great features that's currently
on the boom and mega boom speakers
there's no equalizer
more importantly there's no way to
double up and have two or more of these
speakers play at the same time in sync
so keep in mind Bluetooth speakers have
the ability to receive firmware updates
I'm certain those features will come
back here for these two speakers but
other that the app is really used to
pair the blaster Wi-Fi and my Amazon
accounts the occasional are getting
better and look up and that's really
about it that's nothing that's not
robust is not really detailed or
anything like that so alright folks to
the moon you've been waiting for word
sorry it's been a long video here but
I'd rather help those trying to make
that purchase decision or other than
sipping some of the important stuff out
there please put on your headphones or
earphones and enjoy my 3d audio test and
if you haven't yet please like and
subscribe
do you help support my work follow me on
Facebook Twitter or Instagram all right
folks here we go
alright folks there you have it first
off I want to say that the blast can get
pretty loud I was able to fill up small
to medium sized rooms with blasting it
at maybe about 50 to 60% volume at
maximum bomb it can push large rooms
though you do lose a bit of audio
performance at the most levels I listen
to the speaker at several distances and
found the most comfortable range to be
about five to ten feet away
maintaining the most clarity while still
sounding very balanced the blast
performed well outdoors with the music
staying strong over most environmental
noises in discussing these specific
audio ranges I found the blast to be a
bit light in the lower frequencies bass
was present but didn't have much impact
or body to the sound this was okay
unless Basie John was like acoustic
classical and some rock music but it
felt lacking in richness for genres like
EDM and hip-hop now in bass heavy songs
testing this with like Drake or Kanye
jay-z's more recent album in the 444 I
felt the speaker really struggled to hit
those low resonating frequencies but
instead of boosting them they flattened
them out and lost some audio
characteristics there now in listening
to Warren G's classic regulator's most
of that warm ruling based notes were
difficult to pick out and comparing to a
similar speaker the JBL charge 3 that
clearly uh performed a blast in the low
ranges now in the middle frequencies
where most instruments and vocals are
heard mids were more forward than bass
that John was that absolutely did stand
out though and did great
where classic rock classical and just
some songs that are strong and vocals
melodies were clear and stood out in
songs like the bone era of time by tame
impala they're busier mid-range was so
clear and discernible at moderate volume
at the loudest violence I heard some
respite us in the upper mid-range that
could sound harsh for some folks now
heading into trouble there was decent
performance in some songs I felt the
tappan could become slightly distorted
or lose clarity there though this
occurred on more trouble heavy songs
like pop and electronic music now in my
testing specifically with the song my
girls by Animal Collective
that's where I noticed it it does vary
from song song and some perform better
than others but there was some
inconsistency in the high frequency non
songs with a more balanced spectrum the
speaker handled higher ranges pretty
well and I never felt any ear ring or
any retaining Asst
through my several hours of testing now
also as a reminder the blast provides
360 degree audio wherever you place this
you're going to get an equal amount of
audio throughout the room there is of
course no audio separation
so overall the UE blast is a good
speaker but more so for the right genre
of music now this that sounds similar to
the UE boom in my opinion as it had
similar audio cat eristic the biggest
selling point and why you would consider
getting the blast over the boom and most
other Bluetooth speakers on the markets
at the moment here it's because it has
Amazon Lex and how darn rugged the
speaker is as well when someone asked me
for a speaker to use outdoors I always
tell them the boom is practically pullet
proof
so alright folks hopefully I did help
you in some way please be sure to LIKE
and subscribe and follow me on social
media that would help tremendously in
supporting the work that not only i but
what everyone does here at jim's review
room thank you guys I'll catch you guys
on the next one bye
