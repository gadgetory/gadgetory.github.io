review by Jim's review room today i have
the much anticipated the brand new 2013
nexus 7 so with last year's 2012 model
it was a definitely a hit with the price
point hardware and performance so with
this year how has the new Nexus 70
second-generation evolved as grown as
well we'll find out this 2013 nexus 7 16
gigabyte model currently retails for 200
$29 the 32 gigabyte version retails for
269 in both feature Wi-Fi connectivity
only and from Google's press conference
in coming weeks the nexus 7 4g LTE
versions will be available with 32
gigabytes of storage and will sell for
349 dollars this will be sold through
Verizon t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T so we'll go
over the external physical
characteristics first and my impressions
on how it feels now compared to last
year's model it's two millimeters
thinner and 50 grams lighter so this
model measures in at four point four
inches wide seven point eight seven
inches tall and has it fitness of point
three four inches now this model weighs
in at ten point two ounces so the
exterior features your standard power
button and your valium rockers here
microphone three-and-a-half millimeter
jack for your headphones stereo speakers
on the back and a micro USB port for
charging and it's also slimport enabled
which means you can watch whatever
you're watching on your Nexus 7 on your
big screen TV or monitor now the adapter
for that costs about thirty dollars
additional and on the back it features a
somewhat rubberized texture and if you
ever seen my other tablet reviews
actually prefer this type of backing
over the all-aluminum body just for the
fact that it does provide extra grip
when holding and then onto the front the
nexus 7 features a 7-inch Gorilla Glass
1920 x 1200 resolution IPS display now
that's a mouthful there but what is more
intriguing is it's 320
three pixels per inch I'll repeat at the
end 323 PV is now this tablet has the
most density of pixels and all tablets
on the market today that's beating Apple
minis 163 PP is beating the newest iPads
retina display of 264 it's beating the
nuk the kindle this samsung galaxy tab 3
microsoft surface etc said i can name
them all for you if you like but what
this means is for every square inch on
your screen there's 323 pixels the more
you have the more detail in turn making
your images and especially your text and
lettering just much more clear this is
one of the biggest selling points of a
new 2013 Nexus 7 now the number sounds
good but does it really perform visually
though or such as the contrast in the
playback and I'll tell you yes it does
now this is possibly the clear screen I
have ever seen now using the mex's as an
ereader was a joy because the text was
so crisp now when I zoomed in you can
even see the finest jagged edges of the
pixels so the contrast is also really
good however when you plug it right next
to the kindle fire HD or the nuk the
colors are slightly washed out on the
Nexus 7 so don't place it next to
something else and everything visually
will still look stunning on this next 7
now moving internally the CPU is eighty
percent faster than last year's model
with a new Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro
quad-core processor at 1.5 gigahertz and
a GPU that is four times more powerful
than its predecessor now in 2013 the
nexus 7 features two gigabytes of ram
and the new tablet also runs in the
newest version of its operating software
which is android 4.3 jelly bean and it
will provide some new features such as
multi-user restricted profiles with more
of a focus on parental controls
Bluetooth smart support autocomplete
dial pad wireless display to a TV to
name a few now what's more notable and
features is the virtual surround sound
and also the increasing graphics
performance from opengl es 3.0 so i
didn't see too much of a difference
compared
the previous jelly bean which is four
point two point two however with all the
new hardware operating systems this
system flows much more smoother though
there's zero skip frames there's no
stutters that I've noticed when
switching between screens or menus or
apps etc now playing graphically
hardcore let's say three dimensional
games was a breeze you threw anything at
this thing and it ran it flawlessly at a
tablet does feature a set of speakers
and both were clear but you can
definitely tell it's not as loud as
somebody competition out there but
nonetheless I mean put on a good set of
headphones or so and you're good to go
now this tablet does offer NFC support
and it's great for those NFC users out
there now wireless wireless charging is
enabled as well if you're into taking
pictures with your tablet how to say
forget about it on this device the 2013
Nexus 7 features a 5 megapixel camera in
the rear and 1.2 megapixel on the front
and I'll be honest they are horrendous
now pictures even in medium light we're
still grainy and because we're just
washed out I mean I just was not
impressed at all by the quality of the
photography in the video so really
shocked for its performance considering
how almost every other part of this
tablet is on the high end spectrum going
on it's it has a 3950 milliamp battery
which is smaller than last year's 4325
melon battery but I don't measure
battery life as such so I rather measure
it and it's claimed up time so what that
means is google claims up to 9 hours of
active muse on this current or new Nexus
7 which is actually similar or the same
as last year's model so smaller battery
and it equals to a smaller unit and it's
the same battery life I think that's
always a plus that's good alright to
wrap things up my summary here the nexus
7 it has the most pixels per inch so the
resolution as thing is crazy and it's
amazing with crisp and sharp text and
photos there it has the most Ram out of
any tablet 2 gigabytes and also the
fastest processor beating out the galaxy
tab 3 the iPad
the likes so hats off to the Nexus 7 and
also to Google as well it's nothing
groundbreaking however it does set the
bar pretty high for other tablets to
file down the road so this is right now
the best tablet you can get in its
segment and the 7-inch form factor on
the market today so I hope you enjoyed
