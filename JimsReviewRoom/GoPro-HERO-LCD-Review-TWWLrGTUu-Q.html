action cameras on the market from the
entry-level to what the pros use at the
events and video sessions of course
today I want to take a look at their
most budget-friendly model and truly see
if the performance and image quality is
compromised if anything the videos I see
at the sporting goods stores always
looks phenomenal now I personally bought
this it's the GoPro Hero Plus LCD for
299 dollars retail as of this video now
as always keep my website in mind
Jim's review room comm for news reviews
and other awesome stuff updated daily
again I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
calm welcome to another review the hero
LCD model looks almost identical to the
others but it's very much different the
first noticeable change the camera is
fixed into its housing
you cannot detach it not a big deal at
first but it means that the battery is
not removable either and if you guys
follow my style of reviews
I prefer removable batteries as
batteries do lose its efficiency over
time through recharging cycles and age
but more importantly if you're in the
middle of nowhere recording a spare
battery will be nice to interchange but
in this case here carrying a separate
power bank would be the most ideal now
there's three different back plates
provided first is an open back to allow
the built-in microphone to capture all
that audio and will test the sound out a
little bit later there's no waterproof
protection on this one but the second
plates here is the standard backdoor
which provides waterproof protection up
to 131 feet or 40 meters of water now
the last plate is a touch sensitive
plate allowing you to use the touch
screen of course but you can also still
bring this underwater but this time up
to 10 feet or 3 meters and for your
information the touch screen does not
register your fingers if you're trying
to change settings while submerged now
each backdoor is held on very securely
with the locking latch and overall like
any action cam should be it's been very
rugged and despite being the budget
model still a quality product from my
month-long testing and now regarding the
connections a microUSB port and cable is
provided to try
the GoPro in addition plugging this into
my computer allowed me to refill the
battery but also allowed me to transfer
and view files then below that is a
micro SD card slot that takes up to 64
gigs of memory now going through the
menu options and thank God for the
touchscreen this makes everything much
easier than using the buttons on the
front now on the far right once tab you
can select which mode you want to be in
either video recording taking photos
with the GoPro burst shots and
time-lapse now to the left our settings
for that mode that you're particularly
in in this case it's for video and this
can record up to 1080p with 60 frames
per second one mode that's not included
is a higher frame rate say 120 or 240
frames per second to capture those
awesome slow-motion footage if you pay
$100 more retail for the hero4 silver
that includes the hundred twenty frames
per second at 720p resolution while they
cream-of-the-crop hero4 black edition
does advertised for 240 frames per
second but it's only recording at a
resolution of 848 by 480
that's less than 720 of course but
that's also less than HD video quality
so just a heads up on that
if slow motion capture is a priority now
next up your photos taken from the 8
megapixel sensor right on the GoPro and
the GoPro does take wide photos which is
a plus if that's something that you need
all photos you see here are unedited and
right from the camera itself now pause
the video if you need to examine the
photos or visit my website jim's review
room comm for more photos online now
overall from my analysis it looks pretty
good it's not as sharp as your flagship
cell phone or point and shoot camera but
it does justice now burst shot mode is
10 shots in succession with just one tap
of the button while in photo mode and
GoPro advertises its speed to be up to 5
shots per second in a last recording
feature here I think that is great for
pros and even down to beginners
time-lapse is ridiculously easy to use
now mount the somewhere stationary and
set your interval from a half a second
up to every 60 seconds a photo will be
taken by the GoPro and then you can
piece it all together when you're home
now keep in mind this does require some
basic editing it's not saved as one huge
big movie file but once done you get a
video
like this that's playing but before
getting into the meat of the video here
here's the other mouth that you get a
mounting buckle that connects to other
accessories and don't lose the heads a
flat adhesive and one curved adhesive
mount and the adhesive does work great
once it's on its surface it sticks very
well and the accessories is where it
does get you the long run as one
official GoPro mount is quite expensive
for just some plastic but I did buy an
off-brand kit for only $15 and it comes
with a bunch of mounts here and I'll put
the link in the video description if you
guys want to check it out now for the
most part they do work but some
accessories do fit too snug and others
kind of fit to knots in hugged enough to
keep the camera stationary but for the
pieces that do work it's worth it I
think considering one accessory from
GoPro again can equal this one entire
bag well let's get into the video now
keep in mind I am not so much of an
action junkie so the videos that you see
in stores or videos online or heavily
edited and done with multiple cameras so
I'm sure my videos won't look anything
near as stunning as they do so I would
think the video sample plan will be more
of an accurate depiction of what you
might record yourself I could be wrong
but just saying now all video recorded
is at 1080p at 60 frames per second and
from my analysis the quality looks great
here outdoors on bright sunny days and
without wide-angle lens it does help
with the cap
much of your surroundings the colors are
not ultra rich but just enough on those
sunny days the GoPro does feature auto
white balance built-in
how many areas the color balance does
shift the party so great colors however
become more neutral now as an example
you can see with this image just 20
seconds apart the color palette changes
due to the clouds blocking the Sun and
you might see some variations with the
other samples I'll be showing soon
now as for later in the day here
outdoors still looks great just notice
that the clouds are a bit blown out a
little bit here and the lights in the
parking deck are blown out as well with
this video I'm using the motor mount
that came with the off-brand kit that I
bought and surprisingly it did stay on
the car now overall the detail the 60
frames per second and certain angles
that you get are still unique and
impressive for the budget model and now
taking this indoors here it's not bad at
all surprisingly there is slight
pixelation and noise but the image is
far from being unusable now you can be
the judge on how this looks and if it
looks decent to you then you're really
good to go now the very last feature I
wanted to discuss is the GoPro app now
once paired to your phone you can get a
live view of what the camera is looking
at and surprisingly it's very fluid now
I needed this one i mounted the camera
on top of my head and granted i have the
great LCD screen here i can't see what
i'm aiming at until now with this app
and while in here I can practically
change everything from resolution to the
time-lapse settings even seeing how much
battery life I have remaining so with
everything being said if the performance
is good and I really don't have any
issues that I can even say or talk about
the auto white balance may be the only
nuisance and the lack of the
exchangeable batteries on the fly but
for the entry-level model from GoPro it
works out well now if you're satisfied
with the image quality there's really no
need to jump to the $400 model the only
thing I can say the competitors like
contour and Sony does offer slightly
more features for the same or lower
price point as for image quality I do
have to test those and see if there is a
drastic difference now if you want to
stick with GoPro the hero+ LCD works out
great in my opinion if you're fine with
using a different brand for sure look
into them GoPro is clearly not the
end-all be-all
