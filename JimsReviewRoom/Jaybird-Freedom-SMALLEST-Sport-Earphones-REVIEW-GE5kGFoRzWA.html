hey everyone Jimmy with Jim's review
room j-bird is back bringing what may be
the smallest and lightest pair of Sport
Bluetooth earphones on the market now
they sent me their fifth generation pair
of freedoms and this time there's a
serious focus at style sound engineering
for such small earphones and as always
originality but they do retail for the
premium price of one hundred and ninety
nine dollars at the time this video
making these more expensive than the h2
models and on the upper end of sport
Bluetooth earphones I'll omit pricey but
let's see if the total redesign is worth
every penny
click on my link in the video
description below prices do fluctuate
and my link will give you the most
updated prices so without further ado my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review
going over what is included in the box
j-bird returns with providing both
silicon and the comply foam ear tips
small medium and large are offered for
each type along with the very familiar
your winglets that we've seen any
jaybird x-series two wire clips are
provided to shorten the cord causing the
wire behind your head to hold steady due
to tension here and the earphone stem
cells will fit over your ear that you
don't need to use the winglets with this
wearing method now for my personal
testing on fit I highly recommend this
style where and it does hold on very
well when running and doing other
vigorous activities again they did hold
on very well but on a very few occasions
they do become loose over time do you
have to push them back in now the other
method of wearing this is the more
traditional way that most of us know of
the air foam dangles from our ears and
they wear on the back and the neck just
hangs now indeed these do feel better
than the x2 however I'm still
encountering nearly the same issues with
the winglets again when wearing it in
this fashion
that they simply just don't stay on
regardless of the sizes that I try and
on another side note though of course
your ears are different than mine but
those with small ear canals they do have
to fit pretty snug so just a heads up on
that and then last in the box here there
is a protective case which is pretty
original to me it's not magnetized but
two metal bands requires you to pinch
the ends here to stay open
not a hard shell case but it does what
it needs to do now getting a closer look
at the freedoms plastic has worked
perfectly fine before but this time
they've introduced metal housing with a
paint finish which has been holding up
from my experience now there's no sweat
proof but I tested this while running in
the rain as you've seen earlier in the
video here and they still work perfectly
fine and when you do compare this to any
other sport earphones you can see just
how crazy small these things are and if
you wear glasses wearing this while
cycling with a helmet on it's such a
minimal design that won't get in your
way now how do they do this almost
everything is housed in this little
controller now it looks a little bulky
here when you do compared to the
competition but it's not heavy to weigh
one side of your head down it's pretty
standard with volume up and down it's
also used to skip music but in the
middle the action button for answering
phone calls or pausing and playing music
is located there now rotating to the
rear arm metal pin connectors to use
Jaybirds proprietary charging dangle or
attachment
now just snap is on and plug in your
supplied get short though you
be 2.0 cable one of the biggest
positives though the attachment itself
can recharge your earphones while you're
on the go you don't need the wire just
think of this like a mini portable power
bank you're on the way to the gym while
in the car Snap is on and it provides
about an hour of use from a 20 minute
charge not bad on the downside though
this is proprietary so just make sure
you don't lose it now jaybird is
claiming up to eight hours of total use
but looking closer at the item
description the earphone stem cells
provides four hours of use and the
charging attachment provides another
four hours of playback totaling up to
the eight hours that they claim now from
my testing of leaving us on at 50%
volume I was able to achieve 5 hours and
27 minutes into the unit died
I also recharged the freedoms again with
the attachment into recharge had taken
me about an hour and 30 minutes from a
dead battery all the way to full and the
very last test here that played these at
maximum vine both on the earphones and
the smartphone here the freedoms then
lasted three hours and 34 minutes to be
precise now the eight hours claim is
probably an understatement from my
experience here and you might actually
get more on your end if you're playing a
moderate to medium levels now you can
technically where the attachment if you
absolutely need to as it's seriously
super lightweight but I would wear it
when working out at the gym rather than
running or doing some other vigorous
activities it does bounce around a
little bit there now we're in the
attachment how it looks on the other
hand that's up to you guys that
subjective so this leads us to this
sound test now for a pair of wireless
sport earphones
I honestly think Jay Berg did it once
again the sound is immersive the volume
is loud for most people the sound
quality is very impressive again for
wireless sport earphones because these
are in ear they do offer passive noise
isolation and from my experience it does
block out a good bit of outside noises
the base on these are very good with
just the right amount for my taste here
is not as deep in bass like the
powerbeats2 but the bass boost is
signature helps very much with those
listening to EDM dance and hip-hop
clean it's not overdone and deep enough
making these a very universal pair to
have now the mid-range is clean and
clear it's pronounced not bright and not
underwhelming if you're listening to
quality high bitrate music files not
stream that is the sound stage on these
are very good for support Bluetooth
earphones with hearing audio
characteristics
from the front and behind you overhead
and below you regarding the highs listen
to these at higher volumes there's no
ear ringing in your ear tameness and
despite the freedom to capability of
being loud listening to these for a
while I didn't have any listening
fatigue whatsoever unless regarding
sound characteristics jaybird offers
this app called my sound now on the home
page here there are several presets to
change the sound signature both the
general audio adjustments do sound
profiles created by athletes themselves
like clicking on all presets there's a
bunch more to choose from that will suit
your taste but that's not the unique
part here going into the customization
you can fine tune the freedoms very well
surprisingly for such an easy and
intuitive method of just sliding the
frequency ranges up and down the audio
characteristics and the freedoms can
change very subtle - very aggressive but
the freedoms they are very responsive to
tuning now you like somewhat of a
brighter mid-range adjusting this I can
easily hear a difference but more
importantly adjusting this all the way
up the freedoms doesn't become distorted
the same with pumping bass all the way
up here although the adjustments are
drastic the freedoms response will still
provide a quality sound without being
muffled or distorted that I've seen on
some other cheaper earphones now the
last aspect of the app here which is
very original you can save your presets
and they will save directly into your
earphones if you were to use the
freedoms on another smartphone or device
that sound profile won't change there
again it's saved right into your
earphones now watching movies with these
and testing this on my Samsung s7 with
Netflix it's been simply amazing that
soundstage again it's very impressive
and for the most part there doesn't seem
to be a delay which we do see on some
wireless Bluetooth headphones or
earphones but on rare occasions with
these with the freedoms you might sense
a millisecond where the lips slightly
move before the audio gets to your ears
it's not drastic it's a lot better than
most other bluetooth wireless headphones
and earphones out there maybe it's not
noticeable to most but you guys know how
MUC here in our last regarding wireless
range that they perform very well here
as good as any other good Wireless pair
of headphones and earphones I walked
downstairs and the freedom still kept a
skip free signal going through several
walls and the first floor ceiling so in
the end here I've tested many wireless
support earphones in the past several
years on this channel alone and a good
amount fit and how meant it does stay
better in my ear but
none of them though from my experience
at least the ones I've tested so far
does basically sound as good as these I
recommend to give them try if one of
your main protease is audio quality and
basically a very very slim small
minimalistic design again just make sure
that the fit works for your ears
basically so I'm Jimmy with Jim's review
room and find me on Facebook Twitter and
or Instagram you guys take care and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
