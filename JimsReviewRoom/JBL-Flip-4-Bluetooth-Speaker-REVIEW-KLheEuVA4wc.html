room I'm seeing your comments asked me
to review the flip for all over my
previous videos and I appreciate that
you guys keep doing that you definitely
got my attention on this one the Flip
series makes a return in other way
looking nearly the same nearly
everything has been improved
I personally paid for this at the retail
price of one hundred dollars and as
always I'll place my Amazon affiliate
links in the video description below
click on my link and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time you
never know when you might see these
things go on sale so without further
adieu my channels here to help you make
a purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's over the physical features first
the flip 4 is ever so slightly bigger
and ever so slightly heavier but despite
the minor increase a foot 4 is still
very portable very compact for most
people's needs
the nylon fabric makes a return offering
a very rugged experience and with this
year's model it's not just splash proof
but JBL finally caught up with the
competition and it is now fully
submersible in water with the flip force
ipx7 rating it can't go under water up
to one meter or 3.3 feet for those on
the imperial system and for up to 30
minutes as a side note the speaker does
not float which is quite a letdown you
eaten fugu speakers actually floats if
you ever drop them off the boat or into
the pool now looking at the buttons
there's bluetooth pairing on the far
left volume up and down and to the far
right is pause and play or if you use
the app to change it you can have the
same button to call up Siri or your
Google assistant besides those options
you can answer phone calls with that
little triangle and with my testing
unfortunately it sounded quite bad
standing at just two feet away from the
speaker my voice was audible but it had
slight brass penis and on the other end
they were able to tell that was clearly
on a speaker
phone at four feet away which is very
reasonable here speaking naturally my
voice sounded very raspy then there was
an echo similar to me speaking while I
was in the bathroom and I sounded much
much further away that it was somewhat
annoying for the person and the other
end now finishing up these buttons
there's power up top with five white
LEDs to indicate better in life my
battery test will come shortly here so
just hang on tight there is a JBL
connect plus button and I want to
emphasize the plus in the name with last
year's speakers they also had JBL
connect but you were only able to pair
those speakers with one other JBL
connect speaker with the plus versions
here you're now not limited to just two
but you can connect over a hundred of
these speakers all at the same time and
all of them would play in sync that's
perfect for those trying to fill up a
room the only problem though and
seriously I'm personally bummed out
about this as I know many of you already
purchased a JBL charge 3 or maybe the
JBL Xtreme the Plus version don't even
pair with last year's model the flip
floor cannot pair with any other speaker
unless it's another flip for or until
JBL releases new models later this year
and maybe into the future then you can
mix and match and sync two speakers or
more together so just a heads up on that
now moving on under that field flap
there's an axillary port for physical
connections and right next to that is
the microUSB port for charging the
device
it was my testing at 50% volume the same
volume level on every one of my speaker
tests for the last three years or so
after 14 hours of playback that the
maximum went here
it still had 50% battery life remaining
that's phenomenal
now ran this a second time this time at
maximum volume and they speaker lasted
exactly four hours and a speaker also
does slightly warm up at higher vines
but didn't notice anything hazardous
about it that last but not least your
signal strength on this and being frank
Bluetooth technology is nearly perfect
these days I walked through the entire
house here upstairs and had the signal
go through several walls and the flip
floor never cut out or skimp on a signal
strength so - the moment that you've
been waiting for hear the sound test
I played several tracks for you guys and
then I'll give you my verdict f
words whatever that's also misery
it's no mystery and you and I with a
history day whatever left ghosting is
also tragedy when we aim to be you and
actually by history
hey I'm sorry
are you talking in code no reason why
you got me on hold on me but I knew
something was ignited when you left I
wanna go all I wanna do is get to tell
you he's to work to taunt us alcohol you
but I did to mention you get the credit
are you Renee and there you have it
folks
keep in mind audio recorded on my end
and then play through your speakers are
not the best depiction of audio quality
but it's my review here keep in mind the
flip floor does fall into these small
speaker category it's not meant for big
rooms but this little thing can for sure
fill up small better of the dorm rooms
and at full volume it can fill a
medium-sized room quite well the large
open room surprisingly it does not sound
tiny at all and it is still very much
enjoyable for personal listening now for
entertaining of course sound will be
slightly suppressed I would then
recommend a medium sized or of course
the larger size speakers at your
disposal
I have fifty to sixty percent in volume
which is a comfortable listening it's
full of bass that is not distorted or
raspy at a very punchy character that I
absolutely love and we return it up to
maximum bottom base levels stay the same
but the mid-range in highs are now
further emphasised the mid-range is
clear very distinguishable especially at
high volumes which is great and the
mid-range of vocals and instruments are
pushed forward but despite being forward
the small speaker still lacks detail or
resolution but again it is small and the
price is only $100 I can expect it to
perform like a 200 $300 speaker out
there assumption based on the high
frequencies snare drums and cymbal
crashes are two of the main instruments
you will find here they're not raspy or
tin ii at comfortable listening but at
maximum volume you do lose resolution or
details at the very top and the high
frequencies do slightly jumble a bit now
for the average consumer
you'll most likely won't notice this the
average consumer that are more
articulate you might be able to tell but
again for the $100 price range this
speakers overall performance is still
phenomenal
now as for a soundstage like most
Bluetooth speakers out there there's
hardly any audio separation unless you
go the JBL connect plus route so in
conclusion here the only downfall a grep
is the lack support for existing JBL
speaker owners basically not being able
to pair this would be new foot for now
maybe there's a firmware update that
could come down road maybe not we'll
just have to wait and see now for those
looking for a rugged bluetooth speaker
the flip floor is rugged though but keep
in mind it does not float when you
compare it to some of the competition
out there it is somewhat of a letdown if
you do drop us into the lake and you're
unable to see where it fell or if you're
unable to dive and get it it's basically
gone forever
on the other hand though how loud this
thing gets the amount of baseless offers
and indeed the future speakers that can
connect using the JBL connect plus
feature that foot 4 is still a great
speaker to buy I do highly highly highly
recommend it the audio performance alone
something better than most other small
bluetooth speakers on the market in my
opinion so that's it for this review be
