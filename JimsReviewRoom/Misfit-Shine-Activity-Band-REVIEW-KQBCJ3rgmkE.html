review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the misfit shine another
activity bracelet that competes with the
likes of the Nike FuelBand jawbone up
and Fitbit force and several others of
course now this measures your calories
burned distance walked your sleep
patterns throughout the night and
attempts to encourage you to be more
active through their points system now
as of this review this item is priced at
a hundred and twenty dollars which is
slightly a cost savings to you compared
to the competing bands now although
cheaper will go into its physical
construction and more importantly the
app that records your information so
without further ado we'll get started
now what's unique about the misfit shine
is you can wear this almost anywhere in
your body the package includes a
magnetic clasp that you fold over itby
to your shirt sleeve shoe etc unlike
other bands out there in the market
today now surprisingly the magnet is
very strong and hold down to your shirt
very well as you can see here shaking
the device vigorously showed no signs of
movement you can also leave the shine in
your pocket and it will record your
activity also in the package includes a
one-size-fit-all rubber sport band to
wear this identically like watch now
lastly in the package does come with a
prying tool which is a very thin flat
head to install the supplied battery now
the battery will last up to four months
per misfit and can be easily changed
now I personally didn't like the battery
because I really hate buying batteries
every so often all other bands that I've
reviewed so far and usually has a USB
dongle or cord to connect and charge
every seven to ten days so it is your
preference if you'd like to charge every
so often versus buying a battery that
lasts several months now the shine
itself is very well constructed though
made from precision milled and laser cut
aircraft aluminum now I've been wearing
this for nearly a month now and no signs
of wear or scratches are yet to be found
on the face or the back of the shine
itself now because of its top-notch
construction this is the only band that
I know of so far where you can
completely submerged underwater
unlike the competitors now / misfits
website you can go underwater up to a
hundred and fifty feet so if you're
bathing in the tub or doing water
aerobics or so there's no concern of
damage now the last physical aspect is
the LED lighting the van can display the
time once
double tap its face here and the time
will show with the hour hand being
definitely white while the minute hand
blinks after the clock is shown your
progress is also displayed on the face
of the shine now once it makes a
complete circle you've basically reached
your goal for that day
now the LEDs look very cool at night
modern and sleek but I can't see
anything when I'm out on a sunny day in
direct sunlight non moderate Sun you can
barely see the LEDs show up now that's a
huge flaw as I do use my watch
throughout my workday now the last vlog
pertains to the double tapping now at
times when I'm tapping away it doesn't
register and I sit there tapping like
I'm dialing someone's phone number I
would ensure by the second time tapping
that I hit it right in the middle and go
at a steady pace to ensure the shine
reads my desired action now this at
times became very frustrating now moving
on internally and more importantly is
the app and these shines features now of
your progress is synced wirelessly via
bluetooth and at the time this review
only works with Apple devices now it's a
huge letdown that Android was left on
the sidelines but for my reviews the
latest Nike FuelBand Andy jawbone up24
which are the other and more popular
bands doesn't support Android as well
which is out in my opinion the only one
so far that supports Android is the
Fitbit flex Fitbit force and the
original jawbone up and you can watch
those reviews by clicking on the videos
that are playing right now or going to
youtube.com slash Jim's review room now
the shines app is free for download and
as you can see on your screen I'm on the
main home page now at the very top
includes your main home button the
middle house is your friends that you've
added any third to the right is the
world news that updates people who are
syncing in real time now the far right
is your profile and your personal stats
for the world to see and it's actually
the location you go to search for
friends and add them to your list now
backing out here and going into a little
bit more detail on the home page the
shine keeps score or points you earn for
that day now similar to the Nike
FuelBand where the points only correlate
to your activeness
the more you generally move around the
more points are earned and of course you
can edit your goals to match your
lifestyle and from there try to match it
or beat it on a daily basis now below
houses a timeline graph that shows
moments you were more active versus not
throughout the day with a trophy icon
where you didn't reach your set goal now
the shine does take it a little bit more
in-depth compared to the Nike FuelBand
as once you click on your points steps
taken calories burned and distance
walked are shown and lastly on the main
home page swiping up will review your
highlights for that day icons indicate
when you were kind of active versus
pretty active to revealing any sports of
activities that you have logged in for
that day now click in the top right
reviews your weekly calendar that shows
your entire week's progress at a glance
now this is really interesting to see if
you're really a numbers kind of a person
or a graph driven type of person the app
indicates if I'm hitting my averages and
how much more or less active
percentage-wise compared to the previous
week now lastly out of this very simple
you can use app is the menu button at
the top left
now once clicked you have access to
change your activity goal you can see
mine I'm at a posh 700 since I'm working
in front of a computer most of the day
unfortunately now I believe about a
thousand points is the average or the
normal for most people now backing out
here the next item is my shine where you
can adjust settings as you can see on
your screen now most supports are
self-explanatory but the item worth
mentioning is the shines ability to
measure your activity through misfit
lamps now it's currently in beta stage
and as indicated misfit is experimenting
with this feature you select an activity
you are intending on doing and then
click Save now once you're ready
you'd have to shine 3 times to start
logging in that specific activity chosen
now as cycling misfit did advise to wear
the shine on my ankle for the best
results not for swimming - word on my
rest and so forth so from my experience
I believe this is just a way for the
shine to segment and activity from just
normal walking and moving around now
this is just my speculation but when the
activity is performed though let's say
cycling I highly doubt the Mizpah is
recording distance accurately because it
doesn't know what gear I'm in and how
fast I'm actually traveling so there's
no indication that the shine has a GPS
tracker built-in as well but again the
shine is recording quote-unquote your
activity and providing points for such
action that's an identical concept like
the Nike FuelBand where you're true and
main measurement of your health is
really based on those points the hard
numbers and patterns are much more
dominant on the Fitbit and the Jawbone's
product lineup so altogether the misfit
shine is a very well-built product
though that's comfortable to wear and
looks decent as well the app itself in
my opinion is a cross between the Nike
FuelBand
because it does provide points for your
activity and there's an activity log but
also a cross between the Fitbit flex
where it does measure your steps and
estimated calories burned at least
there's more of a focus on that compared
to the Nike FuelBand so obviously it's a
matter of what your main goals are is it
to just in general remain moving and
active and trying to meet or beat those
points that you set for yourself now
which of course does motivate some
people or are you looking for more of a
holistic and counting numbers kind of
app like counting carbs active minutes
versus passive minutes etc you can find
that on some of the other competing
bands and as for the price $120 it's $30
cheaper than the more expensive brands
out there so it's somewhat justifies
some of the things that are missing now
the sleep log isn't as detailed as it
just measures times when you're not
moving versus slightly tossing a bit in
bed the thing requires batteries which I
personally was not fond of and the LED
lights are horrible in bright light
conditions now wearing this in more
active sessions like biking and swimming
are plus since other bands can't do that
but it skews the numbers and areas like
distance and calories burned so overall
again for $120 it's not bad at all
considering what it can do and not all
bands are perfect either
but with these features and the point
system this might be up your alley so
