review room welcome to another review
now Bluetooth speakers are becoming ever
more popular for its size and
portability as you can see from my
previous reviews of JBL boasts beats and
alike companies are trying to cash in on
this new market and this time around I
ran across the instinct speaker made by
reactive priced at only $99 I decided to
give a more budget-friendly alternative
a try so without further ado we'll get
started
the instinct speaker is a very well
built product it's a small form factor
at 6 and 1/2 inches wide two and a half
inches tall and 2 inches thick making
this very portable and because of its
all hard plastic construction it's
possibly the lightest Bluetooth speaker
I've worked with and the plastic doesn't
feel cheap either
pressing on the front grille barely
yielded any movement and overall the
entire unit is very solid
now all buttons are located on top with
the first being the bluetooth
connectivity button and then to the
right of that is your volume up and down
and then going on to the right side here
although this is a wireless speaker you
have a three-and-a-half millimeter port
for connecting this manually next is an
on and off switch that glows to indicate
when it's being charged and lastly is a
microUSB port for charging your device
now a USB cable is provided by reactive
but no wall charger unfortunately either
you can charge this by connecting
directly to your computer or in my case
I just used my phone charger and plugged
in the wire and regarding battery life
it's right at the average of other small
profile Bluetooth speakers with up to
eight hours of use and before I forget
what you also get in the Box is a 3.5
millimeter tangle free cord in a
carrying case for travel and lastly you
can answer your phone calls and use the
instinct as a speakerphone there is a
built-in microphone and from my test the
audio quality was actually really good I
stood about six feet away and the other
end basically can hear me clearly with
no echoing or having that large room
effect so far for only $99 it's not bad
all the basic functions are available
and the build quality is as good as the
more expensive brands but how did the
audio test go and to critique and demo
the unit
I'll play several songs and give you my
verdict afterwards love is swinging on
the edge tonight let me show you
and we
we go yo
and there you have it folks and hope you
enjoyed the sample here from these great
artists and all their information is in
the about description below now getting
back on topic here of course music heard
in person is much more clear in
definition but hence my review and I'll
be honest I wasn't expecting much from
the speaker
granted it was only $99 and I reviewed
other speakers in the 150 to $200 range
before and there's always something
missing in the audio quality in this
case the instinct came in with no
distortion on the mid to high notes and
keep in mind I played this at maximum
very clear vocals cymbals snares you
name it and watching movies you can hear
them minut movements from just you know
the actors moving around the clothes
rustling and the actors taking a slight
breath even before speaking in quiet
scenes and yes it's that clear
but nonetheless the speaker is very loud
at the same time in considering this is
a small speaker you won't get that wall
vibrating or chest warming base but
there's a surprising amount of bass
that's generated from this thing more
than some of the other Bluetooth
speakers I've tested now for the small
bluetooth segment it's actually one of
the best speakers I have come across
this does sound better than the JBL
charge and the job on jambox mini that i
reviewed these past two months and the
last part of my test here the range was
on par with other speakers I typically
leave my iPad playing in the studio and
then I walk down to the other side of
the house downstairs and the instinct
never lost connection and that's about
40 linear feet going through several
walls that is and of course the first
floor ceiling so if you're just looking
for a simple speaker with a great sound
this is at the moment the best deal that
you can get again I'm surprised but it
makes me more confident to review other
smaller companies out there and just
give them a try nonetheless you can't go
wrong with this one again this is the
instinct from the company reactive so I
hope this review helped you in some way
