budget review this time I tried finding
a speaker that could closely resemble
the best of the best out there at least
in regards to specs this is the 9 boost
portable speaker that I asked them to
send over this is classified as a
mid-sized competing against the likes of
the JBL charge 4 and these sony xba-1
now we'll see if budget price products
are close or even better than some of
the more expensive stuff out there for
the 9 boost that comes in and about $100
cheaper than the competitors
I'll leave my affiliate links down in
that video description below so you can
check for the most updated prices in
real time
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review now going over the physical
features first the build quality on this
has been the best and most rugged of all
the budgets Bluetooth speakers that I've
tested so far this year super strong
aluminum metal grille in the front
rubberized edges with a bit of texture
and resistance here and the bottom has a
few slits for that passive base radiator
none of this feels cheap at all but
overall it's as portable as other
mainstream speakers on the market and
further site it's also drop resistant as
well Megan is dermo for the rugged
outdoor trails or your kids when you're
clumsy girlfriend boyfriend whoever I
tested this and a speaker still is going
strong now the 9 boost beats out several
other budget bluetooth speakers with an
ip67 certification equivalent to the
other mainstream competitors out there
testing this to ensure there isn't any
water intrusion that boost still works
just like the capitation it also floats
giving you a peace of mind for those
taking this to the pool the lake what
have you now looking at the right side I
do wish the buns gave me a little more
tactile feedback or sensory click the
buns are responsive but they're quite
flush here and they don't give me that
confirmation that clicky feeling though
I can't confirm if I actually press it
or not at times all the buns are
self-explanatory but features you can't
see if I'm up and down can be used
skip and go back on your music and the
pairing button can also be used to pair
two of these boost speakers together and
play at the same time for the one issue
that it did have with this speaker when
you turn this thing on the voice prompt
is loud as heck
all right there we go
all right calm down lady it rotating to
the rear here behind this
water-resistant flap we have a 3.5
millimeter input for physical
connections microUSB port for charging
and a full size USB port to use this
speaker like a power bank so you can
charge your phones or devices that comes
in handy then nine claims up to 20 hours
of battery life on this thing which is
class-leading and equivalent to the more
expensive midsize bluetooth speakers out
there now I test this at 50% volume and
the results are quite impressive
I'll have the numbers on your screen to
indulge now I tested Bluetooth signal
the 9 features bluetooth 4.2 climbing up
to 100 feet of signal strength using my
samsung sa plus I was able to get 96
linear feet with a straight line of
sites may miss one the best-performing
bluetooth speakers i've tested so far as
a side note I did test this with movies
on Netflix and YouTube happy to say
there's no syncing issues no test of the
speaker as a speakerphone since you can
take phone calls with this if I hold
this out at arm's length just like so it
was fine but leaving this on the table
and then only stepping four feet away
that's when my voice started to sound
very far away there's no echoes though
but on the other person in my recipients
it was very hard for them to hear my
voice so so far the nine boosts strong
suit is durability and surely battery
life keep in mind this is a budget
Bluetooth speaker so some features are
missing which is understandable but
honestly if you're not gonna use this as
a speakerphone if you don't leave the
convenience of a battery level indicator
although I would like it but again it's
just a convenience thing are you okay
with living without it comment down
below
all right folks please put on your
headphones or earphones as I'll be using
my binder or microphones for the audio
test and be sure to light up that
comment section with those fire emojis
card folks here we go Jesus shit
sometimes alright
alright folks here we go
Oh
just one that there's one and there you
have it folks now first up this speaker
gets loud enough for small to medium
sized areas for large areas it's very
much for casual listening which is
normal for mid-sized Bluetooth speakers
now if you pair both of these then it
gets really really loud
I always highly recommend any speaker
that is to get two visits sync them
together now for genre is that I would
recommend this for if you're into
classic rock classical music or if
you're more into vocal work that's my
recommendation then and booze isn't a
basic speaker whatsoever you're not
getting deep bass or want to perceive as
even neutral base I would have preferred
a bit more though to help with warming
up the vocals a little and also giving
it a little bit more depth or dimension
with the audio it's not bad but it could
surely be a little bit better in the
base area the mid-range however is quite
strong here this felt like a very bright
speaker with vocals very much in the
forefront that medium to slightly loud
volume this is a good casual speaker to
have for general entertainment once you
start pushing maximum vibe the speaker
does get a little stretched and s's and
vocals start to jumble up a little bit
the non boost really boost up that top
range and at near maximum it's pushed
the speakers it pushes the speaker to
its limits and then the quality starts
diminishing then with my overall
assessment the audio isn't bad for the
average consumer looking for a general
speaker and for the price you get tons
of value with the physical bill
the peace of mind for water and better
in life it's as good as the more
expensive stuff out there but with the
audio again it's more so for general
listening around the house strap this on
to your atv your bike what have you it's
perfect for those kind of situations and
at that price point with what they're
offering for the speaker they can't
really complain
all right folks please comment down
