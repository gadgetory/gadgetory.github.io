review room now had reviewed these
solitudes back in June and for sure they
were a step up from the original solos
that started this all well beats just
released their solo2 wireless for the
price of $2.99 as of this video and for
sure beats are on the top tier in
regards to pricing but they're selling
for some reason I'll go over its
construction determine if there's a
difference in audio quality of Bluetooth
versus being wired and showcase another
pair of beats for you so without further
ado welcome to Jim's review before
starting here I have three models the
solo - solo - Wireless which were
reviewing and also brand new is the solo
- fragment Edition and I'll try to
showcase the fragments more in the video
when needed as they sound identical to
the original solo tubes now to first
start off there's only subtle
differences with the wireless that makes
it stand out
now all models still offers the same
beautiful glossy finish
that's very fingerprint prone though now
for the fragment Edition the chrome is a
mirror-like finish and no question as a
fashion statement it really stands out
now if you like white cars white tees
etc the fragments I would describe in
person looks like pure white it's not an
off-white not even close it just looks
really clean but going back to the
differences here it's mostly seen on the
ear cups themselves considering the
wireless is now Bluetooth their houses a
battery with a micro USB port going into
the right ear cup no closer inspection
reveals what appears to be additional
airflow for the battery housed and not
necessarily vents for the speaker
themselves more on the sound test later
though
now it's thing and be right near cup
features a small on/off button that's
somewhat hard to find when you have
these on your head
but after some practice muscle memory
kicks in and find this was a little bit
easier now in addition I love white LEDs
as it looks classy and sophisticated to
me here they indicate your battery
remaining which is a huge plus and is
also another LED on the left ear cup
which indicates when it's paired to your
selected device and also take notice
here there's still a three-and-a-half
millimeter port if your
batteries or you just don't want to use
bluetooth altogether now the last subtle
feature here that you cannot see is only
on the left ear cup you now have pause
play buttons by tapping on the beats
logo or you can adjust volume by
pressing up or down and skip music by
tapping twice or three times to skip
forward or move backwards respectively
then I did test this worked on Pandora
and slacker radio and on both my Android
and Apple devices no ovens are clicky
and responsive and again muscle memory
eventually guided me to where the
buttons are located now as discussed in
my solo to review they are indeed of
much better quality than what they were
once before stable hinges better plastic
snoozed
more cushion all around especially with
the very soft and plush ear pads now
wearing these and going into my comfort
tester I do admit they clamp somewhat
firm now at first they're great but
after an hour and hour and a half so I
noticed slight discomfort but after the
second hour mark had personally noticed
pinching at my ears now readjusting them
helped but taking them off and having a
brief rest had me wearing these again
for a for some time again with no real
issues now on the positive note though
unlike some other headphones there
really is no pressure along the jaw line
which is a real nuisance on other brands
and overall the crown of the head wear
at time pressure is noticed I didn't
notice any issues there either with
long-term wearing now in regards to
content these does provide a three and a
half millimeter wire for your headphones
with an inline controller similar to the
original solo ones it's still the same
quality with clicky buttons and
responsive controls there's also a
built-in mic so you can answer phone
calls and audio quality is fine and it
sounds like you're just on a headset
nothing too special and nothing bad to
speak about that's not the norm but
beats also provides its neoprene
carrying case which is also a plus here
and when stowing away your headphones
it's a small package overall which is
convenient inside there is unfortunately
not a separate pocket to hold your wires
or any other accessories that you may be
holding on to now moving on to the
performance here Beats has always
received mixed opinions in regards to
audio quality now I personally do listen
to a wide variety of music of course
preferring some over others but for me
stating these are horrible overall would
not be fair to put in simplest terms
sounds similar to John Mayer some songs
from maroon 5 or one Republic does sound
a bit what they call muddy to me if I
can describe some it's bass droning or
spewing over to the mid-range it's not
as apparent for the average consumer but
if you do pay close attention for
example one republic's secrets you'll
notice the lead singer ryan tedder voice
is a bit recessed and not as pronounced
you lose a bit of clarity and it's not
the sound of distortion you can say but
it's a loss of clarity for the benefit
of bass again a little bit of drowning
or spilling over to the mid-range
but with that being said a hip hop and
rap does perfectly well in my opinion
when a producer focuses on the beat and
bass with the solo twos they do bring
those notes out very well
base and sub-base levels are hit deep
and in my opinion without distortion and
beats I believe hits based more than the
other headphones that I've personally
tested so far whether it be the v-moda
crossfades
Sennheiser Momentum's or these Samsung
level overs and considering pop music
nowadays relies on so much techno or EDM
like music the solo twos work for the
most part for that particular genre as
well again those songs where vocals are
key instruments hitting the mid-range of
sound those songs will not do as well as
other brands on the market but if you're
a bass head need that deep bass in John
Rose again of EDM rap hip hop and most
pop music these days beats does well in
those genres in my opinion and hope I'm
coming across as being fair here as
these headphones are good in the right
areas not to finish off the wireless
headphones what I wanted to test is
determine if there was a difference in
audio quality Bluetooth versus a wired
connection now Bluetooth is an audio
compression technology and does degrade
Audio somewhat but to be honest that
seems to be more in the past now as I've
tried this with Bluetooth speakers
switching from wire to wireless
connections I cannot tell a difference
and if there was it's so minut that the
average consumer can't even tell today
it's the same with the solo twos and
bees solo2 wireless here
there's no downgrade in audio quality
that I could tell now both still plays
very loud and louder than other
headphones in the market now testing the
distance I left my
phone upstairs and walked downstairs and
onto the other side of the house here
the signal remained perfect going
through several walls and the first
floor ceiling now as for the battery
test here beats claimed the set is to
last up to 12 hours now left these
things on early on in the morning and
while testing this all day and just
letting it play as well and the first
time around I was able to achieve 14
hours and the batter is still yet to die
so I had to go to sleep but I did
recharge it before I slept here and I
woke up at 3:30 in the morning and I
started playing the headphones again
living it at 50% volume that way we can
get an even base and even result and I
let it play it past the 12 hour mark and
in the end it played from 3:30 in the
morning all the way until about 10:30 or
1041 at night so 19 hours and 11 minutes
to be exact
until this died now this is weird and I
did try it twice just to make sure that
this was accurate and sure enough it did
surpass what beats were climbing so very
impressive very phenomenal indeed so
hope this video helped you in some way
let me know what you personally think of
beets if you like my work and me jim's
review room on Facebook Twitter
Instagram or Google+ as I normally post
updates on items I'm currently testing
before I put them on the website
it's a great way to have fans from of my
work communicate on there and ask
questions as well so again this is Jimmy
with Jim's review room you guys take
care and I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
