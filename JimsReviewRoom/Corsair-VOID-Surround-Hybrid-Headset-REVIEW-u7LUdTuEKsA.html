room as I promised you guys gaming
peripherals will be reviewed on this
channel as you guys have asked for it so
thank you for showing your supports and
letting me know what you guys like to
see but today we're looking at Corsairs
newest addition to their void and lineup
of headphones this is the surround model
priced at $79 retail as of this video
but I have seen it on sale recently for
about $59 on Amazon and you can click on
the link in my video description below
to see what the most updated prices are
today so jumping straight into this my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
gems review room
going over the physical features first
the headband is all hard plastic with a
decent amount of cushion for the crown
of your head it's wrapped in microfiber
fabric the ratcheting system works
absolutely great offering very cliquey
feedback and unlike some of the other
cheap headsets that I've tried so far
the ratcheting system stays put and you
won't accidentally have these extend or
retract during movement moving down to
the ear cups these do graciously swing
exactly 90 degrees for a lay flat
stowing but still retains a decent
footprint since the ear cups don't fold
inward the foam ear pads are removable
if you ever need to replace them and
inside you'll see the single 50
millimeter driver that pumps out the
audio the outside the air cups are a
glossy black finish with Corsairs logo
and with a matte red accents all around
now the left side has a mute button yet
moving to the rear end nicely hidden is
the volume adjustment scroll wheel the
mute button is responsive and gives a
nice subtle feedback but the wheel on
the other hand felt a bit cheap
scrolling barely had any resistance and
it felt and sounded like lower quality
parts when in use but the rest of the
headset however does feel very well made
here and appropriate for its price point
the mic is also well positioned with
options of pivoting up and down and
although made of some tough silicone or
rubber like material the microphone end
is adjustable for your needs and just a
heads up the microphone with the audio
cable that extends out of the headsets
they're not removable however they're
both well built from the time of me
testing these by tugging and pulling on
them simulating accidental pulls and
tugs and since the environment my
controls are on the headset itself
there's no inline controller which was
perfectly fine for me now moving on to
comfort I couldn't find the weight of
the headset here on the box or no horn
Corsairs websites so I took the liberty
of measuring it myself
the surrounds came in at about 338 grams
which is on the heavier side in the
headphone world but as I do more gaming
headsets I should get a feel if this is
an average weight or not but despite
weighing in the 300 gram range
surprisingly these are comfortable for a
good while because the headband does sit
much more forward and not at the crown
of the head
rarely and barely did my head feel any
wearing fatigue in addition the clamping
force is subtle to the jawline and dirty
long term wearing I barely noticed any
discomfort regarding heat regulation my
ears never sweated or become too hot to
the point where I really needed to take
them off prematurely overall regarding
comfort surprised
very pleased to say I was able to wear
these for about three to four hours
straights before needing a break of
course everyone's comfort will be
subjective and right before getting into
my sound test the surround model is
compatible with both PlayStation and
Xbox but only offers stereo separation
via its 3.5 millimeter plug for the
surround sound effect which is software
driven you would have to utilize the
included USB download and download
Corsairs queue application with this
application you can utilize Corsairs own
equalizer to fine tune your audio which
works pretty well but nothing too
drastic and also toggle Dolby surround
sound on and off now with all the void
models only this model is able to be
used with either a USB connection for
the PC or the traditional 3.5 millimeter
plug but now getting into my audio test
base from my experience is tight and
more under neutral and from my
experience is that tube AC where it
models the mid-range yeah it's just
enough for a general balanced sound
signature now utilizing the equalizer
does help a slight bit for those
desiring a bit more bass but as I stated
earlier the equalizer doesn't offer a
drastic difference to fit everyone's
needs but for most though the bass
should be just enough regarding the
mid-range signature isn't bright so
voices aren't in-your-face it does a
good job for its price points with
staying clear and flat those looking for
something more neutral the surround
offers just that but now looking at the
other end here the high notes
I'll meant were a bit tinny and
high-pitched which did produce some
listen fatigue if you are using these at
higher volumes and regarding volume
levels these headsets do get pretty loud
now I then turn on the Dolby Surround
feature through the corsair q
application and you can hear the
atmosphere and your surroundings become
a bit more hollow and make it sound like
you're actually there although I'll
admit it wasn't as much as I was hoping
for but you do get a slight increase in
spatial sound recognition more
specifically sound in front and behind
you but with the virtual surround sound
on this did cause the mid-range to sound
really boxy especially for movies and
music and for those who are unfamiliar
with the term boxy it really means
singers voices or actor voices sounds as
though they're literally speaking into a
box
however for gaming you didn't notice
that much though and it really was more
normal in my sense now in the end these
van and I would say they do work great
in the 50 to the $80 price range and
with the simplicity build quality and
surprisingly comfortable wear I would
say these are worth a look on the other
end if your focus is an surround sound
maybe a little bit more competitive
gaming I would have to say check out
some other headsets before making a
definitive selection now last regarding
microphones performance
here's a quick test alright folks so
here is the test on the noise cancelling
microphone on the surround headset I do
have something playing in the background
on my computer speakers right now and
for the most part you guys can tell it
blocks up most noises if not all of it
so it does really well in that aspect
now regarding my voice here like most
gaming headsets this really inherent you
get this nasally effect my voice sounds
nasally like I'm congested or so but
when I'm verified with other gamers
online if you're the PC or Playstation I
tested on both systems for the most part
everyone said my voice was very clear
there's barely any static or breakup
again it's nasally but that's basically
about it again that's a problem that we
see on if not every game you have
something I've personally tried so
that's it for this review I hope you
guys enjoyed it if you do like my work
