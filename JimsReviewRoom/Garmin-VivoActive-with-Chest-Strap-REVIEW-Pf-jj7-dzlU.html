surge and maybe the answer to what many
consumers are looking for the vivoactive
is one-half a SmartWatch and the other
half an activity band but regarding the
health aspect there are some features on
here that we haven't seen before on any
other product but before going deep into
the details here's the current pricing
information as of this video
I personally paid $300 for the
vivoactive and it does come with a chest
strap for heart rate tracking and
without the strap you're looking at two
hundred and fifty dollars for the
abandoned by itself so for now sit back
and relax I'm here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review by Jim's review
going over the physical experiences
first this is the thinnest activity band
that I've tested and I love the fact
that it's thin for those who work at the
office wearing this does not snag those
long-sleeve shirts but wearing this in
general it doesn't look huge on their
wrists either
now of course the look is subjective for
everyone but this has to be the closest
thing that looks more like a SmartWatch
rather than a ruggedized activity band
now the view of active uses a buckle
like many traditional watches and it's
secure when worn daily and during
workouts now moving to the strap it's
indeed slightly stiffer than the Fitbit
surge and it's not elastic but regarding
comfort the strap is very smooth the
watch is very light overall it's still
been a pleasure to wear now one thing I
personally test for are for those who
lift weights either doing military
presses or overhead extensions and
similar movements it doesn't clench the
back of my wrist like some other bands
on the market same thing for cyclists
and other demanding sports that requires
a lot of wrist movements now regarding
the all plastic housing it's again light
but everything from my analysis is built
tight with no flexing and squeaking and
you would hope so considering I did wear
this in the shower but Garmin does claim
to have a 580 M water resistant rating
meaning you can go swimming with us and
that's something that fitbit surge
cannot do per their website although
they have the same 580 m certification
and I'll show you the swimming part of
the app a little bit later in the video
now looking at the back again the
vivoactive has your charging syncing and
firmware updating ports for use with the
garments proprietary charging cradle now
speaking of charging battery life is up
to an astonishing three weeks in its
best case scenario that's without using
the GPS at all now I'm glad I waited a
bit here before posting the review the
Garmin released an update recently
updating the bantoom version 2.6 now
prior to updating with my battery test I
had drained the battery by 50% in just
three days in 23 hours to be exact now I
would assume if I continued here I
practice of battery life but with this
new update the better life looks to at
least double in its performance from
what I can tell so far now I have to
test this for the rest of the month just
to see truly how long the battery will
last but there's one more thing that I
wanted to point out now when I first
bought this I fully charged it and
didn't do any runs yet but
only after one day and nine hours to be
exact the Garmon died it appeared that
the band continued to search for these
smartphones Bluetooth connection when a
phone was too far away again this was
prior to the update and if you have read
or seen others mentioning poor battery
life before my review came up here they
might have been using the older firmware
version so just a heads up on that
but getting away from batteries here
let's take a look at the display now
overall it works well in bright and
direct sunlight situations if anything
the numbers and the display looks to
reflect the light that's hitting it but
oddly enough not necessarily in dark
areas just not bright areas the screen
doesn't pop enough for a quick glance
it's still readable but it does take
more efforts and you wouldn't think you
need the backlight on at that moment
considering the room you're in is just
fine for everything else
now it's an odd phenomenon and it is
something that people will notice but I
believe it won't be an issue
where it would be a deal breaker if you
need that backlight that you can press
that left button on the watch by going
through the factory display here that
comes with the band first you receive
this huge clock here with the partial
date at the bottom swiping right at one
time reviews your notifications such as
missed calls text messages emails etc
and going to the right again
is your calendar for upcoming events now
next are meteor controls which I found
volume to work for all the apps that
I've tested but oddly enough every time
I press skip or back or even pause slash
play here my NFL app opens after
deleting the NFL app pressing skip
doesn't do anything at all I couldn't
find a fix for this but if you can help
me let me know in the comments below I
would think then hopefully this is a
one-off situation I was swiping to the
following screen provides a very
beneficial weather widgets telling me
the high and low for that day with
current temperatures but tapping the
screen offers a four-hour window of
incoming weather and swiping a write one
more time here from there offers a four
day outlook and last year which I always
loved about the Garmin products is yes
you do have your step counter and a bar
to illustrate how close you are to your
goal but the move bar is returning and
included with the vivoactive
now the first bar fills up here after
you've been inactive for for the first
hour the band will also vibrate to get
your attention and tell you to get up
and move around a little bit now every
bar after that will fill at 15-minute
intervals to show you how lazy you
not this time but also yours miss it's
really a great way to remind you when
you're so focused on work just sitting
around for too long to get up and take a
walk
very few bands currently offer this
similar feature now one thing that I
found odd here was the sleep function
was nowhere to be found it's actually
hidden and the gold screen that we were
just at tap the menu button below and
then you can tap sleep then when you
wake up you hold the right button down
for several seconds to get it out of
sleep mode and that's basically it now
to the meat here and why this band is
different from the others now pressing
the right button brings you to your
activity screen for the time being
Garmin can record your specific activity
for running and walking like most bands
but the three unique modes are biking
swimming and golfing and this is what
other bands don't do at the moment
swimming for example you tell this band
how long the pool is 25 meters 30 meters
you can even customize the length here
and of course this will calculate the
calories burned from swimming but this
provides lap counts length pace stroke
count including the number of strokes
per length and session and interval
averages and you can see how deep the
metrics go just for swimming alone now
as for a biking this counts the basics
but with GPS your trails are logged your
distance is calculated by GPS and your
speed is also recorded and last year for
golfers the GPS will pick up your actual
golf course that you're standing on now
looking online and I'll provide the link
here and also in the video description
there's over 17,000 golf courses in
America that's registered and 38,000
worldwide in total now what the
vivoactive can do for you is tell the
whole numbers and pars measure layup and
dogleg distances as well as measure
distance from the front back and middle
the green there's much more information
and Garmin's of website as I know
majority of my audience doesn't really
golf but quickly looking into the
running profile actual time pace
distance and lap times are all measured
and with most of these activities if you
have the heart rate chest rep these
activities will record and display your
heart rate zones with both real-time
heart rates and average heart rate
information so overall before showing
you what the app looks like my
experience with the watch itself has
been for the most part and very positive
now from my testing and
different parts of the city to the
suburbs and last in the local park off
of the main trail here I was able to
have the GPS locked on in about 15 or 20
seconds each time it's about 10 to 15
seconds faster than other bands that
I've tested now the GPS has been
practically identical as well to that of
my GPS on the phone even down to the
distance and pace and as you've seen in
the video so far the screen doesn't
perform as smooth in transitions as some
other devices today it's clearly not as
smooth as your phone as well it doesn't
hinder the experience negatively though
it doesn't necessarily feel like it's
going to slow you down at least not for
me but overall the touchscreen has been
very responsive through swiping back and
forth and the vibrating alarms which you
can only set to go off on a daily basis
and not on individual days is strong
enough to wake me up or alert me of
notifications and a last bit here before
looking at the app I did test the heart
rate monitor and this is why I
personally prefer chest straps in
general it's that much more accurate and
a consistent tool across the board
regardless of brand for the most part
now wearing the h7 from polar proven an
accurate ban on my channel here and
wearing the garment at the same time
both straps were practically identical
both chefs were always within one or two
heartbeats of each other but to further
provide proof here I perform some basic
interval training and even with a stop
and go workout method every beat was
very much spot-on
even the average heart rate at the end
with all this up and down in heart rate
calculations were eventually the same so
let's now take a look at the Garmin
Connect app here and see what it has to
offer
starting on the main page here on top I
have my step counter with my daily goals
shown in the middle now one feature I
love about Garmin and not every band
does this it's an automatically
adjusting goal based on your previous
day's performance it goes up when you're
being active in days where you just
caught off guard there the number lowers
itself just to make it more obtainable
the next day now of course you can
change that number easily with just a
tap on the pencil icon but moving to the
next tile is a combination of calories
burn for that day based on my general
activity and workouts logged but also a
calorie intake log as well by tapping on
details it does offer you to add foods
via the very popular app
I fitness pal there you can login your
food and drink intake and it will
basically bring the data back into the
garment app for viewing now moving back
here is the sleep tile offering how much
time you've slept but more importantly
how much movement was measured during
your sleep so it's pretty much
self-explanatory
now the next tile here offers activities
or workouts that you've recorded so far
tapping on each activity opens tons of
information that you can review starting
with a map to run the following here is
a very detailed summary lap times are
also presented although I didn't have do
any lap times here and last are all your
detailed charts for viewing again very
impressive very detailed all together
and that's basically it from a home page
and I'm sure it will look different from
what you may have as every owner can add
widgets by just pressing this top upper
button right here basically you click on
add widget and you can add courses
workouts badges or basically
achievements and record your own weight
over time but backing out real quick
here also wanted to mention four steps
calories and sleep you can always click
on details and swipe left or right to
view previous performances and pretty
standard but it's still pretty useful
you can compare weeks and months to see
if you're doing better or worse and make
adjustments now one thing before I let
you go here government has this thing
called Garmin Connect IQ it's their
website that houses all the third-party
apps that are available to use with the
government people active now for example
the watch only comes with one digital
time display but downloading and singing
to my band I'm able to have new watch
faces widgets and other very useful
features at hand and it's ridiculously
easy to do now not to mention the Garmin
Connect website alone is very detailed
and offers even more customization but
customizing is so deep for Garmin
products that's seriously for another
review or video so how this video helped
