room
JB released a slew of new speakers and
they all have a very uniform and
consistent look now today we're looking
at their cheapest and most portable
speaker the JBL clip - I personally paid
for this at the retail price of $60 and
I'll place my links in the video
description below as always click on
that and my links will give you the most
updated prices for today you never know
when it goes on sale so without further
ado my channels here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review
go over the physical features and test
this thing is seriously compact it's
five and a half inches across fitting
perfectly in my hand or bag here the
same rugged fabric makes a return with
the rest of the clip to being made out
of plastic that's wrapped in a slightly
grippy silicone now of course this does
come with a carabiner clip up top and at
first I notice it was a bit stiff and
kind of takes away from that smooth and
fluid working product however after
realizing if you intend and clipping
this to your bike or bag jet ski but
whatever it may be the stiffness doesn't
cause the speaker to bounce everywhere
causing the audio to sound like it's
coming in or out so that's a plus there
now also keep in mind the new JBL
speaker specifically the JBL charge 3 in
this clip - there now ipx7 certified
meaning you can completely submerge this
into water up to three point three feet
or one meter for up to thirty minutes
now i perform this test to verify and
the clip two is still working fine of
course one of the biggest perks in just
likely charge three the ue boom - the
mega boom and some fugu products the
speaker floats if you ever do drop it in
the pool or the lake a huge advantage
there but let's take a closer look here
on the left side there is volume up and
down on either side right in the middle
is a bunch of answer phone calls and use
the clip - just like a speaker phone
with my testing the speakerphone works
very well here at close proximity and
once you get about four feet away that's
when you notice the voice does sound
like you're somewhat far away that's
when the other person can kind of tell
but the quality is not crackling and for
a 60 dollar speaker this performs better
than some of the $200 Bluetooth speakers
on the market rotating to the right
there's a bluetooth pairing button the
power button is to the far right and in
the middle is a microUSB port covered by
a flap to keep water out regarding
better life JBL claims up to eight hours
of use and with my testing leave Masson
at 50% volume the speaker died in 24
hours in around 30 minutes which is
crazy but keep in mind vibe is
exponential so I went ahead and did a
second test leaving this a full volume
full blast here and it played for four
hours in 22 minutes into the unit die
from a full battery
now recharging it took about an hour and
50 minutes for my test
one of the biggest grips that I've had
though there's no real battery indicator
I can't press two buns at the same time
to receive a battery level prompt nor
is there an app that tells me how much
life I have left on here now even the
light doesn't give options here it's
either blue for being connected or it
turns red if the battery's low there's
really nothing in between now the very
last feature I want to show that a clip
2 has a 3.5 millimeter wired permanently
attached to the body here which is very
convenient if you decide not to use
bluetooth
although the wire is exposed and if you
are using this on rugged terrain with
jagged rocks on the ground say a parkour
so I am worried though that the metal
gold-plated end here let's suffer some
scuffs over time now on flat surfaces
the plug is recessed enough to not touch
the pavement enough regarding wireless
range I've tested this in my house here
walking down stairs and on to the other
side of the house signal range was
perfectly fine with my samsung galaxy s7
phone never did I lose connection now to
the moment that you've been waiting for
hear the sound test I'll play several
songs and I'll give you my verdict
afterwards shadows
Oh
I'm Jason
and there you have it folks now sound
report on my end and then play through
your speakers are not the best depiction
of audio quality but hence my review
here they clip to is very much a
personal listening speaker for $40 more
and did you can get the flip 3 which
does fill up a small room the clip 2
doesn't well it does fill up a small
room but if you do put on maximum volume
you can still sit next to it and it's
still comfortable to listen to what the
flip through you might have a little bit
of ear ringing because of how loud I can
get it's loud but loud for a $60 speaker
let's just put it that now the year you
roll to which I just reviewed and again
the JBL flip three those two are much
louder than they clip to here but again
for sixty dollars it's perfect for
having this clipped onto your bag while
biking or just maybe if you're on a
motorcycle now getting a bit more
specific regarding the bass it's more
quality than quantity the bass
thankfully isn't distorted and there's
just enough there to fit with the
speaker characteristics if there was a
higher quantity of bass I would think a
clip 2 would have sorry to sound a
little bit distorted for such a small
speaker the mid-range is clear and
pronounced and the highs again great for
a small speaker is not tinging and ear
ringing the only thing when you do have
this on maximum volume it does slightly
lose some of its quality with sounding a
bit jumbled then the auto cat 206 isn't
as well defined but overall for the
average consumer and in this price range
the speaker will sound perfectly fine it
sounds really good now since there's
just one 40 millimeter driver in the
clip - there's really no sound
separation however with the clip - you
can daisy chain another one of these and
have both speakers playing at the same
time now technically left and right
audio channels but it's a little bit
more immersive when you have two
speakers in a room or in area now it
really bummed though there's no JBL
Connect allowing you to pair this with
other existing JBL speakers but the
daisy chain option is better than no
option at all now overall the audio
quality is very good for the price and
size but the only concern I would give
to the consumer test this out and see if
it's loud enough for you it is lower in
volume again compared to the JBL flip 3
or the ue roll - however as stated
before for the size waterproofing
especially price those are the three
main selling points that clip two is
worth looking into so hope this review
helped you in some way add me on to
facebook twitter or instagram with the
jim's reviewer abuser name and add me on
my personal account here if you'd like
at jimmy long official on facebook and
instagram twitter is jay long official
it's all on your screen right now you
guys take care i'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
