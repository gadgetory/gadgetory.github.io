I'm trying to step up my game in the
online PC gaming community shout out to
Detective disrespect for those who know
him but I am looking for a better more
competitive advantage I still have my
Cloud revolvers which are priced at 120
but today we're looking at the revolver
s these are priced at 150 and to justify
its price HyperX offers and improved
noise cancelling microphone slightly
improved design and a new digital sound
processor that you don't get on the
original model as always I'll place my
Amazon affiliate links in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time so sit back relax
and hopefully videos can help you make
that purchase decision welcome everyone
to jim's review
go over the physical features first
they're practically identical to the
original leather band feels supple and
soft up top the metal wireframe is
highly durable and just like the cheaper
model it's shockingly performs well for
weight distribution considering how
heavy these are and because of that
HyperX design it's actually more
comfortable than my $200 logitech
Artemis now there's barely any wearing
fatigue at the crown of the head and the
clamping force that the jawline is
subtle yet it's still comfortable HyperX
makes a return with their signature
memory foam ear pads which felt decent
and because these are over ear closed
back headsets my ears do heat up from
extended play now no sweating on normal
occasions but at times if you're in a
warm room or for someone who doesn't
have any air conditioning you're going
to get ear sweat regardless nasty now
the wire is fixed on the side in which
I'm hoping for a detachable version as I
mentioned in the cloud revolver review
wire cheddar is quite apparent though at
very low volumes if you move quite a bit
or play mostly campaign games and it's
really silent in the background that's
heavily also involved in dialogue the
wire chatter might distract you from
your experience but during more intense
online gameplay like overwatch or maybe
battlefield you're not really going to
notice much
now besides wire chatter the headset so
gives off a reverb but to give credit it
has been improved quite a bit with these
rubber mounts up top with the original
revolver it gives off this metal
vibration reverb when you accidentally
touch the headset with these new rubber
mounts on the S model you get less of
that tinny metal result it is there but
honestly I don't think it's a
deal-breaker at all once you're in the
game I'll be honest with you guys it's
not noticeable every time now next up is
the microphone it is detachable which is
nice and standard like most headsets
there's fair amounts of adjustability
and even with accidental tugs that I've
tested it stays put now general
movements with the wire rubbing against
her shirt will not cause wire chatter
through transmit to the microphone which
is a good thing but on the other hand if
you're manually moving the wires with
your hands a very faint rustling noise
will be picked up as for my voice you
could hear yourself I'll give this one a
thumbs up I don't sound as nasally with
some of the headsets do but for the most
part my voice sounds quite natural when
compared to the competition now as
mentioned earlier HyperX is claimed to
offer an advanced noise cancelling
microphone and with my testing it's a
rising Lee blacks out background voices
very well I had Adam in the background
speaking in a natural voice and then
microphone barely had him audible this
ideal if you're gaming around friends
get me competitively give me when you
have family members in your background
that won't respect your domain on the
other hand
typing keys or simple clinking or
crinkling of paper that noise is reduced
a good bit but it is still picked up
overall a very good performance last
years the digital sound processor is
built right in and thankfully offers a
very slim profile this is possibly the
biggest reason maybe the sole reason why
you'd spend the extra money and buy this
particular model standard game and mic
volume scroll wheels or on the side
there's a nice large mute button in the
middle on the left side are preset
equalizer settings that toggles from
enhanced vocals to flat EQ to bass boost
lit up for your convenience now this
works on PC but sadly nothing happens
when a head is connected to my
Playstation 4 now dead smack in the
middle is the Dolby surround sound
button and once pressed that digital
processor inside offers simulated 7.1
surround sound and during my time in
gaming switching back and forth between
both my god is it's effective I'm highly
impressed spatial awareness is distinct
you can easily identify if someone's
behind you in front of you and who's off
in the distance playing overwatch it
gives off lovely audio cues when he
announcer speaks the amount of detail
recognized now versus what the original
model offered is night and day where I
found it the most impressive is
battlefield one and once DSP is on each
bullet shot is just visceral with higher
pitches in its frequency the environment
you standing becomes more Airy in
experience creating that surround sound
experience immediately in-game
explosions are much more pronounced yet
not distorted nor muddy and again that
spatial sound awareness I want to
emphasize that the sound gives off such
a huge competitive advantage over all
I'm highly impressed it is a very
immersive experience and you get quality
sound characteristics all around so the
wrap this up here this of course works
best for the PC the DSP works for
PlayStation 4 as well but you only get a
slight hissing noise when you turn on
the surround sound feature but the sound
in general does improve over the factory
or stock settings for Xbox one there's
no DSP connection
all you have to connect this through the
3.5 millimeter cord that's supplied so
you do lose these 7.1 Dolby surround
sound feature
so overall the sound aspect it is simply
hands-down great I think it's one of the
best for competitive play though but if
I had to critique I do wish the headsets
were even lighter and for the
reverberations I wish they were reduced
even further but overall I think the
headset is perfect for the average
consumer to a competitive player so
