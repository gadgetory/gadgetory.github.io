review room welcome to another review
now when I was looking for a USB flash
drive I was looking for the utmost speed
for transferring huge video files but
you'd be surprised at how many USB 3.0
drives actually perform just slightly
better than USB 2.0 versions now in this
review I don't compare pricing too much
as you do get what you pay for but the
SanDisk Extreme is known for how fast I
can move so without further ado we'll
get started
the sandesh extreme is a tall
lightweight plastic construction it
sticks out quite a bit though at three
and three-quarter inches and uses a very
nice
clicky retractable mechanism
unfortunately with its title of being
extreme it doesn't come in a more
durable all aluminum case nonetheless
pro mine uses and considering and uses
more in a commercial level it's been
holding up pretty well now in regards to
speed and value extreme versions are
possibly the best models they have right
now from SanDisk meeting allowing
competitors out there right now and as
stated I have the 64 gigabyte version
and if you're looking for the upper 100
megabyte close to 200 megabyte per
second read speeds this SanDisk is on
the cheaper side surprisingly
manufacturers patriots and Corsair our
two quick examples are priced at $84 and
169 dollars respectively for similar
claimed performance now if you're ok
with around 100 megabyte read speeds
then you're looking around the 35 down
the price range for a 64 gigabyte flash
drive but what's more important are its
features and the reason why I purchased
this and correct me if I'm wrong but
SanDisk offers secure access and most if
not all of their flash drives protecting
your files with a hundred and twenty
eight bit encryption now this allows you
to share your flash drive without anyone
seeing what you have stored in your
vault to access the vault open up the
secure access program on your computer
type in the password and all the files
are there now this works on both Macs
and PCs as well so even if you lose your
flash drive which I've seen happen on
job sites and especially in colleges
where students are forgetting these in
their computers at the library at least
you'll know someone won't be able to see
your private files and you can use the
extra
Meem just like a regular flash drive as
well by saving your files right onto the
drive and not into the vault and you
won't need a password to access in the
future now to the second most important
part is speed and I'm not a big
benchmarking channel but I'll try to
show you some real-world tests as an
example the first test is showing how
fast a big file can be transferred over
to the SanDisk
initial burst speeds are around 200
megabytes per second which is very
impressive and shortly after that it
tapers down to about 180 megabytes per
second it's still crazy fast nonetheless
though and a four gigabyte file can be
completed basically in about a minute
now when doing the reverse though I
found writing to my computer hard drive
from the thumb drive yielded about 125
to 130 megabytes per second on average
as well finishing a 30 gigabyte file in
about 4 minutes time now another test
that people do is transferring very
small files in this case photos at
several megabytes each and this would
obviously be a little bit slower
considering each file is being created
copied and then written and a little
over 6 gigs of photos the speed was
averaging around 44 megabytes per second
and finished at about 2 minutes in 30
seconds in total time so with those
basic or real quick tests there and in
real world testing I guess you can say
at least what I use it for the extreme
flash drive is very fast when compared
to a lot of the other flash drives on
the market and it personally suits my
needs when transferring large video
files from one computer to another now
if you're in the market for a flash
drive and you're working with some large
files I do personally recommend this so
hope you enjoyed this video and I know
it's a short one but again I personally
have been using this almost daily and it
worked out well for me so if you can
please take your time to like and share
this video and find me on my Facebook or
