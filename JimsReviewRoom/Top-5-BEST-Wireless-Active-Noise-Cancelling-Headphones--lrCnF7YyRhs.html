room testing a bunch of headphones over
the years I've been pretty fun of these
Wireless active noise-cancelling
headphones now they don't get rid of
everything around you but headphones
with a and C usually does a great job at
blocking most of the outside world for
you so here's my list of the best anc
headphones that I've personally tested
right here on this channel I'll place my
links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time
now first up the pair of Z 2.0 and 3
models I really love how these look not
only does the minimalist design looks
unique but you can feel the quality
materials use the very smooth polished
metal to the leather it just absolutely
feels great in the hands but the biggest
reason why their Atmos list ear and
although parent does have them retail
for $300 I've always seen them on sale
for around 200 making these the cheapest
on this list now the noise cancelling is
close to the boast QC 35 s which is
phenomenal you do have the option
through the app to adjust or turn off
the noise canceling altogether and then
there's other options like sound
profiles and NFC the audio performance
is very good in my opinion
offering a well rounded sound good
enough for most generals to be enjoyed
but the battery life though in Wireless
mode is a bit low though at just seven
hours now long the negatives here turns
into a positive here the zigs do have
interchangeable batteries so having a
spare battery is ideal here if the
better ever goes bad maybe outside of
warranty you can always replace them
now last regarding comfort they feel
great but in hindsight and after some
time with them they do tend to slip off
the head here if I do lean over now if
you're just sitting at the desk
listening
these zieks works perfectly fine again
the link will be in the video
description below for updated pricing
now moving to number 4 these are my
oldest and have been my favorite for
some time here these are the Sennheiser
wireless momentum 2.0 they offer the
best bass boosted audio signatures
perfect for pop hip-hop and EDM the
wireless Momentum's offers very loud
performance amazing better life at over
22 hours of use and a timeless design
now active noise-cancelling cannot be
turned off though with these but after
testing some newer headphones lately
many other headphones now perform better
at active noise-cancelling than these
wireless momentum they do
lickin more sound and others is what I'm
trying to say basically the last
regarding comfort they feel great for
extended play super light again and
overall very durable the retail price on
these are a crazy four hundred and fifty
dollars to $500 from Sennheiser's
websites but again my link has them for
three hundred and forty nine at a time I
uploaded this video now number three
it's a more recent model it's also from
Sennheiser this is the PX c5 50s that
specifically made for travelers it's
super lightweight very comfortable to
wear as well and the features offered
are one of the best now you have touch
controls on the side and they are much
more responsive than the parent Z's
you do have the ability to turn off the
active noise-cancelling feature if you
choose to do so you can also place these
on standby if you fold the ear cups
inwards which is really unique now one
very handy feature if you lift off
either ear cup or take the headphones
off altogether the headphones pauses
your music and will resume once again
once you put your ear cups or your
headphones back on your head now the
active noise-cancelling works very well
here it's almost as good again as the
boys QC 35 but again there's two other
headphones after this one here that does
a better job now in regards to audio
characteristics it's very easy to listen
to a balanced or flat sound signature
with a lot of quality here and the pxc
550 s can be tuned with Sennheiser's F
these retail for 399 dollars now number
two and this was my number one pair for
a and C headphones for quite some time
here it almost ties with first place so
I'll be comparing and mentioning this
model a lot here on out there the bose
qc25 is the most comfortable out there
on the list very lightweight very
durable and the audio quality sounds
phenomenal the despite it not having
some audio certifications like apdex and
such they still sounded as good as any
of the other headphones mentioned so far
if not better now although the QC 35
offers a flat and natural sound
signature it's clean and many would say
a lot of those who critique these
headphones say that they are accurate
now Janos really do really shine here
our instrumental classical definitely
rock music pop and simply musicians with
strong vocals now I still enjoy them
very much with pop EDM and hip hop I
think bass lovers or bass heads might
need to have an equaliser to help out or
they just have to look into other
brands now the soundstage on these QC 35
s for a pair of active noise-cancelling
headphones is one of the best in my
opinion now the only errors I see
consumers critiquing is there's no way
to turn off the active noise-cancelling
four times you don't want to block out
the outside world and for some people
who are more sensitive to ANC the most
QC 35s do give that kind of like an
airplane air cabin pressure feeling to
your ears also know Bose has always have
been a brand that offers the least
amount of features for some reason but
NFC is offered but there's no in-depth
app to adjust audio there's no lifting
of ear cups to pause your music there's
no touch controls but then on the flip
side again the most comfortable pair of
headphones on this list here again audio
signature is great from the factory
battery life is one of the best on the
market overall simply no gimmicks just a
great pair of performing headphones and
let me stress one more time here the
most comfortable out of the bunch these
are priced at $349 retail at the time
this video now last but not least here
number one on my list are the sony MDR
1000x if you want the bells and whistles
here get this particular model
these are Sony's flagship and active
noise canceling headphones they're as
comfortable as these Sennheiser PXE
550's but then your pants do slightly
warm up they do warm up my ears here
more than the Bose now from the factory
in general they're a more balanced sound
signature with a little more emphasis on
bass and mids versus the Bose QC 35 now
as stated in my verses video the high
frequencies are a little recessed but
with some slight tweaking with an
equaliser these things sounds as good as
the second place one on my list again
they boast QC 35 now with that being
said what makes this the top choice here
is for 50 dollars more than the bose
qc25 s again you get just an ever so
slight better performance and active
noise-cancelling it's not much but worth
stating it does black out a little bit
more noise again over the Bose model and
every other pair of headphones on this
list so far now like most other
headphones you can turn off the noise
canceling if you'd like there is an
abundance of features also including
sound profiles which can be switched and
the headphones themselves is a little
button on the side here another useful
feature allows you to place your hand
over the ear cup causing your music to
stop and the microphones will actually
amplify your surrounding so you can hear
what is around you without fully taking
off your headphones now touch sensitive
controls are on the side and they are
super responsive very similar to the PXE
550's battery life is still one the best
in the industry at 22 hours of use and
very last sony does offer audio
processing such as the digital sound
enhancement engine which takes
traditional audio files on your phone
mp3 for those very familiar with those
everyone's familiar with those and up
converts them to provide a higher
quality audio experience then there's
also L deck which is Sony's high
resolution audio support offering the
clearest audio performance that wireless
headphones can have so in the end here
the Saudis are not perfect either that's
why I believe that both QC 35 comes up
and comes in very close here but I
believe these sony / provides a slightly
better value for just fifty dollars more
retail and you get all those features
and the best in active noise-cancelling
performance even if it's my mute if you
go with bose or sony in the end you
honestly can't go wrong with either just
depends on you guys so let me know in
the comment section below which one do
you prefer which one is your favorite
ear I'm sure I miss probably some other
headphones on the market specifically
the Beats Studios I just simply haven't
tested those other headphones or the
