review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the Nabi 2 and before I
get started here if you can please
comment below on what you're planning
and purchasing your child for this
upcoming holiday season and hopefully
they've been good all year I'm just
curious to know and I'm actually needing
some ideas myself as well but getting
back on track here the Nabi 2 is a
tablet designed specifically for kids
and I have to say I'm really impressed
by this tablet I'm really shocked at
what it actually offers and its delivery
of content as well so without further
ado let's get started the specific model
I have here is the Nabi 2 for $179
retail this Nabi comes as a standard
tablet but is wrapped with this
beautiful red silicone housing which is
removable now behind the silicone the
tablet is pearl white and it's actually
hard plastic construction it's a very
strong yet durable product with no signs
of flex even a small touch of plastic
located here are raised so if your child
places this face down without the cover
on the screen won't scratch this
odd-looking metal plate on the back here
it's designed to mount accessories to
personalize this tablet to how to do a
little bit of research on that you can
purchase letters put pictures of ninja
turtles I think that's the going
accessory right now and also available
is a kickstand specifically for the Navi
the after mention can all be purchased
on the Nabi tablet website now moving
along here the dimensions are as follows
on the screen and the measurements are
with the silicone cover on and the unit
comes in weighing at one point three one
pounds so starting with a top of the
tablet here you have your valium and
power buttons and to the right
Navi including connections which some
adult and high-end tablets don't even
have there's your three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone port and HDMI
connection micro USB port a micro SD
slot for expanding memory up to 32 gigs
any outlet for plugging into the wall
charger now the very bottom has a
microphone and the very left doesn't
have anything at all now the front face
of the tablet has a 2 megapixel camera
that also records in 720p resolution and
unfortunately there's no rear camera in
regards to the quality it's not a
stellar camera but being a kid's tablet
it's definitely enough for them no other
notable features that we can't see in
this tablet includes built-in Wi-Fi to
connect to your home internet or about
in a Bluetooth 3.0 connection now
getting a bit deeper into this review
the Nabi 2 comes with a 7 inch screen
that features a resolution of 1024 by
600 and for my review again for a kid's
tablet it looks actually good the
resolution is almost identical to the
iPad minis resolution which is 1024 by
768 and that's a premium tablet now you
won't have the crisp images similar to
the likes of the Kindle Fire HDX or a
Nexus 7 but both of those tablets again
their adult tablets and they start off
at $229 and again this tablet is meant
for kids before I get into the apps and
software what also is important is
ensuring the tablet will run as it
should now if you're not the tablet runs
on Android more than likely the same
software that you have on your
smartphone unless you have an iPhone
though but Android powers this tablet
with a arm7 quad-core processor and a
Tegra 3 graphics engine so you'll know
the interface and experience will go
without a hitch
since its built on the foundation of a
solid program and from solid companies
Android is developed by Google and the
Tegra chap is developed by Nvidia or
some people pronounce it Nvidia which is
also well known and well respected
it's a graphics card company for both
desktops and laptops
so overall the tablet typing is
responsive video playback through
YouTube comm responds instantly and the
entire time I've had the tablet I have a
running across any hitches or hiccups so
if over odds have been a very smooth
experience so regarding its interface
and usability the tablets home page is
where every child will
start it includes apps and icons already
pre-loaded now the interface is very
simple and for a good reason of course
and there's mommy and daddy mode where
you can customize your kids experience
in your own as well
but I'll get into that a little bit
later there for you now the child
interface swipes like any other tablet
in which you'll eventually find apps
such as a camera gallery and some fun
apps in there as well such as coloring
and in a set of electronic drums now on
the following page the web app is
available a child can go onto the
internet with the built-in Wi-Fi now
what's great about this is the parents
are the only ones allowed to add which
websites kids can visit as you can see
on the screen only those displayed are
able to be viewed now as a parent let's
assume I'm allowing my child to visit
the lego website and needed to add that
website to this list now the tablet
prompts the parent to enter in their
password and at this time I enter in the
web address and then the title I'm just
going to call it Lego com
now the child will have access to Lego
comm ed to me as a parent it's much more
convenient to add what websites to allow
rather than providing an adult tablet
then entering every website to not allow
so moving forward here me genius
is an app that offers an array of books
that already comes with the tablet and
they're all read along children books
where a person reads and highlights the
words as your child follows of course
you can purchase more through the tablet
but again having 30 books already loaded
that's a huge plus again all free now
spin let's and I believe that I
pronounce it spin let's music and TV are
two paid services spin let's music lets
you hear sample music of every track and
an album and practically every genera of
music is available through the kids mode
only kid appropriate music is available
both for purchase and sampling and each
song is a dollar and 29 cents
and as for spin let's TV it's an
unlimited children's video streaming
service for only 2099
a month and they're all child's save TV
programs such as and this is from what I
can see in the picture here Paddington
Bear Inspector Gadget Madeline the busy
world of Richard Scarry and of course is
much more as well the next type of which
I'm a huge fan of is the chore list and
the treasure box and I can create a list
of chores for my child to perform and my
child will on a daily basis check it off
after they have completed that specific
task now in my opinion it's an excellent
and fun way to help my child learn
organization responsibility and
prioritizing and with this chore app I
can also customize the list and not just
use the pre-built ones what's also
unique is there's a reward system for
completed chores over time your child
will earn Nabby coins in which they can
eventually go to the treasure box and
exchange those coins for apps and other
fun games to play my child can actually
see the sense of accomplishment and
working hard towards a goal now the last
thing I wanted to touch base on before I
spoke about the education aspect of the
tablet is mommy and daddy mode now I go
into daddy mode which offers a main home
base for everything from adding and
removing apps by my own music now which
is uncensored and from my personal news
only to reviewing my child's progress on
her tablet now I can also personally
Skype if I needed to and there's a
separate web browser for me that has no
restrictions I can surf the Internet at
my own will I can always purchase more
apps to supplement my child's learning
as she grows through the app zone in
mommy and daddy mode the app zone also
shines by providing free apps for
download and there's a very good amount
of them to there ranging from just games
to additional learning apps again
there's there's free apps besides ones
that you do have to purchase so overall
as a quick overview mommy and daddy mode
does offer something to the parent as
well the only things that you wouldn't
be able to do like a regular adult
tablet is access Google Play or the App
Store so a lot of the adult apps won't
be available unfortunately you don't
have access to let's say for example
Shazam
Instagram or even the official YouTube
app and they will not be available but
again this tablet is designed for your
child it's not really not for you going
back to your kids interface all you
would have to do is click down that Nabi
mode icon and then your kit can be off
running with a tablet again and you know
doing his or her own thing so now
regarding learning and education there's
your four main subject areas to the
right math English social studies and
science now upon opening those you or
your child can select either their grade
level or degree of difficulty and the
content is actually pretty staggering as
well and I'll show it on screen what I
mean here we'll use 1st grade math as an
example after I select my grade level I
can choose a math topic here there's
seven topics in total and we'll just
choose the first one here just for
simplicity sake
and after that opens as you can see
there's 15 more modules or lessons and
just adding and subtracting alone so the
content is nice but most of the content
from my experience is dominantly quizzes
the teaching aspect is a bit lacking in
my opinion the example shown here is in
is with math as you can see you read the
one example provided and then you're off
taking a quiz it's the same thing for
science as well it's not too deep or not
deep at all into explaining in providing
reasoning for such topic now for English
you're provided with a paragraph and you
start the quiz right afterwards to test
your comprehension and memory and only
for social studies of video plays with
information to be later tested on with
quizzes provided now I look at this
first as a negative but then realized
the Nabi 2 is technically a kid tablet
and not necessarily an educational
tablet like the ones manufactured by
leapfrog I've also thought like any
other educational tool it's to
supplement my child's learning from both
school and the parents it would have
been nice to see more of a teaching
aspect or a lesson based program offered
but yet again there's
of course is built-in in so much more
content beyond that that's probably the
only flaw that I can think of in my
overall experience with this tablet it's
a very good kid tablet altogether
so overall the Nabi 2 is a very solid
quality built product with features you
actually see on high end tablets such as
a HDMI port to view it on the big screen
and expandable memory a good display
with a processor enough for a child and
there's just so much more that this
product offers but the one that is
missing is the teaching aspect I was a
little bit like I said drawn back by
that but again it's a minor downfall
it's not detrimental as a whole I still
believe this is a great tool and a fun
way to supplement your child's learning
well knowing as a parent there's
absolutely nothing on this tablet that
could get your child into trouble and
not only bad websites but the tablet is
not heavy on gaming and social media now
perks on the chore list and the treasure
box are truly a bonus as well so I'd say
this is worth a buy if you're in the
market for a kid tablet so that's it for
