cleaning up my gear Rebecca used for
work right across my pair of cheap in
your earphones that about two years ago
and now review some moderate to
expensive stuff on my channel and I'm
sure you guys like nice stuff like I do
but I like it when I run across crazy
cheap products that absolutely works now
what I have here is the noise hush and
x80
bought on amazon.com you can find a link
in the video description below to check
out more recent prices by the time this
video it's $11 so without further adieu
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room calm
welcome everyone to another reading the
earphones themselves are hard plastic
with a glossy pink coat as you can see
what 2 years worth of wear looks like
there's just slight scuff marks but
overall there's no paint chipping and
more importantly nothing becoming loose
the cable especially on cheaper
earphones tends to disconnect or break
off right at the end and time causing
the audio to crackle fortunately over
time the end do not move here at all and
the wires have stayed intact and as you
can see the noise hutch brand does come
with lay flat tangle free cords which
works out great now throwing these again
into my bag and squeezing this into the
supplied felt carrying case each time
when I pulled it out I give them a brief
shake and a slight pull they're ready
for wearing without much hassle now in
addition there's an inline microphone
which I'll demonstrate here really
briefly
sounds pretty clear it sounds pretty
much like you're almost on the phone
itself ok good
do you hear anything in the background I
do have a small little fan running to
hear that nope don't hear anything
nice no I don't hear anything
ok how about here do you hear anything
nope don't hear anything
alright and how about this side yeah I
can hear that it sounds like tapping
almost yeah tapping the water with the
microphone on it perfect that's it for
the test alright alright thank you again
bye
now regarding comfort the package does
come with four different sized ear tips
keep in mind these are in ear earphones
meaning that your tips goes inside the
ear canal and is required to stay snug
to prevent falling out now I personally
don't use these for working out as they
do tend to fall out or lose suction and
of course they are not water or sweat
resistance but I do use them throughout
the week when I'm working on my website
and youtube at Starbucks or listening to
music in general if I don't bring my
headphones and I plug these also right
into the PlayStation 4 controller for
casual gaming now from my experience
sitting stationary to just casual
walking these stayed in my ears
perfectly fine providing decent sound
isolation and minimal sound leaking - at
higher volumes now I do admit there is a
bit of sound travel through the wires if
you bump the wires above this why split
you can hear some moderate movement but
again if you're sitting at the desk
library again maybe in ps4 no problems
at all and now moving through the audio
experience this will obviously not sound
like a pair of $200 earphones but around
11 to 15 dollars now they actually do
really well I do admit the sound stage
to be specific it's not as open but
comparing to many other earphones at
this price range this does much better
these are slightly based focused no
we're close to the Beats Audio products
and just slightly above these
Sennheiser's bass boosting
characteristics the sound signature that
sin has it usually has these will do
very well for pop hip-hop and EDM of
today for casual listeners for those
just looking for a cheap pair of
earphones these will sound great to them
for audiophiles and those with a good
bit of experience and knows when maybe
bass it's slow too much there is a
little bit of droning here into the
mid-range just slight overlap of a low
bass coming over the mids are clear
though and the vocals does very well and
they are very much pronounced and the
highs are not tinning or ear ringing as
well it's a little bit of roll-off just
to prevent that from happening now with
cheaper audio products after even an
hour of listening your ears were
slightly tingling with these
surprisingly not at all never once that
I have listening fatigue with these so
overall from my experience for the price
for non audio files these will work
great the reason why I have these is if
I ever lose them I really don't mind
they are my pair that I carry everywhere
in my bag for work and while I'm also
filming in the field first
carrying around my $500 Wireless
Momentum's which cost a boatload more of
course but also much bigger to carry
around and I use those for more
entertainment purposes and strictly at
home
that's just me in my particular
situation but again reliability quality
build and also I believe sound signature
as well for this price range are all
very well done so this review helped you
in some way feel free to comment below
on any other earphones you think of
worth checking out and as always add me

scenes information that I personally do
