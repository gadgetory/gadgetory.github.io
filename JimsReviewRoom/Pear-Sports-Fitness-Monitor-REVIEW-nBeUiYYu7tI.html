review room today we're looking at a
company that takes fitness monitoring a
little bit different from the other
bands I reviewed in the past now I like
the polar loop and Garmin vivofit
mainly because they measure your heart
rate during exercise but with pair that
takes it one step further to be precise
pair measures and segments your heart
rate into different intensity zones not
only that but with supplied earphones
you have world-renowned coaches right in
your ear that's also monitoring your
heart rate in real time and telling you
when to push harder or when it's time to
rest but before I get real deep into
this review pricing is only $99 via
Pierce ports comm and other select major
retailers on the screen so without
further ado we'll get started
we'll go over the physical items first
and then get into the app and
performance afterwards now in the retail
packaging you do receive a heart rate
monitor earbuds and gel ear cushions and
the sizes of small medium and large and
last is a convenience carrying pouch
which I firstly store all these items in
here in the car when not in use now the
heart rate monitor itself is similar to
others on the market utilizing an
elastic band and snapping together at
the Bluetooth sensor in the front and if
you've never worn an HR monitor before
it's not bad it has to fit pretty snugly
to run that chest area but it's not
tight though and contacting and
confirming with pair you can use other
Bluetooth 4.0 chest heartrate monitors
as well if you have another one that you
prefer or feel more comfortable with and
the stride earphone themselves
surprisingly fits well and I prefer
earbuds as ear monitors but they never
seem to stay in my ear when working out
or jogging but the design on these are
very very well done preventing them from
falling outs
even when jogging and weightlifting now
after doing a bit of research the pair
stride earphones are sweat and splash
proof and features what they call the
surefire retention system which are used
by these special forces and because of
this developed design it really does
stay in the ear I'm really really
impressed by this the only nuisance
though I found that they're not true
in-ear monitors but actually sits
outside of the ear canal somewhat so you
can hear ambient or outside noises there
is some sound isolation though but not
100% but again overall from testing and
hearing the coaches in ear and listening
to music
they still performed very well now
during my testing I haven't encountered
any other issues that's really a big
factor here however as a word of caution
the wires do feel a bit flimsy with one
area slightly showing the copper wire
only time will tell the longevity of
these earbuds unless the air phones does
offer a button on the right channel here
which provides on-demand audio
information on your heart rate time
paced distance and calories burned etc
but more on that a little bit later and
the third and last piece of the system
is the free app for both Android and
Apple devices now what's unique about
this system it really calibrates to the
individual more than some other activity
buttons on the market but not only does
it take down the basics like age height
and weight
but prior to working out it's
recommended to calibrate the heart rate
monitor and polar loop and Garmin
vivofit does not do that now this way
the app and device knows exactly where
your heart rate levels should be during
your training and again providing in
real time over your earphones if you're
in that target zone or not now looking
at the homepage here the top provides an
overall total of your workouts distance
time and calories burned and again it's
the entire total the entire time you
have had this system and this
information can be broken down by a year
three months one month and viewed by the
week and with a pair system you download
workouts that are provided through the
app and many of them are actually free
but I'll go more into that a little bit
shortly here and before moving on I'm
wearing the chest heartrate monitor
during this review and it shows in real
time my beats per minutes on the bottom
right now clicking on workouts the top
review is any plan workout to have
scheduled for today training plans that
are available and last hour workouts
I've downloaded so far and ready to use
now clicking on get more workouts brings
you into the in-app workout store and
there's a large number of workouts that
berries to your liking and not only
running is available but also spin
classes on a bike to a focus on weight
loss two core training and with pair you
can even receive coaching for marathon
running but the biggest selling point of
pair it's all done and performed by
professional coaches and athletes that
prepare has partnered with and just for
validity looking at pairs website will
show you all their programs which a very
good number are free but also you can
see what coaches are available now I
know Jillian Michaels or Chris Powell's
not on there but you have athletes like
Leslie Patterson which she is the Xterra
triathlon world champion for both 2011
and 2012
Robert reams world a renowned fitness
expert in Caen and dr. Phil as the
show's fitness trainer has a good amount
of workouts available as well both paid
and also for free now during your
workouts Perrin uses your smartphone's
gps to calculate your distance and pace
and with the heart rate monitor it knows
how you're performing now Peretz off is
smart enough to read all this
information in real time and advises you
in your earphones to either pick up the
pace while running or when to drop into
different
heart rate zones from maximum
cardiovascular efficiency endurance and
conditioning again all based on
expertise from the coaches and trainers
now here I'll let you listen to some of
the information in real time so you can
hear the coaches themselves tell me when
I'm not performing as I should as a
motivator and as a coach to keep me on
track something other activity bands at
the moment don't do below our target
heart rate go ahead and pick it up a bit
current zone below one target zone one
good job that was a tough effort go
ahead and stop the cardio exercise and
get ready for your first core move
corkscrews you won't be tracking heart
rate during this exercise but I'll let
you know when you have one minute
remaining
and also when you have 30 seconds
remaining your first core set starts in
30 seconds ok go ahead and start into
your set of corkscrews alternating side
to side for the next two minutes
calories 51 note that you can hear
feedback information whenever you want
it by pressing the middle button on your
remote control now going back to the app
if you don't want to use a program
there's always free format in what you
can do at your heart's content and the
system will still log your information
for review and you can see on your
screen
beats per minute is measured in real
time and again what's important is your
heart rate zones everything is still
monitored as if you're doing a
downloaded workout and once completed
you can always go back to your main page
and go to history to view a map of your
jog in this case actually went on a bike
ride now the last few features here and
a top right of the app there's a
sprockets to change some of your
settings user settings allows you to
change your weight and over time this
will affect the workouts and
calculations that you would receive now
backing out and going through the
workout audio is a must since you'll be
wearing the earbuds while exercising now
as stated earlier in this video you can
press the side of the right earbud and
audibly pair will advise all the
information you've set from this screen
and going back here also includes
periodic stats where every five minutes
pair will advise certain information
that you'd like to hear again fully
customizable and contacting the people
at pair sports they did advise that you
can create your own workout on their
website
then you can view and download this
workout back at to your phone so in my
opinion the pair is original in its
execution and really does set itself
apart from other Fitness monitors right
in this price range
the only issue as mentioned earlier was
the wiring in the earbuds may be a
little bit weak and for some exercises
I'm afraid some people might not know
what a particular move is or exercise is
and although a video option is presented
there's no video to illustrate what
needs to be done at least on some
exercises or workouts some videos are
not present I had a look at these
exercises basically online and I wish
the accessories were also waterproof as
many of my viewers asked me about a
device that worked specifically for
swimming nonetheless it's still a great
and simple product to news though so how
this review helped you in some way

fitness bands I reviewed on my channel
