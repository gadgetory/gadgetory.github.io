you've been following me you know it
just finished up the Moto 360 second
generation review but it wouldn't have
gotten a good idea on how that performed
without testing one of its main
competitors I'm pleased to show you guys
the Huawei SmartWatch that I personally
paid for at the retail price of 349
dollars now this is the base model that
comes with a leather strap there's other
variations with metal bands in different
colors straight from the Huawei website
now when comparing to the competition
the base model is slightly higher in
price but after watching this video
we'll see if it's worth the extra
expense I'll also play some Amazon links
in the video description below so that
way you can check and what the updated
prices are today so without further
adieu my channel is here to help you
make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to gems review before starving
and I never do this I have to briefly
mention this has to be the most
exquisite unboxing of any product I've
personally done the experience of
opening a beautiful box the ivory color
and the unveiling of a shiny new
timepiece really provides a unique
experience it's far different from the
unboxing Bluetooth speakers on my
channel here and if you're buying this
have fun and enjoy opening this because
they really did put a lot of effort into
this aspect but going over the
SmartWatch now while we went with a
recessed in display it looks a bit more
modern I think a bit more high-end in
general but you can be the judge on that
the body is made of stainless steel
which surprisingly has shown some minor
fine scratches more so than a moto 360
despite wearing both watches for the
same amount of time fine scratches were
also evident on the polished chrome
parts which makes me question a little
bit on how the finish will hold up
wearing this long-term but overall from
far away and not scrutinizing the watch
style still looks amazing regarding the
leather band supplied although this is
the base model the quality on this is
one of the best soft and supple leather
les were than I've seen on other
smartwatches with leather bands and the
little details of the stitching on the
sides brings this all together but more
importantly this has been very
comfortable to wear although in photos
and in videos the watch does look huge
but the watch itself
surprisingly light it's not heavy at all
and the Huawei doesn't look big where it
looks unnatural when you see this in
person as you can see in the video I
have small wrist but the watch isn't
obnoxious in size of course I would
recommend you trying one on yourself
just to be sure but going around the
Huawei like most smartwatches the action
button is located at the natural feeling
2 o'clock position this button manually
activates the screen or puts it back
into ambient mode holding it down brings
up all the apps to use which I'll get
into details shortly and one more press
here with the same button usually brings
you back to your clock display rotating
to the back more smartwatches are now
including a heart rate sensor which I'll
test and demonstrate later in the
fitness portion of this video but while
on the back the Huawei features quick
release pins allowing you to use first
and third party bands that are 18
millimeters in width and for those who
are curious the factor bandwidth is the
same as the Moto 360 second generation
at 20 millimeters however you can see
where the pins are located here they're
shortened just a bit so just a heads up
on that but taking the band often
putting it back out has been very simple
in addition keep in mind that leather
straps are not meant to get wet from
sweating while running or being caught
in the rain but they watchface itself is
ip67 water and dust resistant and for
those who don't know that means that
this can sit in one meter or basically
three point three feet of water up to a
half an hour
I wouldn't swim with this but washing
your hands and showering with this would
be fine last regarding its physical bill
the front has a 1.4 inch sapphire
crystal glass display featuring a
resolution of 400 by 400 resulting in a
286 pixel density the screen is
technically visibly sharper than the
Moto 360 second-generation but being
honest in having them literally side by
side it's not easy to tell comparing to
other competitors on a spec basis the
Apple watch the Samsung gear s2 both
feature pixel densities a little over
300 but in the end the Huawei is still a
pleasure to look at the differences are
minut now while wait like most other
smartwatches features an AMOLED display
providing deeper blacks and more
contrasting colors to the eyes than
those without an AMOLED screen there's
only one drawback at least with the
watch that I bought here I noticed the
display isn't as white as the Moto 360
now sometimes you have this effect with
emiliya displays as evidence in
smartphones
I bring this outdoors in bright sunlight
and I know my camera isn't doing any
justice here but the screen is still
visible in person now one thing to be
aware there isn't an ambient light
sensor so the screen can't adjust
brightness automatically in different
environments for me I left brightness at
four out of five so walking outdoors the
screen wouldn't need to be adjusted does
this affect battery life I'll discuss
that towards the end of the review now
moving on to the user experience Android
wear is the operating system standard on
all Android smartwatches starting with
the main screen holding the screen down
offers an impressive 42 dials from the
factory however I did notice unlike
these Samsung gear s2 or the new moto
360 there's maybe two from the factory
that you can actually customize the
watch face where you basically select
your favorite templates change the
background colors and the clock hands
now although limited in that aspect one
the biggest benefits Android wear does
offer a very good amount of paid and
better yet free watch face dials to
download and use now if you're into the
more complicated sleek and modern looks
or looking for something simple and
clean too even something funky you'll
most likely find it still in the display
more smartwatches are now offering an
always-on display when the smartwatches
tilt it away from your face or the watch
hasn't been in use the Huawei displays a
black and white toned down version of
the clock to conserve battery gently
moving the wrist as if you're intending
on looking down at your watch does
automatically turn the display on and
for my testing this works very well and
at times when it doesn't the always-on
display or sometimes I call it the
ambient display simply helps but besides
the customization of different dials and
watch faces these smart features are one
of the biggest reasons why anyone would
even consider buying this over a
traditional watch you do receive push
notifications from your third-party apps
and you receive notifications from your
everyday services like Gmail hangouts
text notifications Facebook Instagram
etc whenever one of these things pops up
they do take about a quarter of your
screen here and you swipe up and read
your message or swipe right for the
message to expand or sometimes the watch
may review additional options such as
opening this on your phone or deleting a
message for example so I think from the
left to the right side gets rid of that
notification altogether now one of the
unique features is voice recognition
only when the screen is on not in
ambient mode saying the phrase ok Google
Earth allows the options to verbally
open up an app or
better yet respond to a text message the
voice recognition from saying okay
Google has worked very well and it time
to use these speech-to-text option
whether the language partner compared to
other voice recognition watches the
huawei from my experiences is considered
as very good moving on to the main
screen swiping right just like holding
that physical side button your most
recent apps are up top and scrolling
down reveals all the apps you have
installed besides having the benefits of
notifications you have media controls
when you use apps like I Heart Radio or
Pandora allow you to pause play and skip
your music there's also four gigs of
internal storage to sync some of your
music from your phone to your watch and
if you have Bluetooth earphones you can
listen to music right from the Huawei
now going back to the apps screen
swiping right one more time allows you
to select your most recent contacts to
send a text or initiate the phone call
from your phone swiping right one less
time allows you to manually use ok
Google or moving down there's other
random shortcuts that you can initiate
from there getting into the health
aspect while wait does tracker steps
through your entire day google fit is
pre-installed and you can utilize that
to track your daily progress and wow it
does have pre-installed again their own
fitness apps simply labeled as daily
tracking or fitness tracking in which
you can set up your step goals and see
your general daily progress or if you're
going for a run initiating the fitness
tracking portion here we'll segment that
activity now if Google fit or the Huawei
apps are just ok for you
there's always RunKeeper Strava and
other similar apps where you can see
your time elapsed step counts and some
other apps includes your pace distance
and calories burned but those familiar
with those apps on their phone will find
the app experience isn't as robust or as
detailed when viewed on the watch one
major example although RunKeeper does
have the ability to use heart rate
sensors RunKeeper doesn't utilize the
heart rate sensor on the huawei Ban same
with google fit you can initiate a
running activity google fit on the watch
will tell your phone to acquire gps
since there's no GPS on the watch itself
but once you start there's no heart rate
data being displayed in real time the
only time you have heart rate readings
is when you manually ask the band for it
it's not continuous there's no heart
rate zone training there's just not much
being done with that HR sensor on the
back at least for my testing here the
accuracy of the HR sensor is very
similar to my chest strap and my pulse
oximeter indicating that the accuracy
is really darn good now less than the
health or personal features there is a
silent vibrating alarm that you can set
up to go off once or you can set up
individual days when you need help
waking up without disturbing others
testing this the vibration is on the
light side and deep sleepers will most
likely not feel this waking them up so
stack from the factory and this really
goes for Android wear in general this
will work fine as an all-day activity
tracker counting your steps there is a
stopwatch if you need that if you do
intend on carrying your phone the pace
and distance can be displayed which is
highly beneficial during your runs but
features we see on dedicated activity
bands like flexi stairs climbed again
the heart rate tracking in real time
sleeping analysis they're just not here
a 10-day it's still predominantly a
SmartWatch and the fitness side of
things still has a ways to go if you're
more fitness focused last regarding
battery life I'm aware several website
states the battery life isn't as good as
some of the other bands on the market
but for my personal experience again
leaving that ambient display on and
brightness at four out of five
it wasn't bad at all take this off the
charger at 7:43 in the morning then
ending the day right at 10 o'clock at
night I still had 37% battery remaining
now if I'll have to watch uncharged
overnight
the following morning I'm surprised I
found that the watch still had 25%
better left then eventually the watch
died later that afternoon at 1:00 p.m.
and of course all this video is proof of
what I experienced of course the better
life does vary from time to time but I
usually got an entire day and a half
worth of life and worst case scenario I
needed to recharge the watch that very
night but regarding recharging in
general I was shocked at why we came
with this pin type docking station here
rather than inductive charging like some
of the other cheaper watches out there
putting on undock
although magnetized once in a while it
would not 100% connect or 100% align I
would have to wiggle it at just a bit
now second other watches allows for it
to face you while charging as it
displays the time a perfect nightstand
clock replacement but the while we
obviously sit on the table facing the
ceiling instead and recharging from a
dead battery to full takes about an hour
and a half
so overall is this watch worth the extra
$50 over the other $300 smart watches
and my answer for that is yes the watch
performs ever so slightly smoother and
faster than some of the other smart
watches out there and definitely a
little bit faster than the Moto 360
second generation the screen is sharp
enough for my taste
and the styling I do personally prefer
so far the huawei I feel is the best
overall SmartWatch experience despite
its own shortcomings that's until the
new LG urbane second generation gets
rereleased
those specs are ridiculous so that's it
