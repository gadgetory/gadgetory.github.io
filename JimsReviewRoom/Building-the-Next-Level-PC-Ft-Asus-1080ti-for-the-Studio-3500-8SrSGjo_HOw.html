broom I am hype for this computer build
this will be the first of several that
we're planning on doing from today and
into 2018 today's build will be an Intel
build used as a benchmark you can say
before you venture into different
processors and such now my last bill I
gave her the name of Forge as a metaphor
to a foundry where she quote forges
videos for me well this time around this
computer build were naming it Raider
mark 1 now as always I'll place my parts
list in the video description below
click on my affiliate links and they'll
give you the most updated prices in real
time so sit back relax and get ready for
another Jim's review room edits in 3 2 1
hey folks back with you so my last
computer case was from fan sex it had
tempered glass on either side I love the
thing I still have it today but it was
really dark inside the case so the main
theme of this build for raider mark 1
was to future-proof
everything and fill it with as much LEDs
as I could
so it went all out and I bought ACS
products so we can have their aura RGB
lighting sync with our other components
the Strix z2 70e gaming motherboard it
lights up there's an aluminium and metal
accents here that makes the board feel
premium looks premium as heck and
overall this motherboard game was
everything again to basically
future-proof ourselves now g.skill did
hook us up with 32 gigs of their ddr4
trident and z ram again real metal
accents used and inside each stick are
five individual LEDs that works with the
asus or a software now moving on the CPU
cooler were using the corsair h 110 i
I've used the H 110 version 2 in the
last computer Bill's been very happy
with it they're quick and easy to
install I also went ahead and bought the
Corsair HD 120 RGB fans in a three pack
to help illuminate the case a bit better
not fast on thermal takes RGB fans for
the time being though as the Corsair
models offers individual lights within
the fans casing so when the fans are
going it gives off this ray of light all
the way around that looks really sick no
less if you watch my last build I used
NZXT lighting strips and have no idea
what the hype was really about I kind of
fell into it I bought them but the
colors work displaying is what I
selected I'm a computer through these
software there and at times their
software was a bit glitchy as well and
since I bought the Corsair fans I went
with the Corsairs lighting node Pro to
give those a shot and so far they're
much more accurate and the biggest part
they don't disconnect easily there's a
huge problem with the end exp at the
time now for the processor I went with
Intel's latest the 7700 k i7 core
processor the processor from what I hear
is very easy to overclock but adding on
that core set of liquid CPU cooler
should help stretch this out a bit
further I'm aware what AMD is offering
but I surely want to save that for
another video now checking out what I'm
using for stores I've been using OCD for
a while they've been for liable
ever failed on me knock on wood here in
my last build I was using their 1
terabyte Rd 400 m dot 2 SSD and for this
build I'm using them once again here
since it's crazy fast and we're talking
about 2500 megabyte read speeds here but
besides loading games if we're ever
editing video work out here the RT 400
will get those cached files it files
nearly instant now besides using cloud
storage we do keep some physical files
backed up on hard drives as well we have
to 512 gig OC z VX 500 now the last two
items I want to save to the end of the
video it's my new 1080 TI and the be
quite pure base 600 case any gyms
reviewer in black and orange colors now
like the ACS motherboard and RAM sticks
the 1080 Ti is able to sync with the
other parts of the computer to display
the same color now all these components
including Corsair can display how hot
your computer is with green being cool
yellow showing warm and red being hot
pretty useful as I intend and
overclocking and rendering 4k here for
work or if I'm seeing if the system can
run Crysis 3 or slower IO my last EVGA
980ti had a feature where the fans
didn't spin when not under load and it's
the same thing here with our new
graphics card our new 1080 TI very much
silent now I'm pretty sure modes come in
place now with the modular straight
power 10 800 watt gold rating power
supply unit from be quiet
coupled with it be quiet case a system
again very quiet in general I do hear
the Corsair 120 HD RGB fans up top but
it is a trade-off who wanted delights
for this build so something to take away
from this go-around next time and for
sure getting some custom length cables
it is expensive but I think it's very
much worth it here I did the best that I
could and tucking everything away and
hiding it for you guys
but of course there's still some wires
that are showing that our of course my
OCD is basically alerting me telling me
I need to do something about it
also I want to get some 240 millimeter
RGB fans since I am missing one on the
rear so any comment section below let me
know what you guys think also I need
some ideas for the next computer build
please recommend me some crazy crazy
stuff I would love to see if I can get
them in the studio hope you guys enjoyed
this you guys take care and I will see
you
on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
