room I'm almost done reviewing the
iPhone 10 be able to look out for that
but during my time of owning this
there's been a bunch of news outlets
that are claiming that this phone is
Apple's most breakable phone ever proved
by their drop test basically and with
news outlets and other big sites Clemmy
even at a three-foot drop there's more
visible damage on the 10 versus previous
generations like this model that I have
here this is the A+ so retinal did
sponsor this video asked me to
personally test their newest drop
resistant case and they allowed me to
show you the actual test completely
uncut which I'll be honest I am super
super nervous about that they're
personally paid for this phone for god
sakes
now for team Jim's review and viewers
use my coding to videoscript' in down
below you get an additional discount on
top of their current sales that are
going on check it down below and see
yourself some money so folks welcome
back to another review
this is the mod case by wrench alright
fairly so this looks pretty simple and
straightforward but modularity or
customization is what makes this case
unique you can swap on the buns to
different colors I personally like the
black and yellow that's going on here
you can leave this as a bumper case and
still get the same impact resistance
leaving the rear naked you can swap out
the trim and give the phone an accent
color if you'd like now much love to
mkbhd but run assured you should have
given me some kind of like orange or
gold or yellow trim to match the Jim's
review room colors but either or the red
still looks pretty darn good now if you
don't want to go completely bare on your
behind it because it's modular you can
snap in one of their custom back plates
I do have their black and white marble
there's a clear plastic - if you're into
that but my favorites you've gotta go
carbon now last but not least before I
drop this thing into oblivion this is
the first set of accessories that
attaches to the mod case rattle shell
has created some very dense quality
lenses they screw on it with a metal
thread this isn't that plastic you look
closely here they're pocket size perfect
for traveling light ideal for those
vlogging or those who take Instagram
photos behind the veil you know whatever
it may be the lenses shoot some quality
images and you get to extend the
features of what your phone can
currently do now the wide-angle lenses
captures much more than these stock
lenses with the macro lens you get some
crazy close-ups of object
a magnifying glass and one of the lenses
that Rena sure offers is this fisheye
lens which gives you this effect which
is pretty trippy so alright folks let me
step out of this office here bring this
outdoors drop this right on concrete and
see if there drop protection is legit
I'm using their mod case of course with
tempered glass screen protector here is
a moment of truth folks alright so I got
the rattle shield case on my iPhone 10 I
also use the Rhino shield tempered glass
screen protector just in case to protect
my investment and do a very quick 3 feet
drop somewhere around my kneecap or so
and 3 2 1 oh man
alright so I don't I hope this is
protected here but here goes the front
of the screen do you see that look at
that and let's rotate to the back and
see if there's any compromises to the
phone here it looks good and there are
some little scuffs on the kids itself
but not a big deal because we're gonna
take this to the next level let's rotate
back here and let's see sometimes people
try to put their phone in their pocket
just completely just misses and it's
like holy crap alright let's take a look
at this and hmm look at that screen is
still perfectly and Ted does that look
good to you guys let's rotate into the
back look at that still protect it
alright let's take it one step further
now sometimes people are you know and a
crowd of people here some might bump
your arm it drops let's say you're at
the club someone doesn't like you you
know crap happens so you got it run
you're here let's take it one step
further so you have up here and you're
raving or something like that and then
just accidentally drop it oh this one
I'll be honest with you I am nervous
about this one that sounded pretty nasty
alright holy cow folks look at that is
that in focus for you guys I want to
make sure you guys absolutely see this
no compromises to the phone no issues no
screen cracks of course this thing's
still working obviously let's rotate to
the back and look at this holy cow so
guys this Rhenish on my case does do
what it claims this thing is awesome
this thing's has extra features from the
camera to customizing it to the way that
you like it guys check them out below

savings on board this holiday if you
