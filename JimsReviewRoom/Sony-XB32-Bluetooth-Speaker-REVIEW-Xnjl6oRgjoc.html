alright folks the LEDs are really cool
and I think they do look better but what
I'm really hoping is that Sony improved
on its audio compared to last year's
model we'll see in today's video folks
this is the sony xba-4 a hundred and
forty nine dollars but at the time this
video I have seen him go for one hundred
and eighteen dollars click on my
affiliate links down in that video
description below that will give you the
most updated prices in real time we'll
see if that sale is still going on I'm
Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you guys make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review so going over the physical
features first
I'm loving the placement of the LEDs
it's a subtle change but one that looks
a bit more modern if you don't like the
lights for some reason here you can
always turn them off and within the Sony
Fiesta Bowl app you can change the
colors to your liking you don't get real
in-depth color selection but they're
surely enough though if you want to
color coordinate let's say with your
room and such now physically the speaker
feels great
it doesn't feel hollow doesn't feel
plasticky and cheap the outside is
coated with some sort of thin silicone
or what feels to be this rubberized
finish the front is that fabric abrasion
resistant cover protecting the drivers
behind it
now speaking of protection soda claims
this to be dust proof and also shock
resistant perfect to bring this along
sandy beaches perfect for your kids to
handle they might drop this thing or so
but it's also waterproof with an IP
seven rating MIDI this can be submerged
underwater now with my testing this
thing does float though which is a huge
plus and it performs perfectly fine
today nothing has been compromised one
word of caution though the LED light
strip right here it is plastic if you
were to drop this on the edge or so it
does have the potential of potentially
breaking cracking letting water in etc
that's what happened with my other Sony
XP speaker that I previously tested a
while ago it's still functioning
perfectly fine today the drivers is
still pushing out audio but the LEDs do
crack the housing was perfectly fine
just want to give you a heads up on bats
now getting a closer look this is where
I was hoping Sony would have in
indeed the buns are cliquey and
straightforward but some of the
essential functions like battery level
indicator or pairing to another speaker
is hidden behind this flap right here
which I'll show in a minute now on a
positive note there is a live button
which alters the audio to give you a 3d
audio experience at least person√Æ will
be testing that a little bit later now
rotating to the rear under that
water-resistant flap this is where I
mentioned in last review I wish Sony
would have moved some of these features
or some of these buttons to the exterior
onto the front it simply just wasn't
intuitive but here we are again you can
turn off the LEDs with a button on here
you can also check for battery life and
it's awesome that it's a verbal command
or a verbal gesture no WP c stands for
wireless party chain where you can sync
any one of these speakers that have
listed on the screen for you guys and
have them all play in sync to the right
is simply the Add button to add one
other speaker just like the affer
mention you can play them in sync or in
this case you can have two speakers one
playing or both playing I'm sorry
in stereo sound instead now there's a
huge USB port used to charge your
devices think of the speaker working
just like a power bank micro USB in
which was really cool last year I love
that I can use any one of my phone
chargers card chargers what-have-you and
charge this thing no proprietary wires
the only gripe now considering we're in
the new year new model if you're buying
new devices this year USB see the newest
connection
the newest port is the way to
future-proof yourself you don't get that
here also there's no quick charging
capabilities now last but not least is
the 3.5 millimeter port for physical
connections now real quick battery life
is claimed to be up to 24 hours per Sony
but be careful this is with quote
standard mode and lighting off Sony does
disclose though this speaker can get up
to 14 hours with extra bass on and the
LEDs blinking away I did the latter test
and achieved 13 hours and 37 minutes to
be exact
now moving on let's get into the
features offered through their app the
sony xba-40 2 has party
booster assuming you need to boost your
party even further turn this on through
their app and now you can tap on the
front sides and the bottom of this thing
here to create rhythmic beats along your
favorite track of I don't know Taylor
Swift or something like that I don't
like a tambourine or so I don't know I
don't know who's gonna use this feature
but it is out there
another feature in Sony's Fiesta Bowl
app there's motion control with your
phone some movements can change how you
control your music or tapping on
illumination here you can make the
lights flash dim and such it works but
you have to have that specific app open
if you're in any other app it won't work
again now thread about this feature to
be blunt it's kind of gimmicky as the
fire festival and trying to keep this PG
for the kids but it is out there alright
Bluetooth performance whoa we're sitting
at Bluetooth 4.2 I'm not a specs mad but
I do like future-proofing myself
Bluetooth 4.0 is good don't get me wrong
but Bluetooth 5.0 is out there and a lot
of headphones earphones and speakers are
moving towards that way as well now
regardless I did test the Bluetooth
performance I'm able to cover about 75
that 80% of my apartment here my
apartment about 1,100 square feet and
for reference most other Bluetooth 5.0
speakers I'm actually getting about 90
to 100% coverage now testing this with
video on both Apple and Android is safe
to say I didn't have any syncing issues
as well so for video this is perfectly
fine I also confirm you can have two
devices connected at the same time I
have an iPhone and a pixel and can
simply press play on either device and
the XP 32 will jump to the latest source
no need to unpair and then repair which
is a huge positive for the speaker also
as a side note this speaker does handle
l DAC allowing you to playback high
resolution audio files to be upfront
it's meaningful to those who do own high
resolution audio if you're streaming
it's not a big deal but the option is
out there now let's get into audio test
please put on your headphones or
earphones to experience 3d audio sound
there's going to be a lot of samples in
this one since I'll be switching between
live sound and extra bass and such for
you guys here at last please find me on
Instagram or Facebook at Jimmy Lew
official that would
the world to me and of course like
subscribe and light up that comment
session with fire emojis
alright folks here we go alright folks
I'm gonna be switching between live
sound and extra bass for you guys so you
can experience what that 3d audio sounds
like a good time don't need promises
honestly no big deal as long as you can
show
and there you have it folks
audio recorded on my end and then play
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here to answer the quick question
does this sound better than last year's
sony xba-1 yes it does not a huge margin
but it doesn't sound as muffled and
recessed that's really about it as a
side note if you want a really quick
comparison video let me know down in
that comment section below this review
is more of a general review on what's on
the market instead of a one-on-one or
head-to-head but anyways for a midsize
portable Bluetooth speaker the Sony
Xperia x2 bass is it on the level of say
the Harman Kardon onyx studio for that's
usually plugged into the wall consumes a
little bit more power to get that extra
thump no it's not at that level but it
is it is on par with other midsize
bluetooth speakers there's a bit of
thump and punch and it does help quite a
bit
when you're enjoying Janos a pop EDM and
hip hop now is it the busiest portable
bluetooth speaker almost but not quite
as a pro tip if you were to put this
closer to a wall or a corner of a room
that rear roofer in the back helps
reflect some bass and improves the
experience most Janos would do
absolutely well with that but for those
who are absolutely nitpicky here and
noticed there's a slight little flutter
in the upper bass levels and very low
end of the mid-range it's faint but it
sounds kind of like air coming out of a
balloon it's minut but it's evident and
like I said you gotta be really nitpicky
to sense it now turning off the extra
bass does make this speaker sound quite
flat and that's always an option for you
as well the mid-range is indeed better
than last year's the bass doesn't spill
over as much and again there's less
muffled audio and Distortion a big
improvement in my opinion at first this
did sound a little reset for my liking
but go into the Sony Music Center app
and push the mid-range and if you want
the high frequencies up as well your
call and I think it sounds better vocals
and instruments in general are pushed a
little bit more for they stand out it
sounds clearer making this speaker much
more enjoyable the high frequencies
would never ear ringing or ear
stretching some roll off on the higher
pitched tones was Evan
not a bad thing if anything it was a bit
neutral for me but again that's fine at
least it doesn't blow out now the
interesting features was live sound I
don't know how well it translated in the
audio sample for you guys but at least
in person it sounds like it creates a
much wider stage you do lose a little
bit of a direct audio which some of you
may prefer but you do sense audio that's
originating from something a little bit
further away from just the two drivers
out in the front now which one do i
personally prefer i like the direct
audio instead turning off live sound for
me was a more impactful experience so
