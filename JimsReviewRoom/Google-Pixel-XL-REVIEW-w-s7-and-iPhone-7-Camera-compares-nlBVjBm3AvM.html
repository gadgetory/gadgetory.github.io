Jimmy with Jim's review room Google over
the years have been providing their own
line of phones usually manufactured by
reputable companies in today's case and
last year's model it was HTC now Google
phones have been known for a great value
and with stock Android as the operating
system it's a great experience now with
that being said they unfortunately
increase the price which some are very
shocked by to hear this time around but
Google is claiming to have one of the
best cameras on the market and some
unique features that would hopefully
justify its price I personally bought
this at the retail price of seven
hundred and sixty nine dollars with 32
gigs of internal storage I'll place my
links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices as of today so
let's see how this performs here and
show you my experiences first up video
sponsors do help me tremendously and
this video sponsor is from evolution
labs having me showcase their Rhino
shield crashguard offering protection on
a variety of phones while still keeping
the phone thin now to admit the pixel XL
is somewhat slippery here and if you
want to add a little bit more grip
without getting a full-blown case this
is a perfect option now what would this
be without a real-world test they right
I'll show the crash guard claims to
offer drop protection of up to 11 feet
high I gave it a shot and this thing is
seriously legit the proof is in the
pudding here the proof is in the video
check out the crash guard bumper case at
Ronald shield dot IO or in my video
description
I'll leave their link there
the pixel Excel offers a solid metal
body but on the back there's a touch of
glossy plastic which is an odd choice as
it started to show some faint signs of
scratches and where the fingerprint
scanner makes it return which works
crazy fast and the location feels very
much natural whenever you need to unlock
your phone you also have the ability to
swipe the fingerprint scanner and it
pulls down your menu options now getting
back to the front
I'm very bummed here that they remove
the two front facing speakers which were
found in last year's model but instead
we're left with a pretty big area below
which isn't really used for anything
again odd as it was such a unique
selling feature again on the Nexus 6p
now to speakerphone in my opinion is
loud enough and perform good enough as a
speakerphone but to be a bit critical
here if you're watching Netflix or
simply speaking with someone at maximum
volume the high notes the very high
frequencies do get tinny and sharp at
times now one of the biggest
improvements though that I've seen and
this is on par with other flagships on
the market today is that 5.5 inch AMOLED
display not getting too anal here about
the screen since my channel does cater
to the average consumer but the screen
does look great I personally enjoyed it
and the colors are very accurate now
because of that AMOLED technology used
it does provide deep blacks and
contrasting colors well not being too
saturated in sunlight the screen is for
sure bright enough it's not as bright as
the competitors but staring at these in
person a difference is very minimal now
finishing the physical features simply
there's two speakers on the bottom and a
USB type-c connection to charge your
device charging this is on par with
other devices and it ranges anywhere
from an hour 25 minutes to fully charged
to an hour and 40 minutes from a dead
battery then in regards to use my screen
on time performance was just under five
hours for more heavy use and my best
screen on time has been 5 hours and 45
minutes not bad considering I still get
a full day's worth of use and I'm a bit
of a moderate to heavy user as I do test
these phones as my work phone but
comparing to the Moto G or even the
Samsung s7 edge or they now recall note
7 6 hours was possible on those phones
sometimes even more if you're paying
around that flagship price at which the
battery performance was a bit longer or
better now if anything this was I'm the
average side or slightly above average
for today's premium phones now lastly
the phone is rated at IP
fifty-three water resistance -
technically explain this it's safe from
a slight water spray at a 60 degree
angle it's not ip67 which can be
submerged under water like the new
iPhones but to be fair the Moto Z LGV 20
are not resistant at all any note 7 God
rest its soul is no longer available so
it's not even an option for you at the
moment now what is completely missing
though is the microSD card slot to
expand your storage and to make up for
this missing card slap the pixel offers
unlimited photo and video uploads to
Google photos basically into the cloud
and they won't count against your
storage limit and photos are saved in
its original resolution the photos won't
be downgraded as long as of course you
take the photos with your pixel now it's
not a complete solution as apt another
downloaded content still takes up space
but unlimited cloud storage is not bad
at all now moving on at the time the
phone was announced Google stated DX
will mark a third-party independent
camera testing lab that I personally use
to compare my cameras and lenses before
buying DXL mark gave the pixel the best
score of any smartphone camera they give
it an 89 the s7 came in at 88 in the
iPhone 7 with a score of 86
now that sounds great but my channel my
reviews I'm focusing again on the
average consumer the ones that uses
everything in auto mode for simplicity
sake so here goes some samples here
please pause the video as you can be the
judge for yourself and see how these
pictures look to you and I'll just
mention some of the key pros and cons
here now first up Google pixel excel and
Samsung s7 indoors at the mall looking
at color saturation detail and clarity
now the s7 and pixel provides very
similar results here there is a tenth of
wormus on the s7 while the pixel Excel
appears to be a bit more natural the s7
however was slightly sharper now with
the iPhone 7 Apple is almost every time
that I shoot this it's a cool looking
image with the least amount of sharpness
now while they're in person to store
that use more yellow tone lighting
versus what looks to be a fluorescent
light in all of Apple's photos now next
picture here and starting with Apple the
photo doesn't look bad at all looks
pretty good but once you also introduced
the pixel excel you notice the pixel is
really warm in this case here and did
look a bit unnatural showing off Samsung
it was the perfect white balance and
again a bit
of a sharper image but flipping that
around here this time Samsung is much
warmer than the pixel is very very
accurate as shown here with me eating a
steak bowl at Chipotle no app on the
other hand offers a very cool look once
again overall between the pixel and the
s7 both throughout my tongue testing has
been performing very similar with each
other with Santa and generally providing
a sharper image every time and then
there are times Google does better than
Samsung as you can see here there's less
noise and the roof trusses up in that
corner are much more visible in
comparison now the one big issue that
I've noticed is outdoor photos aimed
directly at the sky now I was simply
testing the auto high dynamic range and
for some reason the Google pixel excel
here gives off this halo or green
glaring effect every time switching to
the other phones you notice there's
nothing at all another the last issue
that I also notice was low-light
shooting I can clearly see the pixel XL
shoots in a much slower shutter speed
and a built-in optical stabilization for
a nighttime performance isn't really up
to par with holding the camera as still
as I could letter gun signs and in
general images are not as sharp because
of these very slight hand movements
there's still a good bit of noise as
well or graininess and the image here as
well and pretty similar on the s7 but
the s7 is once again sharper now the
iPhone 7 it dipped from the best in
low-light but lacking a lot of that
color it to really make that image pop
now touching base on the front-facing
camera it's nice and super wide versus
Apple which is really close up and
narrow you can be the judge which one
you do prefer yourself but Pixar
provided a good bit of noise once again
here but still retain a detail while
Samsung although I have their beauty
face feature set to zero
Samsung smooths out the images my face
as well quite a bit to help blend in the
pixelation but again be the judge let me
know what you guys think is better in
the long run now very less I don't know
I'm dragging on with cameras here for
those who do record video this does
amazing the video stabilization is
possibly one of the best if not the best
that I've tested so far on my camera
here on my channel that is the closest
I've seen has been the s7 and the note 7
they should be on your screen right now
to compare for the time being and also
going up the stairs which include now
very stable both times with the least
jello effect happening I didn't bring
along my old LG v10 which did great in
the past but
two newer phones today these two have
them basically BP Samsung on the pixel
and here's the iPhone 7 it's stable but
you'll notice the autofocus or it could
be the image stabilization you see how
the image keeps going in and out here
now all three cameras have 4k recording
as well at 30 frames per second all
three don't have image stabilization at
this resolution but the video you see
now all have been downsized to 1080 for
your viewing now right so enough about
cameras here let us start talking about
performance and exclusive features as
always with Google they do come with
100% stock Android this is running the
latest Android you get 7.1 and like all
stacked Android phones it's seriously
fast now everything moves quickly really
if ever there's a hiccup the camera
loads much faster as well an HDR
processing doesn't take forever
like the 6p gaming and video watching
buffering is simply a slick experience
it is running the latest processor these
Snapdragon 820 one which Qualcomm claims
to be up to 10% faster than these still
Kirt Snapdragon 820 now also on board is
four gigs of ram for those who are
interested but overall with the stock
Android experience one of the best
processors on the market and again four
gigs of ram surely being enough for most
phones the average consumer will feel
this phone performs perfectly fun and on
par with the latest and greatest and
will do so for a while as well now
touching base on features I'll go over
the biggest ones here multi-screen which
technically isn't new as other phones
have offered this specifically LG and
Samsung but stock Android finally has it
I was able to activate this from their
secret UI settings but this should be a
standard feature coming soon I would
think so this allows for two apps to
open at the same time and it's claimed
to be any app not limited as some other
competitors have been countered again
this is still a work in progress but
hopefully later in the year this will be
a standard I want to include this
because I think it's such a welcome
feature finally it's here now next is
something so simple but I absolutely
loved it with most apps long press is
available similar to Apple's three touch
press and hold and a small pop-up comes
out for quick shortcuts now email allows
you to compose a new email to be sent
hold down messaging and your recent
contacts pops out same with your phone
icon with the camera prior to opening
the app you can have it open in selfie
mode or direct it to open movie
recording so you
have to fiddle with it later on and very
less Google assistant similar to what
the Google command could do before it's
an evolution Google offers responses and
suggestions based on the current topic
at hand as an example asking for movies
for the weekend and showing and offering
suggestions now with photos with the
assistant you can take it several steps
further bring up assistant and simply
say Doctor Strange and movie theatres in
your air would show up with the exact
times for you to select now quickly I
know the example it's a better
illustrate bring up Google assistant
tell to navigate to your workplace while
in the map bring up Google assistant one
more time here you can ask for gas
stations on route you don't have to
terminate your previous search to work
you can tell Google to use your previous
question and Google can follow through
again offering those gas stations that's
already predetermined on your existing
route so that's a little bit more
intuitive it provides suggestions the
answers based on your over conversation
or inquiry now there's no room for
improvement I do admit that I would have
Lightford to understand in water variety
of ways I'll be asking but in the end
this does seem more quote intelligence
than Alexa or Siri at this time so this
concludes my review in my personal
opinion performance wise it's great the
physical build is quality built the
camera does very good the better life is
average is slightly above average and I
do love the new Android features Google
assistant being one of them
and the exclusive pixel feature of
having unlimited storage space the
reason why I don't want to push out a
review out so soon I want to really get
a feel for it
after that hype ties down etc in my
humble opinion yes it's a great phone
but it just didn't feel exciting to me
for a similar price to other flagships
you have no tozi with moto mods you have
the LG v20 with second screen manual
camera mode with the replaceable battery
IR blaster and before they note seven
blew up the end screen the edge apps
iris scanner was great not to mention
the note 7 and iPhone 7 can be submerged
underwater to an extent for peace of
mind with Google there didn't seem
anything unique but again most things
that it does do currently it does great
as most other flagships already do now
the Android features will eventually
come down to other phones including
Google assistant of course and so
hopefully you understand where I'm
coming from on this here not bashing the
phone at all but in the end here let
know what you guys think down below I'm
really curious to know how you feel here
so thank you very much for watching this
video you guys take care and I'll see
you guys on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
