welcome back I've been hyping a lot of
PC related stuff on my social media
lately and if you're just tuning in I
have these soundblaster x85 in this
review today also the cloud revolver
from HyperX and there's some other goods
coming down to row two so stay tuned
but the headset that I have here today
this is a mid-level model and creatives
professional series of gaming headsets
it's priced at $129 retail but I have
seen them on sale for $100 even on
Amazon as always I'll place my link in
the video description below click on
that and the links will give you the
most updated prices today so without
further ado my channel is here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's reviewable
go the physical features the headset is
built pretty tough on the soft side of
things the headband up top offers that
imitation leather with just enough
cushion and plushness who healthy
reinforced stainless steel on the sides
here are rock-solid now the air cups are
actually plastic
despite the main part that most people
will see the outer part is made of
aluminum when you do go and put on this
headset here or maybe readjust them
during gaming you're grabbing those
metal parts and the headset for sure
feels very durable now during my stress
test and I know this is a bit extreme
here the headset stays intact there's no
cracking and squeaking here the headband
is very flexible but more importantly
after torturing these the headband
retains its firmness around the head
sometimes with cheaper headphones or
headsets they do flex or bend a bit now
there's only one set of ear pads in the
package however they aren't removable if
you ever need to replace them and the
air pass themselves are claimed to have
memory foam it did feel comfortable
though but it didn't feel somewhat gel
like as I would expect from memory from
that I've used that in other headphones
before but more my comfort test a little
bit later moving down the right ear cup
doesn't have any connections or buttons
but the left side has the port for the
microphone attachment which is fully
adjustable the windscreen is available
to help prevent any pops or heavy
breathing here although not the
prettiest and most modern looking
microphone taking the windscreen off and
using it bare there was only a slight
downgrade in microphone performance the
microphone by itself it felt like it
worked really well the foam does help a
little bit here but it's not marginal
here's a quick sample so you can be the
judge alright folks here's the
microphone test in the 85 this is
completely unedited I didn't alter my
voice in any way it does sound a little
bit nasally it does make my nose sound
like it's a little bit clogged even
though my nose is dry here but other
than that it's very detailed it's still
clear enough again for playing games and
of course you've just recorded my voice
as you guys see here I'm gonna take off
the wind muff right now see if there's
any kind of difference for you guys keep
it on if you are heavy breathing or if
you have a phone in our fan in your room
and it's blowing against you and blowing
right into the microphone it does help a
good bit if not keep it off and have it
look a little bit more modern I guess
hopefully you guys enjoyed the rest of
the review and before finishing up here
with the physical aspects regarding
comfort these weigh in about 280 grams
and with my experience of other
headphone and headset reviews usually
anything under 300
grams is comfortable enough for most
people oh there's just the right amount
of pressure to draw line here and at the
crown of the head wearing these for
several hours and gaming really no
issues whatsoever the ear cups barely
causes my ears to get warm here but more
importantly it doesn't cause me to sweat
or have hot ears afterwards and last
going over what is in the package you do
receive one standard court that is
detachable from the headset I noticed
the cloud revolvers from HyperX here
didn't have a removable core and so just
be aware of that if you're shopping
around there's an inline mic with a huge
mute button to slide up and down a
volume scroll wheel on the side and a
pause play and answer phone call button
now a second cable is provided and it's
technically an extension cable - used
exclusively for your PC unfortunately if
you use this on your Playstation 4 or
Xbox there's simply no connection for
your microphone so works but the mic
wouldn't now each chord is about 1.2
meters long or 4 feet in length so now
to the sound test the h5 is a very
balanced headset these are not bassy
so those love hearing the explosions
stand out or the son of a gun with a lot
of power behind it the h5 does not
provide that here however because the
base in true the rest of the audio
signature it's very much balanced from
the factory those who intend on using
this headset for a long period of time
long gaming sessions there's barely to
know listening fatigue whatsoever the
mids are pleasant where voice is being
very clear and distinct the highs
especially when jet engines row by in
battlefield 4 or loud screeches from
zombies or so it's not ear piercing high
notes are intact without going overboard
sometimes you get that issue with
cheaper headphones in general there's a
very good amount of detail provided for
a mid level headset as far as soundstage
the high-end model the h7 offers 7.1
surround sound
however the h5 which is what I'm
reviewing here for a mid-level headset
you do get a good amount of in-game
spatial sound and it does help
tremendously with the immersion playing
this with the division when you walk
around the safehouse and you have that
radio host on turning around provides
very good audio direction from behind
you in front of you you can hear the
host on the left and right audio
channels of course overall ours is
shocked from the surround sound
performance now the one less thing I
also tested here is the Sound Blaster g1
this is sold separately it's essentially
a DAC or an amp and once you pair it up
with the h5 headsets this does provide a
decent boost in audio performance
environment
sound that much more spacial the clarity
and distinctness is increased the bass
is improved a slight bit here but it's
not base your Bhumi which is fine for my
case here again if you want that
balanced sound signature for those long
gaming sessions so you don't have again
that hearing fatigue and the g1 also
confirms works with non-creative
headphones and earphones too now place a
link in the video description for more
information and a g1 sound card as well
so in the end if you're in the price
range and can get them for $99 even the
h5 is a great option with a quality
build simple design with no flashing
lights that mic performs well and the
audio signature again that's subjective
but it provides a very easy to listen to
detailed and clean audio signature so
