room give you guys a look at the beats
solo 3 wireless headphones from Apple
these things I'll admit looked nearly
identical to the last generation but
there's some new tech on the inside that
would be very interesting to go over
I personally paid for these at the
retail price of two hundred and ninety
nine dollars making this hippie premium
price point of headphones but despite
being expensive its equal to what Bose
is offering and is actually cheaper than
these Sony Huron I had reviewed several
months back what I'll do I'll leave my
links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time so
my channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room going over the
physical features first
they are literally identical to the last
generation the same layout was here and
as much as Apple has been pushing for
lightning connections surprisingly they
kept with a microUSB port which I'm
perfectly fine with I'll be honest with
you about that as I still have plenty of
USB connections around the house the 3.5
millimeter analog connection is not
officially dead just yet so we get that
here and then rotating just a bit you
have the same vibe up and down tapping
right in the middle right on the logo
gives you pause and play if you do hold
it down it'll give you Siri Google Voice
or s voice for those on Samsung as I've
tested and proven to work here now the
same build quality returns with either
the very fingerprint perm glossy
finishes or what I have here is a
special edition silver and white with
chrome accents looking amazing in my
opinion now the chrome accents on the
arms seems to be holding up well but the
beats logo has already started to show
some minor scratches from possibly being
in my bag or rustling against some sort
of fabric the arms are still reinforced
by metal and despite the entire outside
of the headphones being made of plastic
they still feel well made and pretty
decent in the hands here when handling
now during my stress test and keep in
mind beats are not like the very first
generation where we did see them fall
apart but I did notice some seams did
out here and to be fair they did snap
back and a little bit bummed that that
did happen I didn't see that on any
other pair of headphones that I've done
the same stress test too I did
double-check though and nothing was
compromised nothing was broken and I'm
aware this test is pretty extreme here
but seriously if you're not doing what
I'm doing which I'm pretty sure you're
not I'm certain your headphones are
going to last as for comfort right out
of the box they do squeeze the head
somewhat medium to moderate levels of
firmness causing my ears to slightly
warm up a bit for the first 30 minutes
but afterwards my ears do acclimate and
feel fine now there's no pressure at the
drawing thank goodness where it pinches
your head and then wearing these for
several hours straight thankfully again
no pressure or soreness at the crown of
the head was noticed either now I also
weighed these solo threes against the
solo twos and they both weigh the same
as well that would have assumed what
maybe a gram or two difference for Apple
finding some space to stick in their new
chip but I start talking about the
internals here the solo threes has this
new w1 chip inside give me some better
battery management the old Sola tooth
claims to get up to 12 hours of use this
time up to 40 hours as claimed
now I left this on at about 50 to 60%
volume and they played day and night and
I recorded 52 hours of straight use
which is insane and at 50 to 60 percent
environment it was plenty loud for
casual listening now an additional
feature Apple calls it fast feel when
your battery is low charge it for just
five minutes and you get three hours of
playback instantly now testing this it
does work and it's amazing when you're
in a crunch now because of the w1 chip
we're anticipating better wireless range
Apple features what they call a class
one connection offering connections up
to 300 linear feet with class 2 like
most other headphones on the market
including solo twos the range on those
are always around 30 linear feet now
it's at the range in my house here walk
from one side of the house to the other
leg this thing will go through several
walls and of course the first floor
ceiling and there's not even a hint of a
disconnection or distortion static even
the signals possibly the best net tested
so far and a pair of headphones and last
before jumping into the audio test sound
leaking wise when you are wearing these
and maybe on the train or in a cafe in a
quiet environment essentially the solo
theories performed ok there is some
I'm leaking you do hear the VOC was
pretty well especially again those quiet
areas so now that the moment you've been
waiting for the audio test first off the
solo2 wireless sounds identical to the
solo three Wireless so cutting to the
chase
if you're going to shell out another
$300 for beats and already have the
solitudes you're really just paying for
the crazy good battery life and these
signal performance of course that's up
to you if that's worth it leave a
comment down below if you're
anticipating on upgrading now switching
the old model with the new repeatedly
over summer songs I'll be honest I
honestly could even tell a difference
yet with that being said if you are
looking for basic headphones beats once
again provides that if you're a bass
head it hits deep it provides that nice
Rumble for hip-hop and select pop music
more bass than these Sennheiser urbanite
svey moto Wireless the Sony Hurons and
Sennheiser wireless momentum just to
name a few here but if you're that type
that enjoys a more of a balanced sound
signature something that doesn't sound
bass boosted you'll notice the upper
bass frequencies and a solo 3s and solo
to is of course someone gets into the
mid-range the upper bass frequencies
overshadows some leave vocals and some
songs now regarding the vocals and the
mid-range frequencies by themselves they
still do very well they're clear there
are tickle it and pronounced but again
once in a while you get bass levels
coming over and those select songs now
the higher frequencies performs well
without getting anywhere close to being
too sharp or ear tinging which is a lot
of discomfort for me a little bit more
sharpness would have been nice though to
really hear the details on the top end
but again these are truly bass focused
headphones now if you're listening to a
quality bitrate audiophile the
soundstage and these are impressive with
sounds being distinguished from left and
right to in front hand behind you and
then last regarding passive noise
isolation or blocking out outside and
unwanted noises when you're wearing
these they did really well it's not
close to active noise cancelling of
course but good performers nonetheless
so overall with all biases aside and all
some people dislike beads some people
love beats if you are looking for bass
beat headphones are honestly one of the
best choices for sure the bass may be
overwhelming for some even giving some
listening fatigue for others yet in
every other aspect the better life is
phenomenal the range is good passive
noise isolation is done well in a
soundstage is great the solo still look
really good with amazing finishes but
new have
are really putting out newer and more
fresh designs and I'm shocked Apple
didn't redesigned these are just even
updated these at all but hey if I'm
broken why fix it right so that's it for
