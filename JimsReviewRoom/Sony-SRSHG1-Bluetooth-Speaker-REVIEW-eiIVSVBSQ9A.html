Jimmy with Jim's review room so I just
reviewed the Sony Xperia sley focuses on
bass and one of the unique features for
Sony it was also water-resistant for
$150 it wasn't bad considering how loud
and how much bass it had but Sony just
released another series in their lineup
basically the sony srs hg one that I
personally have here now I personally
paid for this the retail price of $199
at the time this video but I'll place my
personal links in the description below
click on those links there and you can
get the most updated prices so without
further adieu I'm Jimmy with Jim's
review room and my channel is here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
you
going over the physical features first
the ACU one is made for portability
that's measuring at 8 inches from left
to right a little over 2 and quarter
inches from front to back and it stands
almost two and a half inches tall the
ha1 does weigh a little bit more than
most other bluetooth speakers on the
market more so than the Bose Soundlink
mini - more than the UE boom - and
almost identical in weight with the new
JBL charge 3 and when you do hold this
it's not a heavy per se but you do get a
sense of the speaker being pretty beefy
no construction wise the exterior feels
to be built well here with minimal and
reasonable amounts of flexing the front
grille and around the exterior it's a
smooth plastic that didn't provide any
grippy texture the buttons are very
tactile and in general the HD one from
my experience is a still a quality built
speaker capable of being stowed and
carry in your bag without any issues now
what we don't have here on the speaker
is water resistance unfortunately
there's no charge out port to charge
other devices
this isn't ruggedized or sand or dust
proof however what this does have and
going over the buttons and the ports
here this can work as a speakerphone for
your phone calls there's an extra base
function which I'll demonstrate during
the audio test there's of course your
volume down and up with power button to
the far right here but directly in the
middle you have NFC abbreviated for
near-field communication it's allowing
you to pair your NFC enabled phone just
by tapping on the speaker itself now
we're rotating to the back and this is
where the Hg one becomes unique and why
you might consider I'm getting the
speaker over the others
now this recharges by USB 2.0 which I'm
always fond of since phone charges are
everywhere these days
and since we're touching based on
battery performance here sony claims
this to have about 12 hours of battery
life which is ok but for the price of
the speaker I honestly was hoping for a
bit more these days now like all my
Bluetooth speakers leaving this on at
50% violin letting it play until it died
I was able to achieve a little over 15
hours of use again 50% volume now if I
were to leave it at maximum volume I'm
pretty sure our prior gun maybe they'd
12 hours that Sony is claiming
nonetheless it's still pretty on par
with what sony is offering now up next
the USB port to the right of the
charging port is used to plug the
speaker directly into your PC that way
you can get audio in that manner the
only issue that I noticed though
although audio is being pumped out this
speaker's charged light above the power
button doesn't
light up now unlike many speakers that
I've tested before that does offer USB
audio other speakers are charged at the
same time not here with Sony but moving
along a 3.5 millimeter port for
physically connecting your other devices
here and to the far right if you had a
second speaker you can have them play
left and right audio channels for
improved audio separation but here this
is truly where it really gets
interesting if you have multiple Sony
speakers compatible with the song pal
app available for both Apple and Android
your Sony speakers can work like this
oness brand where you can have multiple
speakers throughout the house play at
the same time or basically have a group
of speakers let's say maybe a set in
your living room play audio or maybe I
set in your bedroom and it's all driven
through your home wireless network and
because the speaker would be connected
to your home wireless network additional
features makes the hg1 able to play I
Heart Radio Pandora and other music
streaming apps and if you did have a
home network computer audio from that
computer would be able to be played from
there now the entire Wi-Fi aspect is the
biggest selling point of this speaker
and as a side note though the first time
attempting to set up bluetooth was an
absolute pain now I had a contact Sony
Support and they did advise me to simply
reset the speaker on the bottom here and
now the speaker pairs with bluetooth
fine and speaking of bluetooth the range
has been good as its competitors in
keeping a signal from one side of my
house to the other and having that
signal go through several walls so now
to the moment that you have been waiting
for here I'll play several songs for you
guys and I'll give you my verdict
afterwards
it was shadows
haha
Oh
Oh
how did
I am
and there you have it folks now sound
recorded at my end and then play through
your speakers are not the best depiction
of audio quality but hence my review
here
now playing the hg1 at casual to
moderate volume does really well
especially with the extra bass boost
function on you do get a deeper a better
sense of immersion as you can tell from
the samples now it's not as deep as the
Sony Xperia chiz heavily bass boosted
and cheaper than this model but again
the extra bass is a nice welcome note on
the other hand here when you do play the
Hg one at high or maximum volume for
entertaining purposes or maybe outdoors
the bass does go over into the mid-range
and impacts the vocals a slight bit now
the audio quality in general at much
higher volumes does become slightly
distorted due to the drivers just trying
to push all that bass out as much as it
can
now the mid-range from my opinion is
done good with some tuning though but
right out of the box it does sound
slightly recessed and it just doesn't
stand out as much to the average
consumer
now once adjusted though you would
achieve a mid-range that's much more
acceptable and to compensate the bass
the speaker's more enjoyable and I would
say it's on par with other good
performing bluetooth speakers now as for
the high note there's no ear ringing and
minimal hearing fatigue at loud volumes
and audio separation or the soundstage
basically again it's not a parent's just
like most other Bluetooth speakers but
again the biggest selling point though
is the ability to pair not two of these
to help with audio separation but the
ability to pair multiple speakers to
play at the same time now in the end the
HD ones audio is very good at normal
listening levels but if you're in need
of something for entertaining or using
this at higher volumes for the price
there's better out there now the only
reason that I would actually consider
this particular model here is if I do
intend on pairing other Sony speakers to
play around the house so that's it for
