Team Jim's we thank you guys very much
for bringing this up to my attention
folks were asking me to review the newer
phones and nearly every one of my videos
for the past two months and a lot of you
guys love them too so I reached out to
them and they were awesome
to send a review unit as always being
transparent I'm going to go over both
pros and cons here this is not a sponsor
to review my assessments was not altered
in any way I'll leave my affiliate links
down in that video description below
click on my links for the most updated
prices in real time you've never know
when these things might go on sale I'm
Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review so going over the physical
features first this must be the most
unique looking headphones I've ever seen
not only are they headphones but these
little nubs that sticks out and probes
your ears they're just like earphones
the design is all for the experience the
nerve phones have super-sensitive
microphones inside so once you download
the app you go through about a minute of
audio samples so the app can obtain your
hear to profile now when these
futuristic tones goes through your ear
your eardrum vibrates in the same those
signals to your brain so you can
interpret sound but the eardrum also
sends sound back out through the ears
well those very faint sounds that
obviously we can't hear ourselves are
actually picked up by these super
sensitive microphones built into the
headphones and then your own personal
audio profile is created through the
neuro phone app the expectation your
phone shapes the audio to your listening
style based on different levels of
sensitivity within your ear so before I
get too in-depth about the audio let's
go over the basics real quick I'm
already getting hyped up here about
these things but we got to go over the
physical features first
now the neuro phone the headband is
completely metal here with a little bit
of plastic up top and a silicone band
underneath build quality wise these
things are not going to break
considering it's one-piece construction
there's no hinges there's no rotating
arms and such these things are fixed but
because
don't fold flat or fold into themselves
it's a large footprint not to mention a
large carrying case
but real quick here the case itself is
story it comes with a magnetic latch and
lid and on the inside there's also
another magnetized holder for your
included wire and your tips like so it
works it's big but it's functional but
getting back to the headphones here
there are sliding adjustments which I do
love let me put these on real quick very
similar to those and these Sennheiser HD
one headphones as for comfort I've never
had pinching or sharp way down at the
top of my head and they clamping force
here is comfortable
the only negative and it's very minor I
do feel a little weight coming at 329
grams which is heavy for headphones you
feel it around the ears if I'm moving
out and about I'm perfectly fine with
the neuro phones if I'm sitting for long
periods of times at the office here for
example I do notice an ever so slight
amount of neck fatigue it subjective but
compared with the competition most I've
tested are technically lighter now my
biggest critique though I'd notice if I
ever bend down to like tie my shoes here
or if I go to pick up something or
moments I have my foot on my desk I look
down like this I've noticed that the
headphones do slide a little bit forward
here and especially when I lean back and
notice it pulls back as well it's a
little bit slippery now looking at the
inside of these ear cups here here are
those ear tips no I know it looks funky
but it's pretty cool think of these like
wearing earphones and then putting
headphones over them every one that I
tested this with at first says whoa
that's weird but I felt comfortable no
one ever said that it was weird and then
refused to continue wearing them if
anything after a while it felt pretty
damn good but a house here isn't this
the ear tips do not jam into the ear
canal like the most traditional in your
earphones if anything these super soft
ear tips here rests and seals the
outside of your ear canal last there's a
good bit of breathability and comfort
with no sweat issues the ear cup simply
don't heat up my ears
alright getting into features here neuro
phone went with a no button design
that's there's not even an on and off
switch which is pretty cool though to
turn them on
you place them on your head give it
about a second or two here and then
you'll hear them fire up and then a
voice prompting indicating a your
battery life basically
now with the no button design it's good
and not so good at the same time with my
testing they're highly responsive touch
sensitive areas on either side of the
ear cup and I do love this idea they're
customizable through the app as well but
the maximum amount of commands you can
give are basically for a single tap on
either side or a double tap on either
areas the not-so-good side though
there's simply just not enough areas of
contact if I sign vine up and down and
then skipping and then going back on a
song those four commands or actions are
taken up what if I want to add a bun to
pause and play I have to pick and choose
also if I want to adjust vine I just
can't hold down the touch sensitive area
instead I have to keep tapping the side
of the headphones to make it go up or
down last I noticed what I have music
playing if I need to adjust the headset
and granted you use these touch
sensitive areas to push them up or down
you're most likely going to trigger
whatever you have set that was a
nuisance and I am hearing the volume
going up and down right now but let's
take a look closer look at these ear
cups here near phones do come with a USB
a port and offers one cable to connect
these via USB if you want any other
connections such as three half
millimeter or a cable that connects
directly to lightning USBC and so forth
they do cost an extra twenty dollars
retail somewhat of an extra accessory
which sucks but these are one of the few
headphones that actually lets you
connect to a variety of devices more
specifically to those devices that don't
have 3.5 millimeter ports now the same
port is used to charge the headphones
folks at neuro sound are climbing up to
20 hours a battery life on these things
I did test myself at 50% vine with
active noise canceling on the results or
on your screen but before getting into
the audio test I want to touch base on
the internal features and experiences I
tested signal strength and was able to
get about 50 linear feet here with one
wall at the office before I heard a
slight crackle in the audio compared to
the competitors this is actually on the
lower end if you're planning on walking
around the house and have the signal go
through walls this might be of a concern
if you're standing close by with your
phone
not gonna be a big deal as a sidenote
you're able to pair with more than one
device which is a huge plus in my book
and also testing this with video such as
Netflix and YouTube on my Android phone
no leg whatsoever another plus their
phone call wise it wasn't the clearest
experience noise just within my arm's
length right here if I'm moving to stuff
around you play sorry about that but
we're picked up by the headset but
distances or basically sound in another
room the headphones did suppress that
quite well when in quiet environments
obviously that's where it work best but
still my voice was not crystal clear you
can say I've heard better sound leaking
is kept to a minimum matter of fact this
is possibly the least amount of sound
leaking of any pair of headphones I've
tested blasting is quite loud I can
barely hear these thing leaked that's
because of the earphones offering direct
audio into your ear canal and a second
layer of passive noise isolation which
are the ear cups themselves touching
based on active noise-cancelling I
unfortunately don't have a sample I went
to my first location to do the recording
got some video here for you guys and
because of the design of these
headphones they don't create the perfect
seal over my equipments so I couldn't
give you the most accurate
representation please trust me those who
have been with me for years they know
Jim's room are always there for the
consumer reliable reviews with my
assessment the nerve phones did
exceptionally well I also did bring
along my Sony 1000 excellent threes
which are the king of anc right now and
the newer phones it blacked out almost
as much as the best there with neuro
phones you can tell most of the noise
cancelling actually comes from the dual
layers physically blocking out the
outside world the active part of the
noise cancelling does assist and when
both are combined is truly something
worth mentioning and praising here
compared to the 1000x m3s you can tell
there's much more frequency cancelling
rather than relying on the physical
isolation aspect they're both headphones
are very much neck-and-neck just both of
them each one of them provides a
different experience so folks let's get
into the audio test here please put on
your own headphones or earphones as I'll
be using my binaural microphones keep in
mind this is my listening profile so
we'll be quite subjective but I think
there's going to be quite a few care
through risks might make out that I
think are worth experiencing last folks

alright here we go all right get ready
folks about a probe your ears give me a
second here
and there you have it folks like I said
before the audio experience will be
different for everyone because of the
unique sound profile for me personally
it's rare to have a memorable pair of
headphones like a really memorable pair
that has characteristics that just
stands out from the rest the near
phone's is one of them everything is
very very well balanced that not one
frequency range stands out too far and
there's not one that's too underwhelming
either my interpretation from my profile
everything is clean detailed if anything
highly accurate but that's not even the
highlight this is the biggest most
noticeable trait on these newer phones
it's the sound stage there's large
amounts of depth to my audio from
vocalist and the forefront and
instruments in the background at the
same time here maybe hearing one
synthesized beat on one channel while
the other channel plays a different note
nearly every instrument every beat is
separate and identifiable my experience
was simply high resolution and a wide
soundstage giving you the feeling of
something bigger around you it's
impressive
and again well the best for sure but the
headphones do get loud there for me yet
I've never experienced any listening
fatigue listening at moderate volumes a
little bit lower I can wear these for
hours and still have them very still
have a very immersive experience but
still know your numbness or exhaustion
since I'm somewhat known for an C
headphone reviews I tested this and I
can safely say these are similar in
character that is to the boast QC 35 2's
that's where it's a little bit more
accurate a little bit more neutral but
the details and the resolution is better
on these compared to these Sony's the
Sony's does great for certain genres
because it has a little bit more bass
but the audio fidelity compared to newer
phones and bose qc25 the sony was a
little bit lacking here so the air is
that I would really critique through the
listen experience was the immersion
feature within the
the concept is very similar through the
skull candy crusher 360s that I recently
reviewed if you're into that feeling
that sensation where the ear cups are
vibrating here honestly skull candy did
a better job although I can feel the
vibrations out of newer phones but the
audio was it's not a deep resonating
subwoofer like bass but it was really to
be distorted and didn't translate to
that big speaker in the trunk of cars
I personally at the immersion experience
and the lower end which was it sounded
great the last I wish to write on the
app as well right on the screen there
was a description of what my personal
audio profile means what do the colours
mean what does the extensions are the
long end details here mean to you from
my uncovering at the 12 o'clock hand ear
the signals that signals the lowest
frequency basically it's your base up
there and going clockwise or clockwise
for me here it moves up the frequency
spectrum where it sticks out is where
your ears are the most sensitive I get a
little bit more information for the
average consumer which from menacingly
help and I think also would further
promote the unique proprietary software
technology that neuro phone is using so
folks down in the comment section below
let me know what you guys think of the
neuro phones themselves you guys have
been requesting this hopefully this
review helped you in some way again
please support my work follow me on
instagram at jimmy luke official that's
my personal motivational account or if
when i found all this tacky stuff here
all these awesome features of products
it's at gyms reveal room and of course
like comment subscribe and those fire
emojis alright guys I'll catch you guys
on the next one enough of me saying guys
