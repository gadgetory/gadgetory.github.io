review room welcome to another review
now it's been a while since Samsung came
up with their Chromebook the last one
they made was back in knocked over of
2012 and for 2014 Samsung released their
most up-to-date system the model I have
here is the samsung chromebook 2 11 and
1/2 inch model it's priced at $319 and I
should be receiving the 13-inch model
pretty soon which is 399 dollars now
there are some new updates to the system
that seems promising and I'll see how it
fared out in my average day so without
further adieu we'll get started now
there's definitely a market out there
for those just looking for a laptop
computer that's also budget-friendly and
just does the basics without paying an
arm and a leg and with a Chromebook it
fits right in that niche now if you're
not familiar with Chromebook I suggest
watching my video what is a Chromebook
for more information on why it's
different from Windows and Apple now
back on topic here the samsung
chromebook 2 relatively stays the same
size and the thinness doesn't change
either remaining at 0.66 inches now the
weight just slightly increases from 2.4
pounds to 2.6 pounds on this model but
either/or in my opinion it's still a
very portable and light enough notebook
to carry but upon my first impressions
and also during long-term testing I
gotta admit
Samsung really improved on its build
quality when you first grab the
Chromebook the lid with the imitation
leather and faux stitching is very
grippy more than any other Samsung
tablet I've held that has the same
backing and the only other device where
I felt this secure hold and supple
feedback is the now old Barnes and Noble
Nook HD tablet to me it's a very
welcoming field that really makes the
Chromebook feel more expensive than it
really is but also providing that sense
of security when holding the
construction is much better overall I'll
be at plastic the chassis seems that
much more stiff and rigid with much less
flex the hinged lid is now more secure
and is as good as the other Chromebook
tablets on the market and sometimes you
get laptops that are just too sensitive
and while typing your palm hits that
touchpad causing your cursor on the
screen to move
that a touchpad to me seems very
well-balanced with just enough subtle
sensitivity to click on items and also
while tapping with two fingers it right
clicks now going over its physical ports
the left side has a full HDMI connection
to connect to your TV with a USB 3.0
port and power input to follow the left
side also houses a micro SD card reader
so you can expand memory beyond the 16
gig hard drive the crumble comes with
and it's unusual in my opinion that they
went with a micro SD card reader since
the previous Samsung Chromebook was able
to read regular-sized SD cards along
with other Chromebook manufacturers out
there presently but I think smartphones
are becoming more prevalent and I just
reviewed the smart camera by Samsung the
NX mini which also used a micro SD card
it's possible that Samsung is steering
the industry to using more micro SD
cards in general just for its size
convenience but that's just my
speculation am I in fear by getting back
on topic here the very front and rear of
the Chromebook doesn't have any
connections and the right side has a USB
2.0 port with a 3 and 1/2 millimeter
input for your headphones the webcam
gets bumped up to a 720p resolution
which is huge when compared to the VGA
webcam they were using previously and
you can see on your screen the left side
is the old model and what many
competitors are using right now into the
right is a Samsung Chromebook 2 now
again the screen comes in at 11 and a
half inches with a resolution of 1366 by
768 and I think we're all hoping for at
least a 1080p resolution and all the
Chromebooks coming out but sadly we're
stuck here though the screen is still in
no question good for a budget price
laptop that is and does what it needs to
do and as I've stated in my previous
Chromebook reviews for this price range
you're going to see this resolution
being the norm for at least 2013 and I
would assume companies will continue to
bring this resolution over to 2014 as
well unfortunately that is now moving on
internally Samsung uses its own develop
processor which is also found similarly
on their tablets
it's the octa-core exynos 5 which 4
cores
runs at one point 90 Hertz and the last
four runs at one point 3 gigahertz and
Samsung was nice enough to now include 4
gigs of ram as being the standard now
other notable features are wireless ABG
and Wi-Fi connections with wireless AC
which is the latest and fastest
technology soon to be available in a
system update / Samsung now in addition
the latest Bluetooth 4.0 is also
built-in to connect to all of your
Bluetooth enabled devices and Samsung
also claims up to eight hours of better
life and through my testing running
through what appears to be a typical day
of emails web surfing watching a Netflix
video etc real world testing yielded
just a hair above seven hours of news
and while testing the unit remained cool
with only warm when leaving this on your
lap so with all that being said
Samsung's performance yielded perfectly
fine for everyday casual news pulling up
email going out to Facebook browsing
photos went without a hitch watching
YouTube videos and high-definition
wasn't a problem
and Netflix ran smooth thanks to now the
four gigs of RAM I can open up a
reasonable amount of chrome tabs and
since our Chromebook operating software
runs through the web and not through
apps or files like your a traditional
smartphone or traditional computer you
can say testing the web browser Chrome
was most ideal now with 10 open chrome
tabs at the same time that's when I
started noticing just very slight
stutters but still a very usable
experience but when you get up to 12 to
14 tabs open that's when it starts to
become an unpleasant experience
now as for gaming it does run anything
that I've encountered so far through the
web typically web-based games are not as
3d intensive and demanding as an app say
on the tablet and I personally do not
recommend the Chromebook for gaming as
it's just very limited in content
compared to all the other computer
platforms available again if you're
unfamiliar with Chromebook I highly
suggest watching my video what is a
Chromebook to understand the positives
but also some limitations Chromebooks in
general possesses so to wrap things up
Chromebooks in general does have its a
lower though it's budget-friendly
pricing basically still allows you to do
what you cash Leawood on a standard get
more expensive laptop now although
Chromebooks don't allow you to download
and install programs the Google
ecosystem comes with some good products
free like Google Docs
to substitute Microsoft Word Google
Hangouts for chatting and webcaming and
the flexibility of connecting an
external hard drive or flash drive to
watch movies store photos etc now if
that's all you're doing is social media
typing papers watching movies and
listening to music to make powerpoints
and checking your bank statements and
syncing your calendar let's say all that
is perfectly fine with the Chromebook
and specifically with this Chromebook as
well now don't intend unprofessionally
photoshopping or hardcore video editing
on this unit or machine and so that's
about it there so visit me on facebook
or google+ for behind the scenes content
I hope this review helped you in some
way and if you have not please take your
time to like and subscribe to this video
for future looks to new products this is
