room consuming my review of some bars on
the channel we're going to take a look
at the clips our SB 14 this is the
flagship model with all the bells and
whistles in clip choose Wireless
multi-room line up this package comes
with the sambar and wireless subwoofer
and it retails for six hundred and
ninety nine dollars at the time this
video as always I'll place my links in
the video description below
click on those links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
you never know when these things might
go on sale so sit back relax as I'm here
to help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review
governor of the physical features making
sure this fits your entertainment center
the RSB 14 is 44 inches wide and 4
inches tall the TV I have and I'm aware
some will say it's small I'm trying to
save up my money for a really nice one
down the road here at 55 inches for your
reference now cliff is stating the
sandbar is perfect for TVs 50 inches and
bigger the top and rear is made of black
plastic the front is all aluminum and
looks absolutely amazing and very manly
with the dark theme of my studio space
aesthetically it definitely goes with
the Jim's review look the wireless
subwoofer also looks badass with a
brushed aluminum like veneer and feel
and on the left of that cabinets there's
the side firing 8 inch woofer which I'll
detail how it performs in the audio test
shortly but getting back to the sound
bar all of your buns are on the fronts
of course the supply control is much
more convenient to use but one thing I
found completely lacking is a via meter
adjusting volume levels up and down I
honestly don't know where I am and how
much higher I can still go I thought it
wasn't a big deal but while testing I do
miss that convenience rotating to the
back you can wall mount the speaker if
you'd like a mounting template is
provided in the box however screws are
not provided there are ample amounts of
connections with both analog and digital
sources such as the three-and-a-half
millimeter input and also the optical in
besides the physical connections for
your blu-ray Xbox Playstation etc you do
have bluetooth it works from 60 to 70
linear feet away from my smart phone
during my testing I also link this with
my laptop which makes it convenient when
I'm working at my desk and I want music
to play from the other end of the office
here either or signal story from testing
has been find now one of the biggest
selling features and why you would go
with this lineup the RSB 14 and the
models before it offers a Wi-Fi
connection the sound bar is linked to
your home network and one you can play
music from sources like Pandora Spotify
and Amazon music to name a few and I'll
repeat again the place offer your home's
internet connection not through your
phone and second if you were to purchase
other compatible clips play five
speakers in this case I have the RW ones
they also connect to your home Wi-Fi you
can have music playing different rooms
throughout their house very similar to
Sonos Wi-Fi speakers Yamaha just
reviewed had a similar setup I believe
both in Sony have Wi-Fi speakers as well
it's a much simpler alternative rather
than the old school way of hard wired
net running ceiling speakers to
rooms so let's get into the audio test
here I'll play several samples for you
guys this is purely the sambar for your
reference with no audio editing while
listening feel free to follow Jin's
review on social media
my turn
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded at my end and
then play through your speakers or not
the best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review here first up
considering how compact the subwoofer is
this thing packs a serious punch I'm
amazed at how clean and accurate it
sounds but as important it's very much
sufficient to fill up a large sized room
basis very much apparent when large
characters are on your screen walking
such as in this Iron Man clip here two
explosions occurring with definition the
mid-range with vocals is bright enough
in for vocals are 100% clear and
articulate considering the mid-range is
where the human ear hears most details
in the audio experience the detail is
quite impeccable from simply a sound bar
now faint noises in the background that
shell casings hitting the ground during
the gunfights
all add to the immersion to the RSB 14
offers I can say the same thing with the
high notes as well and there's no ear
ringing and ting unis yeah it's filled
with detail and resolution from my
experience even blasting the sambar at a
very high level the sound center is
still very much balanced within each
other's frequencies very high notes of
tire screeches the screams that jets
flying by all performed very well now
one area where I would have to critique
is the soundstage it does a good job but
I was wishing for a bit more one scene
in the revenant a voice in the distance
behind us rang out and we both turned
our heads in the studio looking behind
us subconsciously and not intentionally
it was seriously a surreal experience
this mostly occurred during scenes where
the audio Direction was absolute and
intentional now majority of other scenes
you do achieve left and right audio
channels distinctly but the spatial
awareness directional audio again clips
does do a good job but just a smidge
more in performance would have been
great I also tested the sambar
with music playback and the audio test
sounded amazing at high volumes you can
use the sound bar to entertain a large
area or for more personal listening at
high volumes bass mids and high notes
again did phenomenal detail punchy bass
clarity it's all there highly recommend
the setup so that's it for this review I
hope it helped you in some way let me
know in the comment section below of any
other sound bars you need me to review I
know several have requested for JBL and
bose so be on the lookout for those be
sure to support my work by liking and
subscribing if you haven't already done
so I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and
we're here to help you make that
purchase decision you guys take care
I'll see you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
