by Jim's review room today we'll be
looking at the Magic Bullet Blender /
mixer and the one I have here is the 21
piece Black Edition priced at $49 from
Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond now from my research
there's no difference in the motor with
the regular Magic Bullet and the Black
Edition and just as a tip as well I went
to Target in Macy's and they do have the
regular Magic Bullet there for the same
exact price at $49.90 and although Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond website didn't state this
item was on sale it actually looked like
it was a regular price but of course
check your local stores if you're
intending on buying so without further
ado we'll get started
so the only difference between the
regular and Black Edition is what you
receive in the box the Black Edition
comes with an assortment of cups and
lids in the box you receive one tall cup
one short cup for party mugs with three
matching lip rings two lids one shaker
and one steamer lid for either
microwaving your food or making it into
a shaker to twist on straw leads to
permanent straws one stainless steel
blade one ice shaving blade and one
magic wallet base which houses the motor
and lastly the 100 page recipe booklet
and all that equals 21 pieces so there's
a lot in there every piece in the box
except the motor and blades are
dishwasher safe per the instruction
manual the blades cannot go in as some
dishwashers may damage the rubber seal
due to the heat however for the cups and
lids just be sure to place in the top
rack only all cups are plastic and can
be placed in the microwave or freezer
another huge plus or benefit is the
convenience the cups provide if I'm just
making single servings the cup with the
handle as you see in the video
eliminates a need for me to transfer to
another cup or mug after blending
blending in general is very fast as long
as you don't overfill the container the
large cups holds 18 ounces while the
regular sizes holds 12 ounces now the
operation of the unit is very simple you
place in your ingredients into the
chosen cup then securing its content
with the bladed lip flip it upside down
and align the lid with the base the
Magic Bullet features a press down
feature where you can use the cups
control chopping or pulsing
ingredients you can also press down a
little bit further and twist to lock the
lid altogether having the magic bullet
continuously run personally I've been
using the magic bullet for a good year
now mainly mixing smoothies from frozen
fruit now for a good bit of time I use
this about probably every other day and
let's just say I was on a smoothie binge
at that time now as you can see in this
drink the smoothie is blended evenly I
always prefer a thicker smoothie but you
can always thin it out and just by
adding more liquid now I have noticed
any drink that you make this thing works
perfectly fine in for the more
health-conscious folks out there I'm use
to blend protein shakes on the fly and
yes all the powder in this machine will
dissolve and mix with the magic bullet
and Leslie cracking three eggs in maybe
a little bit of milk and pinching some
salt to blend makes the fluffiest omelet
you can ever imagine the omelet came out
perfectly whipped and beaten of course
you can add in a little bit more than I
did like ham onions cheese and maybe
some bell peppers as well overall this
unit when it comes to anything liquid
based this works great again I've been
using this for over a year and haven't
seen any signs of wear or failure now
other tests I've performed and as you
can see on screen I attempted the
Chapman grind to see what the magic
bullet is capable of I like putting
chopped peanuts onto my ice cream
however when I place peanuts into the
Magic Bullet the results were not even
on the first attempt I thought I just
held it down for too long and the
peanuts became too finely chopped I did
a second batch in just in case and it
yielded both whole pieces and finally
chopped nuts now I wasn't too impressed
with the chopping then try chopping an
onion and as you can see the same
results happen again the onion was not
sliced or chopped all the way and then
some parts were just too finely chopped
leaving a mushy consistency obviously
the magic Bowl isn't necessarily
designed as a chopper but on their
website they do claim the Magic Bullet
can so I decided to see if this thing
grinds I had a small piece of Parmesan
cheese block and decided to slice it up
and then put it into the magical after
pulsing the cheese several times and
then lock the cup in and let it run a
finally coarse finish eventually
resulted and use the same cup in place
to shake the lid as I mentioned earlier
and with this grind works perfectly
sprinkling
cheese the last test I performed was the
ice test which I do on all my blender
reviews the Magic Bullet does come with
an ice shaving blade now on the first
attempt I just use ice cubes only and I
filled it up to the maximum line now
once blended some ice cubes remained
whole some broke in half and the rest
were shaved into I finally course mix
now at this time I honestly thought I
was doing something wrong
sadly but out of self-doubt I read on
the directions that shaving ice the
supplied recipe booklet advice I had to
put in a little bit of water into the
cup as you can see the second attempt
now with water to help move things
around a little bit yielded the same
results unfortunately from my test and
experience it does absolutely great at
making drinks or in general blending
anything that's totally liquid it's
surprisingly a powerful machine that can
handle most items but the issue is the
chopping results that are not really
chopped evenly so if you're solely just
making you know or working with liquids
like smoothies mixed drinks or making
omelets the machine is definitely worth
it for only $50 but if you're looking
for a blender and chopper you might have
to look elsewhere so I hope you enjoyed
