room welcome back to another video you
guys basically asked for this one this
is the comparison between the J protects
threes and also the power beats three
that I have here my right hand so this
is going to be a very informal video
comparison video that is it's not
scripted I'm going to wing this
basically but let's get into this let's
get start right away with the power
beats 3 it is on the upper spectrum of
pricing it is retailing at $199 with the
x3s shocked to hear this when they first
announced it they're going for a hundred
and thirty dollars that's it and that's
retail that's not even the sales price
so it undercuts that very premium price
point by a pretty significant amount
currently these are sold out but what
I'll do is I'll leave my links in the
video description below click on my
links they'll give you the most updated
prices you never know when these things
might go on sale by the time you're
watching this video and also if they are
sold out if you're watching right now
you never know when they might go back
in stock as well but anyways um going
into what is included in a package you
get of course your small medium and
large silicone ear tips with the power
beats 3 it does come with one additional
flange design that house we going a
little bit further in ear but most of
the time when you do wear this I'm gonna
put them on real quick for you depending
on how you like wearing your earphones
this will impact your purchasing
decision with the power beats three that
I have on pretend this is the ear cut
I'm going to try to illustrate it for
you and this is the ear tip the ear tip
sits on the outside of the ear canal
actually inside that your canal like the
X 3s but I'll explain that a little bit
further but with the power beats 3 it
does provide very very conservative
passive noise isolation now if you're
running especially for those who do
CrossFit any kind of vigorous activities
even when I was working out in the gym
and I'm like clenching my teeth here it
does slightly lift off and it introduces
my surroundings my environment basically
and I can hear people around me now some
people especially those in the gym I
know you guys love to be immersed into
your music freaking get pumped to get
jammed out here and just get immersed
into your workouts
some people like runners and especially
cyclists they prefer to have somewhat of
your environment get introduced in for
safety purposes if you're running along
in the bushes
I mean running on the pathway here you
don't run into bushes
you want to hear if there is anyone in
the bushes that might sneak up on you
you know people might get robbed or so
just hearing your environment for safety
purposes before getting to the x-rays
again since I still have these on here
the ear hooks have this little metal
band here that is fully adjustable I
love this and once you put them on these
things do not fall off again they don't
provide that passive noise isolation
that in-ear feel but once they're on
they do not come off and you can workout
jog do some track work whatever it is in
the field now regarding the X threes I'm
going to put them on real quick for you
to demonstrate okay provide I'm doing
the under ear method in the review and
then thoroughly test it I did use the
over ear method I did use the foam
isolation ear tips from comply as well
that's applied in the package and I
still had trouble keeping those things
in with these here I know this is a
really quick demonstration but over time
I do especially my right here and
everyone's ears are subjective and I
just feel it about a fall off here they
they don't stay in the air too well at
least for me if you do go on my official
formal review you'll also see in the
comments section people have disclosed
that they do have a little bit of
trouble of keeping these things on
because these are in here when they do
stay in your ear they do provide
fabulous amazing noise isolation passive
noise isolation that is so that is
something to keep in mind another method
or another thing to work around here
this is just really minor they do
provide little Clips here I know you
can't see this the powerbeats 3 also has
a little clip here and we're going to
probably play the video from the review
you can shorten the length of the wire
to have it hug the back of your head or
neck here and prevent the wire from
bouncing around too much the x-series
I'll omit it is a little bit more
cumbersome to put on with the power
beats 3 it's already on that you can of
course take it off but it snaps on much
easier and it just basically pull up and
down and you can adjust it that way
again a little bit easier and the power
beats 3 other that these both are
water-resistant I sprayed water on both
these things no crumbs at all the power
beats 3 does have an exposed micro USB
port I sprayed water directly into this
I had no problems at all recharging this
thing of course these things are still
working today
again these both or sweat and also water
or rain existing
regarding the wires itself I want to
mention that when you are running if
you're not necessarily using that clip
to provide tension or shortening that
wire if the wire is bouncing around
while you're doing your activities you
will hear wire chatter what that wire
bouncing you're rubbing against your
shirt that sound is gonna be translated
into the ear tips and you will hear it
if you do have low enough volume when
you're listening to music same thing
with the X threes so there's really no
which one is better or not they both did
the same thing you can still hear wire
chatter through both of these both these
earphones support earphones do have
inline microphones as well they both can
pick up my voice very clearly which is
phenomenal but both still picked up
background noises you can hear
cars driving by if you're in a crowded
environment you will the recipient on
the other end of the phone call will
hear some noise chatter some people
talking in the background so just a
heads-up on that really know which ones
better or not it really didn't matter in
that aspect with the jaybird X 3s and
the power beats 3 they are both industry
leaders in battery performance but the
power beats 3 does have up to 12 hours
of better life I did personally test
this Apple is pushing hard to promote
their w1 chip which does promote battery
life I got up to a little over 13 hours
with this and then with the X 3s they
are climbing up to eight hours I did get
around there as well I can't remember
the exact number but prizes put on your
on the screen somewhere right there and
again both industry-leading if you were
to buy other sport earphones at around
maybe the $80 101 hundred and fifty
dollar price range the battery life on
those are anywhere from six hours seven
hours maybe it's very rare few that you
get some that or eight hours and it's
absolutely rare I think these might be
the only ones I could be wrong here that
are mainstream pair of earphones or
sport your phones that is that can get
up to twelve hours of use and also
because it has a w1 chip inside the
wireless signal is a little bit better
than these not saying these are anything
bad I can still walk from one side of
the house to the other have my phone on
the other side on the other side here
and the signal can pass through several
walls and the first floor ceiling and
have no problems with me listening to
audio same thing with these but you can
practically walk an entire field with
this and still have not have this thing
I'll cut out on you again that's because
of that w1 chip that's inside these pair
of earphones so this leads me to how did
these sound and which one do i
personally prefer which one might sound
better to you would be power beats 3 it
is base e earth then the x3 is the sub
base really gets hit and you really do
hear it it's pronounced with basic
tracks you do hear it then hip-hop some
pop song it hits that nice deep Rumble I
do like it for those particular genres
but at times for of course classical
instrumental some EDM or house music
where there are vocals you can hear the
voice or the mid-range basically
frequencies are slightly recessed now
with the X 3s they are not as sub based
focus as the power beats 3 but they are
very very bass boosted compared to a lot
of other earphones a sport your phones
that have tested in the past they still
have a lot more bass than all the other
ones that I've tested so far but again
it's comparing to the power base 3 it's
a bass boosted signature not deep sub
bass deep rumbling that roar these are
just more punchy if I can better explain
it that way now the mids are still very
clear it's very pronounced very much
forward I do like that sound signature
it's a little bit more bright but again
it depends on the genre of music that
you're listening in particular at that
moment but I over all I think for the
average consumer
they'll very very much enjoy the sound
signature that comes from the power
beats 3 the power beasley RX very very
loud as well the power or the x-rays are
loud as well but again I would probably
say if you want a little bit more
clarity but still light bass
get the X 3s and then of course then
consider if the fit will be the right
fit for you and then get the power beats
3 if you absolutely love bass of course
you can always tune this with an
equalizer a third-party app from the App
Store or the Play Store and then with
the X threes it does come with an app
the the app does provide an equalizer
which does fabulous it does wonderful it
tunes very easily from jaybird and of
course you can either increase the bass
or lower the bay
and it will probably perform very close
to what the powerbeats 3 has to offer so
at the end of the day um which one is
better as much as I like how these sound
these stay on my particularly ears a lot
a lot a lot better and again not just me
but look at my reviews look in the
comment section
many people say these do work for them
especially over your method but again if
you want a short bet and not and no fuss
at all the power piece 3 is probably
your better option so I hope this video
this comparison video helped you in some
way please shoot and like I subscribe if
you haven't already and follow me on my
social media at Facebook Twitter in or
Instagram and leave a comment down below
let me know what you guys think which
one do you personally prefer they're
both fabulous earphones I think it just
depends on the genre of music that
you're listening to and of course if
they stay in your ear those are the two
main concerns the power piece 3 again
stays in to hear a little bit better I
believe this is more well-rounded
regards to audio but again you can be
the judge let me know in the comment
section below you guys take care I'll
see you guys on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
