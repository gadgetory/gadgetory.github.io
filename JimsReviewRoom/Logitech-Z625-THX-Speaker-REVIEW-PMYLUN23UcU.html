room switching it up a bit taking a look
at desktop speakers today Logitech has
always made some pretty decent stuff
they sent me their z6 25 model for me to
review and if you look on my screen for
the time being it is their flagship
orbest 2.1 speaker system that they have
on their website as e6 23 model looks
nearly identical but it is cheaper by 20
dollars but I'll get into the details
later in this video and to see how much
of a difference there is as always I'll
place my links in the video description
below click on my links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
so without further ado my channel is
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
during over the physical features first
I'll place the dimensions on your screen
that way you can determine if they'll
fit right next to your computer monitors
for some others if they want to use this
with their gaming consoles and have the
speaker's sit on either side of their TV
keep in mind the right speaker has a
fixed beefing vga like cable that goes
directly to this sub woofer as the right
speaker controls everything you're
adding off switches their vibe and bass
level knobs are also on the right
speaker as well the left speaker on the
other hand doesn't connect to that right
speaker it actually connects directly to
the subwoofer on the floor now I'm just
doing our measurements of each wire to
help ensure your speaker placement will
fit to ensure the wires are long enough
for your needs
identity measurements and Logitech's
website so I did take it upon myself
here I measured it and this is with no
slack at all
so of course account for any kind of
bends or turns that's relative to your
particular setup of course pause the
video if you didn't get a chance to
write the numbers down now physically
the speakers are dominantly plastic and
they didn't look or feel cheap either
some chrome accents would have helped
quite a bit I believe I do wish though
the knobs would have had some sort of
rubberized texture or at least some kind
of groove to help rotate the vine knobs
a little bit easier but again that's
just me being nitpicky now on the side
of that right speaker there there is a
3.5 millimeter port for an assessable
input there and a headphone jack for
private listening now take a look at
that subwoofer very sharp edges are
rounded up beveled or rounded here but I
love how the girl the woofer sticks out
quite a bit you're giving it a more
beefier look that rotating that sub
mover to the rear all the connections
are here and this is the biggest
difference compared to the cheaper Z 623
model within Z's 625 which I have here
you have traditional left and right
audio inputs at three-and-a-half
millimeter jack my favorite on here is
of course the optical input here and
below that is to connect your left and
right speakers to these subwoofer itself
well the only thing I wish was included
and would have given this a lot of
praise was a Bluetooth receiver
considering how many are going Bluetooth
these days it would have been great if I
could connect my phone to this and play
music both these Z 625 and Izzy 623
models don't have bluetooth at all and
the Z 623 doesn't have an optical input
and that's basically that's basically
the biggest difference but everything
else from dimensions the size to the
amount of power output per logitech's
website it seems like both systems
at least appear to be identical in that
aspect so let's get to the audio test
here and then I'll give you guys my
verdict afterwards oh and be sure put on
some earphones or headphones to probably
get the best listening experience
we are
let's fight back
scanning countermeasures ready
let's kick his ass he's my friend
so was I
come on
now show them and there you have it
folks
of course audio recorded on my end and
then play through your speakers are not
the best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review here starting with bass
it's adequate and balanced that
definitely complements the speaker's I
was hoping for a bit more sub bass
considering that it does include its
subwoofer here for the very low
frequencies to be hit but what Logitech
offers is very much a well-rounded bass
signature hitting predominantly
mid-range bass frequencies without
distortion with logitech's THX
certification thx attempts to recreate
that tonal balance of what the
filmmakers find a production film sounds
like those looking for deep sub bass or
something with more booming bass might
need to look elsewhere now as we're
men's I very much enjoyed them being
somewhat forward not necessarily bright
but very clear and articulate although
using flat files during testing and
utilizing the optical port for the best
audio transfer possible I do notice some
fine details that present in music and
the sound stage is there though but it's
not as wide and open but for the price
range Logitech still does a very good
job now if you're not an audiophile I
would say these honestly performed very
well the highs are not pinging and ear
ringing and there wasn't any listening
fatigue presence from long-term
listening now using these four movies at
excelled in this area with offering
basic explosions and left and right
audio channels being a parent in this
case as for gaming the subwoofer does
help very much here with low frequencies
being hit again from those explosions to
musical scores to help you get immersed
into the game left and right audio
channels are very much apparent again
which is great in distinguishing
incoming audio yet the openness of that
soundstage almost that 3d effect does
good but having a bit more what happened
great if you're a competitive gamer
besides you would most likely be using a
headset a gaming headset that is anyways
overall the Z 625 I really enjoyed them
the bass isn't overpowering yet it's not
as deep as some may want though but I do
appreciate Logitech offering a very
clean response that's suitable for most
types of entertainments across most type
of genres where there be action movies
to drama from playing games like
Battlefield one to the dialog of Final
Fantasy and music artists from Drake
tomaron 5 for those with easy
6:23 again the specs look nearly
identical I haven't tested them myself
but those who do have them leave a
comment down below and let me know if
they had a similar experience of what
I'm describing today in this particular
review so that's it for this review be
