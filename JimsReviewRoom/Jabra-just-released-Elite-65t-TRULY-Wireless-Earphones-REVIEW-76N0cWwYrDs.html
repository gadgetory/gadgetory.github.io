room welcome back to another one of my
videos today we're checking out the
Jabra elite 65 t truly wireless
earphones has always been transparent
with you guys jarba did send this as a
reviewing it for us to test out for you
guys as always we're gonna be unbiased
here please watch the entire video for
both pros and cons prices are on your
screen but I'll leave my affiliate links
down in that video description below
click on those links as they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time you
never know when these things might go on
sale again on the Jimmy wood gyms review
room and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
going over the physical features first
these things are small and discreet for
truly wireless earphones is pretty cool
if you guys look at the video right now
you can notice that it doesn't stick
past my ears some truly brownness
earphones sometimes they look a little
bit gargantuan kind of unsightly as well
if you were to compare this as reference
the Beano II ate sandy Samsung icon X
2018 edition looks pretty similar in
size now these are all plastic they're
not made of metal they have this
titanium paint finish which I think
looks really good here but overall the
finish is very much quality made well
crafted the buns are very clicky very
tactile here and also very easy to reach
now these are IP X 55 rated which means
that it can take light water jet sprays
here the office with my little spray
bottle
we didn't spray the crap on this thing
and drench them and they're still
working perfectly fine now as for
comfort these feel absolutely great they
three ear tips included in the retail
package where it's perfectly fine during
running walking of course working here
at the office they've never fallen out
of my ears
I can wear this all day with no wind
fatigue whatsoever now going back to the
ear tips they provide excellent passive
noise isolation you put these on and it
blocks up a lot of your environments
forget about active noise canceling also
there's a very minimal sound leaking at
fifty to sixty percent in value which
was more comfortable casual listening I
even bumped this up to about 80 percent
valve which is starting to get loud for
us for these 65 T's and just testing
this here in the office barely anyone
could hear discern what I was listening
to awesome performance they're now
jumping into Bluetooth quality this is
one of the very few truly wireless
earphones that finally has bluetooth 5.0
which is absolutely great for battery
life signal reception etc now the test
is posting myself here at the office
with my samsung s A+ which does feature
Bluetooth 5.0 and I was expecting a
little bit more range basically but I
did get 88 linear feet before they
signal start to crackle from now that is
excellent if you're in the gym if you're
walking throughout your house it's gonna
be no problem whatsoever eighty-eight
linear feet is typically on the
high-end Bluetooth signal range but
because it's bluetooth 5.0 I was
expecting a little bit more on that for
most if not all average consumers idiot
linear feet through a wall or two here
at the office again it did but nominally
did absolutely great
moving on here still sticking with
Bluetooth signal I did test this with
movies a lot of truly wireless earphones
do have some kind of syncing issue where
you hear the audio but then the lips on
YouTube or Netflix is this going and
flapping away I did test this again with
my samsung phone here
no problems with Netflix no plan with
YouTube it is in sync one of the very
few truly wireless earphones that has
that feature or has that ability no
jumping into battery life these do claim
up to five hours with a battery that's
pretty much on the average of truly
wireless earphones it does come with a
charging case you basically stick your
earphones in here when you're not using
them you stow them away and while
they're put away are stowed away they do
recharge they go which is fabulous which
most truly rounds earphones do again you
get five hours on the earphones
themselves we tested this at 50% volume
and actually got 6 hours and 45 minutes
from full to debt again excellent in
that regards the case itself does offer
two full charges so in theory this gives
you a full 15 hours if you need it quick
recharging I'll basically put those
stats on the screen pause if you need to
if I'm going a little too fast next up I
want to talk about the speakerphone
phone call performance and quality
there's four built-in microphones into
these earphones altogether this is a
first I believe for truly wireless
earphones this is something that the
Jabra is really promoting here it does
pick up your voice crystal-clear very
audible it's one of the best if not the
best in microphone quality the only
issue there the only caveat it picks up
everything around you it's someone
that's ten feet away maybe a car driving
down the road there me walking through
doors to leave the building here it's
all picked up through the microphone in
a very loud audible fashion I guess you
can say now if you're in a quiet
environment this thing works
exceptionally well again it's one of the
best now the reason why has four
microphones all together on these
earbuds it's not only just for
speakerphone quality it's because I've
the very first truly Wireless earphones
to feature Alexa built-in I'm gonna call
her Alexa from here on out so that way I
don't activate your speakers at home but
using this feature it's very similar to
let's say Google assistance or Siri on
your smart phones those assistance works
great the commands work great the only
issue that I found here when I did use
Alexa is there was a slight delay the
Alexa feature was a little bit longer it
took like an additional second or two
and as the even has an average consumer
it's something that you will notice I
wish it was a little bit more
streamlined or a little bit more
intuitive or faster now touching base on
audio these do get loud and I had to
turn it up to about 80% Vaughn for the
average consumer for most people
actually 80% is not better all this will
be loud for you some people might listen
to it a little bit louder some people
may be a little bit lower now comparing
to some of the competition like DJ bird
runs or the boson sport fries those that
usually about 60 maybe the 70% vine is
equivalent in loudness at 80% for these
65 C's getting into bass these are more
of a neutral level equivalent to the B
note e8 so these do not thump or a deep
and resonating light DJ Berg runs but I
very much appreciated these because they
are more of a neutral sound profile
there's enough bump or thump that is
enough for most channels very evenly
well played it does not distort or
basically hinder the mid-range
the j-bert runs are very hard hitting
the bose sound support fries are very
deep and resonating cleaner based in the
jaybird runs but compared to these these
are more compared to those other ones
are a little bit more neutral now
jumping into the mid-range this is where
it does shine here very good quality
very good clean audio it doesn't have
the same sound stage as the two other
ones I have mentioned again the j-bert
runs or the bead or the bose sound
support freeze that is but compared to
let's say these Samsung icon X 2018
edition the Jabra 65 T's do beat them
they're the mid-range also does provide
more of a neutral sound profile not
overly bright it's not necessarily Reece
as well again more of a neutral profile
the high frequencies were never ear
ringing ear tinny and never gave me
listening fatigue no jumping into the
application it's pretty much
straightforward pretty decent here you
can adjust which assistant that you want
whether it be Alexa again I don't want
to activate your speakers that's why I'm
calling her Alexa but there's also a
Google assistant in Siri built-in as
well you do have an equalizer built-in
which does slightly tuned the audio
characteristics a bit it wasn't as
sensitive as the jaybird runs but
compared to a lot of the other
competitors either competitors don't
even offer an equalizer built-in and if
they do it's very minut here you don't
really get a audio response you don't
have much changes also you have on here
is the here through option or feature
you basically can turn on the
microphones and have audio in your
environment pump into your ear so that
we can hear your surroundings just for
safety or just for caution as well so
overall I highly recommend the dropper
elite 65 teased the reason being I think
they look great they're very much
comfortable the price point is very much
reasonable for truly wireless earphones
having the Alexa feature is a huge
benefit a huge perk I did wish that it
would function a little bit faster but
just having it in general is something
very much different compared to the
competition out there the audio
signature I believe was very good here
it's a little bit more a flatter profile
that's not a bad thing it just depends
on your preference alright folks so
