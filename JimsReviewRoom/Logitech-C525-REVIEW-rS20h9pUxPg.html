review by Jim's review group today you
have the Logitech C 525 now the purpose
of this review is to see if this $50
webcam is just enough for you in regards
to picture quality and audio quality and
some of its features as well now we're
going to compare this to the Logitech
c920 now that's logitech's flagship
webcam and this $30 more at $80 so is it
worth more just to pay for the flagship
webcam or is this just enough and save
those 30 dollars we'll find out at this
review
all right so with all my new videos will
blast through these specifications in
what I call the rundown so this C 525
webcam features a 720p resolution with
autofocus the webcam can take up to
eight megapixel photos there's a
built-in microphone with logitech's
right sound technology that features
noise canceling audio recording the
webcam itself can rotate a full 360
degrees and can tilt as well it does
feature a nice rubber grip to stay on
your monitor or lab tablet and lastly
the 525 connects via a USB 2.0
connection now software features include
face tracking and motion detection we'll
go into that a little bit later and if
just for comparison purposes the
following is what the c920 has that the
C 525 doesn't now the c920 comes with
1080p recording through a carl zeiss
lens it does have dual microphones and
it can take 15 megapixel photos and does
feature H dot 264 hardware decoding now
that helps with compressing your videos
in real time to HD so whenever I save my
file in the c920 add to my desktop it
automatically saves it to an mp4 format
now what they see 525
which is what I'm reviewing today when
you save it it saves it as a Windows
Media Video which is a WMV file
extension there so you do have to
sometimes convert it if you need to over
to an HD format which is mp4 so it does
take a little bit longer the c920 does
it basically automatically for you in
real time alright so we'll continue with
this review here now both webcams are
plug-and-play so once you connect this
into your PC computer it will
automatically download the drivers now
you do have to go to a logitech's
website to basically download the latest
drivers and then you have access to
Logitech software to do the video
recording and take photos which I'm
doing right now for you now in regards
to connectivity it is plug and play on
all windows-based computers now I did
check out lab sites website now I didn't
see any mentioning of it connecting to
any Mac products or computers so if you
are in
user if you do purchase it just be
advised it may not work for you again it
allows text website I didn't say any
mention about being compatible with
Mac's so that's just a word of advice
and that's for both devices to see 525
and also to see 90 which I have in this
review today now in regards to the
software features in the program and
stuff and I'll show you on the screen
here that you can zoom in tilt your
screen you can also have zoom functions
and there's also motion detection and
face detection as well I'll show you
that again soon but let's go over the
zoom factor first we're looking at the
525 right now remember zoom it in on my
computer here and it's about 15
different levels of zoom and you can see
how clear it shows up in my sadawa look
at it on my screen here so that's about
maybe halfway there and another half and
there goes 15 zoom levels for you right
there you can see how close they
actually got to my face and you can see
all the imperfections and whatnot so you
can see there's a slight noise or
distortion to the screen but it's not
bad at all to be honest with you I don't
think so it is still visible it's
actually not the best picture quality
but for that many levels of zoom this
you know being this close to the screen
it's not too bad but like I said this is
the purpose of this review to see if
you're able to live with this again to
pay 30 dollars less than the logitech
flagship webcam so let's go to the c920
right now in this look at that zoom
feature alright and there you go so let
me go into my other computer here it's
actually to my left I'm going to go
through the zoom functions on the c920
now there's four levels of zoom which
about a dude now who goes I guess the
first level second third and fourth so
that's pretty up close there you can all
probably see my imperfection a little
bit clearer on this webcam but let me
zoom out real quick here one two three
four all right so you can see the levels
of magnification there any c920 compared
to the C 525 so I'm going to do next is
also go into the software features
additional features that is which is the
motion detection I think it's a really
cool feature that they have here and it
is available on both devices both PC 520
to see 90 and I'll put it on the screen
right now for you I just want to show
you some of the features in the software
itself what I use to record the video
that you just see is click quick capture
here and for some reason it does take a
little bit of time just load up in my
opinion and I have a I seven processor
with 16 gives you a in a pretty decent
graphics card but and not complaining
too much but it doesn't Java yes but
here's the actual layout and the best
the actual video feed and you can see me
moving the spots around here you can
change your mics set the resolution like
I said I'm recording right out at 1080p
or at least I should be let's see I said
earlier the zoom 4 at 1080p it's only
one level and I'm just doing right here
at the Mac so I can go which is kind of
awkward but it is what it is if I go to
720p and I'll switch it over and I get
Prime but what maybe 4 levels or so and
with these buttons up here I can this is
a pan or zoom tilt up down left right or
so and unzoom back let's go back to
1080p as a switch shortly yep some of
the advanced settings right as you can
see right sound right light it just
basically means it's Auto sound and auto
light for you I left practically
everything on auto and default as well
and you can see my studies here that's
about it for this wants to record your
videos I mean there's saves they're
shown here you can get it your
containing folder your desktop where
would you choose to save it as you can
actually take photos with this actually
takes photos at 15 megapixels which is
pretty high for webcam pretty impressed
with that motion videos that's something
I definitely want to show you let me
close out an application or let me go
there make men do their concert and
motion detection is really cool
works like a security camera you
today and I'll show you right now how it
works and basically I mean you can you
have to have a pc out of course but
whatever
there's obviously motion the camera will
start recording for you until there's no
motion at all and you could have one you
can see my mouse here but the motion
sensitivity up on the upper right hand
corner I can change this so let me try
to move this box let's see you can see
the sensitivity moving up and down you
see that I just moved as oh is it
intruders trying to steal empty box so
let me try to turn the silent record and
show you what it does basically the
turnout in the mouth sets that motion
sensitivity a little bit lower and right
now it's active and asic see it's not
recording but let me just sneak in there
you know report and a snaps recording
you can see on the bottom left of the
software there's a five-second recording
on its back but as you can see it does
record it the worst phenomena I'm really
impressed you can you see if I don't
click this you know there has been and
record the audio as well so very
impressed by that I also thought about
getting some security cameras and this
is probably a cheap an effective way to
do it
I was having maybe I don't need 1080p
but I can definitely hook this up to my
laptop's thinking outside the window or
so very impressed very pretty
enthusiastic about that piece alright
folks so what I'm going to do now is
manually hold onto these webcams I'm
going to test out the macro performance
on each one of these webcams and just
basically by holding it next to an
object as close as I can into a starts
losing focus so I'll give this test the
macro performance
so either webcam like I said it's your
preference if you want to spend $30 less
and get the mid grade see 525 or you
should go over to the c920 I spend
another $30 at 1280 to get the seed 920
and you can hear my voice both of these
recordings are through the internal
microphones on each webcam so you can
tell about audio quality as well
now with the C 525 and EC 920 buddies
you can of course Skype chat webcam with
your friends loved ones across the
nation across the world whatever and
they'll still provide you know the same
features but in regards to picture and
audio quality I get past the point of
this review and I hope this helped you
out that's it for my review I hope you
enjoyed it and if you did you know shoot
me a like and please definitely
subscribe to my channel I'm doing more
reviews at a daily basis now and that's
it
um Jimmy from Jim's review room take
care everyone bye
