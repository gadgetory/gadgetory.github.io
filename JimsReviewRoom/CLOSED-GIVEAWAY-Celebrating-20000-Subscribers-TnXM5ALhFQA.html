giveaway of course and you know just for
me way say thanks to everyone and to be
honest with you in the background here
there's a bunch of videos playing that
makes no sense at all I have nothing to
do with this video just me I guess you
can say during my bachelor days hit when
I used to be able to travel there just
fell our videos just for just for a
background image that's all so I don't
know if you guys can watch that and be
entertained if you would like to do so
but I can't say thank you guys enough
there's just been a huge surge in
followers and subscribers and on almost
all social platforms as well Facebook
Google+ and Twitter and once I get my
new note for phone here on my new work
phone I'll be more interactive and you
guys pricey more spam from here as well
but with all seriousness let's get into
the good way real quick here and get
that out of the way and I now go into
answering some questions that you guys
have submitted in but to show my
appreciation in like every 10,000
subscriber mark I would like to do a
giveaway this time they'll be giving

very helpful in sharing my videos and
just respectful people's opinions damir

email as he is he still respects all the
people's opinions and reviews and I'm
glad you stayed on YouTube friend so
hope you guys a best of luck to your
channel there and just to finish up here
there's Sebastian from text century
which is a really good guy that's also
passionate about tech as well we've been
conversating recently regarding that
Apple event and whatnot but it's good
that he you know he gave me a shout out
so it's my time to return the shout out
as well and all their contact info is on
the screen it doesn't hurt to add them
as well and that's the thing about this
community people helping people and I
can't
more happy about that surround yourself
with good people and supporting people
so I guess that's another word of advice
I guess I can say and and the 20,000
subscribers currently there's no
question I can't mention everyone of
course but there's so many of you out
there that has helped and once again
it's all because of you guys you guys
make Jim's review room and thank you for
all that support so I'm looking forward
to a very crazy very busy holiday season
with tons of things coming out and again
just to remind you guys or for those who
don't know I left my job and started
YouTube full time last year mid-october
so this time I'm coming into Christmas
season a bit more prepared and I just
might start getting into the new
demographic the gamers out there of
course that's a huge demographic here on
youtube so i might start taking
advantage of that and i used to be a
gamer I don't have any more time with
that but like I said we'll see if I can
squeeze it in and like I said it's going
to be a test run for now until the end
of Christmas and if it looks good I can
tune in to next year if not then you can
forget about it but alright this video
is long enough again thank you for
everything for opening new doors and for
allowing me to give you these
opportunities just share more content
I'll talk to you again at the next video

care
