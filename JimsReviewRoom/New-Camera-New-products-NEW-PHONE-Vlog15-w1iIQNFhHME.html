room welcome back to another video I
know a bunch of guys had just recently
followed me subscribed and all that fun
stuff welcome aboard here these are my
personal videos let's keep in mind they
are not professional not even close to
what my reviews look like so please bear
that in mind but it's my way I'm showing
you guys behind the scenes and you know
hopefully you guys get to know me a
little bit more as well welcome back to
all the og members thank you for
following me all this time is supporting
my work glad to see your faces I know
you guys couple of guys tweeted me to
ask me where the hell I've been the past
we could see my hoes on a business trip
you guys missed that just a way and just
focus on work for a bit but I do have a
video blog out of that and that should
probably coming out probably out of the
week or two but jumping straight into
this vlog here some awesome awesome
updates first one for my computer build
and I'll show you guys and give des
updates later on that in this video but
there's a couple more sponsors that came
up and thank goodness they helped out
and it does how about tremendously with
my budget but with those savings I went
and got a new vlogging camera just for
you guys so that way I don't have to
hold of the cell phone anymore this is
recorded on the Nexus 6p the new camera
should be pretty badass so here it goes
I don't you guys probably know what
model this is right here but it's the
sony rx100 and let me just basically
switches camera from now on no more cell
phone recording hopefully we can record
on this bad boy from here on out so give
me a second
there we go know how does that look does
that look much better does it sound much
better to you guys hopefully it does but
i am glad i got this this thing has been
a beast I don't know if I'm gonna do a
review on it to be honest with you but
from here on out most of my blogs will
probably be on this camera hope you guys
enjoy so other thing here I'm seeing in
the camera there's painting ever since I
posted that picture up on twitter
facebook instagram follow me on there at
jim's review room if you guys haven't
done so already either facebook twitter
or instagram but you guys asked me where
did I get this and I didn't get it
anywhere actually I had a I bought a
canvas and then I sawed it down mailed
it screwed it back together and bought
some local art supplies and painted it
myself just so I can fit the headboard
and I'm see the guy focus on there so I
can fit the headboard and also something
that I wanted I didn't see any art that
dumb I saw the stores that I liked and
to be asked you at the store it is much
much more expensive so there we go let
me show you the actual board I did do
another painting out here give me a
second alright so here goes the original
canvas canvas with the original board
like I said I think it was this size and
I just saw the bottom of it and it made
it more of a rectangle and and again
like I said I just popped it up on top
of the head board but this is one of my
first paintings there should be another
painting down below you can I don't know
if you guys can see the screw right
there but then I used to have another
one right there but that used to belong
to my ex's and then of course we didn't
work out throw it away burned it
whatever and so I just got this lonely
fish this koi fish up here for the time
being I just haven't had time to do
another cameras down below but um I know
it's my creative side I when I did used
to have you know a little bit more time
those were some things I used to do and
that's pretty cool us you know hang
something up and say that's what you
made and it's not like the prettiest
thing in the world I know that koi fish
is that's one of my first paintings
that's not that great but you know like
i said it's something that you made and
I just put up in your house and you're
proud of it anyways second update our
third update technically third update
let me show you the other room and give
you some updates on that alright so i
don't know if you guys remember this
room i told you guys in the last vlog i
believe i was moving a lot of my
entertainment center into this old
office that I have back behind me tons
of boxes I call this the delivery
product room where I have things either
ready ship ready ready to mail back
ready to get rid of think with the audio
engines right there when I rotate this
way big screen got my lovely klipsch
speakers right there and just a bunch of
junk all around here I definitely
definitely need to clean it up and get
that going but that means the main
studio is starting to shape a little bit
so let's go to that room now all right
coach and here we go so again I used to
have that big screen TV and all those
speakers over in that corner that's been
removed and you can see the desks and
all that fun stuff start be set up I'm
going to unbox these for you guys today
it has been building up since I was gone
down here is a computer case the
computer bill that's going on that I
need to update and upload for you guys
once that's done building so there's
been tons and tons of stuff in the i'll
be on the studio and prior the rest of
my house are pretty jacked up right now
i like to try to keep things neat when I
do get busy it does get pretty crazy but
hey business is good things are just
going the right way and I couldn't be
more happier than that and I'm thankful
thankful so I'm not complaining don't
don't take it the wrong way I'm very
appreciative of everything that's been
happening but anyways let me unpack some
stuff for you guys and of course have
more updates along the way alright
alright folks so first up here I want to
show you my computer case that I just
got I have installed anything just yet
ah but this is from fantex this model
here is the evolved ATX case I'm pretty
sure you guys are well aware of this
this once this has won numerous awards
completely aluminum all around which is
awesome rotated to the side open up this
case for you guys the hell there he goes
and you guys can get kind of a look in
there very spacious so definitely suit
my needs here and again this is probably
my favorite favorite computer part it
just looks amazing snot your steel
simple square rectangle this has a lot
of personality a lot of character to it
and I'm sure functionality wise from
other reviews ring and watching a course
this looks pretty badass so it doesn't
put this down real quick but anyways
let's get back to consumer electronics
and I want to open up that for you guys
so let's start with these small boxes
first let's see what we got here alright
so my fault guys I just unboxed most of
the items here as you guys can see all
these empty boxes and then I
accidentally deleted the file so the
magic of unboxing items is no longer
upon us so get that out the way what so
that means I get a zip through these
products for you guys pretty quickly
here but anyways unboxing I know you
guys like that stuff so sorry about that
first up here is the bluetooth speaker
from arch here you guys have been
requesting for me to do a lot of budget
items budget-friendly items that is this
particular speaker the 8226 its water
resistant to water proof the reason why
I got this was it's a very very good
competitor I would think haven't tested
it yet of course to the ue boom and the
JBL Bluetooth speakers this should be a
rugged speaker for only 40 bucks and
hopefully we'll see how the sounds but
of course I'll throw it into mud just
like the only other speakers I do and
see how that performs so again that's
from our cheer another box that i unbox
earlier that you guys didn't see it's
just the i7 processor for the computer
build regarding to rest of the computer
build I want to say I did get to ultra
sharp monitors 27 inches
our srgb accurate 99 percent accurate or
so so that way hopefully all my videos
will be a little more consistent in
coloring and in all that fun stuff in
post-production on that I did have this
box over here and I started to unbox
this and then that's when I believe the
video so I haven't even seen this just
yet open up the top let's see what we
got okay so it got some headphones for
you guys you guys have been asking me
like crazy to review this one right here
the v-moda m100 wireless we got the vino
or bang &amp;amp; olufsen h6 i couldn't afford
the was it bh8 that was way way too much
money they're paired Zeke 2 point 0 and
a parent z3 point 0 for you guys so a
lot of these items you guys have been
asking for and you guys been counting
like crazy and all of my videos about
these we're going to be not even audio
related it's like fitness products and
you guys are like hey can you review the
like the parent Zeke is really really
popular with you guys been asking for
and I appreciate it I really i love it
when you guys do that because there's so
many products out there and I'm only
just one person you know I don't know
what's hot what's not I can't keep up
with all of its and when you guys
comment when I you know when guys enough
of you guys comments on it I could see
it and it does definitely bring it to my
attention I know you guys are excited
about this one anyways these are for you
guys i hope you guys enjoy the review
and those when they do come out um but
that should be coming down the road here
i also got this when i preorder because
you guys can tell or if I you guys seen
me on social media I didn't pre-order
the s7 i'm sipping show you guys real
quick here got this bad boy in gold my
first Gold phony can see already it's a
fingerprint prone got the sm for review
and like that when you do pre-order this
through best buy you can do get the vr
set i don't know if i'm going to do a
review on this considering i'm not going
to be biased in the review obviously but
um I don't know if this is really
catch on with society maybe not just yet
I feel for the time being it feels like
like it's a cool wow factor in the
beginning but after a while I don't know
if mainstream America is gonna really
adopt this wearing huge ass goggles it
reminds me of those pretty glasses I got
for my TV years ago and I I literally
worn them once just a test them for fun
but other than that I haven't I never
wear them and I'm looking at my windows
my bed I they're doing construction
outside they're installing google fiber
in my neighborhood and they're literally
right in front of my house we're not
digging up my driveway so I'm excited
about that but hopefully you guys don't
hear that audio and that's basically
about in here on that me personally
let's see how do I've been itching to be
asked you're itching to go travel hold
on all right folks are these sony camera
ran out of batteries i don't have a
second one so that is I'm list to
purchase later this afternoon but we're
on my nikon right now and of course I'm
I on a different microphone so it sounds
a little bit different so bear with that
but getting back on topic what I was
talking about was traveling in general
what I want to do what I want to discuss
was you know in my late twenties they
used to travel a lot domestically that
is and I thought in my early 30s mid 30s
I want to travel internationally just
see just to see different cultures out
there to see diversity to see how other
people live outside of our little bubble
here in America obviously I started this
business I had a kid as well so a lot of
that you know held off some things but
I'm a believer if you have dreams if
you're passionate about it if it keeps
you up at night you know follow your
dreams and don't get me wrong I'm still
going to handle my business here but
it's something that I always always
wanted to do but besides traveling
internationally that I want to do my
main topic what I want to discuss is
I've been seeing a lot of comments come
in on my vlogs especially of people just
saying how the vlogs have been so
inspirational to them that is
if you guys don't know just to recap I
did two two and a half years ago I did
leave my banking job i worked for
insurance prior to that I mean they're
all really in my eyes really good
careers it paid well but I just didn't
find fulfillment and joy in it and and I
left and I started YouTube cold turkey
with maybe 300 or 500 subscribers at
that time don't tell about two and a
half years ago or so and I'm getting
messages of people finding inspiration
especially you know a lot of you know
young kids teenagers something's still
in college some of young adults that are
saying that they want to pursue their
dreams whatever it may be there's a lot
of aspiring youtubers right now who want
to you know follow that track of a
viewership of success or whatever it is
that fulfills them in their eyes and
because of that it's crazy for me it's
so humbling for me to realize and see
that whatever I say in these vlogs I do
have a voice and when I started doing
these vlogs it was literally just behind
the scenes of just showing you just
telling you my trials and tribulations
it was never a rosy picture starting
YouTube from the ground and to get to
where it is today where it's doing
phenomenal not only just YouTube
although it's only been what two two and
a half years but for me and my personal
life it's taken a little over ten years
ever since college after college I you
know I've been saving up every penny
I've been working my butt off I've been
say you know I just been investing you
know in two different businesses and
just to get to a point in my life where
I feel personally comfortable I'm not
trying to get super rich or I think I
just want to be happy myself as one I'm
pretty sure everyone out there wants to
have you know has the same goals as well
but I mean with all that being said just
to get to the point I have been
seriously contemplating because of your
comments may be starting up a second
YouTube channel I can't promise on that
because it takes so much time it's going
to be vlogs just like this just really
cut paste and upload nothing fancy like
my gym's review room videos and I want
to make it into a motivational or
inspirational channel
and just show you guys talk to you guys
about the behind-the-scenes stuff and
that way I don't drown the vlogs and
Jim's review room just to separate them
if I can't do that like I said I'm still
leaning towards I can't because it does
take up a lot of time while I'm pursuing
Jim's review room while I'm pursuing
personal goals in my life while if I do
start traveling internationally and just
seeing I want to see these amazing
places too I want to share it with you
guys and I want to just show as an
example that I started from nothing I
mean literally I mean we're taught to go
back to childhood I had nothing we my
parents were the first ones we came to
America they were sponsored we didn't
have any money we couldn't afford a
babysitter so I would sit in the House
by myself at the age of what four or
five I mean social services should he
came but that we just couldn't afford it
but I grew up in the hood all the way
into college and after college I was the
first one out of my family to work a
white-collar job middle-class America
and then you know I literally worked my
way up the corporate ladder but anyways
that it's getting another video to be
honest with you but what I'm trying to
say is that the point of ginger review
room from the get-go was to help people
and i read i try to read a lot of the
comments that I see on the videos i try
to read nearly every comment that i get
on instagram facebook and or twitter if
you guys are active on there if you guys
have messaged me most likely i probably
responded to you guys already I get so
in how do you say i get so i get so lost
in your comments there we go that's a
good one I guess I get so lost in your
comments that you know there's questions
that you guys have theirs inspirational
comments that you guys say that you know
something helped you along the way in
life and I find so much gratification
from that I I feel like I get more
gratification from that rather than
producing you know good-looking videos
and all you know that stuff but I don't
know it I don't want to say that's my
dream right
now but if almost feels deep down inside
that that's where it's heading Jim's
review room first of all you tube then
Jim's review room was the foundation to
meet you guys and now that I have a
voice in this world some way somehow I
want to help people man I really do and
it's not it's never been about money
it's never been about popularity it's
even it's it's always been that one kid
that messages me and just say wow I want
to do what you do I'll say okay you know
it's not easy but then the following
month or even six months down the road
and I've seen these kids and you guys
know who I'm talking about the ones who
were you know messaging me they bought
their own cameras I mean they're
upgrading their computers and they're
taking the path of art and creativity
and you know what I have in mind the
person the several people that I have in
mind or actually in Asian countries
including I mean India is Asia
technically but there's a couple of
Indian kids as well that kind of like my
Asian family they they wanted my parents
wanted me to be either an engineer a
doctor attorney pharmacist especially
and I did start with mechanical
engineering very early on in high school
ticket you know pre-college classes and
eventually I said I didn't like it for
some reason I love cars I love cars i
love automobile but I just didn't find
passion behind building little trinkets
and parts to assemble in field and
believe me it's much harder than that
but I'm just saying you know in simple
simple terms and then I just kept trying
to find my passion and eventually it
grew and it molded and so for those who
don't know what they want to do for me I
didn't know what I wanted to do I had an
idea but at that time I mean YouTube
didn't exist for you to start up a
business I mean it was brick and mortar
there was barely anything online but
today you guys have the power to do it I
had the time didn't so it was harder for
me I think but don't get me wrong I know
you guys are tough to but
you guys have more resources i believe
today and that's just being honest
brutally honest there's youtube channels
youtube help websites whatever there's
just I just feel like whatever your
dreams are pursue them and aspire to
reach for them and I'm pretty sure you
guys will get there but anyways I
thought about it i'm contemplating on it
just something that's been deep inside
me for quite a while now excuse me and
i've been noticing it more now on
twitter instagram i've been seeing that
that influx of people just commenting
and just responding to what i post
finding inspiration through my work so
if that is something i can provide to
the world if I can help somebody I
really really really want to do it I
just have to figure out how during the
daytime I can I can juggle all this at
the same time so again this is Jimmy
with Jim's review them i know there was
a little bit deep there but like I say
was something off my chest no promises
if I'm gonna do it or not but you never
know I never knew James review would be
to this point today let's just say that
alright guys I'm Jimmy with Jim's review
room again follow me on Facebook Twitter
and or Instagram I'll see you guys on
the next one you guys take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
