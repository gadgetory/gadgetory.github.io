review by Jim's review room today we've
been looking at the AB Carver from the
company called perfect found at your
local Walmart for 30 dollars now this
item is also available online at
amazon.com
and it's the number one AB wheel on
there now this product does cost much
more than a traditional AB wheels but
there's some unique features on here
that might make this worth to purchase
so I'll test it and give you my opinion
on my experience now as a disclaimer I'm
not a fitness instructor or claiming to
be jacked or cut it might not even have
the best posture in my videos the review
is on the product itself and not me and
of course read the manual for
instructions and safety information and
using this wheel now one of the most
underestimated workouts are core
workouts what are the most
underestimated tools for overall fitness
is an AB wheel now if you want to find
out why core workouts are so important I
recommend clicking on the video playing
right now as I do explain why they are
so important in the gold's gym and we'll
review or find out my channel at
youtube.com slash gyms review room so
without further adieu we'll get started
now one measure to determine your core
strength is by doing planks now per
men's fitness calm the average person
can stay in this position for about a
minute above that you're usually an
animal above the two-minute mark now
you're a beast here I show you my
attempt at a plank and hold it as long
as I could until failure the key part
here is literally laying like a plank
and keeping your body perfectly straight
your elbows Bend at 90 degrees and
you're on your toes with your legs
together of course the video is sped up
so we can get to the product right away
and I want you to do this yourself as
well and post your times below in the
comments
now the ab cover is still a very simple
design with some added features the
entire outer construction and its
handles are plastic with two rubber like
strips running right down on either side
for improved grip and stability now one
of the cons right off the bat though is
after several uses the rubber-like
material attracts dust hair and other
miscellaneous things off your carpet it
doesn't look too appealing after a while
though however it is easily wiped down
with a damp cloth now a clear warning
label on the side of the unit advises to
use only a non-skid surfaces now my
hardwoods weren't slippery and of course
if you're using this
your hardwoods now be sure to rest your
knees on a yoga mat or something soft
that won't slide again read the manual
for safety instructions before using now
going back to the handles the
traditional wheels are perfectly fine
with it's simple straight foam grips now
these don't have foam grips but they are
like the rest of the wheel really wide
the contoured grips also gives you more
support and confidence over the
traditional wheels so a real big plus
there now just doing this in the knee
position I felt my hamstrings tightening
and keeping balance on the wheel I felt
my entire abdominal area from my lower
abs to my upper abs stretch and tighten
at the same time and even up to my chest
area where I've fully extended above my
head my arm muscles were engaged as well
to keep balance and especially when
pulling myself back up and over all this
type of workout has many compound
movements meaning I'm working several
areas at the same time and also
performed side rolls and just feeling my
side stretch felt amazing and this
exercise specifically worked around my
rib muscles it's one of the most unique
and amazing workout activities that you
can do and it actually feels good doing
so and one of the last features of this
wheel and what makes this wheel unique
to the traditional wheels is a winding
mechanism that provides a bit of
resistance when going down and also
support when going back up now as you go
further and stretch ahead the ab cover
winds up a spring inside and you have to
push yourself a little bit more in your
core and arms to fully extend now from
my experience I personally didn't feel
too much resistance and I was able to go
down nearly as easy as I did with the
traditional wheel same with going back
up and because of the support I notice I
didn't engage my abs and arch my back as
much so overall the assisted ADEs is
what I call it is there but it's not too
much there's not too much resistance
that a beginner to this exercise
wouldn't be able to use this machine and
the support isn't too much where you're
losing gains I do try to work out
several days a week and I actually still
felt results the next day I've been
using the AB wheel in general so yes AB
wheels including this one definitely
works non-reality this exercise alone
won't get you cut or ripped and you can
do set ups you know all the setups in
the world or roll this will several
times a day but without a clean diet
your abs will always have a layer
on top of them remember to eat clean to
get lean and use this ad cover to
supplement your workouts so overall with
its quality build wide wheel with rubber
strips the extra wide grips and a
resistance and support mechanism the ab
cover is worth it to purchase for $30 at
Walmart
now some locations do have it for 40 so
be on the lookout though it's still
worth a purchase considering the only
con that I noticed is the rubber-like
material did attract dust and hair now
with that being said the traditional AB
wheels do work is good so if you're
willing to pay more or desire some of
the features mentioned then yes you
can't go wrong with the AB Carver so
hope you enjoyed this review of the ab
cover by perfect if you have not please
