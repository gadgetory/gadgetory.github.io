review room I've been saying it for a
long time but I've always wanted to
showcase clothing and accessories in the
channel just to help consumers looking
for fashion ideas and inspiration not
just consumer electronics it is
something that I personally have an
interest in and always wanted to share
and hopefully one day with messenger
bags and just maybe shoes who later down
the road will see how these first
several videos go first now to start off
I've always been aware of the name
Lululemon thinking that they were only
yoga clothing exclusively for females
but that's not the case
after watching youtubers that I
personally follow and look up to I was
shocked to find Christian guzm√°n
shopping and wearing the brand and maybe
someone more popular that you may know
of its Casey nice that he wears the same
or similar shirt that I have here it's
the metal vent tech short sleeve and
Heather black now as you guys know and
you guys who do follow me I'm in the
studio or office majority of the day I
try to get outdoors when I have some
free time for the fresh air and of
course to engage my body a bit and it's
been hot as hell here in the States and
the metal vent shirt it does do justice
it's crazy lightweight very breathable
especially for those who do sweat a lot
and I think aesthetically it looks
badass I don't have a huge physique and
I unfortunately don't go to the gym as
often as I like
but compared to regular t-shirts and
some other athletic apparel Lulu looks
to taper just in the right areas and
give that perfect length as well the
shirt is long enough for those who are
active with sports and workouts
requiring lifting the arms above the
head exposing your stomach or back yet I
can see some would consider it a little
bit too long so just be aware of that on
the back you'll see their design
techniques they used and not just for
show but Kiara's will have bigger
perforations to allow more airflow you
can see this on the upper back the
armpit areas here and some on the chest
as well now I definitely could wear this
and I do wear this actually when I'm not
working out it's a blend of looking
somewhat athletic but not overly done
you can actually wear this pretty
casually overall really pleased with how
it performs and also the design I also
pair this shirt with my express Kingston
jeans boot
with a slightly faded look on the front
but going back to the shirt here helping
consumers out this is machine washable
placing this on a delicate cycle is a
must and air dry is highly recommended
with avoiding any fabric softeners so
far after wearing and washing the six
times I personally haven't had any
issues and the fabric is holding up
despite being quite thin for comforts
sake and that is my only concern at the
moment that I have with this fabric it's
just thin if you do happen to work out
several times a week and wash it that
many times not sure how it would hold up
in the long run however every time I've
dealt with Lululemon I don't tell them
that I'm a reviewer either at the store
or through their online help but they
all have said the same thing that they
stand behind their product and if
anything wrong happens either a tear of
the shirts do stretch although they're
not supposed to they said that they'll
take it back any time
so it's reassuring to know that you're
paying a high price for these items and
it does come with peace of mind so I
hope this overview helped you in some
way if you do like my work be sure to
add me on Facebook Twitter or Instagram
and I'll see what other pieces of
clothing I can showcase for you guys
down the road if there's any other
brands out there that you guys want me
to reach out let me know in the comments
below you guys take care out there and
I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
