been a busy time of year and I know I
can't be fully aware of every product
that's being released but thanks to you
guys and so many suggestions coming in
I'm reviewing an item that the fans have
suggested today I'm reviewing the
massive fugu XL that I personally paid
for priced at 299 dollars retail and
what I'll do is I'll place a link in the
video description below for you guys to
click on and that way you can see the
most updated prices as of today and last
before I begin you'll see the JBL Xtreme
here from time to time since many we're
asking for me to do a comparison so
without further ado I'm Jimmy with Jim's
ravie room and my channel is here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another video
going over the physical features first
for a Bluetooth speaker this is quite
large it's technically still portable
but more holding it within your arms
rather than using a book bag or such
when you put this side-by-side the fugu
is a bit more narrow versus the more
rounded design on the JBL the google
weighs slightly less as well at 4.2
pounds versus the extreme which weighs
in at four point six now going over to
lay out the top has all of your physical
buttons that glows in the dark which is
a nice feature on the left has your play
button with skipping and going back on
tracks and other side vine down an
action button for answering phone calls
or disconnecting is right in the middle
and less to the right is volume up all
very clicky and very responsive to
rotating to the sides one air has your
power on and off with a 3.5 millimeter
auxiliary port for connecting your
devices physically next is the bluetooth
pairing button and last which I
personally did not find convenient is
the LED information to view how much
battery you have left you tap on the
power button and you have to count how
many blinks you would see one green
blink being low with six blinks being
full offering an array of LED lights
like most other Bluetooth speakers would
have helped but the fugu does disclose
audibly the estimated amount remaining
and since we're on the subject that fugu
XL is charged with a supplied wall
adapter and you don't necessarily charge
this with a USB cable like the JBL
extreme and most other large bluetooth
speakers better life is claimed to be a
crazy 35 hours of use on this thing with
my test at 50% volume to get a median
result leaving this on overnight and
partially into the next day I was able
to achieve a still very impressive 27
hours and 23 minutes straight use until
the unit died but going back to the
connections the other side features a
tight seal here for waterproofing
purposes which I'll demonstrate shortly
but behind here you'll find a microUSB
port that is only used for updating the
speaker's firmware the DC port to charge
the fugu XL with again the supplied wall
adapter and last a charge up port for
charging your phone and other random
devices via USB overall the fugu comes
really rock-solid here and one of the
biggest selling features is the design
not the aesthetics but the build quality
the design features a shell which
see here though rotating to the bottom
I'm going to demonstrate I'm going to
take up these two screws that releases
the core and it slides out the unit
physical features that does make the
fugu a considerable choice includes
being reinforced with a fiber resin
making this shock resistance from drops
up to 3 feet from the ground it's also
dust and sand proof with less being
waterproof up to 3 feet in the water for
up to 30 minutes and despite being one
of the heavier speakers from my test it
did prove that the fugu does float so
the three feet maximum shouldn't really
be an issue if you did drop this into a
st. Lake and very last and very notable
this is one of the few speakers that can
output 360 degrees sound this speakers
on the front and then rotating the fugu
here there's speakers on the rear as
well and very well on the sides
the only other speaker in this class
that can output 360-degree sound is the
UE mega boom so far everything sounds
amazing since from my test here this did
confirm it to be built like a tank
everything so far it sounds amazing as
well but this leads me to the sound
quality now play several songs and then
give you my verdict afterwards
Oh
you
yeah cuz I got it like that
flow so smooth like I got it on tap yeah
and I'm a shake it be a good night while
I'm on Mike England while I'm drinking
Bud Light can you get it when you miss
me like I'm wit risky drinking Jim Beam
hey baby did you do it do it that way do
you do that do you take a break you know
that I'm a beast when I kill it on the
piece like a sex on the beach like it's
not lagoon Jess you see the California
way we go we care baby she could
Californication I stuck here all the
flowers it might I put it down like
this 24/7 and they had the button get in
secretly
get you going out so hot just like
innovating myself just to touch it lit
so fire it's all my hey baby little my
all the watching cuz if the sudden close
fool knows they might learn something
aim there you have it folks now sound
recorded on my end and then played
through your speakers or not the best
depiction of audio quality
hence my review here based on this thing
is deep and strong most likely more than
any other large size Bluetooth speaker
that I've tested and that includes the
now recalled beats pill excel now there
are times however where there is slight
spillover of bass but I'm certain bass
heads wouldn't mind at all for the
average consumer most would still
appreciate the sound as the bass isn't
droning or muddled and if there is any
spillover to the mid-range this is
minimal at times and happens only once
in a while uncertain bass heavy songs as
for the mid-range this does well in
offering a more neutral soundstage
voices still comes across clear enough
and can be appreciated by most and when
compared to the extreme I do personally
prefer the JBL's brighter sound
signature as vocals are much more
distinct pushed forward and interpreted
as clear with the fugu XL if and only
when you do put these side-by-side and
perform a test like I did here you can
hear the fugu sound a bit more recessed
however if you were to test and play
this without a comparison most average
consumers would very much appreciate the
overall sound the difference is there
but it's not a deal-breaker by any means
it regarding the high notes the fugu
keeps within reason without overreaching
and becoming ear ringing or ear tinging
overall the definition and clarity
performs similar to most other Bluetooth
speakers including the JBL extreme
meaning this isn't up to the Bose
Soundlink 3 standard which home it is
not easy to beat for a Bluetooth speaker
now when comparing overall loudness both
the fugu and the JBL can offer sound for
large
rooms and they sound almost equivalent
when you're standing at moderate
distances now when you're standing
closer to one of these speakers it does
seem that the JBL is louder most likely
due to the more Ford mid-range and last
regarding Bluetooth signal I was able to
walk to the other side of my house here
and downstairs with no issues having a
signal go through several walls and of
course the first floor ceiling overall
this is a great speaker if you do value
its protective casing and waterproofing
features and where the foogoo XL shines
is how loud and how basically this can
get well not distorting or becoming a
recipe or droning aside from the lack of
an easier to read battery indicator the
lack of including in the package a
caring strap like the JBL extreme this
speaker comes highly recommended let me
know what you think down below do you
prefer the fugu or do you like the JBL
extreme that much better so hope this
review helped you in some way be sure to
add me on to Facebook Twitter and or
Instagram and if you haven't already be
sure to like and follow my channel I'm
Jimmy with Jim's reavie room and my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision you guys take care
I'll see you in the next one bye
