room today's review isn't too much for
the average consumer which is largely my
fan base but this review is geared
towards some videographers like many who
start out I usually roadie mic Pro great
microphone but I do have to be mindful
of my distance to ensure the best audio
was being picked up so for the past few
months on and off I've been looking into
getting a level ear microphone to give
me a bit more versatility Santa hasn't
reached out to me and provided their new
AVX and digital wireless microphone to
test as they felt that this was best
suited for my situation this is the
level ear Pro Set meant for film
projects and offers broadcast quality
sound and is priced at a professional
level here have one thousand three
hundred and twelve dollars unsent
hazards website as of this video now I'm
placing link in the video description
below so you can check updated prices as
I've seen them lower of course then they
suggested retail cost and before getting
started as my fans know I've always
provided honest and upfront reviews and
in this video I'm gonna show you my
actual tests unedited in different
environments so without further ado my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room
going over the physical features first
you do receive the transmitter the
signal receiver and the microphone that
you eventually choose either at lab or a
hand-held cardioid mic and everything
else that you see on your screen you can
pause the video if you need to to see
what else comes in the package the main
components are made of a rugged filling
metal while the removable battery packs
and antennas are plastic all of our
construction and with my use in the
office and in the field everything feels
professional quality grade with being
solid durable and not to mention very
very lightweight going over the
transmitter looking at the front has
your display indicating your better life
and signal strength
unfortunately no audio levels are
displayed here and the one downside the
screen isn't backlit so in low-light
situations I can't see my information
now it may be rare that you need to
check your battery levels and you're
filming at night but it's still worth
pointing out on the front for two very
smooth and easy releasing buttons to
unhook the lithium-ion battery pack with
the AVX these are rechargeable via a
micro USB port on the bottom and they
don't need to be in the transmitter to
charge either battery life is claimed to
be up to 15 hours of use for the
transmitter and I personally recorded my
use over the past month here and add it
all up the total is 10 hours and 52
minutes of personal use at my end
recharging the battery from dead to full
did take a good bit of time here with a
total 4 hours and 23 minutes to be
precise rotating to the left there's
simply your power button and pairing
button switching to the top has a simple
mute function an LED light that glows
and blinks indicating its pairing state
and to the right a 3.5 millimeter input
for the clear microphone with a threaded
screw mount so that way you can't
accidentally yank the wire if you ever
tug on it of course less on the back
here is a very stiff and simple pants or
a belt clip looking at the receiver that
connects to your camera sanitizer does
provide a hot shoe mount with the
receiver itself rotating 320 degrees to
make way for some more complex camera
setups XLR connections are available
fixed in the receiver here for those
using camcorders or cinematic cameras
and those filming with DSLRs like myself
an adapter is provided in the box to
connect this via a 3.5 millimeter port
last are these lights foreign total to
help indicate better levels with a short
press on the check button
or you can adjust mic outputs with AF
out and reducing the decibel levels to
negative 10 negative 20 and negative 30
but on my end here I left this at 0 100%
of the time this also features a better
Peck where they claimed 5 hours of use
here I received 5 hours and 20 minutes
when I left this on through the entire
afternoon until it basically died this
also recharged via a micro USB cord as
well and recharging has taken me about
an hour and 24 minutes very last is the
level ear mic itself really
straightforward smooth wire hasn't
snagged and for the most part hasn't
tangled on me when putting this into my
camera bag and unraveling it afterwards
the only issue now this was only found
on the metal pop filter / windscreen
this easily fell off with a slight bump
before other frequency response caps
used to help extend or increase the
treble frequencies those snap down and
stayed on with no issues so right before
going into the actual sound test on
video at the moment I'm showing you how
to pair the two up and how long it
actually takes and I'll leave that
playing for you guys the AVX system
unlike previous models like the g3 model
from sennheiser literally offers
plug-and-play now for those who are
unfamiliar before you had to scan for
Wireless frequencies to ensure that you
have a clean and available band to use
you had to do that every time you get to
a new location now you don't need to do
so with the AV X when a frequency on
site becomes too crowded you don't have
to stop Midway and adjust the AVX system
again we'll find it free and clear band
ensure your wireless connection remains
uninterrupted so for now I'll play some
raw clips here the following audio will
be all unedited including my narrative
here so you'll most likely hear me say
um quite a bit but do apologize in
advance but please focus on the audio
and any background noise here that you
may encounter your first three tests
will all be outdoors alright folks we're
gonna do test number one here I'm gonna
freestyle this is not a narrative this
meat speaking freestyle so it might not
be as polished but I got the receiver
here we're gonna keep walking in a
straight linear line and once it gets
down to one bar remaining then I'll
basically start walking back to the
camera so we'll see how this goes
Sennheiser claims that this has 33
meters worth of signal strength or if
you guys live in the u.s. 96 linear feet
so right now we have
obviously all of our bars here and keep
in mind this wire is under my jacket
while I'm walking here let me know if
you hear any wire chatter let me know if
you hear any of the wires just rubbing
against my shirt here and you hear any
kind of a noise in that aspect so right
now we have about three to four bars
remaining in signal strength and we keep
going here the second test I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna go downstairs down a level
or two and there will be vehicles there
will be cars down there and that will be
the obstruction that we'll face and
we'll see the signal strength at that
time so I'm touching this wall right now
this is actually definitely more than
100 linear feet more than the 33 meters
claimed and just let me know I haven't
tested the I haven't listened to the
audio sample here I'm pretty sure the
signal maybe hasn't been caught off
maybe not but at least down here on the
receiver it's telling me that they're
still two to three bars left and never
got down to one bar remaining so we'll
see how that goes
anyways we're gonna go down to level two
hopefully this performs well and we'll
go from there
all right take care all right folks
we're gonna do test number two here I
got the receiver in my hand and we're
gonna walk out here and that's very very
busy parking deck and let's see how the
signal strength goes so right now we're
still at but me five four bars actually
just drop down here and I'm gonna keep
walking I'm gonna keep an eye on my
camera as well just make sure no one
steals that and let's see how it goes
I'm gonna walk up here I'm gonna take a
right I'll walk in between some cars too
and of course there's some concrete
columns and we'll see how that looks
like I always want to make this real
quick so I make sure my camera doesn't
get jacked and right now we're still at
three bars I don't the guys can still
see me here waving my hands if you guys
can see that and I'm gonna walk back
towards you guys in between cars and
about two bars it did dip down to one
bar at times so I know with these
vehicles in the way I do know that the
vehicles are causing some kind of
obstruction of course and reducing the
signal strength so let's see here so
that's it
and I'm back there we go hopefully it
sounds good
alright folks I'm doing test number
three right now I'm on a busy street
corner here in downtown and as you can
tell you don't hear too much of the the
noise in the background but it still
picks up my voice pretty decent again my
microphone is right here on my collar
and again you guys see the cars in the
background a street corner the honk the
horn honking here and just let me know
what you guys think down below again
there goes the actual test for you guys
in a busy environment with cars just
move it around yep alright folks we're
back in my studio right now the last
several clips obviously we're outdoors I
want to give you an indoor sample just
in case if you guys would do maybe maybe
an interviewing session or if you're
filming in a small quiet room just to
see if it picks up any ambient noises
and whatnot so right now I have my
computer in the background it's running
you probably can't even hear it at all
also this room is primal at the 10 by 11
10 by 12 obviously there is some stuff
in here so it would dampen the sound a
little bit but reverb regarding sound
just bouncing off the walls
you probably don't hear it too much
either on here I don't have any sound
insulation either I'm just gonna stay
quiet right now to see if there is kind
of is it is there any kind of static or
any kind of hum in general probably let
me put my computer to sleep as well and
see if it picks up anything give me a
second here and it's virtually silent in
the house here no one's at home right
now and you can see you can hear there's
really no static again the the wireless
signal you don't really hear anything at
all the other thing that I want to test
here is the audio levels like I said AVX
is a true plug-and-play system you don't
need a mess too much I mean there's some
options and they are very minimal
options to be honest with you but you
can oh this can't automate your voice so
if you speak really low right now it
adjusts the grill time in let me just
get to the point where I'm whispering
and it can still pick up my voice
basically but then if I jump up to a
very loud voice the audio levels doesn't
peak to the point where it blows out it
still keeps it within range for the most
part for most situations and I don't
have to barely have to adjust it and
post editing again all this audio right
now is on
for you guys so let me get back and
basically get back to my normal speaking
tone here let me get back to the the
narration part here and I will basically
conclude the video give you my final
thoughts all right so overall for my
test I am very very impressed by the
system for me the audio sounds great in
a multitude of environments the signal
strength alone is very impressive and I
very much appreciated how simple the
system is the battery life also is great
on here with the available feature to
recharge via micro USB and despite
missing those audio levels on the
transmitter or other fine tuning
features that we see on other older
models or even advanced models the audio
performance on this as you've heard in
my video tests were great for my needs I
didn't need to fine tune anything really
and before I forget to mention this
entire narrative was recorded on the AV
X and not on my condenser microphone
just like all my previous videos that
you see here on YouTube so that's it for
this review hoped it helped you in some
way here be sure to add me on through
Facebook Twitter and/or Instagram and
throw me a like you guys take care and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
