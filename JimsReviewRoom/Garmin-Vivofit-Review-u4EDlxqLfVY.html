review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at the vivofit
from Garmin and there's two different
packages one without a heartrate monitor
and one with and they're priced at 130
dollars and 170 dollars respectively at
the time of this review and I just
reviewed the polar loop with their heart
rate monitor priced at 180 in total and
you can click on this video or find it
on my youtube channel so without further
adieu we'll get started
Garmin have been making fitness monitors
for runners and Vipers for a while now
but this is garments first attempt and
activity band is a very simple and
lightweight design the band itself is a
silicone rubber like material that's
actually separate from the activity
tracker the screen itself uses the same
technology that your home digital clock
uses to indicate your steps taken
remaining steps to reach your goal
distance traveled calories burned the
time in the day and lastly is your
heartrate when you're wearing the
heartrate monitor and the red band on
top is the move bar the first long bar
here is your first hour of being
inactive additional smaller bars will
eventually appear after every additional
15 minutes and for my test the band does
a good job of distinguishing just moving
your hands around for let's say typing
or driving your car versus an actual
movement like walking it's a great
reminder throughout the day just to
stand up a bit and take a walk to the
fountain or restroom now as you can see
the lettering is highly reflective so it
does work perfectly fine in abundant to
moderate lighting but in dark rooms or
areas it's quite hard to see and if it's
pitch-black you can't even see it at all
and like many other bands on the market
today the view of it does not have any
fancy displays it's pretty similar to
the old-school Casio watches but because
of that though you don't have to
recharge your band every five to seven
days instead the built-in better it
lasts for more than a year before
changing now there's two bands that
comes in the package one small and the
other large but there are various
notches like the Fitbit products to
ensure a snug fit the brains of the
device is detachable so you can swap
bands for different colors and currently
there's five colors on the market today
and this is possibly just my opinion but
where the view of it was actually
released the pictures online really made
the band look bulky and unsightly but in
person it looks decent it's a slim
profile and although there's a slight
bulge on top it's still better than some
of the other bands out there and it's
quite comfortable to wear as well and I
wear this in the shower and aware this
is sleep as well to monitor myself 24
hours and yes the band is water
resistant up to 50 meters and what I
liked about this band was there are no
ports for either syncing or charging
everything is done wirelessly and it
connects to both Apple and Android power
devices to have Bluetooth and Garmin
also includes a USB plug for your
computer or laptop so you can sync this
and view the data on there and if you
forget to sync don't worry about that
because the band does record up to three
weeks of activity or two weeks if you're
using the heartrate monitor as well so
so far the band itself is very simple
and again it's easy and lightweight to
wear but something I believe that's even
more important is its features and its
software now going on to the app here
the main page provides your basic
details steps taken distance traveled
calories burned and Garmin does provide
auto goal based on your previous
activity levels now this goal will
adjust day to day based on your past
activities and it's a good stepping
stone rather than just having be
standard 10,000 steps that most bands
lead fixed until you change it but on
the view fit you can of course manually
set this up if you'd like by clicking on
the details button gives you a chart of
how active you were throughout your day
and on the screen you can view activity
for the week month and year to compare
yourself and of course that's very
important to basically continually self
improve the next section is activities
where it works in connection with your
heart rate monitor now when you wear the
heartrate monitor and as soon as it
starts tracking your heartbeat it will
trigger an activity automatically as I
click on one of these workouts that I've
performed you can see it records your
time distance speed and calories burned
and because of weight lift my distance
and speed are pretty low but by wearing
the monitor my calories burned only one
can assume would be more accurate than
wearing a band that didn't accompany
your heart rate monitor like the popular
three companies currently like jawbone
Fitbit or Nike so with that being said
this of course works for general and
overall fitness but I believe the band
the app and the heart rate monitor
working together is more beneficial for
runners
joggers specifically now the last tab
shows my charts and you can see the
speed and your heart rate fluctuating
throughout your progress and keep in
mind the band that you're wearing as
well also displays the beats per minute
when you press through the menu button
in regarding distance and speed Garmin
Connect which is the app you downloading
see on your screen is the same app
that's used across all the other garmin
products that has the GPS features in
this case the distance and speed is an
estimate since the view of it although
it's made by GPS manufacturer doesn't
have GPS capabilities and the band
itself
so although the app says this activity
has no map data it's because this app
isn't used on other products as well
where the map would be utilized
unlike the view fit where it doesn't
have GPS capabilities and before moving
on to the next section if you're
deciding to buy the bundle this heart
rate monitor comes in the box it's a
long plastic strip in front with
stretchable fabric if you've never worn
a chest heartrate monitor before it's
not bad it does have to fit snug pretty
much around your chest and also just be
sure to moisten the contact pads on the
inside before wearing if you don't
moisten them the monitor won't have good
contact or register those heartbeats now
it's been comfortable enough for me to
wear at least although this long plastic
strip again sits right here on your
lower chest where your lower breastbone
is located and I don't feel it too much
but some have expressed discomfort so
just a heads up on that though and it's
been accurate as I do stop halfway to
cut my pulse to ensure accuracy now
going back to the app here the next
section is sleep monitoring and before
you sleep you press and hold the button
on your band to trigger sleep mode when
you wake up press and hold it again
after doing so a chart does reveal a
graph and how much movement was
registered during your snooze now I
wasn't too impressed though although the
chart clearly shows throughout the night
what you're up to in your arts to
movement but other bands have been able
to display light sleep versus deep sleep
by percentage which gives me a better
idea of my sleeping habits and lastly on
the main page are your badges icons that
review your accolades over time and once
clicked will show you what you have
achieved so far and lastly by pressing
the top left Settings button you can
access community which is where you can
add friends or virtual friends found
through the app by doing so you can view
the leaderboard to compete against other
vivofit wares out there
third on the list is the device's tab
that reviews what devices you have
synced with this app and lastly the
sprocket on the very bottom of the page
here you can change your height and
especially your weight to have your
goals change over time so overall when I
was first introduced to the vivofit it
didn't see much because it was just so
simple but over time I can see there's a
real benefit to this band because of its
app especially for runners all the main
components are there to make this a
worthwhile purchase and as I stated in
the polar loop video you have to get
this with the heart rate monitor bundle
without it I think a different company
is better suited as it does come with
more smaller features that view fit is
missing such as a vibrating alarm
flights of stairs climbed some other
bands have food logs and third-party
apps support as well so hope you enjoyed
this review of the view of it and it's
heart rate monitor from Garmin please
watch the other videos to see if the
other products are more suited for you
and if you have not please take your
time to visit my Facebook and Google+
pages for behind the scenes information
