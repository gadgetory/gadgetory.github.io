review room welcome back to another
unboxing so today after several viewers
suggested Arya reviewed this particular
product here it's the roar bluetooth
speaker from creative labs and creative
labs they're more well known for making
sound cards that you place inside your
PC and I've known them proudly since the
late 90s or 2000s or so but this
Bluetooth speaker likes a couple viewers
had suggested it to me and they said
that this actually sounds really really
good actually better than some of the
more expensive brands out there my
particular favorite after reviewing so
many Bluetooth speakers this year and
some from last year as well
is the Bose sound like - - both sound
like three as well so we'll see how that
sound compared to the sound from the
roar here as well so before I get into
the actual unboxing here I just want to
give you an update on the channel so I'm
still reviewing the Jabra step which I
have here these are brand new from Jabra
and I actually reviewed their Sport+ if
you have been found a channel that video
was uploaded probably about two or three
days ago and I gotta admit and this is
like a sneak peek I guess you can say
the Sport+ I'm sorry Jarrah we're not
great at all compared to the step which
I'm testing today so these will be out
pretty soon and probably early next week
or so and we'll put that to the side
another company reached out to me called
cheero
and they have this cartoon character
which is very popular in Japan and this
is probably the number one selling
product I believe on Amazon Japan at
least that's what cheer all the company
that manufactures this has advised me
and this is a power bank basically that
holds power and charges your device via
USB but more on that later but more
importantly I guess for you guys as well
they offered for me to do a giveaway as
well of the actual action figure and I
don't know if you guys seen this guy
before
I asked all my friends everyone said
they have seen this guy before but don't
know where it's from who it is etc but
again he is supposedly very popular in
Japan but who knows but they did give me
this to giveaway it's a basically a toy
figurine
of danboard so we'll get more into that
during the review but back on topic here
let me get this out the way regarding
this package here I have yet to open
it's still sealed but I just literally
took it out the the box here and if you
guys hear that this thing sounds really
loose and hopefully nothing's damaged
during transport in here but without
further ado let's go to opening this and
let's see what's inside for you fans out
there so let me just zoom in real quick
here do you guys can see the box here
pretty clearly here goes the front of
the box for you guys and the basically
that's the sides are what the speaker
itself looks like but will of course
take a closer look on that after I open
this up by going to the back of the box
here and I'll zoom it in a little bit
further for you and there are some of
the product features for you guys it's
NFC enabled just for quick pairing with
your NFC enabled devices of course this
connects via bluetooth creative does
emphasize that this does have a pretty
good amount of base so we'll see about
that there's instant roar audio power
said instantly boost speaker audio
loudness and spaciousness so that should
be pretty interesting there is actually
a slot to insert your micro SD card so
you don't have to use your phone or even
a 3.5 millimeter jack you can say to
play audio files from you can play again
from your micro SD card and again on
micro SD card readers built right in
here let's see bedtime mode basically it
gradually reduces playback volume before
automatically shutting down so I guess
it helps you snooze at night and there's
a dual purpose battery at the Belkin 16
6000 I'm sorry milliamp lithium-ion
battery and it charges your smartphone
and tablets and gives up to eight hours
of audio playback so that's pretty
interesting a lot more bluetooth
speakers are coming with that feature
basically a charge out function and you
see that with the beats pill excel
believe the JBL charge bluetooth speaker
as well which I have done reviews on my
channel
it supports FX and AAC audio files
basically as good as wire connections so
the audio codec is basically as good as
a wire
action since I'm using us through
Bluetooth let's see here security
there's speakerphone or teleconferencing
features is it integrated voice recorder
and it records directly to your micro SD
card slot or a micro SD card
one touch sorry to grab attention when
you need it okay and I said you probably
can zoom into this it says up to 10
meters in range which I'll double check
that and let's say we'll just get into
the box here for you guys and let's see
what we got for you so all right
flipping this around and I'm gonna zoom
out for you guys alright first up we've
got the Quick Start Guide which will
always put to the side here for you guys
please piece of cardboard
we got a micro USB cord here we got the
wall charger as well
AC adapter perfect and that's it for
wires and let's see the actual device
itself let's see this anything else in
the box here before we move this to the
side here let's take the cover off of
this beauty here Wow really nice small
form-factor it's not big it off but it
feels dense it feels like it's really
meeting with a lot of stuff inside here
okay let me just zoom in a little bit
for you guys okay and there you guys go
and let me see let me just turn it off
and it does make a little noise when you
guys did it turn it back on
nice little touch and let's see so a
little bit of grill all around with some
very nice chrome / aluminum trim let me
refocus that for you guys you guys can
take a look at that that is a really
nice finish how its beveled in on the
sides there let's go to the other side
that's practically almost identically
the same okay the front with the
creative logo and we're gonna go to the
rear here for you guys and I'm gonna
resume or refocus actually so you can
see all the connections on the back here
alright so I got you a power input but
0ly in power out with the USB cable it's
a DCO micro USB the micro SD card slot
here and you got the microphone or no
microphone record and play and pause
button you want a loop or shuffle
forward and back playing pause so a lot
of the controls are actually on the back
of the actual speaker not on the front
there's an alarm feature and I'm not
sure what this is here but of course
I'll be the manual for you guys and
there's a off and arm button here again
not sure what this is until I read the
actual instruction menu and I'll get
back with you guys on that but other
than that that's about it there's no
ports on the bottom there and let me
just put it back on the table here let
me zoom back out for you and they got
the NFC right here a battery indicator
the recorded light or indicator that
should shine on when it's recording
bluetooth pairing or speak from button
volume up and down the roar button I
guess to see how loud it gets in and of
course on and off regarding the power
so very nice accents it's basically this
aluminum mesh grille almost all the way
around basically both left right and the
very front and also the top as well and
it sits very conveniently right there
and like I said it's a really nice size
it's not too big but it's not small at
all and they got a little bit of a
silicone touch on the very top the
buttons are a little they're real clucky
they're not hollow like the
Soundlink three which I kinda was
disappointed that it went with that
style but other than that that's about
it that's the update for my channel here
and hope you guys can like this video
put your comments below that's about it
guys again find me on Facebook Google+
and Twitter and look out for this review
and again also the Jabra step should be
coming out early next week or so and
then I'm doing the review and the cheer

the back in the office here for you guys
to enjoy so that's about it again this
