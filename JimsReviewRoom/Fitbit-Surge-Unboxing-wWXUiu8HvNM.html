review room welcome back to another
unboxing now I was able to get my hands
on this about a week ago or so for about
$250 retail and I'm finally able today
to put up a quick unboxing video just
been a hectic week here right before
Christmas and if you have been following
me on Facebook Twitter or Instagram you
know I have the charge HR as well so add
me on social media or subscribe here if
you haven't and the review videos should
be around the corner but just looking
around the box here to see what features
this has this Fitbit surge now offers
built-in GPS which is huge meaning you
don't have to take your phone with you
and rely on the phone's GPS it's all
done right on your wrist now indeed
there is heart rate monitoring right on
the wrist as well and there's a huge
benefit of heart rate monitoring while
running now it does help make every jog
or exercise you do really count towards
your desired cardio or fat loss goals I
don't discuss more of that in the review
now other activities are pretty standard
like the different types of activity
tracking notifications are right at the
wrist and alarms it's water-resistant as
well etc but in the review I'll showcase
how this all works it's a matter of how
well they perform not the fact that they
are included right here in this device
then last before I forget here the
search does work for both Apple and
Android devices now I went with the
large this time in size since the charge
was bought in small in my last review
and it was already at its last notch but
so far the large actually fits perfectly
but I'll show you briefly what it looks
like later in this video on my wrist but
now looking at the box here and this is
truly unlike any other Fitbit box is
actually really unique here but just
opening up and getting inside here
Fitbit offers again its own proprietary
charging cable that you can use as well
to sync with your computer now there's
also a USB adapter here that way you can
wirelessly sync with your desktop or
laptop computer and that way all of your
information is hosted on fitbit website
you don't have to go through your phone
and sync that way if you choose not to
but so far in the band although looks
big and actually feels big at first
actually feels really comfortable on the
wrist
I would have thought that it looks like
a big piece of metal here and it would
just be uncomfortable especially while
sleeping but that really hasn't been the
case
now I've worn a long thermal the other
day while going to film the bow Sports
review bow sports earbuds and in that
review in that video if you did see it I
did have a sneak peek of the search
itself demonstrating the heart rate
monitor on there but so far it's fine I
haven't tested this by wearing a
button-up shirt though just to test
those for those who do work in an office
and requires a button-up shirt more
professional attire I do know for some
people with big watches it does snag the
cuff a little bit sometimes preventing
it or presenting it as a nuisance but
over our initial impressions have been
very favorable although I did get this a
bit early it's working without any
issues from what I can tell the
notifications have been hit-or-miss
though getting to me right here on the
wrist but there is a firmware update
that I'm downloading that hopefully
should address that so again this is
just a quick unboxing more details with
the review coming up soon I doubt that
it's gonna be this week
Christmas is of course next week I am
trying to get it before Christmas but it
has been crazy here at Jim's review room
headquarters also known as a spare
bedroom in my house here so hopefully
I'll get it up by then if not it will be
of course very shortly after Christmas
that I'll have this up but find me on
Facebook Twitter Instagram or Google+
all with the Jim's review room handle
and of course I'll update my findings
I'm there as well but add me you can
always ask questions on there you'll
guys will see photos of items that I'm
reviewing prior to me uploading it onto
the website here it's just really good
information and I always love hearing
from you guys so that's it here you guys
take care and I'll see you on the next
one take care bye adios
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
