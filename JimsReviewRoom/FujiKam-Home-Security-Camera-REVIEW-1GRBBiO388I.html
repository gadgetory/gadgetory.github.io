room if you guys have been following me
you don't have had the Dropcam and just
recently upgraded to the nest cam but
it's still missing not one or two but
several features that other home
security cameras aren't including well I
stumbled across and purchased myself the
number one selling home security camera
on Amazon it's not a big name like
Samsung or nest cam themselves but it's
called Fuji cam and I'm always worried
about buying these Asian products with
horrible instructions but luckily the
makers of this camera has shown a lot of
promise you can click on the link in the
video description below
to check for updated pricing on Amazon
but I personally paid $99 at the time
this video so without further adieu I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to gems review
going over the physical features it
looks good but I will admit for those
wanting these stealth look it's not as
incognito as the Dropcam consider it
comes with a shiny silver paint scheme
on top you have an array of infrared
lights to help the camera see in
pitch-black
a motorized rotating base and on the
very bottom are lights indicating or
signifying if you're connected via Wi-Fi
or physically connected to your router
now after contacting Fuji cams customers
support email they responded the same
day which is great but they did
literally just say no when I inquired if
those light on the bottom can be turned
off now on the head of the camera only
on the right side here is a speakerphone
which is very loud and the audio is
clear enough to be used perfect for
speaking to your kids or checking up on
grandma and moving to the back of the
camera there is an Ethernet port for
physically connecting this with the
supplied ethernet cord a dedicated
square for connecting this through some
sort of an alarm which there is no
documentation whatsoever or instructions
on in the manual now to the right is a
threaded mount for your supplied antenna
and directly below that is a micro SD
card slot that's able to take up to 32
gigabytes of memory used for a local
recording and storage now you can set
the camera to record 24/7 and this will
delete the old files creating a
recording loop or you can have it record
whenever motion is detected in the last
option you can schedule when you want
the camera to start recording now last
to the right is a function button to
assistant connecting the camera to your
home network and speaking of connecting
this it is easy enough but the easiest
method does require you to physically
connect the camera to your home router
it is an additional step that I haven't
seen when compared to other home
security cameras I've tested so just a
heads up on that
other than that this unit is still very
well built its sturdy on flat surfaces
and it comes with a very decent base the
Fuji cam does come with a wall mounting
plate with thank goodness anchor screws
the wall mount can pivot up and down
with the contact point of the camera
offering you to position the camera in
your desired angle finally the right
position wouldn't be hard at all but one
last feature before going into the video
feed in the app you can swipe to rotate
the camera left and right by 320 degrees
you can also tilt this up and down by
120 degrees that way and I got a mint
this works much more smoother and with
more accuracy that a d-link pan and tilt
that I tested a few months back
but going into the app here the main
page will show all the cameras you have
with only a still thumbnail a number on
the top right indicates how many times
motion was detected and then moving to
the top right offers different
resolutions for different settings up to
720p for this particular camera which
for a $99 camera that's actually rare
now their settings for notifications to
your smartphone either through sound or
a vibration and below that you can
select which kind of a ringtone that you
want now going back out if you press and
hold the camera thumbnail more settings
are offered in which you can pause and
read through if you need to most are
just really self-explanatory now the one
area that I want to show you is the
motion and notification options in here
you can adjust these sensitivity and
differentiate for day and night time use
the alarm action below is very important
this will tell this particular camera to
take a photo and or a video when motion
is detected that way you can go back
into what's going on and that's IO input
again nothing in the instructions
regarding this particular feature but
now backing all the way out tapping on
the thumbnail shows you the image in
real time with options to hear your
video feed with its built-in microphone
for most situations and casual
conversations if needed the mic works
great as for a baby monitor this would
definitely pick up if he or she is
crying and right before I show you the
actual video clicking on the record icon
on the bottom will review all the
snapshots and B motion captured on this
particular camera and I gotta admit this
captures motion
very well so you won't miss much of
anything that's going on the only issue
I noticed you can't rewind a video
during mid play and on the Android
platform
I noticed most photos are my photos here
I'm sorry and videos are mixed together
and not separated like on my iPad but
let's get into the video sample here for
a $99 security camera the image quality
is really well done thanks to offering a
720p resolution the colors were not as
good as the Dropcam and nest cam
products but compared to majority the
cameras at this price range this does
better
the only gripe the camera lens itself is
very narrow with most of the cameras one
of their selling points is having a
wide-angle lens for more coverage indeed
this does have the rotating base which
I'm demonstrating here but it does
require manual operation now moving to
night vision in pitch black this
performs ridiculously well with minimal
noise and distortion
the cameras still very fluid and all the
way across the room this can clearly see
all the way back there
so overall from my experience the only
thing I see missing that would impact
your purchase is basically a wide-angle
lens but having the feature of a
rotating base I would think would Trump
that issue for some cloud recording is
not available either to an off-site
monthly service or to something at home
like a NASA storage station I don't use
those services myself but I do see why
someone would want those now keep in
mind most cameras do have local
recording now except for the nest cam of
course other than that for the price you
really do get a lot though especially
that's 720p resolution you get nighttime
performance the motion detection does
work great and the camera never missed
sending me a notification of any kind of
movement if you are in this price range
hands down this must be the best in the
market at a hundred bucks so this review
helped you in some way be sure to add me
