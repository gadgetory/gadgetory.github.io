review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at the brand new
Samsung Galaxy Note pro this tablet size
is completely new to the market and it's
currently $200 more expensive than the
10.1 inch version so is this well worth
to purchase the model I have here is the
12 point 2 inch 32 gigabyte Wi-Fi only
version the note Pro comes in several
different variants either 32 gig or 64
gig configurations and two color choices
of either black or white a 16 gig
version is not available and eventually
LTE and 3G versions will be available
through your carriers now on your screen
you have different price points of other
models currently available at the time
of this review so if you're on the fence
of which tablet to get hopefully with
this review it will help you decide so
without further ado we'll get started
physically the most noticeable
difference is its size the unit measures
11 inches wide eight inches high and
only 0.3 inches thin still it's only
1/100 of an inch bigger than a brand new
iPad air the Note 10.1 and note pro are
actually willing to finish tablets on
the market today and continuing with its
physical features like all Samsung
current and future tablets will have the
imitation leather backing with faux
stitching the 10.1 2014 edition
I reviewed had the same backing but it
felt much more plastic like this time
around the backing looks identical but
has a silicone feel to it giving it a
bit more grip when holding in general it
looks modern generates minimal
fingerprints and no scratches when I
attempted to key the device now going
over its physical layout you still have
your power and volume rocker buttons on
the top with the infrared blaster in the
middle to control your TV the S Pen is
still stowed on the side and will of
course discuss that in detail shortly
now on either side of the note hazard
speakers which during my test sounded
decent for a tablet it's just loud
enough for average slash casual self
listening they warn't anything stellar
for speak up though of course there's a
three-and-a-half millimeter input on the
side so you can use your own headphones
if desired now to the right is the
latest USB 3.0 port used for charging
your device with the supplied wall
charger and transferring your files in
most tablets today still use the slower
microUSB port for charging so this is a
new plus for Samsung I also connected a
note Pro directly to my computer though
which for my case didn't charge the
tablet and below the USB 3.0 port is a
micro SD card slot for expanding your
memory and transferring files and that's
something a good handful of tablets
don't even offer today there's nothing
on the bottom of the tablet this time
however where the buttons are located
instead of the original app button
resides now a recent app button the name
speaks for itself allowing you to
quickly access applications you are just
working on and closing them with a quick
flick of the wrist task manager is also
there to end all tasks as well
and finishing up the physical layout the
front has a two megapixel camera while
the rear has a eight megapixel camera
with built-in LED flash and although I
believe it's weird to hold up as huge
tablet to take photos nonetheless the
cameras are good for casual users what
you see on the screen right now are
currently photos taken from the note Pro
itself with no photo editing now tablets
are not Canon or Nikon digital cameras
but for a tablet the no pro had some
decent photos low light had some noise
but it was still tolerable in my opinion
again good for casual users the last and
most notable item physically is the big
screen again this is a 12 point 2 inch
screen diagonally and it comes with the
same resolution as the 10.1 inch model
at 2560 by 1600 giving a pixel density
of 247 pixels per inch now the more
density of pixels per inch the more
crisp images and lettering will be the
image quality is still very well done
with contrasting colors and deep blacks
and bright whites
now having the tablet for the first 24
hours I was concerned the tablet would
have slipped out of my hands even when I
was holding it at my side because it's
so thin and so wide physically the
tablet and the screen size itself is
huge for a tablet there's no question
about that and some have stated
basically it's just too big but I don't
think it was a big deal since after you
played around the tablet for a while you
became comfortable with it 24 hours
later I was a lot more confident
afterwards so I highly recommend though
having or purchasing a cover with a
built-in Bluetooth keyboard for both
protection and also productivity and
when placing this on your table or desk
it works well and looks amazing because
of its size so with all that being said
how's the performance especially this
tablet is geared towards productivity in
my case as a full-time youtuber I really
need this for my calendar news email and
communicating on social media and with a
processor consisting of 8 cores the
affirmation is not a problem at all 4
cores run at 1.9 gigahertz while the
other four cores run at one point 3
gigahertz in laymen terms the samsung
exynos processor is meant to be a
multitasking champion the processor is
also the same processor found in a 10.1
inch 2014 edition samsung tablet same
with its three gigs of ram and both now
runs on the latest Android 4.4.2 kitkat
but what's unique about this tablet
versus the after mentioned because of
the screen real estate you can now run
four apps simultaneously on a screen
through multi window and although it's
the same processor on the smaller
samsung tablet it runs for the most part
without a hitch and goddammit this thing
is a beast at multitasking but I said
earlier it runs for the most part
without a hitch at times even with just
one app open and task manager cleared I
would still get a stutter or hiccup here
and there or some actions just didn't
happen as fluid this was also found on
the 10 inch tablet as well and my only
speculation is the coding Samsung used
might have either been too demanding or
just wasn't efficient at this time it's
not frustrating but for me at least I do
notice it although very far from broken
or frustrating this is something I
wouldn't have expected from a premium
priced tablet
and now I'm going on to the main screen
here you still have your interface
TouchWiz which you're probably most
familiar with if you're an Android user
but what's new is Samsung's
magazine UX it's a tile based interface
in which companies believe are becoming
more popular and demanding think windows
8 live tiles or the app Flipboard left
from the magazine UX screen you can
customize information you want displayed
and the screen now I'm showcasing my
news feed and everything news related I
want goes here basically now if I wanted
to add another news feed let's say I'm
interested in sports I pinch the screen
and scroll to my news tiles and drag and
drop sports on to my desired page at
maximum each page can hold up to six
tiles afterwards I add which new sources
I want to be viewable and as you can see
on the right side each one I click will
eventually be reported to me once I back
out and click on that tile and use it as
normal it basically becomes Flipboard
when I flip through pages and see all
these news sites that I've selected so
far now one issue I've found so far with
magazine UX it looks quite limited pinch
the screen again as you can see in the
social realm of apps whereas Facebook
Instagram Tumblr Google Hangouts
snapchat etc apps I've downloaded
through Google Play Store or the Samsung
store doesn't show up here as well and I
would assume those apps have to be
compatible with magazine UX for them to
work and with that being said I found
myself using this standard interface
more since all of my information was
there just maybe down the road hopefully
in the near future magazine UX will grow
to something more
now the next software feature
proprietary to Samsung is the air
command identical to the note tablets
and phone once you pull out your S Pen a
window appears prompting for your action
the fan offers five actions that can be
performed and you can access this
anytime by clicking on your S Pen button
while close to the screen first up is
action memo if you're in a hurry and
want to write down someone's information
as I'm doing here the note pro will
recognize my handwriting and convert it
into a contact the best thing it
populates the field for you name email
phone number and if you want to map
on Google Maps it'll show basically its
accuracy is impressive of course if you
have decent handwriting however it
doesn't recursive well though
now scrapbook is the next feature where
once accessed you draw a square around
any content you want to snip and be
placed into a saved folder
it's literally like scrapbooking for me
trying to get ideas to decor my house at
times I see something I like and I snip
it and save it and I do the same thing
for clothing as well and possibly for
let's say designers architects or
possibly a hairstylist could snip things
very fast to find inspiration later in
their saved folder next up is screen
write which takes a photo of your screen
and then allows you to write on that
screenshot then you can share it on your
social media app like Facebook or
Instagram etc it's pretty simple to use
for sharing content that you've written
on now s Finder is the second to last
option where you can search for anything
on your tablet either tight or
handwritten it'll find it for you in
this example I found John Smith's notes
I wrote earlier again it can find words
that you've also handwritten in lastly
tis pen window which is really unique
after selecting this option from the air
command draw a square anywhere on the
screen and select an app that you desire
to open wherever you drew the box the
app will open right there and I find
myself using this when I'm on a web site
and I need to pull up my calendar or
instead of using multi window I can pull
up Google Maps at the same time I'm
looking up the restaurants addresses and
its reviews it's another tool that
Samsung offers to help you multitask
whether for work or for your personal
needs so for my test for both work and
pleasure I really do like the note
series in general
I love the S Pen it gives me more
precision less need to put finger prints
on the screen and some of the features
through Air Command I actually use with
the twelve point two inch screen though
swiping the on-screen keyboard can feel
like a chore now since it's so wide the
keyboard is almost the same size as a
full keyboard and I can almost type on
there like a regular keyboard but
without physical keys you do lose your
place a bit and you do have to look down
pretty often so treating this as a
regular keyboard I would have to say no
but working on a 12 point two inch
screen is like a dream there's so much
area to view web pages are viewed with
comfort and pictures are viewed almost
like a huge portrait
although watching a movie and this was
truly a delight but holding a while in
bed required a different change in
holding the tablet up nonetheless the
twelve point two inch is definitely
definitely a huge benefit and playing
games on this went without a hitch I
haven't had an issue with this and ran
basically anything that was available in
the Google Play Store let's include more
graphically intense games that had 3d
polygons and basically simulated physics
again no Prime's as you can see on the
screen now regards to video playback it
was the same as well
very smooth processing and the colors
and the contrast looks great and the
ever-popular Netflix was not an issue at
all either
and typically with my youtube channel I
don't get too deep into the technicals
as I'm trying to reach the average
consumer but the benchmark numbers are
in the about description below if you're
interested and lastly my mixed use on a
tablet yielded 11 hours and 17 minutes
average to be precise of battery life
that I recorded now when I was on the
tablet I would record my time on and
then off with using basically the web
random YouTube videos trying new apps
playing Pandora in the background etc
and then when I go to sleep I would turn
off the tablet all together and that
count the time the tablet lay dormant I
just measured continuous news
just like the manufacturers do I left
auto brightness on just to have a
standard measurement again 11 hours and
17 minutes was the average so altogether
the note series is great but as for the
note Pro specifically I know it's
subjective I don't think that $200 price
premium is worth just the additional two
inch area now if you really love the big
screen and want it or more importantly
need it then so be it but if you're
considering best bang for your buck the
specifications analyst is nearly
identical to the $550 Samsung Note 10.1
2014 edition and on speaking of the same
camera same resolution same processor
same RAM same or at least similar
performance the differences that do
exist just isn't enough again for a $200
premium can
Internet can buy another great 7-inch
tablet for 230 dollars in the end it's
still a great tablet but it's a matter
of your preference so hope this review
helped you in some way
