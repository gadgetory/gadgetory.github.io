room headphones or headsets have their
pros and cons when it comes to gaming
but we're starting to see earphones show
up here as an alternative on the market
they provide passive noise isolation
since they're in ear they offer the
convenience of Portability and not to
mention some folks honestly don't like
wearing headsets as it could be
uncomfortable the Sound Blaster p5 I
have here it retails for $69 the same
price as one of the other competitors
here but I'll place my links in the
video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices for today again I'm Jimmy
with Jim's review room and my channels
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over the physical features first
these are plastic with chrome paint
despite creative including a carrying
case which is a nice one its durable and
minimalistic I instead toss these into
my bag and carry them around for some
time just to test out its durability and
the paint finish has been holding up
really well there's a good bit of
protection here towards the wires
exiting the air phones themselves which
is always a plus here but when you do
move down the wire it's a braided cord
but the wires do feel awfully thin a
thicker wire gauge would have at least
given this a beefier or more of a
substantial feel now what I also notice
was the wire does tangle quite a bit
here if you do stow this in your bag and
bring it out front later now moving down
and looking at the inline controller
there's a mute button that's also used
to answer phone calls there's a
microphone mute switch and up top
there's the microphone itself regarding
quality this picks up my voice very well
here a bit clearer than a good handful
of dedicated headsets out there but what
I didn't notice though because the
microphone is not directly in front of
your mouth like most earpieces for phone
calls this does tend to pick up noises
in your environment more than headsets
in general so just a heads up on that
but if you're playing in a quiet room
you should be perfectly fine here's a
quick sample
alright guys testing out the p5
microphone for you guys I'm going to
move over a little bit to the right here
but while I'm doing so of course the
wires gonna be rubbing against my shirt
here let me know if you guys hear any
kind of Wired chatter since I'm moving
around the perfect test and why not do
it right now but anyways my voice is
being picked up very clearly here it's
actually clearer than some of the
headsets that have been testing recently
but on that there is a little bit of
wire chatter that I can hear through my
earbuds whenever I move around like even
just touching the wire right here I can
hear it through my earphones there's a
lot of noise being transferred up but is
it picked up by the microphone you guys
let me know I hope you guys enjoyed the
rest of this video alright moving on to
comfort there's three different silicone
ear tips that feels really good they do
stay in the ear very well and had no
issues while sitting down gaming if you
are using this to listen to music here
on the go with your phone the earphones
are very light they never fell off or
became loose while in the ear canal now
on the package it does say 95% noise
reduction here the package doesn't say
anything about being an active noise
canceling pair of earphones as of course
you don't see battery being inserted
anywhere but from my testing here the
passive noise isolation is just okay
though here
few other earphones granted for
listening to music on the go other
earphones tends to block up noise for
better than the P fives here and that's
basically it jumping right into the
sound test the p5 offers a decent base
it's not deep sub base for explosions
and other gaming content but there's
definitely enough for the average gamer
if you're looking for a natural sounding
bass signature that's distortion free
doesn't bleed over into the mid levels
of audio this sounds great in that
aspect now as for the mids it's ever so
slightly on the bright side which I do
prefer a like out my music voice is a
most audio in-game do stand out a bit
for clear precise recognition however
for the high notes though and a few
games especially the division and some
aspects of black ops 3 for the ps4 I
noticed the high notes do screech a bit
or a little bit sharp basically
especially at higher volumes and that's
probably the only audio gripe that had
with the p5 s though now as for the
soundstage it's done pretty good as most
in your earphones do for gaming you'll
be able to hear distinctly left and
right audio channels from enemies
welcomed by you to coming up to you now
if you do pair this with a DAC or an amp
in my case I also got the g1 from
creative that connects to your PC again
links will be in the video description
for more information the audio immersion
the soundstage album it is tremendously
increased and not to hype it up here but
going back to the division while you do
stand and mill the string and listen to
the wind you do hear that airiness of
air blowing around you around the
buildings and it's just just very
immersive the earphones respond very
well to a deck or an amp so that's
basically it for the review here I hope
it helped you in some way in general the
build materials and the high pitch sound
signature was a bit of a turn-off for me
but the bass mid and soundstage on these
are done very well not to mention having
the option to use these as and everyday
pair of earphones for music for your
phone
it beats carrying around a headset
everywhere you go not to mention cheaper
