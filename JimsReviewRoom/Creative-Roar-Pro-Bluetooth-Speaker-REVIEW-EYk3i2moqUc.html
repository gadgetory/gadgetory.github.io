Jimmy with Jim's review room I've
reviewed several creative Bluetooth
speakers and for the most part they've
been great offering the most bang for
the buck in regards to features and
sound quality that's up there with the
bigger names Craig decided to send me a
review unit and they're just released
roar Pro model that claims to have
better audio quality better battery life
and a few features that intends on
justifying it's much higher price tag of
two hundred and forty nine dollars
retail as of this video so without
further ado my channel is here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's review room
going over its physical features first
identical in size with the original roar
one the dimensions are still compact and
offers good portability the weight is
identical as well weighing in at two
point five pounds or one kilograms even
the bill quarter remains the same being
exceptional with a solid frame metal
grille and the side passive radiators
are protected too one thing I'm happy to
see returned the roar - which was
slightly smaller had top firing speakers
while the roar one in the world pro here
has front firing speakers in turn the
sound is more immersive and more
directed towards the listener rather
than the ceiling like the models before
this is loaded with features and more so
than any other Bluetooth speaker on the
market looking at the top near-field
communication makes a comeback for easy
pairing to Android devices a battery
indicator which I still prefer at least
five lights creative only offers three
here bluetooth pairing button with
speakerphone option allowing you to take
phone calls with the roar when paired to
your phone and then volume up and down
next is the roar button which helps
create brighter clearer sound
characteristics which will demonstrate
shortly and last is the power button
rotating to the back you have the AC
adapter input 3.5 millimeter port to
physically connect this to your audio
source and third is a charged out port
allowing you to charge other devices via
a USB cable just like a power bank when
your phone might be close to running out
of battery now keep in mind like most
Bluetooth speakers this doesn't have
quick charging capabilities so it could
be pretty slow continuing on a micro USB
port is available for connecting this to
your computer for listening to audio and
creative does allow this to connect with
your PlayStation 4 to the right to
creative once again includes a micro SD
card slot allowing you to play audio
right from the card which I'll be honest
I've never used but the following
feature to the right allows for voice
recording during group meetings or in
the office room maybe college students
conducting group research that's where I
see the memory card feature being ideal
there's physical pause and play and
shuffle on the back to control the music
and the SD card however you can't
control your music when you are
streaming via bluetooth new to the
created for our audio profiles which
changes the characteristics of sound
from warm neutral energetic and last
tera bass which offers bass boost and I
switch to toggle between USB or getting
your audio from the SD card as mentioned
earlier so there's no question the build
quality is amazing and the features are
great once again there's a bunch of them
but how does it sound I'll play several
samples and
give you my verdict afterwards here's
one the artists that I've been working
with for some time now here's audio
trance
oh geez
we gonna wear that dress you like
skin-tight on my hair up real real nice
and syncopate my skin to your happening
cuz i just wanna look good for you good
for you
oh I just want to look
for you good
Oh me show you how proud I am to be
yours leave this dress a mess on that
floor
for you good for you I'm a more keep
Simon could even make that tiffany just
say give it to you hard so bad so bad
make you never believe and there you
have it folks now sound of course is
best heard in person and when playing
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here I'll be upfront when I first
tested this the sounded a bit muffled
and bass really drone doubt the
mid-range levels from my assessment
however after playing with the roar tera
base and audio profiles in the back
there's a sound signature that I very
much liked with that being said for bass
lovers this does hit deep and more so
than other midsize speakers once tera
base and the warm sound profile is on I
would equate this to the new beat spell
Plus that I reviewed a month ago but
turning on the energized sound profile
from the back end leaving roar on the
mids are much brighter pushing forward
for a nice vocal experience and hearing
little details in this frequency with
the high notes just like the previous
models there's no ear ringing or dinging
and nothing too sharp to cause
unpleasant experiences as for clarity
this still does a great job if you do
turn down those bass features yet again
for bass lovers of course you use those
features for a more enjoyable experience
what I'm trying to say this speaker is
surprisingly good for a wide audience
which some Bluetooth speakers can't do
now the only thing that doesn't seem to
perform as well is sound separation
which is very typical of Bluetooth
speakers in general regarding loudest
this works great in small to medium
sized rooms with enough noise for some
larger areas but compared to the likes
of the JBL extreme or the UE mega boom
despite those being $300 speakers those
can fill up larger open areas better but
compared to other mid sized speakers
like the JBL charge to plus or the Bose
Soundlink mini 2 this does pretty
equivalent now for my tests in movies
the audio is much more immersive and
you'll be able to hear small details in
the background the bass boost does help
with more action like movies with
explosions yet again changing the sound
profile does adjust to your listening
experience the left and right channels
were not as appearance but depth of
sound or music in the background with
active
horses in the foreground does well now
from my experience this is models better
than the speakers on the phone regarding
battery life creative is climbing up to
10 hours of use and with my test at 50%
volume in playing this the entire day
until the battery died I was able to
achieve 8 hours and 40 minutes of use
which for the price of the speaker isn't
really up to par with the other speakers
on the market in this price range other
speakers are hitting double-digit
numbers last name proprietary to the
roar pro is the ability to make a public
address with it sold separately
microphone may be leaving the speaker in
the back of the room where you're
standing in front talking would help
those who basically have a hard time
hearing all the way back there the
microphone picks up my voice very well
the auto projection is strong and the
distance from me walking away has been
around 40 linear feet through several
walls the same performance was also
found playing music from my phone to the
creative roar Pro a personally 40 linear
feet was achieved in my household as
well the only thing that I must warn you
about is if you do use the microphone
when you walk around and hold it or
touch it you'll hear your fingers
rustling against device the microphone
will actually pick that up and put it
through the speaker however there is a
clip on the back of the actual
microphone you can clip that to your
collar which does alleviate most of the
issue so with everything taking into
consideration it's a stellar speaker and
indeed performs and sounds better than
the previous two models but I'll be
honest with you it's not miles different
from the original roar and the roar -
but if you don't own any of the previous
roar speakers and you can get this on
sale for 199 dollars which I've seen
sometimes it's a great deal with tons of
features audio profiles that will meet a
wide audience there's no need to set on
one speaker for a certain sound
characteristic and the audio quality is
still on the best in my opinion for a
Bluetooth speaker so this review helped
