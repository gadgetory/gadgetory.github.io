have been longtime followers you know I
love smartwatches and considering they
do everything these days why would
anyone buy a Fitbit specifically the
charge 3 well considering most
smartwatches not all of them but most of
them are still big and bulky their
better life might not last as long as
activity trackers and as much as I love
the new Apple watch which has everything
you do get what you pay for but those
starting prices they start at $400 there
might just be enough on this thing here
on this Fitbit charge 3 to make it
worthwhile
I personally paid for this at the retail
price of $149 they do come with both
small and large size straps so fit
should not be an issue as always I'll
place my affiliate links that in that
video description below click on those
links for the most updated prices in
real time you never know when these
things might go on sale oh and if you
haven't already be sure to follow me on
Facebook and Instagram my social media
handles are again that in that video
description
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone
going over the physical features first
let's see how it looks on your wrist the
factory band still feels good although
it might be a little stiffer than the
last generation it's still secure though
with this latching strap that they use
and I personally haven't had any kind of
irritation you can be the judge if this
looks good to you or not now you can
change the bands without any tools just
use your finger to press and release and
swap them out for something maybe more
colorful maybe a different texture your
call the screen is hands-down fitbit's
best on the chart series that test this
in bright sunlight and it's very much
visible I know the footage on camera
isn't the best but in person it's bright
the stock screen is large with your
steps up top the time and below is your
heart rate reading more on the accuracy
of that later
now we're clearly not at a smartphone
touch responsiveness but it's greatly
improved and it feels close enough I'm
flipping through the screen so you have
to keep in mind the touch area is still
quite small though and you have to
somewhat exaggerate the movement or
distance to ensure a swipe everyone's
familiar with their smartphone
sensitivity so I just wanted to point
out it's just slightly different on this
either or you're not gonna get pissed
off and initiate that return at least I
don't think so so let's see what we have
swiping up shows you a better life steps
taken and how many steps you have taken
towards your hourly goal mine is at back
250 which I need to get better at here
your heart rate reading with heart rate
zones split into four different
quadrants if you will estimated distance
calories burned flights of stairs climb
with a little staircase icon and your
active minutes last but not least here
is your sleep tracker which I love now
using this highly responsive and
practical pressure-sensitive button on
the left side is simply refreshing here
it's merely used as a back button but
with each press you feel a little
vibration it's satisfying to use in a
non-creepy way that is but since we're
on the home screen here let's swipe down
now this is really cool and finally we
have notifications which allows for a
lot more text to be shown no more
limitation
- a brief summary now it's just a bigger
summary during my time testing most
people's text messages including
messenger allo and Google Hangouts can
be read in its entirety since most
people don't send paragraphs with text
anymore unless you're my ex or so I know
you watch it leave me alone but it's the
same with emails and the other random
notifications and yes within the Fitbit
app you can decide which notifications
you want to come in and which ones you
don't it's pretty awesome now from the
home screen swipe engrain gives you
exercise which continues to break down
further with workout profiles like
running biking swimming treadmills
interval training weights etc and
there's more that you can configure
within the app and with some exercises
like running as an example if you aren't
carrying your phone with you the Fitbit
charge 3 is able to use your phone's GPS
to record and display your distance and
pace and keep in mind it's also much
more accurate to using running as an
example again you can set a goal that
you want to achieve distance time or
calories burned if not just start the
activity the Fitbit will attempt to find
your phones for GPS which is usually
quick from my testing and basically then
you're off running now while running you
have information such as distance so far
pace which is a huge plus and duration
swiping on this screen you have pace
average heart rate with heart rate zones
calories burned steps taken and the time
and what I particularly didn't like when
you accidentally start an activity and
decide you don't want to record it you
have no way of deleting it I wish Fitbit
would recognize this as a workout that
was a little too short or simply just
ask me would you like to save this
activity instead of forcing me to save
it and then possibly sifting through
this data or clutter later and then
deleting it not a big deal but there's
times where you start a run I would fit
over my Bluetooth earphones and then it
records that time is essentially your
pace which is all screwed up and such I
want to start over
you don't want that in your data all
right so back onto the main screen here
there's a feature for you to breathe in
and out with the relax
app boosts basically next is a stopwatch
and countdown
I know many like having
I'm the riskier backing out alarms which
is during my testing this is hands-down
one of the best it's rare that I get
even a SmartWatch this strong hear that
vibrations I believe are enough to wake
up moderate to maybe even deep sleepers
but I do know the sensation is much
stronger than most activity trackers and
smartwatches out there for alerting me
without waking up or bothering those
next to me now for those who are
wondering at the time this video I do
have the newest update which includes
the ability to sent quick replies back
with a predetermined message at the
moment this only works on Android and
with my testing it's convenient when a
family member or so reaches out and you
want to tell them hold on or give me a
second you can customize what message
you want to send within the app - you
don't have to use the defaults now the
other new feature is being able to
accept and reject phone calls with a
check mark or an X respectively not a
test distance and surprisingly I'm able
to still receive a call notification
from 40 linear feet away
the only issue though I encountered when
testing is it only buzzes twice and then
it stops so if I'm not aware of the
vibration initially on my wrist and
might miss it all together and seconds
if I have my phone on vibrate and a
phone call comes in a charge 3 doesn't
vibrate at all that's weird
now after the rejection you can send a
quick text message as well as you can of
course accept a phone call but keep in
mind when you do accept it though there
are no microphones on the activity band
itself you can't talk into it like a
SmartWatch the phone activates so be
sure that your phone is not in your coat
or your butt or whatever it may be now
last but not least is the weather app
which gives me both the highs and lows
with an icon indicating what's happening
for the day sadly I can't tap on today's
date and get an hourly
breakdown nonetheless the weather app is
so pretty handy last but at least our
settings brightness and left on auto and
Good Vibrations by marky-mark I left on
normal not strong that is so with all
those features being mentioned how did
my test perform here goes Fitbit claims
up to seven days
battery life I personally am averaging
six days and eighteen hours battery life
is phenomenal for an activity tracker
the Fitbit is also water resistant up to
50 meters and perfectly fine for
swimming and using in the shower getting
caught in the rain earlier in the week
and simply dunking this in water the
band has been perfectly fine now the
auto exercise feature do work especially
if you're walking around let's say
window shopping or so thank tivity is
tracked and everything is accounted for
even if you do forget now keep in mind
every activity needs to be performed for
a minimum of ten minutes before Fitbit
auto records it as an exercise for
example if you can't keep a consistent
run for more than 10 minutes the
activity is still tracked but it won't
be labeled as an exercise now sleep
tracking has been accurate for me and I
love the data that app accumulates over
time I know I sleep quite late and wake
up quite late too but all that matters
is what you do during the moment that
you're upright but anyways the fitbit
products produces times your awake
there's REM sleep light and deep sleep
and again it's been accurate the syncing
seems to have improved quite a bit as
well I did have trouble setting it up on
my phone initially for some reason but
after I leave EA that turning it on and
off and resetting stuff after the charge
delivers paired I notice my phone would
sync with the band automatically every
10 20 or 30 minutes or so either or want
to check it the stats are relatively
up-to-date now as for heart rate
tracking I always use my chest straps as
a comparison as they've been reliable
time and time again and provide a lot
smoother and consistent data so with my
testing the Fitbit charge 3 still
provides what I deemed generic heartrate
performance you can see my test
on-screen as proof here now with a
consistent run that data and accuracy is
within reason for a risk-based heart
rate tracker if you're doing interval
runs
I noticed that deviations can be as high
as 10 when the activity is somewhat
intense with my assessment and comparing
fitness trackers and smartwatches
over the years a charge 3 again so falls
in that generic category it's still
accurate and good for resting heart rate
measurements daily heart rate
measurements throughout the day those
who want to monitor their heart health
in a general sense and to those who
perform runs that are a consistent
pace the deviation only gets really wide
when again you're doing more intense
workouts hopefully that clears it up for
you guys so over on the charge three
still retains its activity tracking
status and this doesn't necessarily blur
the lines of a SmartWatch it's getting
closer but again fighting tivity band
it's perfectly fine that's what the more
expensive versa and the ionic is for if
you're looking for smart features but
for an activity tracker
this is hands-down one of the best for
how well it works what offers and it's
performance for everyday use overall if
you're considering the charge three
hands down it is worth it alright folks
