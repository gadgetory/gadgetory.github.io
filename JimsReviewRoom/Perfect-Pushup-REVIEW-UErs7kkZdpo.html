now I read across these rotating push-up
handles at the mall the other day from
the company called perfect and I've seen
these in stores for some time now
actually several years actually thinking
that they were a gimmick but I reviewed
their pull-up bar about a year ago and
it is my favorite pull-up bar today so
decided to give these a try and see how
they work as they're only a $20 hit to
the pocket so without further ado we'll
get started now in general these are a
very simple design the handle snaps into
the rotating base and in turn the
rotating base claims to reduce joint
strain and offer less stress to the
wrist when doing your assorted push ups
now the entire unit on the outside is
made of plastic with the handle coated
in a silicone or rubber like material
the same can also be found on the bottom
to prevent any slipping when used on
smooth floor surfaces now these push up
handles on the side warning label states
that you can be up to 300 pounds or 136
kilograms to use this safely and in
general for my tests these do feel
durable and although plastic does not
creak or flex when in use now one of the
things to realize is the perfect push-up
system does challenge your body more
than a standard push-up at home one of
the benefits of using the perfect
push-up is the increased depth of every
push-up you perform increasing the
stretch of your pectoral or chest
muscles and some folks might say why
can't I use a dumbbell then it's true a
flat sided dumbbell will provide the
same deep push-up as the device here but
the base from perfect and it's rubber
grips does make it different that allows
for varying exercises to be performed
from something simple as wider push-ups
where my standard dumbbells would
eventually slip to an inverted hand
position that I felt worked more of my
lower chest and again with this device
being more challenging the free rotating
handles does engage your balancing
muscles specifically your stabilizing
muscles in your shoulders and because of
the rotating base regardless of what
push-up is performed when you're at
maximum depth your wrist will be at a
more neutral position in turn feeling
flesh strain it's not in a fixed
position as doing a traditional pushup
now these works both on my hardwoods and
car
perfectly fine on a low-power rug no
slipping occurred as well overall I
didn't experience any issues and he
performed as they're designed to do with
a variety of exercises now the big
question is is it worth the $20 I'd say
for sure it is if you don't have a pair
of dumbbells at home already no question
these do supplement your regular
push-ups and helps increase range and
motion but again if you already have a
dumbbell you can still achieve similar
to same levels of depth and you can work
on your deltoids with a bit better
results but if you're into push-ups and
don't have a dumbbell set and or would
like a bit flexibility at the wrist then
yes this is a quality product that does
work though so I know this is a short
video but be sure to watch the pull-up
bar video as that's my favorite pull-up
bar of all time and it's actually still
in use today and check out the activity
bands that I reviewed as that may be
something that would pique your interest
as well so be sure to LIKE and subscribe
and again this is Jimmy with Jim's
review room take care everyone
