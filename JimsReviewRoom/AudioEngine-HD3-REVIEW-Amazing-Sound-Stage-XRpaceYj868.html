room I had reviewed the audio engine hd6
a while back and I absolutely loved them
not only great performing speakers but
the connections came with made it very
versatile auto engine sent me the little
brother to my HD 6 these are the HD
threes retailing for 399 dollars what
I'll do is I'll place my Amazon links in
the video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time so without
further ado my channel is here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review go over the
physical features first these come in
walnut cherry and what I have here is
satin black it's a very smooth finish
and cool to the touch almost resembling
a metal box rather than feeling the
traditional woodgrain veneer and the
walnut and cherry options now overall
build quality looks and feels top-notch
from my testing here nothing really
complain about that fabric grille is
magnetized and can be easily taken off
to expose those Kevlar woofers and dome
tweeters now in person they're
surprisingly quite small and they fit
perfectly on my desk here right up to
the edge 9 that left speaker
specifically is your on/off /vy knob to
the right is the 3.5 millimeter port to
connect your headphones then the HD
threes do work as an integrated
amplifier helping to get a bit more
performance in detail from your
headphones now looking at the back of
that left speaker going down the list of
connections traditional left and right
RCA cables three-and-a-half millimeter
input to the right a USB input for audio
directly from your computer and last on
the top right is for the supplied
antenna as like the HD six the HD 3s can
connect through Bluetooth moving down
simply the terminals for connecting the
left speaker to the right base reduction
switch if you do decide to plug in your
subwoofer with the HD 3s here and very
last is the power connection but jumping
to the wires really quicker positive
screen if you have to to see what is in
the box here and what length they are to
ensure that they meet your desk space
needs the one area that I particularly
liked and think is essential to any
speaker the
are they connects between the left and
right channels is it banana plug stop or
quick plug and play
but the terminals on the back of the
left speaker itself gives you the option
of connecting your own wires so if
you're not out of luck if you just need
a certain kind of length anything longer
than what is supplied not testing
bluetooth I was able to walk through my
house here with no problems at all with
my pixel Excel the signal had never cut
out on me
testing these with headphones I didn't
sense improved audio performance on
either my Sennheiser HD 598 name my RH
80/40 earphones versus simply using my
cell phone in comparison the one thing
that was missing from the HD 6 was a
remote control but considering I sit so
close to these things here they're
always with an arm's length while my HD
sixes were more for entertaining
monitoring and movie watching I set of
course much further away from them but
the one thing that I really wish this
had though was an optical in or a speed
of port and that's how some people
pronounce it here for that guaranteed
lossless wired experience either from
your PC and if you're a gamer maybe from
your gaming console Xbox or Playstation
it's not a big deal but you do get a
little bit more performance with those
applicants versus three half millimeter
wires or the RCA cables not to mention
another input source but let's get to
the audio test here I'll play some quick
samples for you guys and then I'll give
you my verdict afterwards
- phone
Oh
multiple contusions detected yeah I
detected that
Oh God you lost this
those wings
two seconds
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded at my end and
then play through your speakers are not
the best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review here the first thing I
noticed right off the bat is sounded as
though there was an audio source right
in front of me as though I had a center
channel not I'm sure I didn't have my
previous speaker plugged in and set back
a second time just to be sure here and
ran through those same tests the
soundstage simply is impeccable and that
would be no questions here something
that you will experience yourself for
the first time when you do put put these
in at your desk and try these it's
surprising how well these two speakers
just these two speakers performed and
not only audio separation basically left
and right audio channels but also
provide an audio reproduction as if
you're right there now I listen to a
live performance by John Legend and you
can hear them on stage in an open stage
in an open arena what-have-you while my
other speakers I'm currently testing
right now cannot reproduce you simply
didn't hear the quote airiness from
channel legends voice when he performed
in such an open space now based on audio
engines recommendations I had these
pairs of speakers here for several weeks
and surely performed at least 40 hours
of burning time for the drivers to
stretch their legs a bit and again
that's per audio engines recommendations
here for a 2.0 system bass is full and
very much enjoyable for not having a
subwoofer at times for very few select
John Rose though or songs where low bass
resonates there is an ever so slight
amount of droning at higher volumes now
of course those desire for that added
punch a two point one system or better
yet adding your own sub does help with
the matter as you'll have the bass
reduction switch on the back turned on
now the mids are plenty clear and the
soundstage again helps greatly with the
overall immersion of any audio
experience here I would personally
prefer a slightly brighter mid-range and
have the vocals stand out just a little
bit more but overall the audio
characteristics are accurate coming
directly from the factory the highs
never attained or was ever ear
screeching there's no listening fatigue
from my experience and that's worth
listening with these for some time and
even gaming on these for two to three
hours straight I can at least say the HD
3s will sound phenomenal to most people
especially to the average consumer
playing with these same high-quality
flat files on my desktop through that
wired connection
and switching it to bluetooth my
cellphone here you can tell Bluetooth
sounds slightly lower in volume and you
do lose some of the very fine my new
details even though there's apt decks
involved or included with these speakers
for the average consumer and even myself
though audio is of course objective but
my reviews again are geared towards the
average consumer if I didn't switch them
back and forth from Wired and Bluetooth
I honestly could not tell now testing
these with gaming hands down the best
2.0 systems I've used so far again that
soundstage is impeccable and when I'm
not using my headsets the openness of
these speakers as it does for music
gives almost this 3d effect as if I'm
actually bear watching these with movies
at times especially sitting close to
these and listening at higher volumes
there is an ever so slight droning of
bass especially in action movies but
overall it's not bad or wouldn't deter
anyone from purchasing overall you
really get what you paid for you get an
amazing 2.0 sound system in such a small
package and keep in mind you still get
Bluetooth or wireless performance out of
a traditional looking bookshelf speaker
I love these now if you're planning on
using these mostly at the desk
forget the HD sixes save yourself some
money the HD threes are plenty again if
you're using this right at your desktop
again the biggest selling point on these
is how loud these little things get the
clarity and fidelity you also achieve
with a wired connection and last the
openness of its soundstage absolutely
makes the HD threes shine so that's it
