room Microsoft releases its fourth
iteration of the surface pro and
although this looks very much similar to
all the previous models what is under
the hood are its biggest changes I
personally paid $1,000 for the second to
last model offered by Microsoft and this
comes with 128 gigabyte hard drive four
gigs of RAM and the new I 5 Skylink
processor now you can click on the link
in the video description below to see
the most updated pricing so without
further adieu I'm here to help you make
a purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review
going over the physical features
although the width and the height stays
exactly the same
the pro4 gets seven percent thinner
coming in at eight point five
millimeters versus nine point one at the
surface pro 3 the weight is also reduced
and now weighs in at 786 grams or one
point seven three pounds with its
magnesium alloy and very durable chassis
from my testing the lightness and
thinness compared to a traditional
laptop or even an ultrabook to be honest
with you makes for one very portable
device but let's go around the pro four
and see what it has to offer
starting at the top you have your power
on and off with vibe rocker buttons
nearby to the right is a mini
DisplayPort USB 3.0 and unique to the
surface line eight magnetic charging
ports for the supplied power adapter now
it is convenient and makes for a refined
feel and it does somehow stay on pretty
well against minor poles and tugs and
the very bottom features very strong
magnets as well for optional accessories
the most popular being the new Microsoft
type cover and it's priced at 129
dollars retail as of this video and it
is unfortunately sold separately there
is a nice smooth faux suede texture here
in the back and once the cover is open
of course it reveals the backlit keys
everything is very much tactile and very
responsive new to the type cover is a
bigger track pan that's now glass versus
plastic that was used on the older
generations it's offering a smoother
finish responsive touch gestures and
movements the only real issue that I've
found with the keyboard itself using
this in the library or at night next to
someone sleeping but clicking is quite
loud but back to the pro for itself
rotating to the left there's a three in
half millimeter port for headphones and
last is this little notch in helping you
pull out the stand the metal stand
articulates and holds its position very
stiff for my testing and lays almost
completely flat I believe it's a hundred
and fifty degrees now while back here
hidden nearly out of sight behind the
stand is a slot for a micro SD card for
expandable storage and rotating to the
other side all dual front facing
speakers which I am not kidding are the
best speakers on a tablet or mainstream
laptop that I've tested stereo
separation and an open soundstage are
present even at medium volume really
impress
for built-in speakers so with my
experience in time testing compared to
laptops the slim profile and the
lightness is great compared to tablets
this does unfortunately feel a little
bit heavier and of course thicker but I
really don't mind it the pro floor feels
more like a slate than a super-thin
tablet on a market yet it still provides
this feeling of a beefy machine rugged
in a sense now the only thing that I
could caution or would caution for the
average consumer if you are using this
on your lap either sitting in a chair or
in the bed it's a little bit less stable
than your traditional laptop you gotta
get used to it a little bit here and
when using this for work as I felt only
having one USB port was a bit limiting
especially after I plugged in my
wireless mouse having another port for
connecting maybe a five and one card
reader would have been great if I'm
working with photos and video from my
camera those seeking those extra
connections need to look at a new
surface book from Microsoft but let's
move on to the screen and I haven't
forgotten the Microsoft pen that comes
with the pro 4 although the size is
virtually the same the screen gets
slightly bumped up from 12 inches to 12
point 3 now regardless the screen is
still very sharp vibrant and accurate
the blacks in movies are dark enough and
I'm relieved to see there's no screen
bleeding the resolution is bumped up
from 2160 by 1440 to 27 36 by 1824 I
know it sounds a little bit weird here
but let me explain a little bit later
now this translates to a very nice pixel
density for a large tablet or laptop
coming in at 267 pixels per inch the
more within a score inch the more
density the clearer sharper the image
would be the one thing the average
consumer needs to be aware about is the
screen ratio is not your mainstream 16
by 9 or even the 4 by 3 it's actually 3
to 2 and doing a bit more research on
this this unique ratio is geared towards
those in design artwork and other such
activities but web browsing everyday use
this ratio didn't impact my experience
where I noticed something if anything
that was off now regarding the supplied
pen here the surface pro 3 offered 256
levels of sensitivity with this year's
model we're looking at 1024 levels for
improved accuracy and flexibility a huge
leap making handwriting to drawing and
this seemed that much more natural now
the eraser like clicker on top opens
OneNote so you can jot down information
on the fly and a double click here takes
a screenshot
of your desktop and brings you into
OneNote as well then we can scribble all
over that screenshot you just took come
with these surface pro for the pen has a
strong magnet to stick on either side of
the surface and through my testing
carrying this around town for a day the
pen actually stayed on but I'll miss
having peace of mind is quite difficult
considering how crucial this pen is and
this hybrid now regarding software and
its experience I'll put the specs on the
screen this is running Windows 10 with
Intel's newest high-five skylake
processor since the surface line is
geared towards designers and whatnot for
my ruh-roh tests I usually Pro for for
everything that I personally use in my
personal business
besides email and heavy web use
multitasking multiple programs open they
honestly ran perfectly fine but I want
to show my experience with my most
demanding apps at the dhobi Photoshop
Lightroom and Premiere CC all the many
programs when you're especially working
with huge files now Adobe Premiere is
what I used to add all my videos and for
the most part this worked decent not
perfect as you do see some stirring
movements when working within the
program such as resizing or moving your
layers around
however video playback and scrubbing
through your files works at full
resolution at 1080p that's great
it's not the smoothest in the world by
granted there's always an i7 processor
available that may help with processing
the video a little bit better now as
we're both Lightroom and Photoshop this
is where the pen comes in handy for
precision brush strokes to highlighting
areas the pen is also pressure sensitive
to allow more or less color to be
applied and this truly felt natural
obviously much better than the mouse
both Lightroom and Photoshop worked
without a hitch on my very large photo
sizes and now those who are interested
in gaming this thing runs actually like
a beast for a tablet like device now I'm
not aiming for ultra settings but
thoroughly impressed this can play
general games like rocket league here
without much issue and high settings
without a dedicated graphics card
testing this with these Sims 4 on Ultra
settings it's not the smoothest frame
rate for framerate junkies you do see
some frames clipping but considering
this remains stable impress this can
play soon the more generic mainstream
games today Tony this down to high or
even medium settings who of course offer
you the best results and last with the
surface pro and pro 2 they did have some
heating issues where the rear would
become quite
Hut the pro three did improve a good bit
and here with the skylight processor
this does seem to run cooler than its
predecessor I don't have a way to do a
side-by-side comparison
however under load the profile runs warm
to slightly hot as most laptops our
devices do but never felt like it was
too hot to become a concern and
regarding better life I would have hope
for stellar battery life with the new
processor once again but I just averaged
about 7 hours and 20 minutes I would hit
maybe the high 6 hour mark if I'm
watching video in the upper seven hour
mark if I'm just browsing online for
that particular day so overall from my
experience indeed this is a pricey tool
in anyone's room there's no question
about that
now once I start seeing these keyboards
come with these devices I think then
more people are willing to swallow the
price point but overlooking price if you
need or you're okay with this aspect
ratio and value this form factor with a
stylus this is a seriously great device
not to mention the portability of a
tablet that's running a native computer
operating system Windows 10 of course
not Android or iOS so hope this review
helped you in some way write down below

are considering or buying this let us
