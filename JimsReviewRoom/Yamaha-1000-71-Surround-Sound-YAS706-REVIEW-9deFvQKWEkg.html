room many of you have asked and I'm
finally starting at my channel and
reviewing some bars for your home
entertainment today we're looking at one
from Yamaha this one features air
ceramic stream essentially a virtual 7.1
surround sound experience plus it comes
with a dedicated wireless subwoofer the
model number is on your screen and the
sambar retails for $1,000 at the time
this video making this one premium
option when you compare it to the
competition
as always I'll place my affiliate links
in the video description below click on
those links and they'll give you the
most updated prices in real time you
never know when these things might go on
sale so sit back relax and hopefully my
videos will help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review
go over the physical features first the
sambar is much more compact than what I
anticipated for its price the yama has a
slim profile that lays flat on the table
as shown in the video right now or the
other option is having the ability to be
wall-mounted the only issue though the
retail box does not include any wall
mounting screws and subwoofer itself
looks like a perfect cube here at every
angle satisfying my OCD for sure the
subwoofer is also quite small measuring
12 inches in nearly every direction now
rotating to the rear
there's no knobs to adjust base levels
or gain but simple enough of wireless
pairing status lights in two physical
connections to the sambar are offered by
getting back to that main sound bar
looking at the rear there are a decent
amount of connections to HDMI inputs
with one HDMI out with an audio return
channel now I'll place all my
annotations on your screen pause if you
need to if you want to see all the
connections that are available but while
I'm talking about connections here the
last connection and a unique feature
with Yamaha that it offers what they
call music cast it allows other music
cast enabled speakers to push audio over
your Wi-Fi network and have music place
throughout your home now I have the
Yamaha WX - 0 1 0 which can function by
itself I can also pair this with the
sound bar and have both speakers play
the same song at the same time if I link
them together or I can technically kids
who separates or you play one song on
the sound bar and play a completely
different song on the WX 0 1 0 now all
this can be controlled through the music
test app that's available on both Apple
and Android and with the Yamaha sound
bar you can have Pandora Spotify and a
few other streaming services as shown on
your screen streamed for entertainment
it doesn't have to use your phone's data
or Internet service if you don't want to
use Wi-Fi you can always use Bluetooth
as well to play music directly off your
phone as an alternative now right before
I get into the sound test I want to go
over what audio formats this sound bar
covers it nearly has everything which is
great but the only one that's stood out
from this speakers price range it
doesn't have Dolby Atmos now there are
indeed other speakers specifically
Samsung and LG that comes to mind here
offering premium sound bars with Dolby
Atmos built-in and at times a hundred to
two hundred dollars cheaper for the
price range I was expecting Yamaha to be
up there with the latest in Dolby
technology
so - the moment you've been waiting for
here I'll play several audio tests be
sure to put on your headphones or
earphones to achieve the best listening
experience
and not mode okay completely bulletproof
I'm machine-washable diamond that's a
new feature what on earth do you think
the baby will be doing I'm sure I don't
know darling
luck favours the prepare your soul
construct as wise you can not injure
yourself and still retain its shape its
way indestructible
put them down
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded on my end and
then played through your speakers are
not the best depiction of audio quality
but hence my review here the first thing
that you will notice Yamaha sambar is
very clear there's tons of resolution
there's tons of detail as well a
soundstage is also quite impressive that
audio separation has one the best that
I've experienced for a summer that does
not have Gobi ammos now jumping over to
bass I do admit though this is where I
found it somewhat lacking though I had
to turn up bass levels to maximum to
achieve what I thought was a suitable
level now this did help make movies
somewhat more immersive music with bass
players more noticeable overall it's not
distorted and quite neutral or flat for
my taste but having a bit more bass for
entertainment would have been much more
ideal as for actors voices vocals and
music and most of the details that you
would hear in the mid-range the Yamaha
is impressive in this feat voices are
always clear it's always distinct it's
very much forward for an easy to follow
and easy to listen to experience unless
even blasting us at high bottoms the
speaker thankfully isn't sharp and ear
ringing or ear tinging at the very high
frequencies it's pronounced and reaches
a level that does sound satisfying for
jets flying by are those loud Scrooge's
and screams during those scary movies
now last as a side note I notice the
speaker featuring just 285 watts of
total power
I usually don't base my reviews off of
pottage alone but I did notice in
real-world testing for $1000 sound bar
as expecting a louder experience to
really fill up a room or to really be
able to experience the immersion of a
movie now I would say the strong suit
for the speaker is its clarity fidelity
detail and it works great in small to
medium sized rooms it's possible it's
not too loud because of its slim profile
but I do admit having a sambar that
isn't gargantuan is it positive that it
can't disregard overall with my
assessment if you have the money in a
small area to medium sized space a
speaker will do well but for
the same amount of money there might be
better alternatives out there so that's
it for this review I hope to help do in
some way be sure to support the channel
by liking and subscribing if you haven't
already I'll have more some bars coming
down the road
so be at the lookout you guys take care
and I'll see you guys on the next one
