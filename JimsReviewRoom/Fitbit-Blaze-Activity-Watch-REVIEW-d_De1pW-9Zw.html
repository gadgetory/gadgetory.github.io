released with OLED and other colorful
displays none of them I feel has
perfected what consumers are desiring
today the garmin vivoactive worked well
but the display was dark and not as
vibrant and the polar a360 was indeed
bright and very smooth to use but it
lacked true message notifications not to
mention the HR sensor from my test was
very off today we're looking at the
Fitbit blaze it's priced at 199 dollars
retail as of this video but for more
updated pricing click on my link in the
video description below for the most
up-to-date prices so without further
adieu and sorry about the slight delay
here and getting this video out to my
followers but I really want to
thoroughly test the place for you guys
now I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and
my channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
going over the physical features first
the very familiar texture returns
offering a simple yet unique modern feel
the band comes with a very secure watch
like buckle to latch into place and the
entire time of wearing this it's been
very comfortable and secure from my
experience wearing this with long sleeve
shirts hasn't been an issue as it
doesn't snag too much as some activity
bands are just too thick and it gets
caught on the cuff small large sizes are
available with no medium since there's a
good amount of notches to accommodate
most wrist sizes but for me the small
size barely fit I would suggest looking
into the bigger model if you need to now
one other feature that I always love to
see there's quick release pins on the
rear here offering you to swap out
different styles even to a metal band
but I'll mid wearing stainless steel on
the wrist could be a bit pricey for some
coming in at a hundred and thirty
dollars nonetheless having the other
options though I'm really diggin it the
bezel now is stainless steel very
durable against wearing scratches but
for those who don't know the brains of
the Fitbit is fitted inside this frame
to charge the device there is the
nuisance of taking the tracker out and
putting it into the proprietary case
charging from a dead battery to fall
from my test had taken about an hour and
a half which isn't too bad when
comparing with the competition and
putting the tracker back in you would
have to align all sides equally before
pushing in and for first-timers let's
just take a little bit more
consciousness than many other bands I
don't think it's a deal killer since
Fitbit is claiming you only need to do
this up to every five days and that's
how long the battery lasts but for my
testing from a full battery till it died
it proved the blaze lasted five days
twenty three hours and two minutes to be
precise the average for all activity
bands have been around five to seven
days
so the blaze is somewhat in the middle
to lower and regarding battery life
nonetheless compared to smartwatches the
average of those lasts about a day and a
half to two days looking at the rear of
the tracker is the heart rate sensor
utilizing pure pulse technology which
appears to be marketed as an improvement
in their heart rate readings I'll detail
my heart rate test a little towards the
end of this video but overall and in
general the physical side of things
that's built well from my time of
testing buttons are very tactile the
wear factor so far has been impressive
and my screen hasn't shown any signs of
scratches just yet but before getting
into this and to be fair and to set up
proper expectations for my viewers this
is not a SmartWatch although this has
some SmartWatch like features you guys
have to understand
this is an activity or Fitness watch
first and foremost you're unfortunately
not getting weather updates you can't
respond to text messages like some
smartwatches you're also not getting
those powerful Snapdragon processors we
find on say a moto 360 or huawei
SmartWatch but let's do a quick walk
through and see all the features now
similar to smartwatches the display
remains off to save battery and with a
flick of the wrist pointed at your face
the display turns on and it turns out as
well and as accurate as most other
smartwatches on the market the main face
that shows your time and with a ring
here that progresses as you've taken
more steps throughout the day and with a
smaller info area in the bottom for the
date pulse distance calories burned
floors climbed and your total steps you
can change the display with any of these
four options currently available you can
pause the screen if you need to to check
these out here but while on the main
screen swiping from the top down offers
you to turn notifications from your
smartphone and media controls which
confirm to work with my Android devices
so Iping from the bottom up this is
where you can review all of your
notifications and testing this this does
review an entire message and not just a
summary like I said earlier this is a
fitness band first with some SmartWatch
features being second now don't expect
being able to send messages back from
the blaze or any fitness band at the
moment at least the ones that I'm aware
of now back on the main screen scrolling
right offers of your stats so far for
the day including steps your heartbeat
and your resting heart beat distance
calories burned and your floor's climbed
backing out and moving into the next
greenness exercise enabling you to track
your runs cycling weightlifting sessions
treadmill use elliptical time and
general workouts if you go into your
Fitbit account online you can add the
following on your screen here onto the
band as well now regarding running and
cycling the Fitbit blaze does rely on
your phone's GPS and I know many we're
bummed about this especially for those
who don't carry their phones for music
already
sadly the GPS feature isn't built-in now
from my testing I did one run with GPS
on and also have my polar m400 which has
GPS built in and stopped after I did a
mile
both were within range by a difference
of point zero 1 of a mile so that's very
accurate now I did test two with no GPS
on theblaze same distance in the band
recorded 0.96 miles for every mile that
I would do without the GPS I was around
200 feet
off it's not much but for those running
very long distances the variation does
add up but if you do have GPS and
getting back onto the display this is
what your screen would look like real
time heart rate which is sampled every
second your duration pace average pace
your calories burn so far steps taken
the time and last is distance and if
you're into weightlifting which a lot of
fans on my channel ask for
there's heart rates again real time
duration calories burned and the time
are displayed and moving back to the
main area we have fit star which is
essentially coaching sessions on your
wrist here if you're into that kind of
thing there's a good bit of instructions
for each and once you start each
exercise
they'll play an animation to demonstrate
each one here if you don't know what
they're talking about now fit start
works great but it would have been much
much better if it also counted reps
considering it has motion detection
every fitness band does but sadly this
doesn't do that now some of the very
last items there's a separate screen for
a stopwatch and one for a countdown
timer which are self explanatory silent
vibrating alarms are next that displays
what alarms you have set previously and
you can turn it on from here but you
can't set which day or time though that
has to be done through the app now the
vibrations after testing so many bands
here the blaze felt to be a moderate
sensation but not the strong wrist but
not the weakest either I'm a light
sleeper though so keep that in mind and
last are your settings which are all
self-explanatory here when I scroll
through the screens for you as you
probably can tell already the display
isn't as fluid as a SmartWatch because
of its Fitness band processor and when I
first bought this the screen would
sometimes stutter on occasion but after
a week of using this the stutters are
gone but the touch sensitivity for some
odd reason as I'm demonstrating gear and
why the past min of this video has been
pretty choppy the blaze has a somewhat
difficult time with reading my taps the
first time now I'm hoping a firmware
update can adjust this issue right away
but giving credit where credit's due
compared to all other activity bans most
of the market doesn't have a display
like this they're just black and white
or just really lackluster in general and
you're really paying for this beautiful
display that they have here but
regarding brightness and my camera isn't
doing the best job here but surprisingly
this is mostly visible in direct
sunlight you shouldn't have an issue in
nearly every environment that you'll be
in and the band is only splash proof and
you weren't thrilled to hear that so you
can't wear this to swim nor submerging
it is the best idea but simple test here
and does verify and prove that is
water-resistant on my end so let's take
a look here at one of my most favorite
apps here of any activity band the
Fitbit app this works for both Apple and
Android but also on windows phones and
you can connect this directly to your PC
for uploading and syncing now on the
main page very simple to read here with
a huge list of all your metrics you need
to review there's progress shown by
numbers with your goals designated on
the right side and almost all of your
metrics has a color-coded bar here going
horizontally
changing color as you progress steps are
shown beats per minute are displayed and
if you are not in an activity the blaze
samples your heart rates every 5 seconds
now when you are in an activity it will
read and display your heart rates at
every second now resting heart rate is
displayed which is a very great
indicator of heart health and for me
personally it did read a bit higher
though than what I've been measuring
myself and from my under armour fitness
band it's on average about 8 to 10 beats
higher for some reason regarding heart
rate accuracy it's still not perfect
like the previous Fitbit products are
reviewed however there seems to be some
promise though when running colder
weather around 40 degrees it's been a
bit off and this happens several times
and unfortunately I don't have the
graphs on those however it's been
warming up lately and the results did
improve a good bit but not
hundred-percent the initial start of
each run about two minutes in are always
off oddly but the rest of the chart
compared to the chest strap here proved
to be very close with each other no
chest steps are still the most accurate
but seeing an improvement in fitbit's
risk trackers is in the right direction
now going back to the app we've touched
on steps and heart rate the next is
distance floors climbed calories burned
active minutes as the band knows if
you've been walking for 15 minutes or
longer it'll then record that data as an
activity for you there's track your
exercise your weight the amount of sleep
that you have and you can manage your
food intake just like my Fitness Pal and
last you can log-in your water intake
manually here but looking at all these
categories on an individual basis
clicking on steps for example Fitbit has
always provided so much data for anyone
to review a very easy to read bar graph
up top to compare your week below are
your absolute numbers and stars
indicating if you beated your goal or
not and if that goal is adjustable
another tab breaks it down by the hour
for your review and now going back out
here and go into the heart rate section
a linear graph showing your resting
heart rate again it was higher than what
I've tested on myself but your heart
rate is shown throughout the day below
tapping on each breaks it down further
and gives you an idea if you're burning
fat versus cardio versus maxing your
heart rate now going back to the main
screen distance floors climbed calories
burned and active minutes looks
practically the same but I want to touch
base on sleep it's for the most part
accurate with basic sleep analysis
detailing how long you slept for how
many times you woke up and moments you
were Restless the data is good for a
generic tracker as most trackers
displays very similar information but
those looking into something much deeper
look into the jump on up 3 or the basis
peak other than looking at the hard core
metrics so you can compare yourself over
time which is highly beneficial and why
you would buy any of these fitness
trackers Fitbit does offer a good
variety of extra features in the
third-party menus you have challenges
you can try to overcome and earn badges
and random accolades backing out if you
have friends with Fitbit so you can
compare your numbers with theirs and the
only other area I would want to show you
are these silent vibrating alarms now
this works great and surprisingly other
activity bans don't even offer this you
can schedule individual days while the
other bands again can only be set for
weekdays or just weekends again with
Fitbit you do have more flexibility so
overall from my opinion this still
doesn't seem like a big leap bridging
the gap of activity bands and
smartwatches but this has to be the
closest it's been into the new garmin
vivosmart HR that is released and we'll
see how that one goes for the time being
fit bits are still not 100% accurate but
I can say this is a serious improvement
overall when comparing to the previous
generations if you don't need GPS or if
you're fine carrying your phone for GPS
while running the blaze I think is a
great band in general now Fitbit has
always in my eyes been able to offer
some of the most well-rounded
experiences for the average consumer and
some fitness enthusiasts so that's it
