review room now I reviewed several
Sennheiser headphones in the past and
they seriously do produce some really
clean clear and for sure loud sound but
Sennheiser this time is taking a
different focus emphasizing on bass and
more focus as well on the urban scene
with this new lineup the urbanites now I
have both the on ear model
priced at $199 as of this video and the
over ears also known as the XL are
priced at just $50 more at two hundred
and forty nine dollars so without
further ado welcome to another review
going over the physical features first
these are only more fashion focused
headphones I've tested they come in five
different colors and all features this
nylon braided material on top with the
cross stitching to give a bit of
contrast now underneath you have a
cream-colored silicone which is smooth
and I mean very smooth and it's actually
cool to the touch now I notice that
there is a much padding but more on my
comfort test later now moving down the
construction is very solid metal hinges
and screws create a very cliquey
faulting gear cup but better yet there
really hasn't been any noises of
cracking or plastics grinding that I
felt would break over time now
stretching the headband itself shown
these headphones to be very durable
again with no feeling that these will
break now the ear cups are adjustable
similar to these Sennheiser Momentum's
which freely slides up and down and with
this design it always surprises me that
they actually stay in place when worn
they don't adjust when you turn your
head or reach over and grab things
now the ear cups do swivel enough I
believe to fit most heads with pivoting
up and down to be somewhat limited
nonetheless they still fitted perfectly
fine on my head now the wires connecting
into the headphones are very soft and
retract every time I adjusted the
headphones and going into the air cut
themselves is a nice subtle touch of
chrome accents a white band goes around
the ear cups as well to provide some
contrast and last is the removable
velour earpads now unfortunately no
other ear pads came in the box and
speaking of other items included there's
a 1.2 meter or almost 4 foot cable with
one end being a 9
degree Bend and the other that goes
directly into the headset with a locking
mechanism and I wish all headsets had
these because sometimes you accidentally
yank that cable and it does fall out now
there is an inline controller that hangs
about where your chin starts and it's
news to adjust the volume skip songs and
answer your phone calls over all the
buttons are very clicky and responsive
and when answering phone calls on the go
the sound quality is on par with most
other headsets now nothing stellar but
it's still clear and no complaints on
the other end and last in the box is a
polyester similar to Under Armour
fitness apparel material that is to show
your headphones away now I wish there
was a hard case instead for added
protection while in my backpack but
these are definitely easier for
portability and takes up less space so
onto the meat of the review here the
comfort test and the sound quality now
first for the on ears with my testing
and where the headphones for at least
four hours straight just to feel any
tension along the crown of the head and
as stated earlier there wasn't much
padding but the headphones are actually
comfortable up top I didn't feel it
weighing down in my head and this was
the same experience with the XL model as
well now regarding compression on the
jawbone and jaw line unlike some other
brands where they do clamp a little bit
too hard no such experience was found on
the urbanites overall it's been
surprisingly comfortable to wear for
extended periods of time now the only
thing that I noticed though the on ears
which just sits on your ears of course I
noticed it do wobble a bit just feeling
slightly loose you can say in your head
now if I'm working and grabbing items
from my desk bedding down looking up a
top band does slightly slide require me
to periodically adjust the headphones
however the over ear gives me a bit more
peace of mind staying on the head and he
doesn't present the same issue now the
cushions do work well just warming my
ears up but I never had any sweating
issues in general on my ears now in
regards to sound leaking trying on the
on ears first with volume set 75% which
is loud enough for enjoyable but
comfortable listening and you can still
hear a little music spilling out to your
surroundings
now as where the xl's since they do
enclose your entire year more sound is
isolated but some sounds still leak a
little bit through though
and for the part of the review that
you've been waiting for the sound test
both the on ears and the Excel retains
Sennheiser's clean audio with no
distortion whatsoever
both headphones do offer very loud sound
as I leave it at 75% volume and it's
loud enough while other headphones at
times other brands that is I can leave
it at 100% and it's still tolerable the
voices are clear and clean without
sounding bright they sound good for
casual listening and does very well in
genres more focused on mid-range and
high notes genres like pop rock folk
more acoustic sounding music try Sam
Smith John Legend and other similar
artists now the urbanites I would say
does good in hip-hop but ok and wrap the
urbanites felt as though it really
stayed close to these Sennheiser
characteristics which is more of a
balanced tune and sound ranges working
together but considering the urbanites
are marketed to be bass focused I
thought the bass should have hit a
little bit harder now if you're looking
for a deep sub bass there's other brands
out there specifically the beats solo
Tunes now for more balanced sound with
bass up a notch but not dominant these
are still the way to go though now it's
a good median for those who wanting some
thump while retaining more of an
accurate sound range now as for the
difference the over ears does provide a
bit more passive sound isolation since
it covers the entire ear but
surprisingly or unsurprisingly if you
look at the back of the box and look at
the specs the and ears are a hear louder
and offers a bit more detail
a perfect example when listening to
happy' by pharrell right at they one
minute and 55 second mark when the
course and the background repeats the
word happy and it becomes louder it's
more pronounced at the on ears then so
with the over ears it's only noticeable
when I switch between the headphones
though so overall the construction is
great comfort wise these hasn't been
really an issue the sound quality is
good for its price range but considering
again the marketing is towards bass
lovers they might have to look somewhere
else so I hope this video helped you in
