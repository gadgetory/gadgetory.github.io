technological side of fitness I reviewed
their health box a few weeks back which
includes an activity tracker smart scale
and heartrate chest strap but today I'll
be reviewing their new Under Armour
speedform Gemini 2 with record equipped
this is a smart shoe measuring your
performance while running and all that
fun stuff but I'll get into the
technical details later now this is
priced at $150 retail as of this video
but I'll have some updated prizes in the
link in the video description below just
in case prices do fluctuate so without
further ado my name is Jimmy with Jim's
review room and my channel is here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
going over the physical features the
smart shoe only comes in one color
graphite which I was a bit bummed to see
considering the regular Gemini twos
comes with a variety of unique looks and
styles its objective but comment below
if you like how this one looks now deep
inside of the sole of the shoe is a
sensor reading all of your metrics for
running the sensor doesn't make the shoe
much heavier but in general comparing to
the likes of the Nike Flyknit these
aren't the lightest pairs or it doesn't
give you that sense of airiness if you
guys understand what I'm trying to say
here nonetheless these are for sure
lighter and more breathable than the
average tennis shoe and because they're
not the lightest shoes though that
trade-off is extra supports for the sole
of the feet here
Under Armour uses dual layers of charge
cushioning and that's what they call it
here basically a pretty hefty amount of
shock absorption for the back of the
heel into the arch now speaking of the
hill there's tons of support here
cupping the rear of your foot for
stability but one ear have noticed the
upper lip does arch in a good bit and
for me personally on my right ankle in
terms of walking and running did cause
some abrasion slightly loosening the
Gemini shoes did help but again
everyone's foot is a little bit
different so hopefully you won't have
the same problem by getting into the
attacking side of things let's take a
look at their app with purchasing these
shoes you do get an entire year of their
premium service free essentially
becoming what they call an MVP member
format my run on the front page we get
coaching to supplement your activity
live tracking which is an MVP feature
that allows other met my fitness users
to track your progress along a route
that you've created
now activity is below to segment your
workout session and as you can see it's
pretty robust here but backing out to
the main page your distance is shown
with the type of gear that you have
connected and of course it's my shoes
and while you're running as stated
earlier distances shown duration current
pace and cadence now once you're
finished you can review your entire run
or workout here you can look at your
workout details with information I just
mentioned earlier of course next is
solely elevation changes here on the
screen the following screen is the
correlation of pace versus elevation
changes and the same with cadence and
again elevation with your average and
Max steps per minute as you can see my
cadence numbers surely suggest I need
improvement in running the average
recreational runner average is about 150
to 170 steps per minute and that's just
one example where having cadence
information can help
improve your efficiency I'm moving down
to the app here moving through the app
here you can have race splits and a
comment or a note section below so
that's really the meat in the bones of
the shoe and it's app here Matt my run
is free and it comes with many of the
features that you see here so far not to
mention it's one of the most versatile
apps available on the market connecting
to nearly every other device besides
Under Armor stuff but you can download
it yourself on either the Play Store for
Google or the App Store for iOS and take
a look for yourself and the only thing
that I wouldn't mention here the shoe
does have a 400 mile range when you are
active if you're not running the shoes
won't activate and the battery won't
drain neither 400 miles or wearing this
for an entire year should be good enough
at maximum as it's highly beneficial of
course to get new shoes after putting a
good bit of wear on them over time now
you want to protect your joints of
course as best as you can now again for
$150 it may seem pricey at first but if
you need new running shoes you don't
want to get an activity band and desire
to see your performance log in real time
without you needing to count your own
steps manually here a Gemini 2 with
record equipped is worth a consideration
