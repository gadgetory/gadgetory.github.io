room with all this activity bands that
have been reviewing the one area of tech
that I've missed has been smart scales
Fitbit introduced the Aria scale back in
2012 Withings has their own since 2009
but new to the market polar has theirs
this year with their polar balance
it's priced at $100 retail as of this
video I'll place a link in the video
description below click on that and you
can see what the most updated prices are
today so without further adieu my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review
going over the physical features first
it's really straightforward with a
smooth glass top a display for your
weight and per Polar's website at splash
proof and the bottom does feature stable
rubber grips on each end here and under
the cover up top houses three Triple A
batteries in which polar does include in
the package regarding capabilities the
scale does work without the need of a
polar activity band as it can sync to
your phone via bluetooth smart but if
you did have a polar band like the V 800
m 400 or in the loop model the wrist
unit will give you a personalized
activity goal based on your current
weight target and I'll show you where in
how the weight targets work once I can
get into the app you also have the
ability to sync your weight to the band
without your phone if you can find that
more convenient the only thing that I
really saw lacking from a physical
standpoint is a scale not having Wi-Fi
built-in like some of the other
competitors now Wi-Fi would have allowed
you to sync without the need of either
your phone or the activity ban itself
and last the scale can be used by up to
10 different people per Polar's website
so now we're going to take a look at the
polar flow app see what this can read
and see if the app is helpful in any way
looking at the polar flow f if you tap
on the menu icon just select the scale
with the word balance next to it at the
very top of the app is your weight
target which you can only input and
adjust any polar flow website I'll show
you that very soon but in the middle is
the amount of weight that you have
gained or lost when you first started
and last on the right or how many days
you have left to try to meet your target
weight down below polar appears to love
using these wheels here to illustrate
your progress after each weigh-in and
activity you'll see a scale in the
middle here lean one way or the other
the left side will point to either if
you're gaining or losing weights and to
the right is an estimation of how many
pounds are gaining or losing in a given
month for me here you can see I've been
maintaining that lean 145 pound range
but after family coming over and my
mother's cooking things have started to
creep up a little bit here but polar is
promoting that there's no need to have
food diaries or estimations on calorie
intake which for some people may be a
huge benefit or huge relief while others
may prefer something a little bit more
analytical now polar takes the approach
as you can see here in the next section
of the screen by offering a calorie
deficit it doesn't go full-blown and say
the less that you eat but don't eat
anything whatever it may be the more
weight that you lose we all know that's
not the healthiest approach but polar
provides smarter estimates and how much
less you should eat based on your daily
weigh-ins and the amount of activity
that you have been performing you can be
the judge of that will work for you and
for your lifestyle or not but on the
right is your activity suggested for
that day to help you stay on track to
reach your target weight now your
generic daily goal for activities
performed that we've seen on so many
activity bands already but your activity
is adjusted specific to you based on
your way in moving down the app is your
linear graph with triangles representing
your weight registered by the scale the
yellow line represents my trend the blue
line is the trend that I need to stay on
to reach my dieting goals now the only
thing that I wish show down here is my
activity as this is shown on the polar
float websites but oddly not on the app
moving down the polar flow app here does
provide your body mass index which is
pretty straightforward as you can see on
the screen and the very last feature you
can initiate your scale to measure with
the icon on the top right and before
concluding this video as I stated
earlier the only way to adjust your
weight target is through the polar flow
website which you can see on your screen
now this looks nearly identical to the
app but this
have some additional information that
could benefit you very easily from here
you can adjust the target from the top
right and that's basically it
everything else is adjusted and
automated the main screen on both the
polar flow website and the app will
guide you along with the information
that I discussed earlier so overall for
the scale how do I feel about this now I
really love the target setting as each
day progresses the amount of activity
changes to reflect wherever you are on
your weight loss target that's perfect
and that's Polar's biggest selling point
and it does work and the only thing for
me personally does everyone like going
the route of a calorie deficit or would
you prefer to do food logging to see the
specifics or maybe for the more
analytical person now the way the scale
does work with the information provided
and at the end of the day it's really a
matter of preference in my belief so
that's it for the review if you can be
sure to LIKE and subscribe if you
haven't done so and be sure to add me on
to Facebook Twitter and/or Instagram to
see some behind the scenes stuff and of
course follow my journey as well in my
reviews

purchase decision you guys take care
