JBL revealed their entire lineup of new
Bluetooth speakers for the year so many
to the point it covers nearly everyone's
budget from the extreme down to the JBL
flip 3 but right in the middle we have
the charge tube Plus and this speaker
here which I bought myself the JBL pulse
2 it's designed as a Bluetooth speaker
of course but also a fun and interactive
light show as well I personally paid 199
dollars retail but click any link in the
video description below to see what
they're going for today so without
further ado add me on to Instagram
Twitter or Facebook and be sure to
subscribe if you haven't already welcome
everyone to another review
going over the physical features first
it's 7.6 inches wide and 3.3 inches in
diameter the speaker is still
lightweight for carrying around and not
considered as being heavy but it does
ever so slightly way more than the other
bluetooth speakers on the market at 1.7
pounds the entire speaker besides the
buttons are in case with a very solid
grille that protects the LEDs behind
here but before getting into the light
show getting into the buttons here
there's the on and off switch bluetooth
pairing button pattern switcher which
I'll demonstrate later volume up and
down with five white LEDs indicating
battery level a JBL connect button
allowing the speaker to be paired with
another pulse to if you'd like or you
can mix and match and from my research
as of this video you can pair this with
the flip three charge two plus and the
extreme now the very bottom has your
pause and play button and going into the
connections the flap that covered the
3.5 millimeter port for physically
connecting your device and the microUSB
port for charging the speaker is really
firm to open each time most likely for
the splash proof design that JBL offers
now by no means it cannot be submerged
into water like the ue products of being
splash proof is always a huge plus here
for peace of mind around the kids or the
pool basically now some connections not
present is NFC or near field
communication for easy pair
and a charge out port to use the speaker
similar to a power bank and physically
charging your phone or other
miscellaneous devices and speaking of
power before I move into the LED
features JBL claims up to 10 hours of
use and from my test leaving this on at
50% volume and you can see the volume
levels with the LED lights this dropped
down to 50% better remaining at about 8
and a half hours in now I perform the
same test again but this time at full
volume from a full battery of course the
pulse 2 died in 4 hours and 44 minutes
to be exact now one of the main reasons
for purchasing the pulse 2 are the LED
lights the lights can be on all the time
or you can turn it off by holding down
the light function you can toggle
through different settings and have a
different array of patterns by using
that same button again no question
the lighting in general has improved
over the previous pulse with the holes
on the front grille being much more
finer offering a more modern look now
there is an accompanying app which you
technically don't need to operate the
LEDs but does offer a bit more control
to what you can display versus using the
buttons on the speaker itself now the
JBL connect app visually shows you the
themes being offered for example fire is
first here currently being displayed on
your screen and you can control the
intensity from small medium and large
the next one up here is rain offering
white with a slight blue color and of
course going through the other themes
here you can see the differences however
new to the polls too is the JBL prism
for color sensing a nice way if you want
or need to set the colors or mood to
that environment you basically scan any
color and have the post to display it
through its LEDs and just as an FYI if
you are using those theme displays which
I showed you earlier you can't change
the color so for the fire demo earlier
you can't change it to say having purple
and green flames if you wanted to but
back to the spreads canner I'll admit
the old model you could just physically
select the color on the side of the
speaker also adjust the dimming settings
but with the pulse 2 you do have to walk
up to the object either wall or fabric
works fine for me and press the spectrum
button for it to scan now I know some
prefer the old method as you can just
change it right then and there on the
speaker
but for ultimate matching the spectrum
comes in handy and does work pretty
accurate from my testing into the moment
that you've probably been waiting for
the sound
I'll play several samples for you guys
and then give you my verdict afterwards
what up what up clock man did I stop
that shit on laughs hey let me drop this
yet these blow straight toxic come I get
it like samurai get in the mic and you
know I'm getting Americans I can feel my
face but now
I have to be so soon and there you have
it folks
of course sound recorded on my end then
played through your speakers or not the
best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review here the pulse - does
well in general with some very modern
nuances the base is done better on here
than other mid-range speakers but it
doesn't top out at beating some of the
other flagship brands out there when
compared to the original pulse it is
indeed louder
better and bass and has more clarity and
although it is better in bass it's not
as clean sounding though some parts
appear to slightly ever so slightly
though drown out the mid-range just a
bit causing those with more basic vocals
to have this low hum in their voice when
you have a speaker on loud or up to
maximum volume for singers without deep
voices it's really not present though
and I don't think anyone really pick up
that little drone but for me personally
as I listen to this more often with
different genres and then eventually
noticed it a little bit further or a
little bit more down the road the
mid-range is good - with clear sounds
but it doesn't have the bright signature
that I liked on the JBL charge - Plus
that are reviewed recently but not being
bright it is more of a linear tone
equivalent to the other sound field not
one area of audio basically is
dominating over the other not a con
really as some prefer a more balanced
signature rather than a more forward
mid-range and for the highs they are not
tinging and ear ringing there's just
enough roll-off to prevent the high
notes from basically going too far
overall the sound is not bad and it is
an improvement over the pulse to the
original pulse for sure but after
listening to the charge - plus the
extreme those two could be better suited
if you're wanting absolute audio quality
if you do favor the LED lights and this
is a must-have again this speaker is
good and you won't go wrong here but
keep in mind if it's sound quality that
you're looking for it does take a very
muddy hit when I compared to the
aforementioned
JBL models now another big question is
this loud very much so for small rooms
and at most though medium sized rooms in
large open areas of course you will have
sound if you're standing on the other
side of the room or the yard you can
still have a normal conversation with a
normal voice to be answer to it's pretty
typical of most mid sized speakers and
the very last test here this range of
the speaker is of course dependent on
the environment and the device now I
used three different devices to test the
new LG v10 smartphone and the iPad air 2
tablet made it all the way to the other
side of my house and downstairs going
through several walls and the first
floor ceiling no problems that's about
35 to 40 linear feet my note for
smartphone here had skip free music
across the house while on the same floor
but if I were to go downstairs once I
get to that bottom step there it would
start to cut out still range is still
considered as good for the speaker but
not the best one compared to so again
some of the other speakers out there and
that's it for the review folks if you
guys did enjoy my work be sure to like
and subscribe to my channel here if you
haven't done so already and be sure to
add me on to Facebook Twitter or
Instagram if you guys can see some
behind the scenes information on there
and also some products before of course
I put them onto YouTube again I'm Jimmy
with Jim's review room you guys take
care I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
