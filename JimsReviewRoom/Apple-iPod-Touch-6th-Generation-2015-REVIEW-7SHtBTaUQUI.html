gone I mean Apple didn't release a new
model since 2012 and those were
smartphones today they are very capable
of everything an iPad can do and then
some
the last generation Touch stayed with
the a5 processor the same processor
found on the iPhone 4s with just 512
megabytes of RAM and from my experience
of owning the fifth generation iPod
Touch iOS 8 started to slow it down just
a bit
not to mention iOS 9 is around the
corner and a new iPhone 6s will just
push the aging device further down the
performance chart today I present to you
the sixth generation iPod Touch that I
personally bought here for $200 and as
always visit Jim's review room comm for
more news and reviews and feel free to
add me on to your social media channels
again I'm Jimmy with James River drum
calm welcome everyone to another review
before I even start I wanted to tell you
what I use the touch for and prove this
isn't just a device that I'm reviewing
most people won't be using the touch
since they do have their phones but for
my sake here I do use it for my Dropcam
or nest cam monitor at night to watch
our babies sleep I don't want to use my
sims 104 screen and leave it on 8 plus
hours a night or so continuously and
have it hooked up into the charger now
as for my other devices laying around
the house I use them mostly for work for
YouTube that is and when my cousins or
other relatives come by I'll let them
mess around with the touch if they
desperately need some form of
electronics and the I say the
PlayStation controls are all taken up
and last this thing is much lighter and
smaller than most phones and not to
mention cheaper than buying an iPhone at
full price so I can test out products
and apps for Jim's review room so there
is some need for this product in this
world but I do admit it is a bit more
niche these days to be honest with you
nonetheless is still a nice upgrade here
but let's see what upgrades those are
and if there are any worthwhile
improvements to warranty purchase now
physically it's the same as last
generation with no aesthetic changes I
don't mind this at all personally and
still lovely super thin aluminum build
the screen is somewhat small for adults
playing games on this especially those
playing normally on their phones or
tablets now for what I am using it for
not my main go-to device the small
screen size is fine
coming in at 4 inches now buns are very
much tactile with the home button sadly
with no touch ID or essentially a
fingerprint scanner power button remains
on top with volume adjustments on the
left the very bottom features your
standard three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone ports Lightning port for
charging and syncing data and last is
the small speaker which sounds very much
like any other smartphone speaker out
there it's fine for the most part but
slightly raspy or droning I mean my very
high pitched noises or so when the
volume is at max it's very my new for
the average consumer but it is there
nonetheless the front camera for
FaceTime and other self-portraits and
videos remains the same at 1.2
megapixels and offers 720p video
recording resolution respectively
the bigger change comes with the rear
camera on the back getting bumped up to
8 megapixels versus the
five being offered in the last
generation and although Apple has never
been the leader in megapixels their
camera quality has always been good to
great at least on the iPhones and it's
what I would consider good here now with
the samples you see on screen all images
are unedited the camera works fast with
no stutters encountered and offers a
pretty good amount of photo options like
burst mode and panoramic mode as well
with 120 frames per second for video
recording in the Sun the images it looks
fine but I noticed just in the shade the
camera loses a little bit of its
sharpness though using my note 4
smartphone and not saying it's a direct
competitor but just for comparison
purposes only the note 4 does provide
better light balance in retaining
details both in these shaded areas and
what you see in the background
nonetheless for a 200-dollar device the
camera quality I would consider at a
similar level to a good point and shoot
camera well going back to the screen
here Apple has decided to keep the same
resolution and it's still considered as
Apple's Retina display coming in at
11:36 by 640 with a 326 pixels per inch
density it's low in resolution but it's
small screen size packed so many pixels
into one area the density creates a
sharp picture to the eye colors from
Apple and add the touch here portrays a
more natural or neutral color palette
that's not oversaturated if you're
usually using Apple products this will
look clean and for some people it does
look very good but those having used the
Samsung like the AMOLED technology that
it has people might see Apple products
being a little bit more flat and be a
color representation the touch still
doesn't come with the ambient light
reader in turn when you're going indoors
to outdoors on sunny days you will
barely see the screen and will cry or
adjusting the brightness frequently
check this was implemented and advice
like this today and regarding other
sensors unlike the iPhone there's no
proximity sensor either so no bee map
for you and no built-in GPS in regards
to performance in use this is where the
touch does shine as it comes with the
aid processor the same processor that's
found on the current iPhone 6 and 6-plus
Ram is bumped up to one gigabyte the
same as the current iPhone 6 and as you
guys know iOS does run very efficient
even with minimal Ram on board
compared to the last generation which
used the a5 this thing runs flawless for
everyday use and there is a significant
improvement
over how fast apps and games load not to
mention the touch now supports a/c
routers and Bluetooth 4.1 now if Apple
decides to continue with the touch four
years down the road without upgrades as
it did with last generation it looks to
show that the a8 will survive over time
that's as long as iOS doesn't become too
bloated any time soon I don't foresee
seeing that now I believe Apple no
question made very calculated moves the
processor RAM and camera upgrades were a
must and made the most sense it's the
bare bones to any media device but as
some in the past have said the iPod
Touch is similar to an iPhone just
without the phoning part of gasps but
that is further from the truth today was
such a delay in the refresh I personally
was hoping to have at least GPS on there
like any other phone perfect for those
who use RunKeeper and even Apple's own
health app like the iPhones touch ID
does make it convenient for logging in
and buying things
not to mention bypassing typing in your
password every time you need to do an
update or so and although I'm fine with
the size I'm really curious if there are
those who do want the 4.7 inch screen
like the iPhone 6 the touch is still a
multimedia device in a slightly bigger
screen just slightly would have been
more fitting to others I believe but
that's the key word here it's a
multimedia device that's music movies
photos gaming and not only funny vines
and videos that you see on the Internet
the iPod Touch is no question designed
with Apple music in mind its price and
simplicity makes this a perfect device
for any parent willing to have your
child enter into the world of Apple
considering mom and dad has I phones and
or iPads themselves now Apple family
share is also in place buy one on any
device let's say a song or so and it's
available on your other family devices
too without an additional charge what
I'm saying the touch is not designed to
be a Swiss Army knife like what our
smart phones can do but it does execute
a niche pocket very well and because my
old touch is slowing me down I will be
using this new touch here for the small
little miscellaneous things like a baby
monitor or music streamer to my speakers
around the house freeing up my main
phone so how this review helped you in
some way if you do like my work please
add me on to Facebook Twitter Instagram
or Google+ and of course stop by Jim's
calm and seenu's as well as other
reviews on there again I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room calm you guys take
care and I'll see you in the next one
