room today we're looking at the Onyx
mini that Harman Kardon sent over it's
priced at $199 retail direct from
Harmons website but I have seen them on
sale for as low as $99 on Amazon what
I'll do is I'll leave my links in the
video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these might go on sale so
without further adieu my channel is here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
go over the physical features first I'd
love the look
it's very simple yet it still looks very
sophisticated and the front has a very
tough fabric mesh grille and then
rotating the unit to the back here
there's a slight rubber coating to give
it some grip and to give the onyx mini a
more premium feel on the lower half
there is a passive base radiator that is
not only visually appealing here but the
idea of a base Raider is to help offer a
bigger and deeper base experience not on
the very bottom you have a 3.5
millimeter port for physical connections
and to charge there's a micro USB port
as well now going back to the top here
the on and off button is in the sensor
volume up and down on other side and to
the far left is bluetooth pairing and to
the far right here has the phone call
answer button
everything is very tactile very simple
easy to use the vom buttons don't glow
white unfortunately but during my time
testing for most average consumers the
minus and plus signs are visible enough
now regarding phone calls the Attucks
mini is promoting they have noise and
echo eliminating technology for when you
want to use this like a speakerphone
from my test it did work great but only
within a 3 foot radius of the speaker
once I stepped four feet and out my
voice did echo though as if I was in a
hallway or so the speakerphone is really
meant for you to stand or sit next to
and use now very less there is a battery
indicator with five white LEDs on top
climbing up to 10 hours of use which is
average and good for a small Bluetooth
speaker and then regarding wireless
range I'm getting
very close here to about 30 to 40 linear
feet even having a signal go through
several walls and of course the first
floor ceiling very standard test here on
the channel now the only other feature
that is available with the Onyx mini is
what they call Wireless dual sound
similar to JBL connect or the UE double
up features the Onyx mini can pair with
another speaker with the wireless dual
sound feature such as the Onyx Studio 3
another mini that I have here or they go
plus play models the Onyx many cannot
pair though with the onyx studio 2 as
I've gotten that question quite a bit
here on the channel now with 2 speakers
you do get much more sound immersion of
course but keep in mind they don't offer
true left and right audio separation now
other than that the Onyx mini keeps it
simple with no other features here
offered like water resistance a charge
out ports or claimed a rugged build or
so at the $200 retail price point though
it is lacking a bit though and offering
other amenities one other brands or the
competition is offering more now jumping
into the sound test here I'll play some
songs and then I'll give you my verdict
afterwards
are you talking to code no reason why
you got me on hold
I'm peeping I knew something was ignited
when you left I wanna bomb all I wanna
do is get to know you east to west north
to south Ohio but I need direction you
get the present I told you in me with
something like
my memories never G
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded on my end and
then play through your speakers not the
best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review here keep in mind this
is considered as a small bluetooth
speaker most small bluetooth speakers
are around the $100 price range
give or take $20 now with my sound test
the Onix many did perform like a small
bluetooth speaker and it's not as loud
though as I would have expected
considering how loud and impressive the
onyx studio 3s are from customer
comments the loudness is great for
personal listening at the desk small
rooms dorm rooms maybe something to put
in the bathroom again in small areas or
having this at your desk nearby you it
works great for medium sized rooms
it still works good it's more for
general listening though but not so much
for entertaining the bass levels are
neutral without sub bass being hit and
with it playing it's safe offered a
distortion free experience the mid-range
where vocals in most instruments resides
are impressive as it does provide a nice
clear audio performance the very high
notes don't ting or cause listener
fatigue which is great but it hides a
maximum vibe you can slightly tell the
speaker is stretching its legs you can
say and squeezing out all of its power
now like many if not all small bluetooth
speakers the soundstage you are
basically left and right audio
separation is not apparent so in summary
I still enjoy the speaker for personal
listening and does great there but if
you're paying $200 there's other
speakers that are louder offers more
definition and more features a perfect
example is the B&amp;amp;O a1 offering a similar
sized sophisticated styling but it's
also water-resistant built to be rugged
without losing its high-end look here
and more importantly it's still small
but provides a very rich and detailed
audio experience for the annex mini if
you can get it on sale it's worth a look
into if you guys do like the styling
like I do but if you're going to shell
out retail prices definitely check your
options so that's it for this review be
