of my videos finally we get an update to
the bose qc25 twos did Bose improve on
the active noise-cancelling with these
new headphones how comfortable are these
and what are these headphones all about
folks this is the bose noise-canceling
headphones 700 i personally paid for
these at the retail price of $400 these
things are expensive but we'll see if
they're well worth it as always I'll
place my affiliate links that in that
video description below
click on those links for the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
also the bose QC 35 - I'll have a link
there - that's in case both drops the
price on those let's get into this I'm
Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
the most QC 35 tubes are an amazing set
the comfort on these is what sold me at
first and today it's still one of the
lightest pair of ain t headphones I
reviewed on this channel with the new
Bose headphones 700 it appears to be a
new line or a new series for boats and
not necessarily a replacement now when
it called in to boast the Rep insisted
that these were an upgrade but yet they
were still selling the Bose QC 35 - so
we'll see were they gonna go with this
so with that being said physically the
black-on-black looks sleek modern
contemporary but you can be the judge
instead of the Alcantara and faux
leather boats went with this smooth
rubber like silicone on the very top and
on the underside the band itself is made
of metal and that does help create this
premium feel when you touch it after I
removed the ear Pet I did confirm though
that the ear cups are unfortunately not
made of metal when you pick up the older
QC 35 twos it was cold to the touch yet
crazy light because of the metal use
that touch that haptic feedback that
physical sensory I felt both had
somewhat taken that away with this new
model but for $400 that little extra
touch a little bit better materials that
physical sensory could have been better
let's move on to comfort now I didn't
have any pinching at the crown of the
head clamping force around the jaw line
was good I had a good grip right here
without being too firm and wearing these
for hours I never had any kind of
wearing fatigue the ear cups appears to
recess in as much as the QC 35 twos but
when wearing the QC 35 2's felt more
Airy open and my ears don't touch the
inside lining with the 700s my ears do
slightly touch the inside there and
simply in general they do warm up but
they don't cause any kind of ear sweats
in normal office or at home temperatures
in general these are very good and still
competes with the main competitors the
sony 1000 XM 3 is for example my
compared to the rest of the market it's
still one the best in comfort it's just
that the QC 35 tees were simply better
and speaking of the Sony 1000 X Mark
threes here I'll have a dedicated
comparison / versus video soon this
video is more of an independent review
on how it is or compares to the rest of
the market now getting a closer look
these are now touch sensitive controls
and they work great slide your fingers
forward and back to skip a song swipe up
and down to increase or decrease volume
a double tap lets you pause and play and
holding down their right ear cup on the
front lets you hear how much better life
is remaining which is super convenient
now there are still some physical
buttons and they're located in the
perfect location when you have your
headphones on to access your voice
assistant and this includes Google Siri
and Alexa all you do is hold it down ask
your question and then let go you'll
hear the answer eventually what's the
weather right now currently in San Diego
it's 84 degrees Fahrenheit and sunny now
with my testing this has worked fine and
a few occasions though I can hear Google
assistant thinking and trying to
generate some sort of answer here and
then it doesn't just give me it doesn't
give me an answer at all it's a little
bit finicky not 100% reliable just yet
now I've noticed the physical buns are a
little too sensitive now when the
headset is on your head there's no
issues no big deal here but if you're
taking them off like so putting them on
picking them up from the table sometimes
I bump that active noise-cancelling
button and it's not the setting that I
want actually reduces the active
noise-cancelling sometimes the assistant
is activated and again that's not what
it wants either it gets better over time
with muscle memory and where you place
your hands and such but still a small
nuisance especially in the beginning now
on the other side here and this is a
very nice touch you can cycle through
the amount of active noise-cancelling
you have set through the Bose music app
by default ten is maximum anc 1 press
brings it down to at level five another
press brings it down to zero now when
you do bring it down to zero you have
essentially conversation mode basically
there's no passive noise isolation
actually the microphones pick up your
surroundings and actually pumps it into
your headphones with my testing it
sounds very natural and very clean now
there is a very small two and a half
millimeter port for physical connections
Bose has not given up on peyer's just
yet two things that I'd noticed there
one when I plug this in overall volume
is not as loud I can actually
at maximum vibe in short it sounds
better Wireless second you can turn off
the Bose headphones all together and the
headphones will still work it doesn't
sound great as BOCES audio magic isn't
on and then you don't have anc either
but in the worst case scenario when you
need audio and you forget to charge
these headphones at least you'll still
have some music to listen to
now speaking of power let's knock this
out here bose claims up to 20 hours of
use and this is the reason why i warn
these for 8 hours a day straight these
things have auto off for audio when
there's no audio playing the headphones
turns off after a certain amount of time
that you can set within the Bose music
app very straightforward to conserve
battery now there's also an auto off
with motion detection and that has no
options to disable I can't leave these
headset on the table playing to drain
the battery like all my other headphones
that I do so I had to wear them for
eight hours straight each day here no
matter where I went to the gym eating
lunch etc like the videos to support my
efforts here but a 50% vine with active
noise-cancelling on I was able to
accumulate a total of 22 hours and 48
minutes worth of use those purchasing
any electronics whether smart phones
headphones earphones etc make sure it
has USB C to future-proof yourself these
Bose headphones use that USB C to also
fast charge 15 minutes on the charger
from a dead battery gives you three and
a half hours worth of performance back
to fully charge these things it takes
two and a half hours now compared to the
competition twenty hours is somewhat on
the middle to low and unfortunately
compared to other mainstream yet premium
anti headphones like so nice and Heiser
and Charlton name a few even beats the
Bose headphones are still
underperforming here on that spec sheet
but to be fair and this is through my
testing here not everything is just
specs but 20 hours wasn't too short of a
time to be honest with you with Roo
world testing here they never died on me
and never entered or encountered low
battery to the point where it became an
issue
there's always fast charging I wear them
for a day or two plug them back in no
big deal
based on Bluetooth this is really easy
bluetooth 5.0 is offered and this is the
latest Bluetooth technology available so
that's a plus there yes you can pair two
devices at a time using this on my iPad
for example and then my phone rings the
music pauses you can jump onto that
phone call finish that phone call and
then once you hang up the music will
automatically start playing once again
it's quite intuitive now testing
bluetooth strength in my 1,100 square
foot apartment here I was able to reach
every corner I had 100% coverage with a
signal going through several walls
during my time testing plus the two and
a half days or so wearing this and drain
the batteries I've never had this signal
Trump either testing this with video on
both Apple and Android zero syncing
issues across YouTube and Netflix from
video the wireless performance was again
perfect now the only issue though the
music app is very much suspect pairing
to my phone and listening to music zero
issues now worked flawless having the
app connect to the headphones sometimes
it works sometimes it requires two to
three tries with my iPhone I don't know
why but it never connected and I'm
showing you proof in the video I know
there are many others out there that had
success with their iPhones I know you
guys are fine but the inconsistency with
Android alone was worrisome the I think
it seems to be getting better over time
which is weird but again it's not a
hundred percent we'll see maybe the next
firmware update will make it better
we just want good products right off the
bat please last but not least before I
get into the audio section these
headphones don't fold in but they do
fold flat after using the protective
case it fits very easily into my bookbag
as much as I like the foldable design
this simply had less girth in general
the protection is good enough to protect
the headphones from scuffs now one major
feature that's only available on iOS at
the moon is boast AR or augmented
reality there's a technically audio
augmented reality I tested this with
some of the supplied apps which is very
limited at the time essentially you can
turn your head and you can hear the
source of audio stay in that same
direction it was cool at first but kind
of fizzled out very quickly especially
when it wasn't a song that I
particularly listened to but
flip side though voices claiming in the
future you might be able to not to
execute a function there when you are
walking around town there might be audio
cues to help with navigation and there
are some things that might be
interesting it's just limited at the
moment I'm keeping an open mind for this
the folks let's slowly move into audio
sound leaking is at a minimum when I'm
blasting this at eighty percent fine
that's really really loud speakerphone
wise active noise-cancelling stays on
but you can always turn it down with a
button but folks let's give you a live
demo of these speakerphone and the
microphones down here here we go
alright folks I know my hair looks a
little rough right now I just woke up
it's
it's joke it make like 9:00 in the
morning but anyway testing out the
microphones only both 700 this is what
it sounds like and hopefully it sounds
good to you guys try to find the busiest
street near me having some cars drive by
to give you the rural test I folks back
into the studios warm out here
alright now as for active
noise-cancelling this is where both
improved over the previous generation if
you're new to the channel I use binaural
microphones to give you the best in
spatial audio recording please put on
your own headphones or earphones so you
can actually hear the nuances through my
microphone here we go
battery 15 hours connecting cue pixel 3a
connecting to pixel 3 a mobile device
not found ready to connect
now from my testing the active
noise-cancelling on the Bose headphones
700 is no question better than he boasts
QC 35 twos are they better than the Sony
1000 XM 3s which are currently the best
on the market for anc performance I
can't say just yeah please wait for that
video it's coming soon be sure to
subscribe and turn on those
notifications but yes ANC has improved
compared to the QC 35 twos and it does
block a lot of that airiness around you
it blocks out a lot of that wind and
whooshing noises of cars driving by and
busy areas with other people's playing
music here in the background and simply
just voice chatter of nearby people
these reduce them quite a bit
keep in mind ANSI doesn't have the
ability to cancel out everything and it
usually works best with certain
frequencies but comparing to the
competitors on the market the Bose is
one of the best now these are not meant
for the gym they're not sweat or
waterproof here but again I had to wear
them to test the battery with music on
and ANC maxed out I don't hear others
near me running on the treadmill they
have their TVs on in front of them and I
can't hear that hi there so the Bose
anzi headphones 700 beats out many from
the active noise-cancelling standpoint
it's so real it's amazing I'm telling
you it's no longer an underperformer and
it's up there with a competition
alright folks last test here let's
listen to some audio samples but before
doing so as you can see I put a lot of
details to help you make that purchase
decision so please help support my work
by liking and throwing some fire emojis
down below also this is a big request
for me but please follow my personal
social media handles that Jimmy loom
official on Instagram or J loom official
on Twitter I have the links down in that
video description all right folks here
we go all right folks here we go
so tired awaiting God tie it over the
chase I've been feeling like there is
nothing in our Jason hides to breathe
take it all in now see all I'm asking
for is just some space and some time
then I'll be alright
I've been thoughts and appeal spend too
much time by myself so many things that
I still don't know it's time for me
close never come back even though your
taking just the best of
Oh
lose shine just tell my food thief and
there you have it folks
of course audio recorded on my end and
then play through your own speakers are
not the best depiction of audio quality
but hence my review here vine wise I
turn these up to 72 maybe 75% volume to
really reach the enjoyable state at 80%
the audio starts to jumble and you lose
some of that clean sound it's loud
enough but for those who like things
even louder you're going to lose some of
that quality up there now one thing I
noticed compared to the bose qc25 twos
these seven hundreds are indeed much
louder I played these again usually
around 70% but on the bose qc25 twos I'm
noticing I'm bumping it up to 80% by to
have these same performance but starting
off with bass here this is no question
Bose audio signature bass is very clean
Naboo me but direct and just fast not
bassy like these Sony 1000x m3s but this
refined and tailored experience when I
review the most QC 55 2's there were
some that said Bose didn't have enough
base while some said it was a good
amount with these 700 s I did sense it's
a bit deeper but I can see if those who
enjoy bass this might be right on the
fence for them I still recommend trying
the 700s out and see if it's just enough
for you the mid-range is very distinct
the audio separation from instruments to
vocals are very much appearance and
because so you're interpreting detail
audio resolution and a lot of audio
direction there's times you can sense
the beat is coming from behind you in a
little bit below times a tambourine hits
and it's slightly in front of you and
off to the right in slightly up the
soundstage is there not the widest and
best that I've tested but for ANC
headphones it's up there with being one
of the best overall the mid-range is not
recessed not bright either but what you
sent right away more than anything is
the audio direction and separation it is
better than the bose qc25 - is by a
small margin now the high frequencies
were very similar to the rest here where
they're just not high pitched or not ear
piercing they're not ear screeching
that's really good very well maintained
and within reason some asses and vocals
were very well pronounced while the
snapping
fingers on some songs here wasn't as
high as I would have liked some snares
didn't hit that higher note to just make
those high notes Sparkle it's not bad
but overall the Bose headphones 700
again offers that refine tailored and
controlled music listening experience
these are very easy to listen to I think
it hits mass-market or right on the head
with what most people would or will
enjoy now if you're into classic rock or
classical music no question get these if
you're into vocal work this is still an
excellent pair if you're into pop modern
rock EDM these are a strong contender
but if you're into bass may be hip-hop
bass your pop songs I'd say you listen
to some other headphones and compare
them to these like I said I'll have
these Sony versus Bose headphones coming
up pretty soon less if you own the bose
qc25 twos although there are
improvements I would not get rid of them
they're lighter airier very similar
audio signature but I will met the 700th
do sound a bit better but again by that
small margin the ANC though is better
though that's clearly I can tell that
but what I'm saying though the 700s
doesn't blow these out the water if you
have for her dolls to spend though then
ask yourself is Comfort a priority then
get these compared to the overall market
though I honestly really enjoyed the
700s there are no question one of the
best ANC headphones out there but for
what it does it's as though it played
catch up with the best out there and
that's not a bad thing but what made the
qc25 2's amazing was its weight in the
ear cups
sony has the ridiculous anti performance
bang &amp;amp; olufsen for example has the
design style and materials the 700s
performed great but for $400 I was
expecting something class-leading if it
was at the $350 price range again I
think that would have been fine to be
honest I would say keep an eye on the
PXE 550 s from sennheiser those are due
for an update I don't know if there's a
new one coming out yet or not means that
has it like that
but of course these Sony antsy
headphones Sony has been pumping out new
models I think every year if your money
conscious
I'd say hold off on these for now and
test them out yourself if you can before
purchasing but if you
get these again they won't disappoint if
you want to spend that $400 folks let me
know in the comment section below
are these worth it or not to you let's
see what everyone is saying help the
gyms review room community out I'm
trying to help you guys make that
purchase decision click on my face over
there I think to subscribe click on my
links in that video description to
follow my social media I'll catch you
guys on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
