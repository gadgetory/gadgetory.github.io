dashcam review this time it's from
Papago with their GoSafe 260 now it's no
question different as it's not a
standalone unit that you suction unto
your windshield but it's a full-blown
rear view mirror with a built-in camera
now some features include a small built
in screen into the glass anti glare
technology for night driving 1080p
resolution and a wide angle lens now of
course I'll test all these claimed
features here for you and you'll see
what it's all about
now the GoSafe 260 is 130 dollars at the
time this video on amazon.com and I'll
have the link in the video description
below for your convenience now as always
visit my website for reviews on other
cameras and more consumer products I'm
Jimmy with jims review room comm and I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over its physical features the 260
doesn't require the old mirror to be
taken down but it clips over it actually
though it looks to clamp on to these
small mirrors of about two and a half
inches tall and you want to give some
room since you will want the clamps to
hold on tie it down to the mirror itself
now the biggest size is about three
inches tall though and from my testing
this does fit perfectly onto a car like
a Toyota Camry that I have here by
trying this on a mirror with built-in
dimming and possibly other electronics
it sadly doesn't fit so just a heads up
on that but once it's secured onto your
car it really stays stable and
stationary now from my experience the
mirror is wider and it does extend from
the back color to the other pillar while
most standard rear-view mirrors
basically just shows from one side the
rear window to the other now during the
day the mirror does work fine here but
once the Sun starts to set or at night
time the auto dimming seems to dim too
much that is it's harder to make out
some faces of passengers in the rear
here and in my case I'm traveling with
my infant in the back I can't really see
her face too clearly and trying to
distinguish cars in the rear view is a
bit tough as well I can't see if there's
a police car behind me or if it's just a
civilian driving a Dodge Charger now in
the packaging Papago does provide a
super long cigarette power adapter most
-
you would run the cable on this side
door trim here and then up the a-pillar
and then basically through your
headliner now in this case it does work
for the most parts but they go safe 260
does have a resistor or a transformer so
which does make it a bit tricky
I couldn't squeeze this into my a pillar
nor the headliner of course so I really
just placed this in the passenger side
vanity mirror now what the rest of the
wires tucked in that little black box
didn't fall out if someone were to pull
down that visor now it's not a big deal
but it does work though now looking at
the mirror up close on top you have a
GPS port if you want to buy that
additional accessory for $35 on Amazon
and that way you can record your map
coordinates and also your speed now next
is the mini USB port that powers the
mirror the following is a micro SD card
slot that takes up to 32 gigabytes of
class 10 memory now a lower class memory
card like most dash cams here may not
work and from my experience I do have a
SanDisk branded card and that's a class
10 as well and that did fail on me the
unit kept freezing although I was able
to reformat my card several times no
papa code did state SanDisk does provide
some issues now going with a data and I
believe that I pronounced a pair or
Kingston memory cards 18 32 gigabyte SD
cards here micro SD cards would work
again the link is in the video
description now the following is audio
video out and last is the on/off switch
now moving to the front here you can see
a 2.7 inch LCD screen is built right in
you can turn the screen on or off with
the button and have the mirror continue
to record and during the day time it's
not as visible which is fine since I
only use the LCD to outline the camera
and at night it does glow nicely now the
bottom features your menu buttons which
I'll go over right after I show you the
camera on the back here behind the
controls is the camera which is
adjustable it pans a very reasonable
amount left to right but also up and
down as well the visibility of the road
was not an issue at all with the
adjustability but going back to the menu
buttons let's show you what's offered
here and then I'll show you the video
footage afterwards
now first set of options you have the
full 1080p resolution at 30 frames per
second 720p at 60 frames and the list it
goes
now loop recording is also available
meaning you can have your files record
for three minutes five or ten and then
have the dashcam save your file then
now once the memory card does get full
the camera will overwrite the old videos
and save the new ones it's all automatic
now easy is to adjust the exposure value
motion detection is available on here as
well if the camera senses movement while
your car is parked this will record
video perfect for basic those parking
lot accidents or even vandalism issues
just make sure that you reverse into
your spot now record audio date stamp in
GPS is really all self-explanatory here
but the G sensor really comes in handy
the dash cams I've reviewed all seem to
have this feature already if you were in
an accident the shock where the
vibration to the dash cam will have the
dash cam save the video right away and
lock it you can't accidentally delete it
instead of waiting for that three five
or ten minute loop recording to kick in
as I mentioned earlier now less going
into the overall settings date and time
beeping noises from using the buttons
and language mode are once again self
explanatory while TV mode is used to set
your region either pal or NTSC now
frequency I just basically leave alone
format is to format that SD card which I
highly recommend of course before doing
or using a dash cam itself and default
to basically reset your settings in
these screen saver is last so that's
everything physically here and we'll
move on to the moment that you've
probably been waiting for here here's
some actual footage right from the go
safe to sixty that's completely unedited
for your analysis as well and I think it
does well overall during the daytime
here and just keep in mind though this
is a dash cam and not a high-end digital
camera but the license plates are still
very much visible signs for the most
part are as well the reflection and the
windshield is barely if visible at all
and on this very sunny day here the
camera does well with managing very
bright colors without blowing up the
white areas like clouds and the Sun
hitting bright surfaces now driving when
the Sun starts is settled down was fine
as well with most signs being visible
and should be oxygen really no
complaints and just quickly here this is
an audio sample of what the microphone
records while driving in your car and
you do have the option to mute it as
well
can the love will never get lost we'll
come to the latter never be caught
now regarding night driving objects and
vehicles are of course identifiable but
license plates on the other hand here
are somewhat hard to see however if a
car were to merge into your lane or if
there was a collision you can definitely
see who's at fault now driving through
neighborhoods with minimal lights the
image is very dark and you really can't
see too much now overall it does work
but if you do live in the south or a
place where street lighting is not so
predominant you should take this night
driving video into consideration so in
the end here just let me know your
thoughts in the comment section below
