review room welcome back to another
gaming overview now called duty advanced
warfare really changes the concept here
than any other previous Call of Duty
game in the past and going into the
future of course but before I show you
what that means and also the gameplay
let's discuss what I have here it's the
collector's version dubbed the Atlas pro
edition now it's priced at $119 and
right off the bat I got to tell you it
doesn't come with anything physical you
can say to display in your household it
doesn't come with this steel case which
looks very good in my opinion in the
illustration the exosuit looks really
badass and you also do receiving a
hardcover book that really explains or
goes into detail all about the Atlas
corporation that's in this game but I'll
discuss more about that later in detail
but on that that's literally it
everything else that you get in this
package is digital downloadable content
for in-game gameplay but looking back at
previous premium collector items from
the Call of Duty franchise you would get
the remote control drone you'll get
night vision goggles etc something to
actually have or put your hands on and
put on a displaced case etc it is a
collector's item but all isn't lost
though in this particular package as if
you're going hardcore this also comes
with a season pass allowing you to
download all the upcoming maps that are
coming out throughout the year and
there's some other additional Atlas
bonuses as well and again the season
pass alone is $50 in of itself so I
guess you can say it's almost it's not
all lost so you do get somewhat your
money's worth in that sense but as you
can see here on your screen is all the
content that you can get and you can
pause the video if you want to take a
look at what's shown here but now
getting into the synopsis here you play
as Mitchell a marine from the US
government alongside your best friend
here and very early on in the game
during admission were the North Koreans
are invading Seoul South Korea you're
right next to your friend and witness
some tragic events and sadly he dies
while you're left with a severed arm and
unable to further your career in the
military and this is where the game's
protagonist played by Kevin Spacey steps
in and come to find out he's your best
friend's father and see
oh of the largest private military
corporation in the world
Atlas now he takes you under his wings
and gives you a high-tech prosthetic arm
to news and not going any further here
in the storyline and offering anymore
spoilers I guess you can say but just by
looking at Kevin Spacey's face you can
see he's up to no good
despite his generosity but now going
into the gameplay here the game plays
very smooth just like all the other
previous Call of Duty games only when
you reach certain checkpoints or maybe
just that in-game loading screen very
rarely though I would see a little
stutter or hiccup in the graphics but
graphics and lighting is for sure much
better than what ghost was a huge
improvement I think as ghosts are just
kind of reminded me what PlayStation 3
graphics looked like but with this new
look here the game still plays very
familiar with the likes of again modern
warfare 3 my opinion now playing this on
normal even on the very early stages of
the game requires you to still take
cover and run a gun gameplay is not at
all beneficial there's still a good
degree of difficulty in there not a
story in general although just playing
with it for the first several hours
seems like a definite step up from his
predecessor especially with Kevin
Spacey's really acting in actions in the
game and although controller movements
and the feel of modern warfare 3 is
still present there's so much new
mechanics that really changes the game
in a very delightful way but let's get
into the multiplayer and I'll show you
what I mean about the gameplay and also
the movements as well now you can
customize your character literally from
head to toe adding masks and glasses to
changing your gloves and even down to
your boots and as for the weapons
there's a decent amount of them pretty
standard and familiar with the co d
franchise but it also goes back to the
old-school way of achieving them you
have to basically unlock these weapons
by leveling up rather than earning
points and buying inventory at your
discretion and similar to the black ops
style though you have wild cards that
makes a comeback with a max inventory
slot located on the top of the screen
now what's more interesting are the kill
streaks now offer even deeper
customization increasing each kill
streaks effectiveness
now for example UAVs can stay out even
longer show you which way enemies are
facing even going higher in orbits
preventing them from just
shut down so overall the customization
has increased ink goes a bit deeper than
what it was before now your traditional
game modes comes back yet again but my
favorite mode sabotage is missing and of
course this is an overview of the game
so if I'm going a little bit too fast on
this list here feel free to rewind or
pause the video but infested also makes
a return under bonus playlists which is
always a welcomed comeback in the last
mode which I did not record was EXO
survival which is identical to spec ops
but of course now with EXO suits and the
enemies can now flank up walls and fly
just like you can but overall playing
this I really enjoy the movements in the
game when you're just running around the
map it really feels like modern warfare
3 just smooth movements nothing
over-the-top you're kind of like black
ops you can say but once you get really
good at the EXO movements this game gets
fast paced very quick and double jumping
up walls being able to dash in certain
directions really change the pace of the
gameplay and I can't imagine once we see
more people becoming pros at this the
crazy acrobatics will for sure be very
interesting now the map designs feels
very well put with a lot of tight
corridors but open areas is well perfect
for sniping and just overall
maneuverability on the map in general
but overall the game feels balanced and
a veteran of the series - a person just
getting into this game I'm sure they'll
appreciate it either way so again this
is just a brief overview of the game
which is my current style now for gaming
videos on my channel at the moment and
if you enjoy this quick pour meant just
to get the gist of what this game is all
about be sure to LIKE and subscribe and
add me on Facebook Twitter or Google+ so
this is Jimmy with Jim's review and I'll
see you guys on the next one
you guys take care bye
