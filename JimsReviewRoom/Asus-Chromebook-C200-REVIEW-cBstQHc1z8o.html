review room welcome to another review
now a lot of folks have been asking
about the latest and newest Asus
Chromebook the model I have here is the
c200 that comes in with an eleven and a
half inch screen while they c300 comes
in with a 13.3 inch screen now both
however having the same processor in RAM
on the model I have here is priced at
$249 is reported to have a 329 dollar
price tag so without further ado we'll
get started and like all of my
Chromebook videos if you're not familiar
with Chromebooks please watch my video
here what is a Chromebook to get
familiar now these notebooks are very
much different from Windows and Apple by
getting back on topic here size comes in
exactly 12 inches wide seven point nine
inches deep and point eight inches thin
which is on par with most other
Chromebooks on the market currently an
Asus comes in at just two point five
pounds for their 11 inch model which
makes it lighter than the newest Samsung
Chromebook 2 and the popular Acer c720
and the ACS model comes with these
standard connections like many other
Chromebooks with the left side having
your power input full size HDMI out USB
3.0 SD card reader and a headset port
and now rotating to the right side it
has your USB 2.0 input in a Kensington
security lock now one thing to point out
there's nothing on the front or the rear
of the unit including no fan motors Asus
is using the bay trail architecture for
their processor which uses even less
power than previous generations and runs
more efficiently requiring no moving
parts to cool the machine now more about
the processor later in this review but
around the five six and seven numeric
Keys on top here does only get slightly
warm not hot but just a small slight
sensation which is in my opinion
reasonable in regards to the speakers
the asus has won the best speakers and
it
that I've heard so far again for
Chromebooks there unfortunately down
firing but when placed on a tabletop
they do fire back and you do get some
immersion and a bit more distinct
spacial stereo sound compared to some of
the others out there the last feature is
the 720p resolution camera which
although is considered as
high-definition the bitrate appears to
be low still causing a still not so
clear blocky image as you can see on
your screen but moving on to the
physical build these generation of
Chromebooks are much better built with
the ACS offering minimal to no flexing
in the chassis any very solid flip up
screen as well the keyboard doesn't have
any issues and typing on it felt natural
and neutral the trackpad is a little
different with Asus claiming a slightly
bigger usable area which is a plus but
if you ever need to have a physical
press of the trackpad that click enos is
somewhat on a slight stiff side for me a
firmer press has to be applied compared
to the other Chromebooks in laptops
alike but while typing on the keyboard
when my palm accidentally hits the
trackpad it doesn't move my cursor
accidentally which is quite frustrating
if you ever experience that now for a
budget laptop or notebook this
Chromebook is well built in the same
build quality I believe as others on the
market the screen itself comes in at a
1366 by 768 resolution which is pretty
standard on budget laptops and most
Chromebooks
the screen is a glossy finish which does
reflect light sources though like
windows and table lamps directly behind
you but the trade-off glossy screens let
more light pass through and in turn the
ACS does have a bit more vibrancy and
contrast on the screen the c300 model
which has the same resolution offers a
matte display instead so that's
something to take into consideration if
you're planning and purchasing now
moving on to its internal specifications
this is where Asus differentiates itself
from many of the Chromebooks currently
available now Intel at the moment has
two main processors or architectures
that is or builds you can say the first
is Haas well and the newest one which is
the model have here is Bay Trail the Bay
Trail chip does give off less heat in
turn making it possible for this
Chromebook to be fanless with this
latest architecture used it does provide
battery performance which Asus claims up
to 10 hours of news which is more than
most other Chromebooks
available and with real-world testing
randomly surfing the internet playing a
movie streaming Pandora the entire time
the actual news I personally encountered
is currently displayed on your screen
but what else is good about this new
chip it does offer a B G and n Wi-Fi
connections but also the latest and
slowly being adapted into the future is
the AC standard which is much faster and
data transfer from your router and also
a stronger signal since it runs on a
five gigahertz band the rest of the
specifications are pretty standard like
all Chromebooks with just two gigs of
ram onboard an internal 16 gigabyte hard
drive and bluetooth 4.0 for additional
wireless connectivity but with all that
being said and mentioning of a new
processor in this computer how are the
benchmarks and real-world performance
now benchmarks are on your screen right
now and in real-world performance this
performed on par with other Chromebooks
on the market
Chromebooks in general are not power
machines though but for day-to-day
activities they function just enough
typical web sites like Facebook Yahoo
Google searches all went as normal
I've also stretched the Machine a bit
and placed 12 open chrome tabs all at
the same time while leaving Netflix and
pinned or playing in the background and
when everything has finished loading all
web pages surprisingly scrolled smoothly
I also performed slightly more demanding
tasks like playing a video in 1080p on
YouTube which I'll admit somewhat worked
some videos did stutter more than others
though but running in 720p resolution
instead ran flawless and seems enough
for the average consumer needs to be
honest
Netflix ran perfectly fine with slightly
speedier playback than the most recent
Samsung Chromebook 2 that I've reviewed
so overall Asus does offer some slight
differences that at least makes them
stand out and overall performance went
very good in my opinion as my test shown
for the average consumer so hope this
