ever welcome back to another one of my
videos today we're doing a comparison
between two speakers that you guys have
specifically asked me for products for
the last speaker so this is the Bose
revolve and also the Bose Soundlink mini
- you guys have specifically once
compared this because they are very
similar in price and also in size and
possibly performance which we'll find
out later in this video but jumping
right into this there's no fancy editing
in this comparison they both revolve
it's priced at $200 retail the mini -
used to be priced at $200 retail but
today boasted drop it down to one
hundred and eighty one of these I'll
place my Amazon affiliate link down in
the video description below click on
those links it will give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go out and
sale but jumping right into the physical
built here both of these feel
exceptionally well built here both are
basically made of metal aluminum that is
cold to the touch
and it just feels or is is premium all
together the biggest difference here
this might make or break your purchase
decision is that they both revolved is
rugged in the review I did you did see
me dropping maybe once or twice or so
but behind the scenes we actually
dropped about six or seven times trying
to get that perfect shot for you guys
and there's no Nick's remarks here its
cosmetically withstanding drops which is
phenomenal but also the speaker of
course still work today you don't get
any drop resistance with the mini -
another feature here is that this is
water resistance its splash resistant
that is you cannot submerge this
underwater
unfortunately so don't obviously drop it
into the poor so but if you're caught in
the rain if you spill a glass of water
on it no problems at all so moving on to
the physical connections here both the
speakers look very similar in regards to
connections both is bluetooth of course
both of these do have between half a
millimeter port for physical connections
but with that same microUSB port it is
used for charging these speakers but
when you revolve you actually can plug
this into your PC the PC will charge the
speaker same thing with mini - but with
revolve you can actually have audio play
from your PC into the speaker
you don't get that additional feature
with this with the MIDI to the other
feature that the most revolve has and
then the Soundlink mini to unfortunate
doesn't have you keep in mind a mini -
it's a little bit of an older speaker
that is they are involved can actually
double up or pair with another speaker
that is another Bose speaker and have it
play either left or right separate audio
channels or haven't played them in sync
some people basically have one speaker
at one roof and have the other speaker
playing a different room again both
playing the same exact song with the
mini - of course you don't get that and
additionally you don't have the both app
working with these sound like mini - as
well with the numerous speakers the
revolve revolve + and I believe the
sound link or Soundlink color that is
from Bose does work with the Bose app so
this again keep that in mind if you guys
do value the app experience and having a
bit more convenience and functionality
next up here regarding a Bluetooth
signal I did test both these speakers on
my samsung sa + left the speaker's here
in the studio walk down the hallway
about AV linear feet and although both
did claim up to 30 feet no drops in
signal at all on both of these speakers
and despite this being older and still
performed as well as they both revolve
now moving on here the next thing is
basically battery life Bose is claiming
up to 10 hours of life on this one which
is a little bit low for today's
standards here with the revolve it's
climbing up to 12 hours of use if you
guys want to know specifically what my
results were of course check out the
review but with up to 12 hours of use it
is pretty much on average with other
Bluetooth speakers of this size a small
size that is so again take that into
consideration when you guys are
considering how much is enough for you
next up here both of these do have the
ability to charge with a docking station
or a charging cradle that is the biggest
benefit though would they sound like
maybe - it actually comes in the package
you get this little cradle right here is
drop it in no need to mess around with
wires no need to mess around with the
wall adapter just drop it when you're
ready to go pick it up and walk away
with the revolve you do have that
accessory as well so it is an additional
cost and it's $30 right now from BOCES
website so that's really the biggest
difference between the physical aspects
and
the feature list as well to the part
that you guys have probably been waiting
for here is the audio sample the audio
test I'll play several songs for you
guys and then I'll give you my verdict
afterwards
Oh
Peter lei kung
and there you have it folks of course
audio recorded on my end and then play
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here now first things first you
probably can't tell by its physical
ability revolve does offer 360 degrees F
so places anywhere in the room walk
about anywhere in the room you're going
to get a very similar or maybe the same
audio experience wherever you go to same
volume levels the same experience in
general wouldn t revolve arms are with
these Holly mini two it's a little bit
more directional its front firing
speakers where the Bose logo is at and
that's not necessarily a bad thing I
actually do like this a lot because once
you have this pointed at you if it's
more for personal listening you get a
lot more direct sound which means a lot
more immersion and would be sound like
mini - you get much more fidelity you
have much better soundstage and still
this figure even though it's older it's
still one the best in sound stage
quality here where audio is coming from
left and right behind you for with you
both revolve again it offers 360-degree
sound so you lose that immersion of that
soundstage and also you do lose a little
bit of fidelity you don't lose a little
bit of resolution you lose a little bit
of detail compared to the sound with
mini - now with that being said that's
not saying that the audio experience is
horrible on this thing here it's
actually still one the best in the
market if you are into bass this is of
course much more bassy than the
Soundlink mini - if you were to walk
into a room for most average consumers
and you heard something playing in the
back
the speaker you're probably going to say
wow that sounds absolutely good
especially from a small tiny package it
offers a much more fuller sound it gets
louder than maybe maybe two with the
mini - and I can turn this up to a
hundred percent volume and I can turn
this to about maybe 75 to 80 percent
dime to get an equal performing audio
experience in regards to of loudness so
again for entertaining entertaining
purposes I think the revolve does a
little bit better I granted that you do
lose a little bit of quality for
personal listening I would say go with
the mini 2/4 clarity resolution detail
soundstage that is it's not as basic but
if you do value bass I get the revolve
you do lose again that quality but you
get more much more fuller sound from
your listening audio experience so I
hope this review or comparison that is
helped you in some way there's a more
detailed review of course those videos
are linked in the video description

into detail and each one of these
speakers individually so be sure that I
