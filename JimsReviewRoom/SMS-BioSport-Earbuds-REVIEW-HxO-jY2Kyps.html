room now earbuds were just earbuds at
one point in time meant just for
listening to music but today with a
healthier mindset amongst consumers and
the ever evolving technology behind
Bluetooth we have companies like Jabra
and today SMS audio creating Bluetooth
devices that provides real-time
heartrate information now these are
priced at $149 retail at the time of
this video and we'll see how they
compare to something more premium price
earbuds so without further ado welcome
to Jim's review now these come in three
different colors black blue and yellow
each is made of a hard type of plastic
with a nice glossy logo right in the
middle the construction feels tight and
rugged with no indication of having
flaws down the road now one area I
really look into is at the ends of each
earbud where the wire exits now on some
other earbuds you can see this hair
actually being weak and actually flexing
as well and over time causing the wire
to disconnect or become loose now with
the bow sports these look and feel
perfectly secure now all the color
variations come with a very nice tangle
free cord rolling these up and putting
them into a bag or your drawer will pose
no issues with noose down the road
however SMS does include its own
neoprene carrying pouch which is always
nice to have with a main compartment
offering ample storage room with no
additional pockets inside and a
secondary pouch on the front here for
other additional accessories now
speaking of accessories the bio sports
does come with two other sets of earbuds
so in total you'll have three Reggie
from small medium and large and
regarding my fitment test these
surprisingly has to be one of the most
secure non over-ear earbuds that I've
tested they fit in very secure in the
ear and unlikely powerbeats2 when you
are weightlifting and straining or in an
essence pulling muscles similar to when
you're smiling the earbuds don't lift
off the ear canal losing that sound
isolation at least they did in for me
now if you have some earbuds at home try
smiling several times with them in and
you'll sometimes feel them lift off of
the ear canal but jogging with these
and doing other activities the earbuds
never once fell out on my ear something
that has always been hit or miss with
some other earbuds I've tried now let's
talk about his new siege
I'll definitely discuss the heart rate
monitoring shortly but to get this out
the way the inline controller now it's
positioned right below the jaw line
offer controls to pause play and skip
music at least that's what's instructed
in the user guide however my test Here I
am on the Samsung Note 4 smartphone and
tapping twice on the earbuds here did
not allow me to skip my music on my
music apps now I try this on Slacker
Radio Pandora and then locally stored
music played through my music player and
another side note here SMS is upfront
about this there is no inline volume
controller you do have to adjust the
volume by pulling out your phone which i
think is very inconvenient especially
for be sport earbuds and I'm in the
middle of a jog or so however with those
limitations you can still answer phone
calls with just the tap of the button on
the inline controller now with my
testing on phone calls as requested by
viewers with my tester on the other line
my voice did not sound like I was far
away like on a speakerphone which is a
plus but my voice did sound amplified
with a very slight fuzziness or
distortion and no reasonable background
noises for heard
however testing this sitting in front of
a gentle fanned wind noise was picked up
distinctly causing a distraction overall
it's still good quality but for riding
your motorcycle or on a windy day it's
not the best performer and the last
feature here there is a button to
activate or turn on the heart rate
monitoring just by sliding it up and
come to my surprise SMS does not offer a
proprietary app that uses the HR
information instead SMS is endorsing the
use of the very popular app RunKeeper
and indeed RunKeeper is a fantastic free
app for those avid runners and if you do
buy the bow sports they do offer a free
month trial of RunKeeper elite for a
limited time which offer some additional
features not in the free version of
course now I'm not here to review the
RunKeeper
app itself but comparing this to the
only other heart rate monitoring earbud
on the market currently is the Jabra
sport pulse which retails for $200
expensive but after my review they do
offer a very detailed very robust Jabra
app
to help train and coach you now if
you're in the market for a built-in HR
monitoring in the earbuds definitely
watched my job video for more
information as well now in general the
bow sports only benefit is providing
heart rate monitoring to the RunKeeper
app not for SMS so it makes me think the
only reason why you would want these is
if you don't want to wear a chest strap
you don't want to spend 150 to 250
dollars for an activity band with a HR
monitor that's built right on the wrist
or if you're really sold out RunKeeper
already and you don't want to make that
switch to another program now in regards
to accuracy and you guys are going to
get a sneak peak here at the Fitbit
surge have yet to make a video for the
accuracy in the HR monitor for the bow
sports is actually awful I've tried this
several times just to make sure this
isn't a fluke but during a resting heart
rate it's actually somewhat accurate but
as soon as I start running the keyword
here as soon as I start running my heart
rate would skyrocket to a very high
level at about 170 beats per minute or
more and to test the accuracy and just
make sure that like I said I'm not doing
anything wrong here I cross-reference
this with my new fitbit surge SmartWatch
which measures HR levels right in the
wrist and also check this with a chest
heart rate monitor and that was
practically spot-on with the Fitbit and
I used the AXI meter on the back of my
samsung note 4 phone now three devices
were within tolerance and the very last
measurement to rule them over was
physically counting my pulse in Tommy
it's again only the bounce sports were
reading at such a high level and yes I
did adjust the earpiece and ensured
everything was properly seated but to be
honest with you it shouldn't take that
much effort to get these to work anyways
now it's quite a letdown about the HR
monitoring since that's what's unique
about this device this pair of earbuds
now the sound quality is good with no
distortion there's clear mids and highs
the most generous are appreciated by
comparing these two these similarly
balanced sound signature earbuds like
the blue bar X's the bow sports are
missing a little bit of depth in its
base the job our sport pulse and the
blue butt axes both premium earbuds they
both offered better immersion into the
music offers louder sound and against
slightly
bass now for the average consumer if
you're not comparing the other two
affirmation earbuds the bow sports will
still sound good it's actually bright
sounding signatures for the earbuds but
if you're an audio enthusiast you may
desire a little bit more so that's it
for this video if you like my work be
sure to add me
