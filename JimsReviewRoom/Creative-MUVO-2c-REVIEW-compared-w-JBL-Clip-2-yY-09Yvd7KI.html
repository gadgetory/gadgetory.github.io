creative sent me their newest and
smallest portable bluetooth speakers the
move o2c is priced at just $49 retail at
the time this video and this surely
takes aim at the likes of the JBL clip
too I'll leave my links in the video
description below click on my links and
they'll give you the most updated prices
in real time so without further adieu my
channels here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room the move of to see is
seriously small it fits right into the
palm of my hands now it's great for
transport it's seriously light here and
the construction is once again top-notch
with a very strong metal grill on the
front rotating to the rear is a bass
radiator which does flex and so far it
doesn't show any signs of possibly
breaking here if you want to do push
this in quite deep the buttons up top
are silicone and provides a very nice
clicky feedback but there are errors
which I didn't like at all now although
there's a hole to have a string or strap
attached creative doesn't provide one in
the Box honestly not a big issue but
something that I wanted to point out now
the other the rubber or silicone flap on
the side it's slightly difficult to
remove and even harder at times to put
back now you have to get it perfectly
lined here to ensure the flap seals the
speaker and prevent any water from
leaking in but behind that flap though
there's a 3.5 millimeter port for
physical connections a micro SD card
slot if you want to use flag files for
the best quality music and last is a
micro USB port for charging the device
or if you connect this to your computer
you can listen to music via the USB
cable as well and then regarding better
life on this it is rated up to 6 hours
of use now sealing this back up the
movie to see as ip66 certified meaning
this can take water sprays and be caught
in the rain with no problems it just
simply can't be submerged underwater you
just can't do that now with me spraying
this speaker at every angle here it
still works perfectly fine now the very
last feature and similar to JBL and ue
offering their double up or pairing
features with two of these modes you can
have two pair together and play left and
right audio channels which does help
somewhat here but i'll discuss
more of that a little bit later but for
now let me play several songs for you
and then I'll give you my verdict
afterwards
wherever love goes there was also misery
is the mystery and do an eye we got
history
yay
wherever left flows there is also
tragedy when we're in too deep you and I
we got history Hey
Oh
Hey
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded in my end and
then play through your speakers are not
the best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review here the move-up
provides a clean tone and offers just
enough audio to be enjoyed you might be
able to tell the demos here they move
out to see a slightly lower in volume
and for short slightly less and bass
when you do compare it directly with the
JBL clip to now overall the vocals are
clean though and the high notes don't
ting which is great
creating an audio experience enough for
self enjoyment now regarding that
soundstage in person the JBL clip 2
sounded to have a wider present and that
deeper bass does help give music a bit
more depth now as mentioned earlier you
can pair two of these creative speakers
for left and right audio channels but
the most I could spread them out was
about 6 feet apart now although the
speakers do work perfectly fine across
the room here
the audio performance isn't loud enough
on each one of these speakers for the
vibe to basically cross its path again
keep them within six feet of each other
to get that more a full listening
experience overall a good cleaning
sounding speaker but the only thing
lacking is its loudness and a little bit
of bass would have been great for now
the JBL clip 2 offers water submersion a
clip here includes a three-and-a-half
millimeter wire and better audio
performance I believe for $10 more at
$60 or sometimes on Amazon they have
them for $50 even again my links will be
in the video description below for you
