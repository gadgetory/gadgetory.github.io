while it's been like two weeks since
I've been sick where I just have been
coughing profusely my mind wasn't in the
right place and whatnot
I never seen three different doctors I'm
finally on some antibiotics and I'm on
day three of five right now so I'm not
100% there I'm still a little bit
nasally but I am getting better but I
can at least finally talk and speak and
I can't wait to get back on a microphone
and start filming and all that fun stuff
again but there's so much I want to talk
to you guys about there's so many things
that has or was planned for 2016 or plan
for like the last week or two that I
couldn't get to so we'll see that coming
down the road in the next few weeks and
whatnot but I got my coat on I better
run out and do some errands take you
guys along and just give you some
updates that's all alright
all right so I'm just really taking it
easy today I just answered a bunch of
business emails earlier this morning
responded to a lot of the messages guys
sent to me three well like twitter
facebook instagram and whatnot i know i
can't get to all of them
i mean there's hundreds I mean hundreds
of them and man even if I just miss like
a couple of days worth of work man it's
it's horrible to come back and you're
like holy cow you spent like several
hours it's responding back to stuff but
if I didn't get to your message I do
apologize but I've answered most of the
more recent ones and hopefully you
answered some of your questions and
whatnot but updates regarding Jim's
review room if the last vlog that I did
I was at about a hundred thousand
subscribers and right now I'm at a
hundred and like ten which is like
mind-boggling since that ten thousand of
you guys came in and within like last
two weeks I'm not so welcome to a lot of
new faces welcome to my vlogs they're
not professional looking at all they
just recorded on my cell phone and but
it's a way for me to you know get a
little bit more personable with you guys
answer some of the questions and so you
guys see some behind the scenes stuff as
well I don't think the Sun is like
glaring red in my eyes here but I'm
stopping by Trader Joe's real quick I'm
gonna pick up my lady some flowers
she's been phenomenal the last two weeks
she's been waking up early to take our
kids to daycare that's usually my job
but she's been doing that but let me
find this parking spot real quick here
and I'll show you guys well I got in
store what I got to review in the next
couple of weeks and here are some items
just give me a second here let me get
these boxes for you guys so something's
boxes I don't know what's in them
file I got a knife in the car or a box
cutter videos so I can just open up
these packages real quick here I think
this is yeah this is my personal stuff
here
so I paid for these I'm not sponsored or
anything by these guys so I just went on
Amazon got some copper compression here
I don't know if you guys can see that
but I was trying to give back into
working out and whatnot
and I noticed I have been having them
some freaking tennis elbow when doing
some incline dumbbell presses and
whatnot you know working a money chest
upper chest pecs whatever I'm not trying
to get huge or anything like that I'm
just trying to maintain to be honest
with you I just sit in the office you
know most of the day I sit or stand but
then you're just doing like camera work
and whatnot I'm not as active as I used
to be so trying to get back into shape
and whatnot I got some wrist straps as
well some heavy-duty wrist straps and
whatnot
there's nothing too fancy I mean this
just really your generic stuff visually
tough around the wrist here and then
when you lift in just help support the
wrist a little bit let's see what we got
here so this marks already opened this
one I did not pay for just being honest
and truthful with you guys but draw bruh
last year I had a horrible time just
trying to get a contact at jabra but I
guess finally finally businesses get a
little bit better so they sent me some
earphones sport earbuds and this one
here is the sport coat coach this is the
I think this is the newest one a sport
pace there goes the sport coach that's
what it looks like right there yeah
support pace obviously these are has the
ear hooks which I notice stays on
obviously a little bit better but I
usually like the ones that goes into the
ear canal that way it gives me a better
sound immersion and sound isolation from
the world which I know sometimes people
say it's not too safe when you're
running and you
and when you can't hear your
surroundings let's see here this box
here this bad boy I know a lot of people
haven't asked me about this I have
waited two years for this i pre-ordered
this I think a little over a year ago
and it's finally here hopefully you guys
can see that and the images is not
reversed but this is the Atlas wearables
fitness tracker but it's more
specifically designed for weight lifters
and it's a proprietary technology and
what-not pendant I think that's what the
technical term is we're basically Fitbit
and although big guys can't duplicate
this techno technology as of yet but let
me just show you the back real quick
here see what it's all about but this
can automatically read your form it can
read the different types of workouts
that you're doing automatically it can
differentiate alternating dumbbell curls
with I don't know maybe a shoulder press
or something like that so it's it's
really really intuitive since it does it
all automatically for you it's one of
the very few bands maybe the only band
right now that can read your gym type
workouts you know with free weights and
whatnot so I'm pretty excited to test
this out considering that I'm trying to
get back into the gym and get back into
shape so we'll see about that
I did personally pay for that one right
there and oh sweet okay so I got the
track our Bravo and I don't know if you
guys ever heard of tile it's one of
these little things that you just attach
to your keychain or your bike or leave
it I don't for females of you know leave
it in your personal whatnot this is a
very small little device here that you
just basically put it anywhere that you
need to and if you ever lose it you just
pull up your phone and should find it
anywhere
in the United States and whatnot so I'm
eager to test this so I got the Bravo
here they gave me the the carabiner and
a water-resistant sleeve so that should
be really interesting to see you here
those are all the items I have so far
Oh two more items if you guys follow me
on social media here I have this is the
Moto 360 second generation and I have
the Huawei SmartWatch of themselves I
want to begin to see that let me lean up
real quick here you see the screen yeah
tilt your wrist here so the screens on
and again the Moto 360 and now the
screens a little bit a little bit hard
to see right now there you go but if you
guys on social media of course I've
taken pictures of these and follow me on
Jim's review room Facebook Twitter
Instagram and you guys can see more
up-close photos on those so I got these
two tests these are probably the first
reviews I'm gonna push out first and
then all these other items will be for
the rest of January and whatnot and and
I did promise you guys in December I did
partner up with Sennheiser and they're
actually doing a giveaway for you guys
I'm not getting paid for it I'm not
getting any free stuff from it either
yeah they just reached out to me and
they said hey would you like to you know
give out some free items to to some of
your viewers I said hell yeah why not
I'm pretty sure you guys would like it
so they said that they want to give out
three sets of their sport earbuds and
I'll give you the model numbers and
whatnot I'll try to do that video this
week so be on the lookout for that so
there's another giveaway and Sennheiser
will be handling that for me so thank
goodness but on that that is about it
I'm gonna run inside and get my ladies
and flowers all right
all right got him
hey guys think Rachel like huh she loved
these here
she loved the Gerber of flowers and once
they expanded further it gets a lot more
dense than the petals and what that I
don't know that's nothing for her
I'm sure she'll she'll like him
hopefully she'll like him the trader Joe
is not bad man you get some nice flowers
this bouquet was 10 bucks and I mean
sometimes I got the nice bouquets for
like $6 or $7 and they look they look
great so it's a great way not to break
the bank but the same time get I mean a
lot of bang for you buck and I'm always
down for this especially on of course
Jim's review room let's get out of here
what time is it 4:30 I'm gonna go pick
up my little girl early there yeah let's
do that
all right folks on that's probably
hitting with this video I didn't want to
get too deep into the business side of
things of Jen's review room I'm gonna
put that for the next vlog I allow the
new
things contents and some new I don't
know goals that I'm gonna try to strive
for for 2016 and just continue that
momentum from the last year last two
years of doing this full-time so in the
meantime write down any questions guys
want to ask down below it doesn't have
to be YouTube related you can ask me
something personal if you guys like and
I'll try to answer them on the next vlog
which most likely I might do one
probably ahead of this week
if not then of course sometime next week
but yeah ask me anything you guys want
and we'll go from there
but anyways I am signing off this video
was just more to give you guys an update
and where the hell I've been I've been
sick and officially back I guess you can
say it's almost these meds to keep
working for me like setup mind a 3 out
of 5 so it looks promising
