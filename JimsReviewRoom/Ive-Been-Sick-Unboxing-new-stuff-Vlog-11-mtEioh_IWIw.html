while it's been like two weeks since
I've been sick where I just been
coughing profusely my mind wasn't in the
right place and whatnot I never seen
three different doctors I'm finally on
some antibiotics and i'm on day three of
five right now so I'm not a hundred
percent there i'm still a little bit
nasally but i am getting better but uh i
can at least finally talk and speak and
i can't wait to get back on a microphone
and start filming and all that fun stuff
again but there's so much I want to talk
to you guys about there's so many things
that has or was planned for 2016 or plan
for like last week or two that I
couldn't get to so we'll see that coming
down the road in the next few weeks and
whatnot but I got my coat on bottom run
out and do some errands take you guys
along and give you some updates that's
all all right
alright so I'm just really taking it
easy today I just answered a bunch of
business emails earlier this morning
responded to a lot of the messages guys
sent to me through well like twitter
facebook instagram and whatnot i know i
can get to all of them I mean there's
hundreds I mean hundreds of them and man
even if I just miss like a couple of
days worth of work man it's it's
horrible to come back and you're like
holy cow you spent like several hours is
responding back to stuff but if I didn't
get to your message i do apologize but
i've answered most of the more recent
ones and hopefully answer some of your
questions and whatnot but updates
regarding Jim's review room if the last
vlog that I did I was at about a hundred
thousand subscribers and right now I'm
at a hundred and like 10 which is like
mind-boggling since that 10,000 of you
guys came in and within like last two
weeks i'm not so welcome to allowed new
faces welcome to my vlogs they're not
professional looking at all they just
recorded on my cell phone and but it's a
way for me to you know get a little bit
more personable with you guys answer
some of the questions and so you guys
see somebody behind the scenes stuff as
well I don't think sun is like glaring
red in my eyes here but I'm stopping by
trader joe's real quick I'm gonna pick
up my lady some flowers she's been
phenomenal the last two weeks she's been
waking up early to take our kids to
daycare that's usually my job but she's
been doing that but let me find this
parking spot real quick here and I'll
show you guys well I got in store what I
got to review in the next couple of
weeks and here are some high-tech just
give me a second here let me get these
boxes for you guys so some of these
boxes I don't know what's in them file I
got a knife in the car or a box cutter
that is so I can just open up these
packages real quick here thank ya this
is my personal stuff here
so I pay for these I'm not sponsored or
anything by these guys so I just went on
Amazon got some copper compression gear
I don't know if you guys can see that
but I was trying to give back into
working out and whatnot and I noticed I
have been having them freakin tennis
elbow when doing some incline dumbbell
presses and whatnot you know working on
money chest upper chest pecs whatever
i'm not trying to get huge or anything
like that i'm just trying to maintain to
be honest with you I just sit in the
office you know most of the day I sit or
stand but then yums you're just doing
like camera work and whatnot I'm not as
active as I used to be so trying to get
back into shape and whatnot I got some
wrist straps as well some heavy-duty
wrist straps and whatnot it's nothing
too fancy man this just really your
generic stuff basically up around the
rest here and then when you lift in just
help support the wrist a little bit
let's see what we got here so this marks
already hoping this one I did not pay
for just being honest and truthful with
you guys but raw bruh last year I had a
horrible time I just trying to get a
contact at jabra but I guess finally
finally business is getting little bit
better so they sent me some earphones
sport earbuds and this one here is the
sport coat coach this is the I think
that's the newest one a sport pace there
goes the sport coach that's what it
looks like right there and sport pace
obviously these are has the ear hooks
which I notice stays on obviously a
little bit better but I usually like the
ones that goes into the ear canal that
way it gives me a better sound immersion
and sound isolation from the world which
I know sometimes people say it's not too
safe when you're running you
and when you can't hear your
surroundings let's see here this box
here this bad boy I know a lot of people
haven't asked me about this I have
waited two years for this i pre-ordered
this I think a little over a year ago
and it's finally here hopefully you guys
can see that the images is not reversed
but this is the Atlas wearables fitness
tracker but it's more specifically
designed for weight lifters and it's a
proprietary technology and what not
patented I think that's what the
technical term is where basically Fitbit
and although the big guys can't
duplicate this techno technology as of
yet but let me just show you the back
real quick here see what it's all about
but this can automatically read your
form it can read the different types of
workouts that you're doing automatically
it can differentiate alternating
dumbbell curls with I don't know maybe a
shoulder press or something like that so
it's it's really really intuitive since
it does it all automatically for you
it's one of the very few bands may be
the only band right now that can read
your gym type workouts you know with
free weights and whatnot so I'm pretty
excited to test this out considering
that I'm trying to get back into the gym
and get back into shape so we'll see
about that I did personally pay for that
one right there and oh sweet okay so i
got the track our bravo and i don't if
you guys ever heard of a title it's one
of these little things that you just
attach to your keychain or your bike or
leave it I don't four females of you
know leave it in your person whatnot
this is a very small little device here
that you just basically put it anywhere
that you need to and if you ever lose it
you just pull up your phone and should
find it anywhere
in the United States and whatnot so I'm
eager to test this so I got the Bravo
here they gave me the carabiner and a
water-resistant sleeve so that should be
really interesting to see you here those
are all the items I have so far Oh two
more items if you guys follow me on
social media here i have this is the
Moto 360 second generation and I have
the huawei SmartWatch themselves i want
to begin to see that let me lean up real
quick here see the screen yeah tilt your
wrist here so it screens on and again
the Moto 360 and now the screens a
little bit a little bit hard to see
right now there you go but if you guys
on social media of course I've taken
pictures of these and follow me on Jim's
review room Facebook Twitter Instagram
and you guys can see more up-close
photos on those so I got these two to
test these are probably the first
reviews i'm going to push out first and
then all these other items will be for
the rest of january and whatnot and and
I did promise you guys in december i did
partner up with sennheiser and they're
actually doing a giveaway for you guys
i'm not getting paid for it i'm not
getting any free stuff from it either
yeah they just reached out to me and
they said hey would you like to you know
give out some free items to do some of
your viewers I said hell yeah why not
i'm pretty sure you guys will like it so
they said they want to give out three
sets of their sport earbuds and i'll
give you the model numbers and whatnot
I'll trying to do that video this week
so be on the lookout for that so there's
another giveaway and sennheiser will be
handling that for me so thank goodness
but on that that is about it i'm gonna
run inside and get my ladies and flowers
all right
alright got him hey guys think thank you
like him she loved these here she loved
the gerber of flowers once they expand
him further it gets a lot more dense
than the petals of that I don't know
that's nothing for her I'm sure she'll
she'll like him hopefully she'll like
them ah be a trader joe's not bad man
and you get some nice flowers this
bouquet was ten bucks and I mean
sometimes I got the nice bouquets for
like six dollars or so seven dollars and
they look they look great so it's a
great way not to break the bank but the
same time get I me a lot of bang for you
buck and I'm always down for this
specially on of course Jim's review room
let's get out of here what time is it

the business side of things of a gentle
review room I'm going to put that for
the next vlog allow the new
things content item new I don't know
goals that I'm gonna try to strive for 4
