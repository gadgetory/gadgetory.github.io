room the power beats 3 makes a return
this time unders apples ownership with
the same retail price of $199 now
comparing to the competition these are
on the upper end of sport earphones but
we'll see if the power beats can justify
its price one more time I personally pay
for these but I'll leave my links in the
video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these might go on sale and as
a side note I'll be making a comparison
between these PB 3s versus the jaybird X
threes and Freedoms very soon
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
going over the physical features the all
plastic construction feels solid and the
adjustable ear hooks helps keep the
earphones on during running
weightlifting any kind of vigorous
movements you can name it you can't
shake these things off the tangle free
Court makes a return and the inline
bottom controller right here is once
again very click here and very
responsive now the unit is sweat and
water resistance and with me pouring
water all over these things they still
work time and time again the last but
not least here there are four silicon
tips in general this is clearly
subjective here but they are comfortable
for my small ear canals I know some of
you guys who are watching have smaller
canals like I do but keep in mind the
power beats three ear tips they rest
around the opening of the ear canal and
doesn't necessarily go in here like the
J board sport earphones for that secure
fit
now some like the in-ear method as it
does provide more sound isolation yet
some would say it is uncomfortable and
with the power beats 3 although it is
comfortable the earphones do let in more
sound from your environment which is
good if you're jogging you want to hear
your surrounding environment for safety
purposes and then for other people it's
not so great if you want to block out
the outside world again that's why I
meant by its completely subjective it's
completely up to you now regarding
battery life beats is climbing up to 12
hours which is very high for a pair of
mainstream sport earphones
I've personally tested this leaving it
on overnight from a full battery that
power beats 3 died in 13 hours in 33
minutes to be exact at 50% volume and at
the same test that I do in all my
headphones and earphones reviews Apple
is also claiming that because of its w1
chip inside you also get better wireless
range Wireless strength is great and
performed perfectly fine here when I
pair this to either my Google pixel XL
or my iPhone 7 and both tests standing
on the opposite side of the house while
the pair of earphones are on the other
side of the house again no problems at
all now one item that I was definitely
not Keenum is the open mouth soft
silicone case zipper type is gone and
with this it does work I'll be honest
about you about that but I have
preferred a more secure enclosure to
maybe place my ear tips in maybe the USB
cable without fear of it falling out the
case that would've been a little bit
tougher to help protect my earphones
while they're in my bag would have been
useful as well this is a
active in the case doesn't work but I
felt more protection and a more secure
enclosure would have gone a lot further
so last year let's talk about the audio
test starting with base the power beats
three offers that sub base level that
many other sport earphones don't offer
indeed there are times when vocals in
the mid-range might get a little muddy
but if you're a bass head enjoy hip-hop
pop and EDM I still highly recommend
these the mids are clearing presents not
bright and not recessed either from my
testing but enough to be enjoyable the
highs for certain genres can sound a bit
sharp though at times I'm needing to
turn the volume down a bit of our
extended listening there are times when
I do have a slight listening fatigue
it's very faint but it is something I
did notice that was present now
utilizing an equaliser does help to
alleviate those matters now one of the
qualities that the power beats 3 has for
sure here is the openness of its
soundstage sound from left and right
audio channels have tons of audio
separation and direction of sound from
in front of you to behind you let's say
are very much distinguishable it's very
impressive for a pair of sport earphones
now overall the power beats it does get
loud here it's a more in-your-face sound
with very nice sub bass I would say for
non audio files or the average consumer
I'm sure most will enjoy these pair of
earphones now those who are looking for
something more accurate or neutral of
course there's other brands out there in
the end from the brands out there in the
end for the average consumer standpoint
still a quality pair of earphones the
better life is one the best year the
wireless range is possibly the best and
they will stay on most people's heads
perfectly fine now if you do listen to
heavily into hip-hop pop and/or EDM here
it's worth a look into if you're finding
the audio too powerful a free equalized
from the App Store the Play Store will
foreshore help so hope this review
