room I was away on business all of last
week so you didn't see any videos come
out but hum PEC for the remainder of the
year now while I was gone creative labs
did send me their newest creative Aurore
go which is a portable version of their
2016 I roar now it's priced at $199
retail at the time of this video but
I'll place my links in the video
description below click on my links you
know give you the most updated prices in
real time now jumping right into this
this looks very similar to the previous
creative rural products that have tested
over the years is the same great metal
finish highly durable construction and
solid quality the only error physically
that I would critique here would be the
buns are now recessed or dimpled in
quite a bit and I'm sure it is to
prevent any accidental presses while in
transport but being as recessed as it is
it takes a little more effort in each
press and it's just simply not as
intuitive not a deal breaker but
something to point out on the sides you
still have these same base radiators and
with its new metal finish it looks and
feels very premium and as this is
designed for portability I do admit the
size is quite nice it's in between a
medium to small size bluetooth speaker
and the weight is very similar to the
competition at one point seven eight
pounds or 810 grams now new to the eye
or go is the IP X six certification with
a six signifying it is splash proof it's
not fully waterproof but I guess you can
have some peace of mind here if you're
by the pool a speaker still works
perfectly fine F I poured water on this
thing now rotating to the rear the ports
are covered by a rubber flap and behind
here you charge the unit with the
supplied AC adapter there's a three 1/2
millimeter input a USB charge out port
so the speaker can charge your phone or
other devices just like a power bank
there's a microUSB port here to listen
to your audio with your PC and less is a
micro SD card slot for those intending
and using stored music now with the
micro SD card slot you're able to listen
to flat files which are uncompressed
audio for one of the cleanest and best
audio experiences now one thing I did
want to mention though sadly I didn't
find the ability for the IRA or go to
charge via the micro USB port if you
need to charge this you have to bring
along the wall
after the regarding better life creative
is claiming up to 12 hours of use which
I found accurate with 50% volume and
compared to the competition the very
poplar Bose Soundlink mini 2 gets 10
hours and the other very popular
JBL charge 3 gets a whopping 20 hours of
use now on the far left of the speaker
or all your media controls plus the
Aurora button that changes your audio
sound signature and right before getting
to the audio test creative is very much
promoting a wide soundstage based on the
placement of his speaker itself there's
rubber or a silicon feet on the front
here allowing you to stand this
vertically up for use and with this
method audio is pushed directly at you
instead of firing towards the ceiling
and it does help with providing a more
immersive sound stage
now there's other variations too like
placing the speaker near a wall or
having a speaker at different heights
would change the audio characteristics
pretty straightforward but here let me
play several songs for you guys and then
I'll give you my verdict afterwards but
I guess over the years things changed
and the monsters I was a versus scare
found the way runs in my life and kept
straight into my hide and now I feel
them crawl D scream the deep inside my
body
becoming me and I feel I'm crawling
no your them scream the team inside my
party
me
to do
I swear
I just wanna feel
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded on my end and
then play through your speakers are not
the best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review here and when I first
listened to this speaker first
impressions that is it sounded quite
good for the average consumer the
speaker is genuinely loud and low to
moderate volume here there's a sense of
clarity and overall enjoyment from this
speaker now bass is one of the biggest
selling points creative is promoting
here and the IRA or NGO surely has it
for such a small size now even at times
it sounds deeper and even louder than
the popular JBL charge three and even
the sound stage is a bit wider as well
but I did notice when you do have the I
roared go at higher volumes on select
generals of music you do have some muddy
mids and the high frequencies do tend to
be a bit noisy it's much more apparent
on popping fast EDM music now having the
speaker placed vertically does have
quite a bit here as demonstrated in the
video and even some EQ adjusting might
be a must for those who are more
particular with their audio now overall
it's a good speaker and does outperform
some but then there are some particular
songs that is as mentioned earlier the
quality clarity and the fidelity is lost
now also considering its price points I
think there's more well-rounded
Bluetooth speakers out there with indeed
less features but the audio quality I
think does sound better
specifically the Bose Soundlink mini 2
and the sony srs series of options and
before if we get here regarding
Bluetooth range this sounded perfectly
fine when I have the speaker and the
cell phone here and opposite sides of
the house so how this review helped in
some way be sure to LIKE and subscribe
if you haven't already and add me on to
Facebook Twitter and or Instagram you
guys take care and I'll see you on the
next one bye
