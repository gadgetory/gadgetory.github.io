room Samsung had just released their new
Bluetooth speakers to the market last
year they didn't make too much of a
splash for some reason and they were
nowhere as popular as some of the other
brands like UE JBL and Bose so I'm
giving them a try here with their new
level box mini at the budget price that
I paid for
of $99 retail for more updated pricing I
placed a link in the video description
below for your convenience so without
further ado add me on to Twitter
Instagram or Facebook and be sure to
subscribe if you haven't already
I'm Jimmy Wynn Jim's Ruby room and I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over the physical features first
this is considered as a small speaker
for smaller areas needing entertainment
it's super lightweight for easy
transports and made completely of
aluminum and coated with a beautiful
anodized blue that I have here other
colors include black silver and red as
well overall it's a nice built all
around quality finish and buttons on top
give nice subtle feedback when pressed
but going over the buttons real quick
here on the left is pause and play next
is down and up for volume and last is
the power button which also glows red
yellow and green to indicate battery
levels unfortunately novi more a true
battery level indicator to give you an
idea of where this thing is at now while
still on top the NFC logo is located to
the right standing for near field
communication and embassy enabled
devices can just tap here and the
devices will pair instantly for you
there's no need to manually go through
your Bluetooth settings rotating to the
back there is a bluetooth pairing button
to mean 1/2 millimeter input for
physically connecting your device to the
speaker and last is a micro USB 2.0 port
for charging the device
now speaking of battery power here
Samsung claims up to a crazy 22 hours of
playback now I didn't do my test at 50%
volume but instead this time I placed
this speaker at full volume and let it
run testing not only the battery but of
course the stress tests on these papers
too from full the battery died in 10
hours and exactly 39 minutes not bad at
all considering it's all the way up at
full volume and much bigger bluetooth
speakers are obtaining similar numbers
too now as we're recharging that bed
either around 2 hours from a dead
battery to full was what I achieved but
back to the speaker itself here it's a
very simple device nothing extra no
charge out pours no daisy chaining to
other Bluetooth speakers and of course
it is not water resistant as well
however it's sturdy yet easy to stow in
the bag the speaker doesn't vibrate or
move off the table at maximum volume
thanks to its rubber base and the front
speakers is where mostly the sound is
coming from now on the rear that's where
you hear all the bases being pushed out
but let's get into the sound test here
I'll play several songs for you guys and
then give you my verdict afterwards
gyah cuz I got it like that throw so
smooth like I got it on tap
yeah and I'm a shake it be a good night
while I'm on my gangland while I'm
drinking Bud Light can you get it when
you miss me
like I'm wit whiskey-drinking Jim Beam
need baby do you do it do it that way do
you do that
did you take a break you know
I'm gonna wear that dress you like
skin-tight on my real grill now you see
me syncopate my skin to your happening
good for you good for you I just wanna
look good for you good for you let me
show you how and there you have it folks
of course I'm recorded on my end and
then played through your speakers or not
the best depiction of audio quality
that's my review here overall and this
was quickly realized the level box mini
is really conservative but compared to
other Bluetooth speakers in the small
speaker category it does okay with bass
as there is some substance but nothing
close to being thumping or deep the
mid-range where you hear most vocals and
instruments are really standard to
providing an equal balance with bass
levels and the high notes now don't get
me wrong the mid-range is clean and
clear but due to being so small or maybe
so conservative it's not dominant or it
doesn't stand outs like some of the
other speakers on the market the highs
and lows do have some serious roll-off
so putting this at maximum volume it's
not your piercing it's not droning it's
not distorted which is a good thing but
overall you do miss out on range
basically any difference between again
the lowest any highest tones this
speaker game plays really clean and
clear enough for your listening needs
but overall for it being so conservative
even at maximum volume I still wasn't as
immersed into my music
honestly felt the level box mini was
indeed more for casual listening and
definitely there's nothing wrong with
that but it only provided music good for
a small bedroom and even at that it was
again more for casual listening it's
simply not loud when turned all the way
up in the end if you want music in
general that's better than your phone or
maybe your desktop sure the speaker
would provide that but if you're looking
for somewhat more of a WOW factor for
the same price you got to look elsewhere
and before I leave here this is not a
direct comparison but since I'm doing a
review on the JBL flip 3 as well here's
a really quick sample to see where the
Samsung stands
cuz I got it like that flow so smooth
like I got it on tap yeah and I'm a
shake it be a good night while I'm on my
Qinglin while I'm drinking Bud Light can
you get it when you miss me like I'm wit
whiskey drinking Jim Beam hey baby do
you do it do it that way do you do that
did you take a break but that's it for
this review hope you enjoyed it if you
can please like and subscribe if you
haven't already done so and find me on
Facebook Twitter and or Instagram to see
behind the scenes information and also
some photos that I post usually on there
and I will be reviewing the JBL flip 3
that should be coming down pretty
shortly here and for the same price $99
it does sound much louder than this one
here but again that's not just on
initial impressions wait for the review
again I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
you guys take care I'll see the next one
