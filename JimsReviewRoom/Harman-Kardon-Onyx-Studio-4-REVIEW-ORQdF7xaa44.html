room welcome back to another one of my
videos today for checking out this
speaker right here you guys been asked
me for ever to review this I passed up
on the onyx studio - passed up on the
onyx to do 3 and it's because it was
crazy expensive every time I check the
price here this one it retails for $450
that's obscene do not pay that price I
actually got it on sale at 205 as of
this video as I'm writing this or
speaking to the camera right now I'll
put up some screenshots this is going
for about 150 as low as 130 dollars from
reputable resources like Amazon and such
I'll leave my affiliate link down in
that video description below click on
those links for the most updated prices
in real time you never know when these
things might go on sale again hopefully
you guys catch it then so anyways guys
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review and I'm here
to help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
going of the physical features this
thing looks damn sleek it looks really
modern contemporary it's all black very
jims Rovira mesh style you got your
front fabric grill very premium built
here is no compromising those speakers
being exposed where I can practically
mess up rotating to the rear we have
hard plastic on the back with a silicone
rubberized textured band going all the
way around the speakers when you grab
you do feel this a little grippy texture
I do wish it was all the way around here
as well to continue that premium feel if
we don't get that but don't over the
buttons real quick if you're looking at
the front and on like I am you got your
bluetooth pairing button on your left
you have your JBL connect plus feature
it's the same logo practically because
they're basically they own each other of
the same company Harman Kardon JBL but I
did test this and try to pair it with my
JBL pulse 3 speaker which is on the
shelf right over there and also some
other JBL speakers happy here at the
office unfortunately couldn't get them
to pair together in play in stereo mode
now you can use another harman kardon
product that has the JBL or a Harman
Kardon connect plus feature and have
them play both at the same time or
connect up to a hundred plus speakers
and have nose all play at the same time
if you have a bunch around you now
moving down here at the bottom we have
audio down audio up and we do have the
phone call button and on the very right
we have the on/off feature now rotating
through the rear this speaker is about
four and a half pounds it does come with
this little handle this speaker is meant
to be more stationary to stay at home
like so but what I'm trying to say is
because of the handle it does make
hearing a little bit easier if you need
to bring this to a friend's house if you
need to bring it downstairs it's not a
big deal to be honest with you it's no
different than carrying one of these
around this is the sony xba-40 a and a
half here this is the JBL extreme and i
think this is four point six pounds and
correct me forum i think this is four
point three pounds or so so this one
basically sits right in between a door
it's my new difference what I'm saying
is that yes all these speakers are
portable including the annex four right
here it does have a little bit of weight
so of course throwing this in your bag
might not be ideal especially I just
want to point this out to you as well
these legs
that appear to be removable I thought
they were considered that has this
little circular indentation here but
again this stays here to keep this
speaker upright now looking at this here
this is a passive radiator this does
flex pretty well looks really cool when
you got music going and then rotating
all the way to the bottom you have a
micro USB ports for service we have a
three-and-a-half millimeter input for
physical connections and you do have a
power port here which connects to the
supplied wall adapter this is not
charged by micro USB 2.0 now better life
is claimed to be up to eight hours and
improvement over the Onyx 3 which only
claimed up to five hours but did I get
eight hours on this one I tested this
just like all my Bluetooth speakers at
50% volume and this several times here
I'm getting around six hours in 20
minutes on average not close to the
eight hours but again to the previous
generations it still does well compared
to these this does like crap to be
honest with you but again like I said it
does come with a wall mount this is
meant to be more of a at home stationary
speaker so other that missing features
I've noticed on here was NFC there's no
near-field communication no easy pairing
that is it's not waterproof water
resistant is not durability or not drop
resistant that is we don't have battery
indicators which I implore every
Bluetooth speaker to have every
manufacturer to implement out here
there's no voice prompts either so I
don't know when it's in pairing mode and
we do have capabilities with Siri and
Google assistance which is a plus by
holding down one of these buttons here
but other than that that's really about
it in regards to overall features last
but not least before I forget here
bluetooth 4.2 is featured on this
speaker and then test this with my
iPhone 10 and Samsung S eight plus and
we're able to get 83 linear feet of this
speaker sitting in the back shelf over
there and we walked out into the hallway
and that's a signal going through about
two walls or so again 83 linear feet
what's what I got turned my testing now
moving on to the audio performance
please put on your headphones and
earphones I'm gonna be using by neural
microphones which gives you this 3d
expirience please put on your headphones
in front I implore that's the only way
you're gonna really hear this I'll give
you my verdict my assessment on the
audio performance afterwards here goes
and that's it for the Bluetooth signal
it did very well from our test alright
folks first up let me do the Harman
Kardon studio video for you all so me
don't know which way we're going now I
might be going down
I don't want to know it yeah come and
get it pocket stick to borrow it but
it's Anthony don't you wanna party
sitting in the crowd feeling heartbeat
that you wanna party you wanna party
all right folks hopefully you guys
enjoyed that audio experience but
jumping right into this small medium
sized rooms this thing can definitely
get loud for those particular areas for
large sized rooms or open areas these
handle them perfectly fine this is
equivalent to these other two speakers
here the all get very very loud now one
of the big reasons why you have
purchased this over these two are
actually many of the competitors out
there that includes the Bose sound crew
involved plus the UE mega blast we got
the JBL extreme of course a Sony XP 40
here this beats these hands down in the
bass department this thing thumps harder
hits deeper and resonates deeper and
because so I'm more immersed into my
music and this head-nodding a little bit
more it is just gorgeous I guess you can
see if I can describe audio that way in
regards to the bass response this is a
bass focus bass heavy speaker now with
that being said being heavily bass focus
is not necessarily a bad thing if you do
value that that's great
I've noticed that the bass is very clean
from my personal experience here it's
not muddy it doesn't model into the
mid-range as well but one thing about
that mid-range I need to clarify here
compared to the competitors especially
these two here these are much more
forward or bright in regards to vocal
performance and most of the instruments
these are much more in the forefront I
guess you can say when you're listening
with this one it's not necessary recess
again it's not muddy because of the bass
it's just more of a neutral plight
platform frequency or area if not
forward is not bright and you won't hear
the vocals kind of stand out too much as
with these but with that being said that
is not not a bad speaker it actually is
still a phenomenal speaker but the
reason why I'm saying that is if you do
value more detail clarity in the
mid-range you do prefer hearing audio
vocal work these other alternatives that
is a little bit less Basie but also more
bass or mid-range focus these are the
way to go the annex again not bad I want
to emphasize that but just keep in mind
it's a little bit more neutral than
anything high notes never ear ringing
never ear singing I wish there was a
a little bit more detail it went up a
little bit higher a little bit more
resolution a very high in folate cymbal
crashes snares and such rock music it
does good but again you do lose that
crispness on the very top here that's
what you're missing on this one not bad
but again it's because I thought these
are bass heavy speakers this just goes a
little bit deeper and more than any
other speaker that I've tested on this
channel any large speaker category that
is so overall audio wise perfectly fine
regarding video I did tests on the
iPhone 10 we did not have the audio sync
unfortunately when you're listening to
this on the iPhone Netflix and YouTube
the voices the the people's mouths are
moving different from the the audio
output now test this on my pixel and
also on my s 9 s 8 plus that is not the
s 9 here didn't have too much of an
issue it was much better much more in
sync but there is a micro fraction delay
here when I'm watching either Netflix or
YouTube so just keep that in mind video
yeah I'll probably pass up on it you
might have some luck with Android if
you're basically okay with it with it my
new little fraction off basically
so other that that's about it for this
