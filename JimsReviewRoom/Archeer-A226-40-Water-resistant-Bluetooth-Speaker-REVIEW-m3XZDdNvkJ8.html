room most of us know of the Yui roll or
the JBL flip 3 bluetooth speakers both
offering water resistance but that Yui
rolled specifically that offers a very
rugged build well anyways fans have been
asking me to review some very
budget-friendly items here and today I
got the arch here a 2 - 6 from Amazon
for just $40 I'll place a link in the
video description below that way you
guys can check for updated prices so
without further ado my channel is here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review room
going over the physical features first
this looks to be a pretty rugged device
physically testing this the rub around
this is quite smooth and didn't exhibit
that real grippy or soft rubber that I
was expecting nonetheless the entire
frame does feel solid though now the
only one area of concern is on the front
grille here right in the center it does
flex a bit now if it had been as stiff
as either side this would have felt a
bit more well-put-together now going
over the buttons up top the Emmons to
mute during phone calls it doesn't do
anything during music pause and play is
next with volume down and up to follow
and to the right is a flashlight option
now pressing this does turn on the LED
which is bright enough for casual
situations of finding items within close
range the odd part though the power
button to toggle the light is very funky
when I turn this on it won't turn off
with the next press no pressing harder
at times causes the light to turn on and
then immediately off and let's just say
it's just not consistent whatsoever as
you guys can see in the video they're
rotating to the rear there's a 13 1/2
millimeter auxiliary port for physically
connecting this to your phone and
whatnot
a microUSB port for charging and last to
the right is the annan off switch which
you would have to manually slide over to
of course turn it on or off the last on
the right of the speaker is a smaller to
use the supplied carabiner now regarding
water resistance per our tears website
they claimed this to be ipx4 in IPX 6
water and dust resistant respectively
now from spraying water on this it
appears to handle a splash just fine
unfortunately you can't submerge this on
water but again the JBL flip 3
specifically you can't submerge that
underwater
now regarding battery life Archer claims
up to 12 hours of use from my test I do
on/off my Bluetooth speakers from a full
battery to dead with 50% V implying the
entire time I was able to achieve 10
hours and 58 minutes to be precise bad
for a small bluetooth speaker
nonetheless a speaker at this price that
lasts regarding Bluetooth range I tested
this with my latest Samsung s7 and I was
able to walk from one side of the house
to the other and go down to the first
floor and a Bluetooth signal remained
intact the archer speaker essentially
worked over 40 linear feet for me so
this brings us to the sound test here
I'll play several samples and then I'll
give you my verdict afterwards
Green
come from though I was free good
screaming out things we wish
and there you have it folks now first up
regarding loudness this was able to fill
a small room but not suitable so much
for medium sized rooms the speaker
simply doesn't get loud enough like the
JBL flip 3 and I would say it's on par
with the ue roll either or both of these
speakers are priced at $100 this one
again is priced at just 40 now regarding
bass when using this at maximum vibe to
have a small room filled there is
distortion notice somewhat of a babbling
or a balloon slowly releasing air kind
of effect especially if you are close to
the speaker you'll notice this however
when you are standing further away or at
more moderate lower volumes the
distortion is mostly gone in the basis
then good for listening purposes now
regard the mid-range this did well with
offering vocals and singers voices with
enough clarity to be enjoyed for its
price range is not as bright sounding as
the JBL flip three but the mid-range is
apparent and provides enough detail for
general listening and less regarding the
higher frequencies it's not bad you
usually hear tinging with smaller or
cheaper speakers but this did pretty
well for its price range now regarding
soundstage these are very narrow with
sound just pouring out the front ear
there's not much depth or any kind of
sound separation one last thing I wanted
to mention when you do have this at
maximum volume and the speaker is on a
smooth surface the speaker does gently
vibrate here and over time it does move
now I could fall off the table or over
time the direction of sound would change
so with everything under consideration
for the price of feel the speaker does
warrant this price and it didn't perform
or sound like a more expensive speaker
I would say if you're looking at this
price range you of course get what you
pay for and the speaker is no exception
now this does have decent - good audio
only if you're using this for casual
listening not
getting the best sounding speaker out
there or need to have sound on a budget
