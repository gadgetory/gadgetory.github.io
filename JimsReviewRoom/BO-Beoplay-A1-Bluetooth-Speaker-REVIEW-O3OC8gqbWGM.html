room you guys asked for it and you guys
got it thanks to those who asked me for
this review here I wasn't aware of this
little Bluetooth speaker coming out but
I'm glad I finally got my hands on this
so I personally paid for this a whopping
retail price of two hundred and forty
nine dollars making this one the most
expensive small bluetooth speakers on
the market but like anything else prices
do fluctuate and I'll place my links in
the video description below click on
that and it will give you the most
up-to-date prices so without further ado
my channels here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review know of the physical
features B&amp;amp;O or Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen does make
some very nice stuff if you're
unfamiliar with their brand they usually
make some very clean designs and give a
very premium feel to their products now
it's no different with the a1 as the
entire upper casing is made of aluminum
and it's made to withstand being used
outdoors
now one things that you can't see and
more Bluetooth speakers are coming with
this feature this is dust sand and
splash resistant now I've tested a bunch
of Bluetooth speakers over time and
during my water test which I do admit is
a bit more on the extreme side every
speaker has performed perfectly fine
with the audio being uncompromised
however with the a1 once this thing gets
pretty soaked the audio sounds very
muffled and distorted
but the a1 is perfectly fine though let
this continue playing for about 15
minutes or so and let the water dry out
or move on here and the speaker has
worked perfectly fine thereafter so just
a heads up on that it's not broken for
my test here but oddly comparing to
other speakers the audio does become
affected when wet so now you guys know
now the bottom is a hard silicone a
polymer that is to keep this speaker in
one place and a leather strap is a nice
touch too that will age over time give
this a bit of character now regarding
its size the diameter is nearly
identical to the Yui roll about 13
centimeters or about five and a quarter
inches across making this one be more
portable speakers on the market now it's
about the size of my hand here and it
weighs in about 1.3 pounds which doesn't
sound like a lot but when you do pick it
up for the first time it's not
necessarily heavy but it feels really
solid now going over the physical layout
on the right you have an LED indicator
to determine if this is on or off the
power button is next far right is your
volume up and down and then rotating to
the bottom here you have a
three-and-a-half millimeter port to
physically connect this to your device
which you know oddly didn't include the
wire for but right next to that is the
latest and greatest USB type-c this is
basically the future of USB ports here
for those who don't know and B&amp;amp;O does
provide a nice long wire for this but
for my experience you gotta buy another
wire this in case you ever go to the
beach or if you're traveling somewhere
you might forget this wire at home buy a
second one they're usually pretty cheap
since we're on the topic of charging the
unit takes about three hours to recharge
from a dead battery and the a1 is
claimed to last up to 24 hours of
moderate use which sounds phenomenal now
like every one of my speaker reviews I
leave the speaker on at about 50% volume
to get a milder Road result and I
performed four different tests here
essentially fully charging the speaker
and then playing it until it died and
I'm only getting about eight hours and
53 minutes on average I'm not sure
what's going on here but over those four
different tests it's been consistent and
nowhere close to 24 hours at a casual
listening level now if I didn't show up
this speaker layout on the far left you
have this very convenient button where
it will pair with your last known device
and play from the last source the middle
button is to pair your device which I
had no problems with any devices here
and it bluetooth arranged works from one
side of house to the other what's
phenomenal now the last icon is for
answering phone calls and from my test
here the speakerphone is one of the best
though standing a few feet away was very
loud and clear enough while standing
about eight feet away and just even
naturally speaking the a1 microphone
didn't make me sound echoey and it
didn't make me sound like I was really
far away now it still sounds like a
speakerphone
but compared to many other Bluetooth
speakers out there it's
very good performance so now to the
moment that you've been waiting for here
I'll play several samples for you guys
and then I'll give you my verdict
afterwards
hahahaha
Oh
Oh
Oh
I want you to breathe me and maybe your
head let me wrong your body go in
efficient fear
I wish your love
and there you have it folks now sound
recorded on my end and then play through
your speakers are not the best depiction
of audio quality but let me start off by
saying this Wow
I would have never expected this kind of
sound from a small bluetooth speaker the
sound is very much comparable with
mid-sized speakers like the UE boom to
the JBL charge - and maybe even the 3
when it's released it's just not
released here in America just yet but
for its size the a1 is still able to
fill up a medium-sized room that's not
pushing large speaker territory like how
the JBL Xtreme can fill up an area but
for its size simply amazing
the next thing based on this thing is
pretty impressive clean distortion-free
it's deep enough and more bass than the
UE boom - and all other smaller
Bluetooth speakers without sounding
muddy or droning the same with the
Mint's offering clarity detail
not so much in regards to sound
separation or depth like these the bose
sound like many too but the bass and the
clarity combined just makes this one
immersive speaker to listen to the highs
are not taking an ear ringing but on
very loud uses cymbal crashes or a lot
of the beats that has beat that s sound
gets slightly jumbled and you do lose a
slight clarity on the top end but
overall I think you guys can already
tell very very impressive speaker all
around now one thing that I do want to
mention though and notice this and they
created for - a while back here since
the creative or - is tap firing the
sound on the creative world wasn't as
direct and lack some authority because
of that now although the a1 faces up at
the ceiling the audio sound basically
spread out through the room rather than
directional that's a great positive to
have the only other issue or the only
issue that I've noticed though and maybe
of concern over time I notice the
speaker does get hot when near maximum
volume and oddly it still gets warm at
medium volume again all in a matter of
maybe thirty minutes of use or so and in
regarding better life from my personal
experience it was a bit disappointing if
you have the speaker yourself let me
know down below in the comment section
if you're getting much less than a
twenty four hours overtime and the fact
that the speaker does get slightly
distorted here when soaked and other
Bluetooth speakers all of them that I've
tested on the market so far doesn't
suffer that it's kind of a bummer but
other than that I will admit the price
is very high but the audio quality again
beats the
Yui boom to the JBL charge three hasn't
been released yet again here in America
but we'll have a review on that soon and
this for sure beats every again every
small bluetooth speaker that I've tested
so far now if you're looking for
portability something to expand the
outdoors and audio quality is your
utmost priority get the a one I
personally highly recommend it so that's
