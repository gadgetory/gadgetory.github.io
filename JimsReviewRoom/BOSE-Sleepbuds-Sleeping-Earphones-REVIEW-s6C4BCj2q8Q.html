Jimmy with Jim's review room and yes
that is someone I sleep next to that I
will keep her nameless for this video
but because of that snoring I do wear
earplugs to sleep they're not
comfortable sometimes they fall out and
the fact that foam earplugs goes into my
ears that basically probes both sides of
my head it's not the best feeling in the
world
but when post released these the sleep
buds I was praying that these were the
answer so screw the price here I just
want some decent sleep so a full
disclosure I did personally pay for
these to test retailing at $249 at the
time of this video but I'll place my
affiliate links down in that video
description below
click on that for the most updated
prices I'm Jimmy with Jim's review and
I'm here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone tune in the
video
so I've been copyright claims so many
times in the past is not even funny I'm
not even sure how my YouTube channels
still up and running today but if you're
curious on where I now get copyright
free music all that music here in the
background in my audio test
it's from epidemic sounds I've been
using them since last year never been
sponsored by them but in today's video
this will be a very first partnership
together so I'm very excited about that
it's a product I've been using they
offer a huge catalog of audio tons of
filters to find the right music for your
projects so since I've partnered with
them in this video they're giving 30
days free on top of their currently
existing free 30 day trial that's a
total of 60 days for you to use their
service again for free my link is in the
video description be sure to use that
link and enter in Jim's review for those
savings again the link down in that
video description thanks everyone for
supporting my channel and my work Road
to 1 million so jumping into the
physical aspects of the sleeve but these
things are ridiculously tiny take off
they stay here plus ear tips and you'll
see this very tiny piece size almost
kind of like an aspirin sized little
device it's pretty cool now the biggest
concern are they comfortable and do they
stay in the quick answer is yes unlike
ear plugs or those who currently sleep
with in-ear earphones can find relief
here the ear tips do not Jam into your
ear canal but sit more so around the
opening for me and because the flange is
simply so big it's able to conform to
whatever oddly shaped ear that you have
it's not a problem now I sleep on my
side at first then on my back then in
the middle of night I usually switch and
rotate around and such but these have
never fallen out know when laying on my
side though for the most part of the
sleep buds never bothered me most of the
time the ear buds do you sit very flush
against my ear here it's not an issue
but rarely once in a while I would lay
on my side here and at a very specific
angle that presses against the ear tips
that's when the discomfort starts again
it's very rare it has to be a very
precise movement or angle but again it
is there as want to be transparent about
that now next let me show you the case
and then
into answering all of your audio
questions the air tips themselves are
good for up to 16 hours and from my
testing and monitoring I try to sleep
about eight hours at night I usually
have about 38 to 42 percent battery life
remaining equal to about five or six
hours left so this does surely need to
be recharged on a daily basis
now the carrying case provides one full
recharge but keep this in mind though
the ear tips from a dead battery to full
takes up to eight hours to recharge make
sure you don't forget to put these sleep
buds back into the case before leaving
for work and second the case itself
takes about three hours to recharge via
a USB 2.0 connection on the back I'll
have a chart on the screen for you guys
now although this seems to be a very
long time to recharge the buds it's
because both decide to use ultra low
radiation emitting bluetooth it's the
lowest transmitting power among all of
bluetooth also the battery type they've
used is called silver zinc manat
lithium-ion all for the sake of safety
and its size now last but not least and
possibly the biggest section the audio
aspect now hear my answers through some
of the biggest questions that you guys
had so first up here know these sleep
buds do not allow you to play upload or
stream your own music or podcasts etc
Bose truly made these in an attempt to
improve your sleep so in turn the cure
ready to listen up audio files for you
to use nothing else but more on that
very soon these are also not active
noise-cancelling since active
noise-cancelling is used more soda cans
out low-frequency sound so if someone is
snoring next to you ENC wouldn't fix
that anyways that's where noise masking
comes in and perpose noise masking could
have the potential to make snoring
inaudible no another answer you can use
a one ear but if you'd like you don't
have to use both in your ears at the
same time you can use little left
channel or the right channel and leave
the other one on in the table or on or
in the case that it's holy cow
now last does this play all night you
can have it do so but you can set up
different time intervals and have them
stop playing eventually again that's off
within the app so with my testing just
passive noise isolation does help to an
extent with blacking out some noises
once you turn on the masking sounds just
like in-ear earphones
that's when you black out most of the
audio possible now showing you guys the
app I personally use the shower profile
I use it the most but you can pick any
kind of sound that you want from the
ocean to the hum of an airplane or the
airiness of the wilderness here now let
me play some quick samples so you know
what I'm talking about here and that way
you can get a sample of what these can
offer
so a lot of these files for noise
management produces this light white
noise at frequencies that neutralizes
common distractions and as you've heard
from the introduction of the video the
snoring is intense here but from my
personal testing the sleep buds actually
work I don't have to put it up so loud
either usually around maybe 30 or 40
percent or so on the app and it truly
does blackout the snoring and the
rumbling I don't even hear my fiance
getting up in the morning and a crazy
thing these files simply don't sound
like it's just blasting stereo audio
either there's an experience with this
no hear me up there's a really big
soundstage now for example that shower
filed that sounds like rain hitting
trees and leaves you can hear it
distinctly water droplets sounding off
on the right ear but at a different time
and a different distance than the left
one or the airplane file here it feels
like a heavy hit very much hollow
presence and be hung the airplane is
actually around me I'm in the center
that is so it's it's like I'm
encapsulated a full 360 full of audio
now once in a while when I wake up in
the middle of the night or when I first
wake up in the morning I sense as though
it's really raining outside when I use
that shower profile it feels as though
I'm in the environment that Bose is
offering it's quite surreal but it
almost takes you out in a way from where
you are and I'm not even exaggerating
it's quite impressive now everyone's
going to have their favorite audio file
but if you go to the sound library go
all the way down and there are all your
noise masking files now with my review I
do wish there was more thankfully I did
find one that really works for me but
having several files that would hit that
sweet spot would have been a bit more
reassuring for everyone out there a
swiping back up is all the relaxation
files now these files don't play too
much of that white noise but very
tranquil zen-like audio may be perfect
for meditation there's a quick sample
so the only issues that are really had
with these since bose is using that
ultra-low bluetooth technology the audio
file transfers takes ridiculously a long
amount of time sometimes an hour
sometimes three hours you usually have
to download it while you're sleeping so
the next day you have the ability to use
it but one of the reasons why I am
excited about the sleep buds versus my
earplugs which I've been using I can
control the volume and make sure if
there's an emergency I can actually hear
it yeah at the same time now I no longer
fear I'm going to miss out on my alarm
from my phone the reason being is
because there's also a built-in alarm
right in the app and it basically goes
off in the earbuds themselves so if the
phone dies in the milk that night the
alarm will still sound off in your ears
in the morning you don't have to bother
your significant other with a blaring
alarm and you're probably not going to
miss a day of work either unless you
really want to or so but folks I know
the sleep buds are expensive but in the
end here I think they fixed a problem
that they were trying to solve for those
who want to listen to their own music at
night sorry folks you gotta look
elsewhere if sleep is your utmost
priority comfort as well these are the
answer I would suggest that you guys
give them a try so folks I'll let you go
here be sure to subscribe and turn down
those notifications fire emoji that
comment section up and again special
thanks to epidemic sounds for sponsoring
this video as you can imagine the
products the cameras that we have here
to adjust the time and energy it all
adds up thanks for the support everyone
we're going to hit a million subs
eventually I'll catch you guys in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
