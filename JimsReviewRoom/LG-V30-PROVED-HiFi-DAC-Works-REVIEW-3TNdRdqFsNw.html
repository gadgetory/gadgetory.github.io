good head to head is not Samsung or
Apple but it's Samsung and LG I don't
hear too many average consumers talking
about this phone but every time I test
LG I feel as though they're very much
underrated folks what I have here today
is the LG v30 from the awesome folks at
AT&amp;amp;T check out AT&amp;amp;T comm for their
latest phone prices and accessories and
also a big THANK YOU to them for
supplying this loader the retail prices
are on your screen direct from the
manufacturers websites as always I'll
place my affiliate links also in the
video description below click on those
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time so folks sit
back and relax
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over the physical features the
measurements are on your screen with the
weight included please pause the video
if you need to now the biggest
difference the V 30 is the lightest and
the thinnest flagship phone out there
while retaining a full 6-inch display
not only that but the V 30 also has the
second thinnest amount of bezels of all
the mainstream and most popular phones
out there 81.2% for those who are
technical and when I'm gripping the V 30
it's a premium feeling of pure glass and
metal in the palm of my hands it's not
too slippery if anything it's identical
to the samsung s A+ now as I mentioned
earlier the weight is where you feel the
biggest difference between the V 30 and
most other flexes out there it's
surprisingly light now key features to
point out physically the V 30 still
retains the 3.5 millimeter audio input
but more on that a little bit later buns
are clicky and tactile despite how small
they are these days and last on the
bottom is the speakerphone which
performed as good as this Samsung with
no respite us or Distortion at maximum
volume now the iPhone has at least one
front facing speaker which sounded more
direct the best speakers so far this
year and I've personally tested has been
the pixel to excel with dual
front-facing speakers no testing the
razor from just yet but next to that
speaker is the USB type-c port for
charging and transferring now with my
testing I'm getting on average five and
a half hours of screen on time and
average better use of a little over a
day the LG comes with quick charging 3.0
and with my test 15 minutes gave me 21
percent and 30 minutes of charging gave
me 39 percent back touching based on
audio this is one of the biggest reasons
why anyone would go for the v30
it's the onboard digital to analog
converter most abbreviated as back now
the benefit of having a good deck or a
third-party deck is that they tend to
enhance your audio experience they may
squeeze a bit more soundstage out of
your headphones or earphones maybe more
bass frequencies that you haven't heard
before compared to the v20
new-and-improved is the availability to
tune the audio to your liking and the
fact that LG is the first ever
smartphone on the plan here to offer
master quality audio file formats now if
you have been following me for quite
some time I am huge on audio on the
channel here and with the V 30 I tested
this with my sennheiser 598 SEO and
backs and those come with a 50 ohm
impedance my rh 80 20s which are
currently my best
in-ear wired earphones
at the moment and a thorough in my
Sennheiser PXE 550's and Sony WH of
1000x is I want to dispel some of the
rumors or at least clarify how well the
V 30 deck works and if it works at all
first up and I want you to pay attention
without high impedance headphones or
earphones the high deck barely has an
effect my $250 RH 80 twenties has 16
ohms of impedance and my $300 JBL ever
silly 750 NCS with also 16 ohms didn't
sound any different when toggling high
back on or off so most average consumers
your headphones might not work so be
sure to check that out with that being
said with high deck off although you're
not getting the full effect headphones
or earphones were always louder than my
samsung s A+ iPhone and pixel to excel
now when I plugged in my remaining
headsets like the PXE 550's which has 46
ohms and the 5 mandates with 50 ohms
toggling the high deck in the menu wow
that's when I can tell a difference the
audio is much more airier spacious
louder more frequencies nuances detail
fidelity you name it it all can be heard
the audio seems to be more in the
forefront rather than beside now as
always be sure to LIKE and subscribe if
you haven't already to help support my
work here to support these tests I want
to give you a real demo of how this
works and how it sounds be sure to put
on your own headphones or earphones for
my 3d audio experience
please
man was that crazy or what now one last
thing to avoid any kind of rumors and to
clarify basically you don't need the
best of the best flat files for this to
work that's what I thought too in the
beginning and reading forums people were
saying the same thing
yes uncompressed files will be the best
and you'll hear the most from those but
testing this on YouTube and Netflix for
both movies and music the high decks
still perform perfectly fun enhancing my
audio experience I know this was
long-winded but I hope they helped you
in some way now getting back to the
phone and before I forget to mention
here the phone is IP 68 certified
meaning it can be submerged underwater
for up to 30 minutes and up to 1 meter
looking at the rear wireless charging is
offered which is slowly getting more
attention with the average consumer and
then moving up the fingerprint scanner
is also used as the home button the
fingerprint reader works perfectly fine
zippy and fast with no issues from my
experience and the button itself it does
feel a little squishy and not as clicky
or premium like he picks with a phone
that I had just uploaded the other day
moving up and after talking about the
hi-fi quad back there this is the second
reason why the V 30 might be the phone
for you dual cameras on the back that my
Samsung si+ doesn't offer northernly
pixel to excel only on these samsung
note 8 or the iPhone 8 plus had this
extra lens but both phones are more
expensive both photographers and
videographers will benefit from the
following manual mode gives you features
like a DSLR camera and all of Samsung
and other select phones offer their own
pro mode or manual mode LG hasn't done
it the best now they have the most
intuitive menu and information right at
the forefront just look at how I'm sooo
mning in and out here with the V 30 and
it switches between the wide-angle lens
and the normal one
alright let's pull up some samples for
viewing here the V 30 performs very
similar to the Samsung S A+ there are
some minor differences and I'll let you
be the judge in the comment section
below
but the V 30 comes with a 16 megapixel
camera while Samsung iPhone and the
pixel comes with 12 instead in the
defense of the latter three since the
pixels are less Kranz and
the intern should offer better low-light
performance test levy 30 in low-light
the V 30 still did amazing if not better
than somebody competition now getting
back to your regular lighting the V 30
captures a good bit of detail but
comparing to my samsung n pixel the LG
tends to not be a sharper though there's
more megapixels to work with but where
it is lacking detail and sharpness LG
does shine but offering one of the
brightest and most vibrant photos out
there darker backgrounds tends to be
lighting up making photos easily
identifiable the LG tends to shoot quite
colorful as well or some would consider
saturated now this is clearly a matter
of preference but comparing to the
iPhone and if you haven't seen the pixel
review the LG and Samsung are not as
accurate but they make for some
attention-grabbing photos they're good
looking photos right out the box
basically comparing these Samsung and LG
phones they are always neck-and-neck
sometimes the LG gives better results
sometimes the other either or no camera
has been perfect but these two have been
my favorite this time around
now last let me show you the difference
between menu mode quite a dull photo
here and simply bumping up color temp
and lowering the shutter speed a bit
this image looks much much better and
all these photos you've seen so far have
been completely unedited now look at the
display and performance I'll show some
specs on the screen for you please feel
free to pause the video if you need to
but because of how small the bezels are
the screen looks to have its own
infinity display now I did notice the LG
does show a slightly cooler tone over on
White's which I do like for web surfing
and reading and for images and scream
the v30 performed the complete opposite
of how it takes photos and it's possibly
due to the new OLED display LG's using
colors are vibrant indeed but at times a
little too vibrant
especially red objects like cars and
such it's quite jarring and even the
average person might be able to take
notice it wasn't a deal breaker for me
but something I surely would think
others wouldn't notice
then oddly as vibrant as screen is for
movies the s8 plus had the most detail
due to the screen illuminating the
entire video letting me see more dark
backgrounds and textures for those dark
movies now the iPhone 8 plus came in
second and third Dockers unfortunately
was the LG v 30 now although the Samsung
S A+ was brighter skin tones tended to
be more orange and red and not true to
the original footage but and was within
and simply having a brighter screen was
much more engaging and enjoyable so to
wrap things up here I personally didn't
encounter any issues with UV 30 its
zippier that my Samsung but not as fluid
as the stock Android found in the pixel
and the side notes from the factory the
V 30 at the time of this video comes
with Android 7 and not injured 8 I don't
think that's a deal-breaker either but
something to be aware about overall once
you factor in the price the fact LG
offers a 2 year warranty on TV 30 the
extra features that you get that is
equivalent to the more popular Samsung
despite its shortcomings I still think
the V 30 has tons of value folks in the
comment section below let me know what
you think of the LG v 30 worth it or not
I'm personally falling in love with this
I love the audio aspect of course I'm
Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision you guys take care and I'll see
you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
