review room now I've been waiting a long
time for this band as I didn't get a
chance to try the Eric basis
carbon steel from last year so this year
I sure had to give the new model for
really data-driven individuals like
myself basis seems like the go-to band
for understanding ourselves and our
habits now with their newest model this
year the basis peak is priced at 199
dollars and I'll show you what features
this has how it performs and hopefully
help you decide if it's worth buying so
without further ado welcome to Jim's
reviewer
going over to physical features first
the ban is made of this very soft
silicone with many notches to fit all
sized rests although the look is
subjective on the underside of the black
version is a very nice red to give some
contrast and although I admit it's not
as easy to see when worn once in a while
having a glimpse of it does seem very
pleasing now this appears to be a pretty
large watch but after my time of wearing
this 24/7 it really became natural and
didn't seem large at all now wearing
this with short sleeves still seems
fashionable enough but wearing this with
long sleeve dress shirts it just snagged
a better right at the cuffs I also
weight lifted with a new basis and
flexing the wrist forward and backwards
to me was not an issue something that
anyone should look into when buying a
large activity band in general now going
over some of its physical features first
and the back side are all of your
biometric readers there's a perspiration
and skin temperature reader and last
which blinks brightly in green here is a
heart rate monitor and I'll go over how
well these features work when discussing
the screen in the app by going to the
front here the basis pic offers Gorilla
Glass 3 the same glass found on most
smartphones these days just to help
prevent scratches and dings which during
mine usage does hold up pretty well
the only gripe is that glass is recessed
instead of raised causing dust and other
nastiness to accumulate inside the edges
of course this can be easily wiped off
but if you're considering this as a
fashionable accessory you may take that
into consideration the screen itself is
very responsive with a gentle swipe
scrolling through the bands information
now the first screen here is always on
it's the time that's being displayed in
huge numbers or numerix here and with a
single tap reveals briefly your month
day and battery remaining now scrolling
left offers your watch menu features
with manually syncing your device and
other miscellaneous actions which are
all self-explanatory and then scrolling
to the right instead reveals your
heartbeats per minutes regardless if
you're doing an activity or not but one
caveat as many mention in last year's
model does somewhat ring true here for
the heart rate monitor to continuously
function and keep a connection the band
does have to be worn pretty snugged and
for some people they do consider this
tight and uncomfortable for me it's not
too bad for casual workouts but running
through the park gets
oddly enough the heartbeat sensor would
lose contact from time to time
indicating that the band was searching
for my pulse now I tried to wear this
very tight now man this would still lose
that tracking ability for a minute or so
and then find my pulse later during the
jog now I still believe chest heart rate
monitors are far more accurate and also
provides data in real-time but it
depends on the individual and if they
like to wear something snugged around
their chest instead when working out
nonetheless the peak still provided data
in real time but it wasn't a hundred
percent consistent in its connection and
moving out here from this screen you can
push up to see your total steps and
calories burned so far for that day or
you can scroll right instead from the HR
monitor and this will review the most
recent active session you just performed
now this includes walking running
swimming and outdoor cycling now it
indicates how long ago this was done the
total steps duration and also the
calories burned and overall the band the
screen is easy to read in all light
situations and I believe it's one of the
few bands actually that performs well in
bright sunlight
not many activity bands actually do that
now it's not an issue either in low
light settings as swiping upwards glows
a light to read the information now
pervasive with all this news the
rechargeable battery should last up to
four days which is very much only
low-end compared to other competitors
now over the course of testing this band
I averaged about three and a half days
of news before needing to recharge the
device before it dies again just a very
low battery life in general now the app
experience is as important as the
physical band itself now what you're
looking for is something easy to read
but yet provide useful information that
helps you improve your lifestyle
starting with a dashboard your three
most basic information is always
revealed resting heart rates steps taken
and calories burned so far the second
row reveals habits now these diamond
shape patterns has goals underneath each
with a color of line going around each
diamond as you make progress now what's
interesting about the app experience is
it really tries to change your daily
routine through this feature such as
quote-unquote move it
that tells me to move at least thirty
minutes for that day to habit like
sleeping and waking up at certain times
consistently and over time as you
complete more habits different habits
are unlocked and the requirements or
difficulty on each existing ones do
increase it's a system that gives you
baby steps first and you work your way
up
now the garmin vivosmart that i tested
here and jim's review room does provide
reminders when you haven't moved for
some time but basis does take it one
step further in providing specific
activities to perform now at the time on
this video basis unfortunately does not
have notifications available but per
their website
basis will eventually provide habit
notifications to be shown and your wrist
reminding you to get ready for bed or
suggest a run etc which i find highly
beneficial as a reminder to keep me on
track during my busy lifestyle now of
course you can always turn off those
notifications as you'd like though then
the next row of information provided is
recent activity where they're sleeping
or walking this displays the most recent
duration and its information along with
it it's pretty self-explanatory and
works similar to how the band displayed
this information as well now the only
grep that i have here with the dashboard
is it doesn't display your entire day's
worth of information as a whole
basically now after testing many bands
of the markets nearly everyone else
offers a very simple and overall glance
of your performance on that one screen
now all other information is obtained by
clicking the menu option here on the top
left revealing a deeper breakdown now
going down the list here habits is shown
again with a weekly timeline instead of
your performance and how many hours
you've been wearing the band for what
time I normally wake up and a button to
add new habits to achieve over time and
what basis does is prevents you from
heading any new habits until you
accomplish your existing ones now this
might be great for some as it does
provide a lot of
guidance and structure while others
might feel it's quite limiting and in
the beginning now you can be the judge
in that aspect now going back to the
menu here
next is Activity Feed now what seemed
confusing to me at first and this
applies to the entire app not just the
Activity Feed basis records and shows
segments of each recorded activity now
let's say you walk down the hall to make
some copies at the office and then
return back to your seat during that
time although it's quite short it's
counted and it's considered as a
separate activity now looking at the
vertical illustration it shows I walked
starting at this time with this many
minutes then scrolling to the next
activity you can see there's just a huge
gap and it's very much because I was
sitting stationary working at my desk or
something simple like I may be eating
dinner or so and this is identical for
sleep as well it literally just breaks
down every segment and you literally
have to piece everything together it
doesn't show your entire days at a
glance but backing out here let me show
you chart view which I felt has a little
bit more information on the screen on
the top you have your heart rate steps
calories burned your skin temperature
and perspiration levels now by tapping
on this information you can toggle
between maximum levels or your average
but pay close attention to the timeline
here it's only and always displayed in
three hour increments or intervals again
you have to scroll back and forth to
really see what your day was like again
pacing your day together and running out
the last few features on this app itself
device shows or allows you to make
adjustments to the time and day
displayed with options of manually
syncing your data and updating the
firmware and one last time here backing
out settings are to change your personal
profile in setting up your weight height
etc and last as support as a quick
button that opens up your email clients
to email basis about any issues or
questions that you may have and the one
last perk that I briefly mentioned
earlier similar to the polar loop and
jaybird rain that I've tested this can
automatically tell what kind of activity
you're performing basis cause this body
IQ walking running outdoor cycling and
swimming are all detected automatically
and pervasive the band will adjust its
calculations to ensure the proper
calories burned are measured
for each said activity now for the most
part that seems very accurate in knowing
when I do start a jogging when I do stop
up now when I do start my run the
watches screen turns white indicating
that I'm in a session with it's
pertinent information displayed and
before I forget to mention the peek can
stream heartrate information via
Bluetooth to apps like Strava RunKeeper
etc now the only items I didn't see
which can be found on competitors are
GPS functionality to show where I have
ran and my estimated distance and I was
come somewhat shocked though that basis
did not include this especially the
estimated distance so overall I can
really see a lot of benefits behind this
band like the habits as it's the most
robust that I've seen on any band that
I've tested so far as indicated by basis
a new firmer update will provide
smartphone notifications that will show
text email phone calls and app
notifications
not to mention habit reminders and your
watch in the near future now the gray
areas for me is of course wearing the
band very tight and I still can't
achieve that same accuracy and heart
rate monitoring as a chest strap and
speaking of those biometric measurements
basis and its apps does nothing to
provide information if my heart beat is
at a good level or not while running
does my perspiration level matter or
even explain why my skin temperature is
even important or even displayed and
recorded now I'm paying for these
features but for the average consumer
these features are not explained with
the product but items like the lack of
GPS and estimated distance the lack of
real comparable history for your days
weeks months and years are very critical
to me there's no vibrating alarm
presently available although the watch
it does vibrate
there's no social or friend aspect so
you can't compete with personal or
online friends and the battery life is
dismal now one compared to a lot of
other bands that I've tested and
reviewed over the past year the peak
does very well in certain areas and
offerings but not offering some very key
yet very basic information is somewhat
of a downfall for a 200-dollar very high
tech band now let me know your thoughts
in the comments below let me know what
kind of band you're thinking of getting
yourself or what kind of band that you
want to see me review so hope this
review helped you in some way if you do
like my work add me on either Facebook
too
or Google+ that way you can see what I
have a reviewing down the road and also
some personal uploads I put up from time
to time now be sure to LIKE and

bit helps
