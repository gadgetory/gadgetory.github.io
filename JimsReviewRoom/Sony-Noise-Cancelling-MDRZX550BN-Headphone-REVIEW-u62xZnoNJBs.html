room so I just reviewed the brand new
Bose quiet comfort 25 for sure the
leader in noise cancelling headphones so
I tried looking for a much more
budget-friendly model and run across the
sony MDR ZX 550 BMS i don't that's a
mouthful there but it's priced just at
128 dollars most cheaper than the QC 25
so what I want to do is see how good
these sound and for sure how well they
do block out unwanted noise and see if a
cheaper alternatives still provides some
good results so without further ado
welcome to another review
so these ZX 550's for short they do come
in both black and also blue and right on
the package you'll notice these are
ridiculously light weighing in at just
five point nine ounces or 167 grams it's
possibly the lightest pair of cans that
I've reviewed so far but with that being
said when working with these headphones
they do feel a bit cheap though they
rattle and shake when moving around and
the materials are really a basic type of
plastic but overall while testing
despite looking a bit basic they still
have been very durable to use when those
signs of issues extending and retracting
the headband has been very stiff and
there weren't any issues of the headband
accidently adjusting the flexing the
headband was flawless and all points
that rotate went smoothly and keep in
mind easy acts 550's do not have
foldable ear cups but they do a rotating
lay flat like so now regarding my
comfort test the air paths that are on
the headphones are the only one that
comes in the box there are leather like
material which is cool to the touch and
although not as plush as some of the
other premium headbands I've tested they
still were comfortable initially now
wearing these indoors for about thirty
minutes straight I didn't notice my ears
just slightly warm up a bit and with our
number two was warm in general
eventually it was not an issue but it
was a notice experience of warm ears
from the ear cups the headband doesn't
have any padding but considering how
light these are they didn't pose an
issue as well when I wore them for up to
four hours straight now usually with
cheaper or poorly designed headphones
they cause that crown of the head to
hurt a bit
causing wearing fatigue but again this
wasn't
issue more than likely due to how light
these are now the other test that I do
in all my reviews its clamping near the
jawline now this did feel a bit firmer
possibly due to less plush padding that
I'm used to but again this did not hurt
my jawline after several hours of news
overall not 100% the best feeling pair
of headphones but considering his price
they're not bad at all and last
regarding sound leaking since I have
these headphones on playing these at
maximum volume sound leakage was really
kept to a minimum
now quickly going over its controls and
the left has your noise-cancelling
on/off switch with the left ear cup
offering NFC connections to basically
pair your headphones easily with your
NFC enabled device now on the right side
towards the front features your phone
call answering button with the volume
button to follow on the other side and
power and pairing button is next and
less are the pause play and skip buttons
that I found worked on at least YouTube
playlist Pandora and Netflix now the USB
charging port is found on the very
bottom and is charged with the supplied
microUSB cable and overall sony is
claiming a very impressive up to 25
hours of battery life with noise
cancelling on and from a dead battery it
takes a price point four and a half
hours to fully charge and regarding any
other items or accessories there isn't
any this package really comes with the
bare-bones no tearing case no additional
ear pads just the headphone themselves
and a micro USB charging cable now to
the moment that you've been waiting for
the sound quality considering these are
smaller drivers coming in at 30
millimeters while bigger headphones
features 40 millimeters the sound isn't
crazy loud now playing this at maximum
volume was still very comfortable
listening without a hint of me
tolerating the music there's no
Distortion any very balanced note
overall you can say I spent a good time
listening to pop in EDM which I felt
like Sony did well in with just clean
and clear audio throughout now trying
this on more bass heavy genres of rap
and hip-hop these are really just good
for just casual listening the bass is
conservative that genres bass focused
really don't stand out now these pair of
cans will not have your head bobbing or
nodding at your tunes for music I can
see these are just for casual listening
but if you're more tuned to different
sound qualities and more weird what
sounds good and what doesn't
you may find these a bit lacking now
also try this on movies and no question
I had to turn this all the way up and
still I wasn't as immersed as I wanted
to be depth of sound and spatial sound
provided a lacking soundstage there's
not much sense of sound in the distance
with sound occurring closer to your ears
and as for the noise canceling feature I
tried this several times and over the
span of two weeks of testing in
different environments I was greatly
disappointed most of the time I thought
the noise canceling feature wasn't even
on as I couldn't hear a difference the
only time I could hear noise
canceling was actually when I had the
volume all the way down basically muted
then switching to noise canceling on and
I can hear the headphones toggle back
and forth and black out some noise but
while actively listening and playing in
real world testing ambient noises in a
coffee shop of people talking moving
chairs the workers working it's still
audible as if nose canceling wasn't even
on so overall these headphones are just
for playing casual listening just to
have some sound without bad quality but
this pair of headphones are very
conservative all around from loudness to
base to the noise canceling feature now
if you're planning on buying noise
canceling headphones as you're possibly
considering from watching this video I
think there will be better performers
out there so hope this video helped you
