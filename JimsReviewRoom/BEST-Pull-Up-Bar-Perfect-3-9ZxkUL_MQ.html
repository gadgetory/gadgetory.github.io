review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at this pull-up bar made by
the company called perfect for $30 I
found this at the local Walmart and it's
found also online at amazon.com now I've
done the same review on its competitor
the iron jim pull-up bar which is the
same exact price now I'm not sure why
this particular bar isn't as popular as
the engine but watch this entire video
and I'll go over if and why this may be
a better alternative than the iron jim
pull-up bar so without further ado let's
get started so the exterior color is
white and black and constructed with
steel tubing plastic and foam mounts the
unit comes unassembled with a separate
bag consisting of your screws nuts and
washers they also included a two-sided
tool one end has a wrench and the other
end has the Philips head screwdriver
which means you don't need additional
tools to put this thing together
assembly was easy and took about 10 or
15 minutes for myself using its picture
diagrams
now this pull-up bar is securely held on
by the doorframe and does not require
any drilling or screwing now per the Box
this unit fits standard door frames from
27 inches wide to 35 inches wide and for
the thickness of my particular door it
is five and a half inches thick and
before I get started with the pros as a
disclaimer I'm not a fitness instructor
or claiming to be some great famous
advisor
I'm just the average Joe just looking
for good products to use so if I do have
bad posture or not so perfect form
please this review is on the product and
not me so I'll start with the pros here
now I've had the Iron Gym for over a
year now and it's never failed both
pull-up bars do work though but the
perfect pull-up bar does feel like it
has thicker steel tubing the bar doesn't
flex as much compared to the Iron Gym
when I'm on it and I love lightweight
weighing in at about 160 pounds so in my
Iron Gym video several fans mentioned it
didn't fit their door as well the
perfect bar comes in gracefully with
additional mounting positions to ensure
it fits your door though
if you're a bit taller you can also
adjust a back bar by several inches up
to give you a bit more ground clearance
again this is something the Iron Gym
cannot do I also wanted to mention these
wide foam pads help the door
tremendously it gives more weight
distribution to even the load giving
more stability and longevity to your
door trim and the pull-up bar itself as
you can see these black marks on my door
frame is actually from the Iron Gym with
these foam pads on the perfect pull-up
bar I don't foresee that happening if
anything I can always play small
washcloths there to prevent any damage
or further damage lastly what Iron Gym
could not do was truly give me wide grip
options because of these protruding foam
pads here it leaves this area for me to
grip I can work more my lats with more
range and motion the foam padding
extends all across unlike the Iron Gym
as well you can perform an assortment of
pull-ups have your hands face your body
and do standard pull-ups to work your
biceps face your hand the opposite way
and work on your forearms and lats and
sometimes I hold myself up and do leg
lifts to work them at legs abs and also
my core muscle groups as well and just
like the iron gym there's other
functions of this particular product
such as foot anchors for setups elevated
push-ups and doing dips as well so
there's a good variety of music there
and less few items I can easily dismount
this and place it in hiding or moving to
a different room in seconds so the only
con I really had was although the pads
are soft but over time I'm sure will
give way again it's just normal wear and
tear though but I'm certain you can
place washcloths there to help protect
your door or even buying thick felt pads
if you ever need to repair or replace an
area so on that in my opinion is this
better than the Iron Gym I'd say
definitely yes I'd say it's worth of I
especially because it's the same price
for either bar and I've had the Iron Gym
for over a year now and use it often and
I ran across this and said hey you know
why not if this is actually better so
I'd say give it a try if you're in the
market for a pull-up bar in general so
that's it for this review I hope you
enjoyed this review of this pull-up bar
made by
perfect for $30 and if you have nuts
