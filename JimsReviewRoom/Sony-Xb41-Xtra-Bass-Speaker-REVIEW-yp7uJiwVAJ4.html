sidenote let me know in the comments
section down below what you want to see
reviewed it doesn't have to be speaker
related I just need some help since I've
been away for so long so alright folks
this is the sony xba-40 1 this retails
for $249 but it is on sale I've
personally paid $200 click on my
affiliate links down that video
description below for the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things might go on sale out of
Jimmy with Jim's review and I'm here to
help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review this
video is sponsored by me
visit the website jim's review calm and
signup with a free account now I might
have a comparison video with this
speaker and JBL and they're quite
shortly alright folks back to the
reviews now go to the physical features
first this thing looks and feels amazing
now with complete mesh all around the
entire speaker similar to the JBL
extreme 2 or UE mega boom if it was more
rugged but retains a very clean look now
keep in mind the auto drivers are still
forward-facing and provides directional
front-facing audio to clarify there's no
speakers on the side or on its rear so
you're not getting the full 360 degree
audio experience the biggest improvement
and was lacking on the last model the XP
41 like its competitors are now ip67
certified maybe this is dust proof but
more importantly to me this can now be
fully submersible in water up to one
meter for up to 30 minutes
the bigger question for the hose and the
lake or at the deep end of the pool who
can't swim like me if it drops in does
it float from my test thank God it does
now the one other unique water resistant
feature sony claims it's also rust proof
which is a first for me bring this to
the ocean and if you get salt water on
here sony claims it's not a problem now
like in the buns on the very top
everything is on your screen for your
convenience please pause the video if
you need to they're tactile clicky no
issues from my testing two buns worth
mentioning though the first is live
sound which is on the very top this
simulates 3d audio giving you a wider
soundstage i'll get into the audio test
a bit later in this review a second but
it's quite discreet here but it's party
mode you can tap either end of the
speaker on the top and the bottom and
the X p41 creates a beat how you
activate this is on the very back just
give it to karate chops one two like so
and then again I leave you front the
size or so you tap it and you get this
beat going
this is discretion it is pretty much
relative I think a lot of people are not
fond of this I don't know if you ever
gonna go to the club or I don't you
probably gotta get pretty drunk to start
enjoying yourself and cuz being in front
of everybody
slamming your damn Bluetooth speaker
anyways that's your call that's up to
you guys moving to the back this is not
a big issue and as much as I love Sony
extra bass speakers the additional
buttons located behind this water
resistant flap is a slight nuisance
especially to check the battery level
the other buttons are not too bad
there's WPS for a wireless party chain
you can pair over a hundred these
speakers together if you want to fill up
a room or an event and if your friend
neighbor or someone that also owns a new
Sony speaker you can tap Add to pair
with other newer models the XP 4131 and
21 and from my experience they worked
perfectly fine with the older models
this was tough since Sony support and
Sony's instruction manuals quite
horrible here but I did find a solution
I was able to pair both my sony xba-40
one together I'm happy to report it
works though and I provide directions on
my website the link will be in the video
description down below now finish up the
physical features this is a first for a
large bluetooth speaker at least to me
not only is there a wall adapter that
you used to charge the speaker but it
also includes a micro USB input to
charge it that's convenient now next up
here is a three-and-a-half millimeter
input for physical connections and last
is your traditional USB port to charge
your phone or device it's basically
using the speaker like a power bank now
at a topic of batteries sony claims up
to 24 hours with the leds off which is
best-in-class bidding out the JBL
extreme tube and ue Megu I did my test
at 50% volume with the LEDs on now
letting it play until it was official
dead the results are on your screen now
the sony xba-40 one offers bluetooth 4.0
which is perfectly fine for most average
users testing this with my samsung s a+
i was able to get a range up 84 Lior
feet with two walls in between my phone
and the speaker before the audio started
to crackle last but not least let's talk
about the LEDs now I think they look
really good and it's nice to see some
lighting and the side profile it's not
as abundant of course as the JBL pulse 3
but compared to most bluetooth speakers
out there Sony and JBL appears to be the
only two companies really pushing RGB
lighting now you can always turn them
off if you want the counts are bright
enough and gives a nice glow in
transition a strobe effect appears to be
the same or identical to what it was on
the previous models but other than that
the light strip is pretty much straight
forth now the customization is done
through Sony's Fiesta Bowl app access
through the music app and it was an OK
experience simply offering different
color choices to choose from but nothing
like having the lights scroll in
directions that you want or maybe pulse
it exactly the way that you wanted to as
well in the end I stuck with the presets
offered and the quality lights was
already enough for me it already looks
good on its factory settings sorry folks
enough about the physical stuff here
let's get into the quick audio test be
sure to put on your headphones or
earphones as I'll be using by neural
microphones offering you some of the
best audio tests out there and before I
start be sure to throw down some of fire
emojis let's see you guys light up that
comment section
alright folks here we go alright folks
make sure you got your headphones or
earphones on here goes test number one
and these are with mine by newer
microphones here we go
all right first up the sony xba-40 one
is fitting for small dorm rooms to
mid-size apartment at 50% volume it was
comfortable and still loud enough to be
enjoyable pushing it up to 70% and
higher this will surely fill large areas
if your price limit is 200 to 250
dollars the XP for the one is your best
choice right now beating the competition
in regards to price to volume and
especially portability now if you're
needing something for outdoor use or a
super big room or event getting to Sony
XP 31 s for the same price and pairing
them or it be bigger but older now XP 60
for the price of 250 is the way to go if
loudness is your priority and
portability is not now jumping into bass
if you're into genres of EDM hip-hop
anything Basie the sony xba-40 one
sounds damn good most of the time for
large Bluetooth speaker categories
comparing to the likes of the JBL
extreme to UE mega boom bose soundlink
revolve plus the XP 41 is bass here it's
more thumping you can practically hear
the bass in the next room I particularly
like it and I know most average
consumers out there will enjoy this too
now my reviews do target the average
consumer so I'm not trying to be an
audio snob but the only issue that I did
notice though when you do turn this up
to fill those large rooms when vom is
super high that's when you hear the the
quality slightly diminished with vocals
becoming slightly recessed the vocals
are just not as strong now said going
into the mid-range err I do wish the
mid-range was slightly brighter for us
to interpret a bit more detail after
that vocal work could be a bit more
forward this can be improved though if
you are using an equaliser but overall
for the mid-range most people will find
a speaker perfectly fine and sounding
amazing for those more peculiar will
hear the nuances but with my testing my
assessment it's not a big deal it's not
a deal-breaker for most people again
this speaker will be exceptionally great
now high-hat cymbal crashes and such had
a good bit of roll-off preventing that
sharp tingey experience with
very high frequencies it could use a bit
more Sparkle up top but overall it
doesn't get that air piercing audio and
I personally didn't have any listening
fatigue whatsoever
now as for the sound stage like most
Bluetooth speakers it is lacking in this
department I was expecting life mode to
enhance it but man I think life mode was
a dud now some may like it and yes it
does give a more spatial audio
experience more simulated further
suffering its audio but vocals and the
mid-range in general loses so much more
detail in for Dennis it sounds it just
doesn't sound like it's good quality I
personally liked it on its regular stock
setting from the factory so do I
recommend the speaker oh yeah I do
despite the cheesy party mode which
don't help me socially he now offered
waterproofing and knowing that it floats
though the extra micro USB port to
charge for convenience and the go
anywhere the newly updated style is a
huge plus for me all around and dang if
you like bass this is the way to go but
how does it compare the JBL extreme -
and possibly others you got to sign up
on Jim's room comm I'll have it up there
shortly
