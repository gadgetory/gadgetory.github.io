Jimmy with Jim's review room beats and
Apple are slowly rolling out their new
line of earphones and headphones I
tested their power beats 3 then their
syllable 3 and very recently the beats
act
I personally pay for these at the retail
price of one hundred and fifty dollars
and if you do compare these to the
competition or other popular on the neck
earphones I doing it these are on the
upper end of the price range I'll go
over the features and tell you about
this sound quality and determine if
these are worth I buy or not as always
I'll leave my links in the description
below these things do go on sale is just
a matter of when but if you click on my
link they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time so without further
adieu and always my channel is here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
governor of the physical features
because of their flex form cable and
it's extremely bendable highly durable
and despite all that flexing that I'm
doing here
these will retain its shape beyond the
neck portion the wings are tangle free
lay flat cables one side simply has your
power on and off and pairing button
which I do admit though doesn't provide
much tactile feedback to confirm if I
pressed it or not the other side has
your lightning port to charge your
earphones with the supplied lightning
cable and beech is claiming up to eight
hours of use and with my testing of
leading use on it 50% in volume to get a
middle-of-the-road result I was able to
get eight hours and twelve minutes worth
of use from a dead battery I did confirm
what beats calls fast feel it does work
here plug listen for just five minutes
does give me about two hours worth of
playback and that's perfect when you're
about to head out to the gym and need
some audio right at the last minute now
moving up here and the left side of your
inline volume controller you're also
able to skip and go back and song
activate theory and also confirm for
Android users out there Google assistant
does work out here as well there's a
built-in microphone where you can answer
phone calls and with my testing this
performs very similar to other good
performing microphones on the market my
voice came across very clear here but
like most earphones it still picked up
background and wooden noses as well now
moving all the way up including the box
or for silicone ear tips small medium
large and extra-large only two sets of
earrings are included and I'm not using
these earrings are perfectly fine you
stay in what you're pretty well here
having those wings attached do provide
slightly more stability now keep in mind
these are in ear earphones which means
they fit snug in your ear canal
most people don't mind a few do find at
the in-ear method to be slightly
uncomfortable so bear that in mind no
never have they fallen out here doing my
test of walking and running and with the
beep X they do provide very good passive
noise isolation to black out the outside
world but while wearing here it's great
for casual movement like walking and
sitting around the office or at home but
during my runs during my tests because
it's the and the neck wearing experience
or style the wires do bounce around
quite a bit
somewhat distracting at times but the
bigger new ones I can hear the wire
hitting against my shirt my chest my
jawline etc
even when I have music going no even
with that being said if you are a sport
enthusiast if you're a fitness nut keep
in mind these are also not sweat or
water resistant now moving on the
earbuds themselves when not in use are
held together as they're magnetized here
I love this feature I do wish when you
put them together though they would have
gone into standby mode to help conserve
battery very similar to the job Iraq
Jabra has that particular feature on
that particular pair of earphones now
one more item that was in the package
was the carrying case I'll be honest I
hated that thing to be honest with you
you put anything else besides earphones
in their wingtips
money whatever you put in there these
days they have the ability to
unfortunately fall out a zipper or some
kind of class whatever works a lot
better
lastly regarding pairing and signal
strength Apple has been sticking their
new w1 chip inside their wireless audio
products and have to test me power b3
the beats solo threes the Apple earpods
on the channel here and now these after
you sync it for the first time on Apple
devices it pairs again nearly instantly
and the wireless range has always been
great with the beach X I can walk around
the entire house here and have no issues
whatsoever try this with Android devices
same exact experience no problem in
signal strength so this brings me to the
sound characteristics and my sound sense
beef is known for bass and it's no
different here deep sub bass levels are
hid that most other in-ear earphones
simply don't even touch if you like that
hard-hitting resonating tone that basic
songs offers the songs from like Drake
or Chris Brown genres of hip-hop today
bass heads will for sure enjoy these for
general is not so focused on the bass it
is toned down a bit here to prevent it
from going overboard and the mids are
still highlighted the Sesame's with
ac/dc back in black to pop songs of
today whether it be from room 5 or the
chainsmokers the vocals are bright they
stand out and overall the audio
experience is loud now regarding the
high notes 99% of the time it was fine
once in a while here I would run across
the song was very high notes and a sound
was a bit sharper than what I would have
liked but again this was rare the sound
stays on the beat act it's quite
impressive here and your audio sources
left and right of me very distinctly
here but also slightly above you and off
in the distance
now last I'm not sensitive to listening
fatigue not so much but I can tell that
these are on the verge
giving me some dough it's that
experience as if you were at the club or
at a concert for several hours you go
outside and take a break or maybe the
show has ended and when you step outside
some people you see like kind of rub it
yours a little bit like this those are
more sensitive ears I'm sure we'll
experience listening fatigue with the
beep acts so overall before you make a
purchase decision just be aware that
these are basic air phones they're not
for everyone
and regarding the price the only reasons
why I would recommend spending the full
150 dollars is only if you like base
value beyond the next style wearing
value how light these are and how
comfortable these are and you don't need
water resistance you're not planning on
running with these that is perfectly
fine yes I do recommend them at that
time if you can get these on sale that's
even a bigger better deal I do value how
thin these are I do value how light
these are how comfortable these are it
is much thinner than most of the
competition out there so I do have to
give it credit for that so overall hope
