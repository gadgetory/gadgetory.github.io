review room come back with another pair
of sport earbuds and with spring right
around the corner be nice to see what's
new in the industry now Sena has our
just released and allowed me to test one
of their newest earbuds in their sports
lineup priced at just $69 do they
perform well in not just comfort and
stability but sound quality as well
we'll find out I'm your source for
making a purchase decision
welcome to Jim's review room going over
the physical construction first as of
this video they only come in this white
and green color that I have here in the
video the majority of the earbud itself
is made of hardened durable plastics
with a subtle accent of chrome and the
rest made of a silicone type material
now Sennheiser does make an effort to
show their new sport line of earbuds
features stare a touch on its ear tips
and after doing some research on this
particular company stereo touch are one
of the leaders especially in the UK for
adding antimicrobial coatings and to
everyday products so for those who are
health conscious about hygiene and
sweats their ear tips at least gives you
that peace of mind but speaking of the
nasty here these earbuds are sweat and
water resistant and with my testing
drenching these simulating being caught
in the rain these still work flawlessly
now as for durability despite being
lightweight it's pretty rugged from
being thrown into the bag and for sure
wrapping them up and putting them into
my pocket
now one area I always pay close
attention to are the earbud ends where
the wire exits and cheaper earbuds over
time the wire tends to disconnect and
become damaged
overall the 686 G's hold up well as they
offer slight flex to compensate for
accidental poles but I notice over time
from personal testing moving it slightly
back and forth as I do with all my
reviews the flexing did become more
noticeable now nothing appeared to be
damaged and the ends are still rigid
enough to give me confidence and to be
honest I've seen worse and these are
nowhere close to being an issue from my
assessments but this was an observation
and only time will tell of its
durability but moving down Sennheiser
includes a textured tangle free cord
with an inline microphone
and volume controls now pause play and
volume up and down worked on my Android
powered Samsung Galaxy Note 4 but on iOS
8 devices only pause and play seem to
work it was not able to adjust volume
though now testing the inline mic with
phone conversations this works perfectly
now the person I was testing this with
said I sounded natural and didn't sound
like I was using a mic or a headset at
all and I received this question a lot
is there wita noise from running and for
my test it's very slight but here's a
actual live audio recording give up for
you guys the sample and judge for
yourself okay do you hear anything I can
hear the wind like your let's bowl
around something okay I am probably here
for people you definitely hear the
window huh yeah okay yeah I'll just run
it okay let me try the wire inside my
shirt and one quick last test here
you'll again hear a live feed but this
time I'm wearing the wire inside my
jackets while running okay ready all
right here it goes
now the microphone is not located next
to my chin but it's actually located
about two inches above my breastbone and
conducting a call while the wire was
behind my shirts on the other end they
said that the sound was perfect
basically I'm very impressed considering
how low the mic was located
now as for comfort it's so critical to
have earbuds that actually stay in your
ear for those who are on the move now
despite its unique style and shape here
these work very well now having this
narrow band actually keeps the earbud
resting around your jawbone and don't
worry there's no pressure to cause any
discomfort but having this rest here
provides much support working like a
pivot if the type of the earbuds decides
to give way but regarding the hooks here
that goes into the ball of the ear as
small and as minimal as they are they're
adjustable actually to accommodate most
ear sizes by
attracting up and down something I
haven't seen on any other brand that I
personally tested the answer that your
tips themselves these are one of the
most comfortable that I've tried now as
you've seen in my previous reviews
unusually wear a small ear tip and even
then I squeeze it into the ear canal to
cause that suction for a secure hold and
I always prefer the style actually as it
offers deeper immersion into sound as it
provides passive noise isolation but for
these I was fine with the medium tips
that came on the buds and it causes a
very comfortable in ear canal feel now
to further illustrate is not a suction
per se as there's really no need for me
to jam it into the ear but it's it's
just enough inside your ear canal where
it's still comfortable and it doesn't
move at all now for every one of my
tests when running or work me out when
you're pushing very hard you clench your
teeth or you have those weird facial
strains and with other brands it pulls
the ear buds away from your ear canal
losing that sound isolation and also
that sound fidelity as well now if
you've seen my powerbeats2 review you'll
you'll see what I mean but if you
currently have ear buds at home you can
test it yourself put them on and smile
several times as weird as it sounds you
might feel them lift up and become loose
now this wasn't the case at all with
Sennheiser
now they stay down through every run and
every physical activity that I performed
and still provided that noise isolation
I was talking about earlier very
impressed by this design and a quick
note here there is a cord shortener to
have it more snug to your face and also
a in line a clip to prevent wires from
bouncing everywhere nice to see those
features added as some other brands
don't even offer those at all and
regarding noise leaking here these did
very well with minimal noise leak even
at higher volumes and turn not bothering
the people around you so much but
through the moment that you've probably
been waiting for the sound test now the
earbuds gets very loud for most people
and I left mine about 60 to 70 percent
volume and it was still very enjoyable
now I don't know if you believe in this
or not but breaking in headphones and
earphones for me it had taken about two
to three hours of straight listening for
me to then notice the depth of these
earbuds now Sennheiser from all of my
experience testing them seems to offer
balanced sound with a decent bass boost
that doesn't drown or go as deep as the
beat products now it's a similar trait
here
with these sport earbuds you can tell
there's a decent or good amount of bass
that does well in most John Rah's EDM
rap hip-hop in today's pop music now to
the average consumer I believe this will
sound very pleasing while vocals still
retains most of its general quality
characteristics especially those
generous mentioned again EDM rap hip-hop
and pop now as for vocals and the mid
range for songs of other genres the bass
hits the drum beat sounds great for rock
and alternative music for example but
for these particular genres the voices
do sound slightly recessed I wish they
were a bit more forward in this case now
even for a singer recently familiar
Adele her voice could use a bit more
punch you can say now these still sound
good but if you're focused on those good
genres they're rock alternative etc
after a while you might desire just a
bit more now ask for the high notes
they're not singing or ear ringing but I
noticed that a few rare occasions only
when at higher volumes the asses snares
cymbal crashes are slightly distorted
but listening to for example let's see a
headband b.o.b the piano guys without
you Lindsey Stirling spontaneous me neo
Jay Holliday just to name a few songs
and artists there to give you an idea
what this may be good for so overall
what features of being water-resistant a
great fit to the ear passive noise
isolation and an audio signature that
feels geared towards today's modern
music overall for the price this is a
great deal no I just wish they came in
black but that's just personal
preference so hope this video helped you
in some way if you like my work add me
