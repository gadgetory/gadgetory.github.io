room Poehler has just updated their
popular polar lube activity ban that was
introduced back in 2013 today despite
looking nearly identical with the older
model the loop too has some new features
new colors added and some subtle
physical changes to the band itself now
I personally bought this for the retail
price of one hundred and twenty dollars
and accompanied the loop too with my
existing h7 chest strap to monitor my
heart rate comparing today to what was
available in 2013 there's tons of
competition presently in this price
range and you can click on the link in
the video description below for updated
pricing and more information of a chest
strap that I personally use so without
further adieu I'm here to help you make
a purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review ber going over the
aesthetics first this always look big in
photos but once we actually have it on
your wrist it's not bad at all actually
if you compare this to the very popular
Fitbit charge the Fitbit is actually
wider by one millimeter and as you guys
know I do love the darker colors but as
of this video pullers website appears to
only have white and pink available for
the loupe to model nonetheless the white
that I have here does look very classy
attracts minimal amounts of dust and I
haven't noticed the white staining at
all wearing this is very comfortable
when the band feels smoother and softer
than the previous generation the inside
isn't dimpled anymore so no more soap
scum built up as I mentioned in my
previous review and this still features
the same water resistance as before
working perfectly fine in the shower and
yes you are able to swim with this up to
20 meters of depth now if you're not
familiar with the loop band previously
you do have to cut it down to size
Poehler does include a measurement guide
and it works out very well of course you
would have to cut it a little bit bigger
and I would work my way down just ensure
that I don't have it completely snug
than my wrist the only nuisance that
some may encounter you have to remove
and put back the pins just like a watch
removing pins are easy but I know some
will have some trouble putting it back
in protip here using my nail was easier
for me than using the supplied tool but
from my experience the buckle works
great no issues of it unblocked
and yes just like the last one although
shining in a beautiful chrome finish now
it still scratches up from typing at my
desk or resting your palm at a table and
regarding the inside the same port is
found as the last model to sink your
loop to two other PC or Macs and of
course used to charge the device as well
all using Polar's proprietary USB cable
you can wirelessly sync as via bluetooth
as well then I do have to admit there
are a few days where the band seems to
have a little trouble syncing and not
finding these several different devices
that are tested this on require me to
sign out of the app then resyncing them
that usually did the trick most days
however it does sync seamlessly and
showed no signs of issues now going back
to that physical ports here charging is
fast from my experience about an hour
and a half to fully charged a loop to
from a dead battery and about battery
draining this is where I felt it was a
bit odd the battery lasts for me only 4
days 3 hours and 11 minutes to be
precise much shorter than the eight days
of better life that puller is climbing
on their website and thinking it was
only me a few Amazon reviews currently
online as of this video
summer has also stated that they're
averaging about 3 or 4 days as well and
now the very last feature the display
itself the action button to the right
now works absolutely great it's
sensitive enough to register a tab
instead of the old model which struggled
for me with taps not registering at all
the array of 85 LEDs are a gorgeous
white which shines very bright at night
and indoors
however outdoors it is somewhat
difficult to see but to be fair here
most not all but most displays and other
manufacturers found are basically are
difficult to see in the sunlight as well
but what this band can display in your
wrist is your calories burned steps the
time and last is the activity bar
filling up throughout the day indicating
how close you are to meeting your goal
and if you haven't met your goal the
band provides suggestions on how many
more minutes you need to run or how many
more minutes for a walk to reach your
again daily goal a perfect indicator
that in the day to see if a few more
minutes of being active will get you
where you need to be and I personally
love that feature now similar to Garmin
polar alerts you when you've been
inactive for too long if you're sitting
stationary for 55 minutes you receive a
vibration on the wrist to get up
and move five more minutes or to be
exact an hour you receive a ding in your
app which I'll show you coming up
shortly now remember and to keep in mind
here this ban is considered as an entry
level banned
sadly the loop - does not have
indications of your heart rate zones
when you're waiting to chest strap so
you do have to memorize where your
levels are if your design heart rate
zone training however coming up very
soon I'll show you what it looks like
within the app which puller does great
they're not only positive notes
regarding HR when you are wearing the
polar chest strap your real-time heart
rate is displayed right on the band and
no no issues with syncing to the strap
here besides the improvements on how it
feels on the wrist a below - now
features smart notifications for your
iOS devices Android will be available
soon for September of 2015 now I didn't
test this on my Apple products both the
iPad air 2 and the I Touch 6th
generation both the newest models from
Apple unfortunately I don't have an
iPhone on me yet / polar they did
disclose messages and calendar
notification would be present and I used
that to basically do my testing
attempting this I was not able to have a
band notify me on my calendar alerts
I honestly think there was probably some
kind of issue with syncing in general
again this is at the time this video and
the Android version is coming soon for
me to test the later down the road but
let's get into the other aspect that's
as important as the physical activity
band if they have the same activity will
returns its color coded throughout the
day for your convenience
from light to dark each color
representing your activity one great
thing about the polar loop and loop -
unlike many other bands on the market it
can tell when you're sleeping sitting
standing versus walking and running all
automatically and it does do a pretty
darn good job in differentiating each
two if you have to purchase the chess
heart rate monitor and icon shows on the
wheel and once tapped this gives you so
much data about your performance and how
effective your workout was HR max and
average calories burned with the
percentage of those calories how much
were in the fat burning zone heart rate
zone training is key and identifying
your heart rate ranges to ensuring
you're either burning fat or working
your heart health and Paul or no
question does provide visuals numbers
in charts I think better than any other
band on the market now backing out as I
stated earlier if you're inactive for a
full hour you do receive an inactivity
icon as shown here below the wheel are
numeric so for how long you have sub for
and the rest of numbers with its
corresponding icons now moving down
further a progress bar is shown for the
day with an info button to the right
once clicked polar provides suggestions
on varying degrees of actions that you
can do to basically fulfill your goal
for again that particular day backing
out very simple here are calories total
steps time your active in total sleep
tapping on the red tags here will give
you some additional information like
estimated distance and how restful your
sleep actually was now last year is the
inactivity stamps in total with your
manually inputted weight here just in
case you want to keep track of your
progress daily now going over some of
the extra features you get clicking on a
menu on the top left here reveals your
Activity Feed which shows a breakdown of
daily log activity I personally didn't
use this much or at all really but you
can scroll vertically down on basically
the information that you've recorded
next on the menu is activity which is
the wheel that we saw earlier a little
bit moving down is diary which provides
a nice summary for the week to review
next are some notifications that comes
your way here and you can see mine I do
sit in front of a desk many times
throughout the day here so I do get a
lot of alerts and lasts in these
settings there is indeed a vibrating
alarm tucked away in here you can set
the alarm to vibrate your wrist to wake
you up silently and this can be
programmed to vibrate Monday through
Friday or every day selecting individual
days was not an option but despite that
limitation if the Monday through Friday
works for you it does provide a decent
vibration that I think would wake up
most people other than that the band can
hold up to 12 days worth of data before
you need to sync your band
now polar through its app and its
website there's just many ways to access
and read your data to your fitting oh
and before I forget here this is able to
sync with a google fit in my Fitness Pal
if you are using either one of those
programs I haven't tested all the
third-party apps but if you know of any
let me know down
so that's it for this review let me know
your thoughts in the comment section
below on what you think about the new
loop - if you like my work here be sure
to add me on Facebook Twitter or
Instagram to get a look of behind the
scenes information of other products
that I'm putting out and you can always
stop by to say hi again I'm Jimmy with

care and I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
