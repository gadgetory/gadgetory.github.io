review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at this ice cream maker from
Cuisinart model IC e 30 BC found at your
local Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond Macy's and other
select retailers now I purchased mine
for $89 at the time of this review and
I've also done the same review on its
little brother model IC e 21 that's
priced $30 cheaper at $59 and you can
click on this pop up video here or find
it on my youtube channel at
youtube.com/geekandsundry now last a
long time the unit itself consists of
more four main components you have the
locking lid mixing arm freezing Bowl and
the base which houses the motor as well
so that's it and it's very simple the
sprocket is a wide multi teeth design
which in turns provides more even
distribution of power when turning the
freezing Bowl it's unlike a cheaper
version of some ice cream makers where
there's just a narrow metal spindle but
what's great about all the Cuisinart ice
cream makers in general is they don't
require
rock salt or ice as found into more
traditional methods now some people like
the nostalgia factor however with this
machine the bowl is double insulated
with liquid inside now you do have to
freeze the bowl for at least eight hours
or overnight and the freezing Bowl is
what gives the mix eventually that ice
cream texture and consistency
the mixing arm and locking lid is
plastic and clear acrylic respectively
now none of the items per the owner's
manual indicated they were dishwasher
safe so hand wash everything and just
wipe down the motor with a damp cloth as
a tip in this review with a acrylic lid
make sure when you hand wash the lid use
a very soft sponge and nothing abrasive
acrylic is very easily scratched up and
I learned the hard way with some other
items here as shown in the video
now with this model the instruction
booklet includes recipes to make ice
cream sorbet frozen yogurt gelato in
frozen drinks and it makes up to two
quarts at a time and what I'll make
today is butter pecan ice cream for my
tests so this recipe calls for butter
pecans milk sugar salt heavy cream and
vanilla extract
after toasting the pecans and butter and
mixing the rest of the ingredients in a
separate Bowl refrigerate for about an
hour or two
now when ready pour in the mix you've
made into the freezing bowl then place
it into the Cuisinart space now along
with the mixing arm and clear locking
lid you turn on the Cuisinart ice cream
maker and just let it run now for the
instruction it takes about 20 minutes or
so for the ice cream to churn and
thicken and 5 minutes before the mix is
done just pour in the pecans at that
time and that's basically it just poured
in just let the Machine run it's very
simple and what you have now is
soft-serve ice cream if you want hearted
ice cream and which is what I recommend
you do have to place it in the freezer
for several hours now regarding cleanup
again none of the items are dishwasher
safe after everything was done I hand
washed everything with soap and warm
water and there are only three main
components that needed to be washed and
all three were very easy to clean as
claimed by the manufacturer and the most
important part of this review and I'm
sure you've been waiting is the taste
test then in this video it's literally
my first time tasting the ice cream from
a homemade machine and I love ice cream
and I'll tell you it came out very well
indeed the consistency was like
soft-serve ice cream and from this
recipe very surprisingly tasted very
good
a homemade product then I'll mid once
you freeze it and make it into heart ice
cream it did taste a bit better in my
opinion and the consistency was a bit
more creamy and it melted in your mouth
so right after making the ice cream
after hardening the ice cream as well
there's no ice crystals that were found
and a texture was perfect in either way
if he prefers soft-serve versus hard and
ice cream
either way use it was great so after
making several batches and testing this
product I have many positives for this
machine so the unit did work you know
pretty fast once you've placed in your
mix again I only took about maybe 20
minutes for the mix to churn and to the
become the finished product now during
that time the Machine does calm and wine
mild to moderately it's a little quieter
than the smaller yet cheaper Cuisinart
model but nonetheless it's still
tolerable and I really like the fact of
not using salt or ice and a unit in
Guyana was very easy to clean up now in
regards to flaws there's almost none to
suggest but indicating wants is worth
mention though now what I wanted was a
removable lid on top to prevent any dust
from falling into the ice cream while
churning in addition it would have been
nice to have a built-in timer for the
machine to automatically shut off just
in case if I forgot it left it now once
the ice cream thicken the ice cream
expands to a point where it reached the
opening so I was afraid it may overflow
or maybe even you know damaged the
machine if as we became too thick and
machine kind of struggled a little bit
there again those two mentioning you're
not detrimental and just more once than
a flaw overall it's an excellent and fun
machine to use and that's basically it
for this review be sure to watch my
other review and the other ice cream
maker and it will help you to determine
if it's worth worth it to save $30 and
go with the smaller brother which is the
Cuisinart ice EE 21 so I hope you
enjoyed this review of the Cuisinart to

e 30 BC and if you have not please take
