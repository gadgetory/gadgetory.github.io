review room a logitech for the last
several years made one of the best non
gaming mouses on the market the
performance MX now it was introduced
back in 2009 and six years later we
finally have an update with the MX
master now I've personally paid ninety
nine dollars for this mouse as of this
video but check the link in the video
description for updated pricing and even
before going into the details I'll admit
there are some great things about this
mouse but some things that's straight
away from the original MX lineup so I'm
here to help you make your purchase
decision
welcome everyone to jim's review first
and foremost to alleviate in a kind of
confusion I'll be referring to my
previous Mouse as the performance and
the new Mouse here that we're reviewing
today is the master and what makes the
MX line of mice great is its size that's
no exception to the ladder now I've been
using the performance several ones now
and it's absolutely been great by
jumping to the master you'll feel it's
just ever so slightly bigger more
specifically where your ring and pinky
finger sits is just more full in general
in turn causing less of a cup and less
fatigue to the hand around the mouse
that is now if you like big mice this
will feel better
now on the other hand the thumb location
is not as contour or curved as the
performance and you'll notice this once
you pick this up in addition the
rubber-like material for grip other
looks and gorgeous and modern on the
master it's not as grippy and sticky as
the previous Mouse now subtle
differences that isn't bad in a sense
but with the performance it honestly
feels like you can control the mouse
more with subtle movements from the
thumb and fingers again because it's
contoured grippy and with a master the
movements are more controlled by their
wrists and your entire palm now the
master does offer a very subtle two
millimeter increase in its heights as
well offering in simplistic terms once
again a feeling more full now with these
very subtle differences even though I
enjoy using a big mouse it did take
roughly about four or five days to
really get comfortable and get used to
the size now as for the mouse buttons
they offer F
Liss yet very solid feedback with every
press providing affirmation of a click
of the scroll wheel which I loved on the
MX lineup makes a return but this time
offering variability in its speed a
slight nudge offers click scrolling
while a strong push or pull rotates the
wheel freely enabling you to scroll
through web pages or zooming in out of
images very fast now you press the shift
button here and this allows you to
toggle a freely rotating wheel 100% of
time now with the previous Mouse here it
others spun freely or it clicked nothing
in between now on the side of the mouse
is a thumb wheel which absolutely feels
refined and smooth with just enough
resistance to make this feel like a
luxury automobile in its factory setting
it's utilized for horizontal scrolling
but like all the other buttons and why
people buy these more expensive Mouse's
in general you can customize any button
on this Mouse to have it perform other
tasks and I'll show you in later in the
video here about the software and what
it can do but right next to the thumb
wheel are your back in four buttons for
going back and forth on webpages or what
I have seen others do is allocate these
as your copy and paste actions which for
those in productivity environments or
professions this makes work that much
more fluid now one issue for me the buns
are quite small and I have to pull my
thumb back a bit just to reach these
buttons
unlike other mice where just how to slap
my thumb up and press it's a small
sacrifice for the awesome thumb scroll
but it does take a little bit more
effort and does take more time to get
used to now the last button here I want
to discuss is the gesture feature you
can press this down once and this will
open all your open applications for
selection or option two here hold the
gesture button down and then slide your
mouse up down left or right and this can
perform an action for you at its default
settings for window users this will snap
your open window either left or right
here maximize the window or show and
hide your desktop again this can be
customized to other options as well
but now going to the bottom of the mouse
and this is where it's also very
critical first thing to notice this is
the first Mouse to offer Bluetooth
connectivity and the ability to utilize
Logitech unifying technology basically
this one supplied USB adapter goes into
your computer and you can pair several
other Logitech products through
this one connection saving other USB
ports for other peripherals
now as for connection my laptop is on
one side of the house here and I walk
through the other side about 40 linear
feet and no connection was lost now of
course you can utilize the supplied USB
cable like a wired mouse instead and
speaking of the USB cable here logitech
claims up to 40 days of battery life
from a full charge based on using this
mouse six hours daily now the USB cord
charges the mouse for use and from my
testing in the last 10 days here the
battery remaining indicator shows I've
only used roughly 25% of the battery so
far and keep in mind there are some days
when I am working at home all day while
there's other days I am out filming not
utilizing the mouse but so far it does
look very promising though as with my
performance mouse although it's claimed
to have up to one month of battery life
in the real world and the same amount of
usage over time by day 10 again with the
performance MX Mouse I'm receiving an
indication to recharge the mouse already
the performance Mouse dies on average by
day 13 or 14 for me so with the master
you can see it's already doing much
better but looking at the back again
here and comparing to the performance
there is no way to replace the battery
if ever needed now this does utilize a
lithium-ion polymer battery which we
currently see in phones today but my
only concern and only time will tell
after so many charge cycles you would
think the battery may become weaker or
maybe not hold the charge after a while
at least on the performance MX you have
the option to replace the rechargeable
battery with a new one and it lasted but
here is now offering the option to
connect this one Mouse with up to three
other devices simultaneously switching
between my laptop the desktop has been
as quick as just pressing this button
here and the last feature here is
Logitech's dark fuel technology offering
use on nearly any surface including
transparent glass which works perfectly
fine no mouse pad needed but before
letting you go here I wanted to show
quickly the Logitech options software
that you can download from Logitech's
website now in here as stated earlier
you can customize these buttons and
change your settings click on any button
you're intending on changing of course
then select what you wanted to do and
that's basically it you can see the
variety of options here that you can
choose from to map your buttons now
unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a
way to
customize the keys as in creating macros
or a series of keyboard entries for one
mouse button click so as for gamers like
the performance Mouse here for faster
paced precision games like first-person
shooters or large-scale massive
role-playing games that do require 100%
customization this mouse unfortunately
is not for you but as they did earlier
the ergonomics are slightly better by
being more full and having that higher
arch but I wish the thumb rest curved
just a bit more I love the thumb scroll
but the back and four buttons compared
to many other mice does take a bit more
effort not to mention per Logitech's
website here the master has five
physical buttons to customize while the
older performance Mouse features up to
nine now this is debatable but I also
prefer not necessarily a requirement
here for an interchangeable battery and
I'm sure you probably have experiences
before with all the devices the battery
does fail and it'll be nice to have
peace of mind that I can replace the
battery down the road but the biggest
benefits and perks of considering the
master here besides its size the
connection of Bluetooth and the unifier
the ability to have this work with other
devices with just a press of a button
the quick shortcuts and customizations
on the mouse although it's similar to
the performance here and the thumb and
scroll wheel here are just excellent and
last and not to be forgotten here the
battery life performance looks much
improved so in the end in my humble
opinion here and still considered a very
great Mouse but if you already have the
performance MX like I do here stay where
you are until the master dropped its
price or if you're in the other
situation here if you don't own a
previous large Mouse and a large Mouse
is your priority yes the master will
fulfill those hands and the slight
upgrades from the performance MX does
add up to make this a worthy next
generation Mouse for the coming years so
how this video helped you in some way be
sure to add me gems review room to your
Facebook Twitter or Instagram accounts
and you'll see me reviewing items before
they even upload it and also behind the
scenes of the work that I do thank you
everyone for watching you guys take care
and I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
