scene with the likes of jawbone Fitbit
and garment for 2014 but with so much
change competition is only heating up
bands cramming in more options while
others are emphasizing simplicity though
there's an industry shift as well to a
heartrate tracking being a focus point
and also the lines are blurred between
SmartWatch and fitness trackers being an
all-in-one device now I can show you all
the bands in this short video but here's
some that I think are worth mentioning
so what I'd like to do is show you not a
review as I typically perform but a
glimpse on what to expect so sit back
and relax as this is me reporting on
activity and fitness bands for 2015
the government vivo active isn't out yet
as of this video but it's poised to
offer some spectacular features that
rivals even the Fitbit surge at the
moment of course the band can track your
basic steps calories distance but
something unique this can record
specific activities now other bands have
done something similar in the past you
can tell the band to track your session
that you're about to perform then label
it either running or weight lifting etc
when you're done it's kind of like
starting to clock any generic activity
then stopping the clock when you're
finished and that's basically it the
VEVO active is different in that aspect
and I'll give you an example here let's
say you're about to golf the GPS and the
band will find your registered golf
course and tell you what hole number
you're on par and distance to the green
now I'm not a golfer or no much of the
terminology but it Clues you in on
layups and dog legs as well now as for
swimming time distance and stroke count
are all calculated for cyclist you can
imagine something similar as this does
provide distance time and speed
information now that's just to name a
few workout sessions that can be
recorded now one the downfalls it
appears to not track heart rate on the
wrist or at least for the time being
it's not mentioned on the website a
separate chest heart rate monitor is
more than likely needed for this feature
which garment does sell separately now
this will allow much more accurate
calorie burns you do learn more about
your health during and after each day in
finding ways to improve but besides the
health aspect the band offers GPS full
swimming capabilities displaying
incoming calls messages emails offering
garments genius move bar is also
included and the band claims up to three
weeks of battery life which is almost
unheard of any mainstream activity band
now it's priced at two hundred fifty
dollars without the heart rate monitor
and three hundred dollars with one it's
pricey but compared to the competition
this does offer a bit more now look for
this first quarter of 2015 and of course
and here as well find me on facebook
twitter or instagram and you'll be able
to see it when i get it and ask
questions bear
next up is a band that I had been
waiting for a good while jawbone claimed
their new up three would have been
released back in November than later at
the end of December then people
receiving notices of mid to late January
it's still not here as of this video now
I emailed jawbone through their press
and media email and receive their
response stating their quote fine tuning
the manufacturing process unquote which
I don't even know if that's even
accurate anymore no other websites are
claiming jawbone is behind on their
payments and hence they're delayed in
getting this band out now either way I
know a lot of people who preordered are
very upset but hopefully by the time
you're watching this video the up three
will be out and the reason why this is
worth the wait well Jotham claims this
is going to be the most advanced tracker
to man offering state-of-the-art sensors
and features now one of the biggest
benefits the band offers advanced
activity and allowing the band to
automatically tell when you start
running and it logs it but we've seen
this on some other bands like the polar
loop where it differentiates and
automatically it distinguishes you lay
down sitting walking speed walking and
even running but job on claims to go one
step further offering recognition on the
fly if you start a game of let's say
basketball now a job on on their site
hasn't disclosed what other sports in
how many are recognized but having the
ability to read me say weightlifting
than doing some cardio afterwards on the
fly would be a dream hopefully we'll
find out soon if that's even a
possibility or not now sleeping is more
involved than ever before a light sleep
versus deep sleep makes a return on to
the app but now includes REM sleep the
state where you're dreaming and
recovering now job on late many new
bands offers heart rate tracking but
jawbone uses bio impedance versus
optical blood flow sensors bioimpedance
measures how well your body impedes
electric current flow now considering
our bodies are made mostly of water
research have shown bioimpedance have
been a more accurate measurement of the
body's health now besides HR information
the up three claims as of this video to
also measure respiration
galvanic skin response basically
perspiration and with this ban the up
three can be taken for swim and even
diving into a pool its water resistant
up to 10 meters or basically 32 feet in
depth which i think is more than enough
for the average consumer now keep in
mind the up three still doesn't have a
screen or clock in the band itself so
this won't replace a watch now some are
fine with that while others do desire
time to be told now battery life is up
to seven days while pricing starts at
one hundred and seventy nine dollars and
release date is nobody knows at the
moments not even jawbone as of this
video now one of the heavy hitters is
the Fitbit surge released in limited
quantities back in December of 2014 and
officially released you can say in
January of 2015 the search offers much
more besides these standard steps
distance calories burned and data and
stairs climbed the surge generates very
accurate data offers a very simple and
easy to understand app in addition
actual consumer features that blur the
lines of a SmartWatch and an activity
band now for health related features
this can differentiate workouts like
running cross training cardio and
weightlifting with consumer features
like notification of calls and being
able to read text messages and email in
its entirety the one the biggest perks
is from the heart rate optical sensor
and from my testing it provides heart
rate data very close to what a chest
heart rate monitor provides and this
reads all day even while you're sleeping
or stationary at your desk now when not
working out or doing anything strenuous
resting heart rate is viewable and
important to see to determine the health
of a heart as well now besides the HR
GPS tracking is built in this also
automatically records sleep which is
spot-on and food locking is also
available to with vibrating alarms now
the only issue that I have with this
although it's rated at five ATM for
water resistance Fitbit website claims
you cannot go swimming with this now its
price at two hundred fifty dollars and
currently out on the market at the
moment
bases manufacturing what was once the
most advanced track of its time when it
released its basis carbon steel last
year now for 2015 they released the
bases peak offering a very nice size
band that looks very much like a regular
watch it's able to tell time 24-7
there's no need to press a button to see
that display and then some features are
carried over from the carbon steel as
well such as the heart rate sensor sweat
and skin temperature sensor with sleep
monitoring also making it return now
this time with the peak it's offering
consumer features as well such as
notifications of messages and emails now
another big perk it is rated at 5 ATM
meaning you can shower and swim with
this band with no problems now after
personally testing and doing a full
review on my youtube channel I found the
app attempts to change your habits for
the better which is quite unique now
through the app basis every night will
encourage you to sleep at a consistent
time and encourages you to wake up at a
certain time every day now of course
this can be adjusted but it keeps you on
track if you ever deviate now walking or
being active goals will be provided with
a minimal walk or run distance as well
the peak holds your hand in in essence
by only offering more habits or goals to
be unlocked once you achieve a certain
amount of goals presently now keep in
mind the better life is somewhat on the
low side offering up to four days of
news it's priced at one hundred ninety
nine dollars and currently available to
buy
this band is for the serious competitor
I just want to throw this in here for
the folks to see what a more niche or
dedicated Fitness watch has to offer our
government has always been one of the
leaders in offering watches for runners
before the times of mainstream bands
hitting the market and I'll tell you
right now it's priced at a whopping four
hundred and ninety-nine dollars as of
this video and will be available the
first quarter of 2015 now the Phoenix 3
is rated at 10 ATM or 100 meters of
water depth it's built with a reinforced
housing and with models offering a
sapphire display the only thing that can
scratch the screen are diamonds now GPS
is also included but also GLONASS which
is Russia's GPS equivalent system
offering up to twenty percent faster
coordinate and location mapping and
accuracy for garmin levan comes with an
altimeter for real-time accurate ascent
and descent through a variety of
elevation changes think biking through
the woods and trails or skiing down
mountains now a barometer is also built
in to predict weather changes by showing
short term trends and air pressure and
last is a built-in digital compass to
keep you moving in the right direction
and pro-government the Finks three auto
calibrates without you needing to
fine-tune the band ever now for serious
runners this measures cadence vertical
oscillation and ground contact times on
my new details that's pertinent to
maximize your run efficiency of the one
downfall besides the very high price to
the average consumer it doesn't come
with a heartrate tracker you have to buy
it separately from Garmin but with a
chest monitor and the Phoenix 3 you can
calculate your vo2 max and programming
once your running speed your beats per
minute and heart rate variability is
accumulated through the band it then
calculates the maximum volume of oxygen
you can consume permitted the higher
your vo2 number the better health you
have now in addition there's also a
recovery timer and a recovery check and
also a race predictor mode which
estimates basically your ideal finish
type based on your again vo2 max number
it's just really intense but wait
there's more now remember what I said
about the garmin vivo active earlier it
can measure
swimming or this takes it one step
further tell the band how big the pool
is for even more accurate results and
this would track your distance pace
stroke counts and more now for skiers
this track speed distance and vertical
drop on battery life is crazy too with
up to six weeks in watch mode and up to
20 hours if using straight GPS again
releasing this first quarter of 2015
priced at four hundred and ninety-nine
dollars now let's take a different
approach that's much cheaper and offers
much more simplicity the news band from
Withings they activate pop offers just
that and I apologize if I pronounce that
name incorrectly now simply put it's a
watch style design that I think rivals
that of the misfit shine having an
analog dial that's always telling the
time in a small side arm to tell how
close you are to reaching your goal for
that day is simply claim the activate
pop tracks walking and auto detects
running it also tracks sleep with light
versus deep sleep and can also work for
swimmers up to 50 meters or 165 feet of
depth of the band looks super thin and
it's lightweight and also comes with a
battery offering up to eight months of
battery life now I haven't tested this
personally but I very much like the
design / the shine because I can look
down and tell the time the only issue
I'm worried about though the watch isn't
backlit or the analog hands doesn't look
too glow-in-the-dark at all and because
of its simplicity it doesn't measure
heart rate either surprisingly though
this has a vibrating alarm to wake you
up in the morning not too bad it's one
hundred fifty dollars at the time of
this video and was released January of
2015
the very last band that I want to
discuss is very much different from any
other band that I've seen now I had been
eyeing this band since last year's
activity band video that I made Atlas
wearables was a successful indiegogo
campaign raising more money that they
anticipated and currently in the final
stages of manufacturing the product and
releasing it now this band is geared
towards those who strength train more
specifically weight lifting now this
will record the normal metrics like
steps and calories burned etc but this
will differentiate and recording
different physical exercises in real
time now as demonstrated this will tell
a difference between bicep curls versus
alternating curls from regular push-ups
to Diamond push-ups if you decide to do
deadlifts right after this will
automatically recognize this and store
your reps and sets but what's even more
impressive is what Atlas wearables is
claiming this will analyze your form the
app also analyzes and informs you which
muscle groups you're working and which
ones are neglected so if you do p90
CrossFit insanity whatever it may be
this will be intense and seeing what
you're really working and keep in mind
this also has a built-in heart rate
monitor as well and it does work for
swimmers up to 50 meters of depth now
the only thing that I'm truly skeptical
about is how well it tracks the bearing
exercises how many exercises will be
available at launch that it can read
which I'm sure will course continue
updating down the road but more
importantly is its comfort considering
this sticks out going along the forearm
in the pictures and videos that they're
showing something simple as push-ups or
military presses where the hand and
wrist are bent backwards the device
looks like it's going to jab right into
me but I did personally pre-order this
for two hundred and forty nine dollars
and the first wave of releases will be
early spring which hopefully I should
get mine at that time those pre ordering
now may get theirs toward the end or
spring or summer at the latest not
assume now of course add me on to either
Facebook Twitter Instagram or Google+ as
i'll post photos once I received them
now as I stated earlier in this video
there's many other bands that I've sure
missed some honorable mention includes
the pebble steel Microsoft band and Lee
polar m4
and 300 to name a few now some bands
released technically in later 2014 are
still relevant for 2015 such as the vivo
smart in the view of it too from Garmin
the jawbone move in the up24 or the
jaybird rain but I can at least say if
you've thought about buying a fitness or
Nativity band 2015 is when it really
steps far away from being a glorified
pedometer and into the realm of really
being a great overall holistic health
tracker so i'll be reviewing some if not
all the bands from this list mentioned
above so be sure to find me on Facebook
Twitter Instagram or Google+ as I can
respond to questions and show you
pictures much easier on there rather
than waiting for the actual review on
the website and one last tidbit here
i'll be waiting for mobile world
congress to happen the first week of
march and then i'll make a smart watches
for 2015 video at that time that's a
whole different market in a whole
different ballgame in in itself now this
is Jimmy with Jim's review room thank
you guys for watching you guys take care
and I'll see you in the next one bye
