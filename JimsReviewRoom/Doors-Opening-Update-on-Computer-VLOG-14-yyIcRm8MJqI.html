room hope you guys are doing good
welcome back to another vlog here it is
gorgeous outside as you can see the Sun
is just beaming on me I feel like a
vampire it as bright as heck outside by
anyways I want to take advantage of it
doing the final tests on the under
armour band that I have here a lot of
you guys have been asked me about the
under armour health box so I should have
this by the end of this week if not end
of this week then it should be maybe
monday or tuesday of next week you got
to kind of give you guys a time frame
and more than like i'm going to upload
this video tomorrow thursday so can i
give you an idea of you know when this
video was made and you know what kind of
time frame were looking at a lot like
that a lot of you who have been asked me
about this but i just uploaded the audio
engine HD six speakers those who are
pretty phenomenal check that review out
you guys haven't done so already and as
a side note here i have a business call
at four o'clock which I'm really excited
about I can't tell you who it is just
yet it's not a review but it's something
a little bit different and i don't know
i don't want to hype it up I don't know
if I don't even know what it entails
they just said hey would you be
interested in XYZ let's do a phone
conference or a phone call and about
maybe another hour and a half two hours
we'll see what happens so anyways optic
but i'll update that with you guys
pretty shortly but let me go for a run
real quick here um get some data on this
i got the chest strap as well too and i
also have the polar chest strap which
I'm you know always carrying with me
just a cross reference and double check
the heart rate accuracy so you guys can
look out for that I will be doing that
test and I'm gonna be i'll give you guys
an update and regard my computer
buildings well i haven't built anything
yet obviously but i think a narrow down
my list i get bit for you guys alright
talk to you guys later I'll be back
does that look good does that look good
do you look good okay hold on is it on
that's it on hold on there you go all
right cameras on it is on yet is all
right up with Daddy god you're getting
heavy yeah heavy ah can you see high
can't say hi can't say hi louder see hi
hi hi all right good job what's up folks
so today is the following day although
it's in the same video no you guys
watching but yesterday after that
business phone call five minutes later
two day care called me and said she had
a fever of 103 degrees so me my fiance
had to go and get her so I didn't finish
up the vlog last night so today she
still has a fever of 101 degrees she
feels a little bit a little warm of
course you can't go back to school so
she gets to hang out with me today which
is awesome you know it gets me you know
it forces me not to work and actually
spend time with her which I am always
always down for so the health box review
from under armour like i said earlier
has to be postponed just a little bit so
most likely I won't get it up by
tomorrow which is Friday maybe this
weekend if I am working this weekend if
she's sick then of course I'm not
working so i would probably be early
next week so doesn't want to give you
guys a heads up i know is this because a
lot of you guys have been asking for it
so probably early next week i'll get
that up we're trying to try and Cappie
dad so if you guys follow me on social
media like very early on i'm talking
about when i first started youtube two
years ago I used to post some photos of
when she was just born so maybe you know
a month or three months five months
maybe six months old but then it's just
been you know crazy busy with the
business busy with her obviously just
lack of sleep and I just slowly stopped
you know posting photos so if you guys
haven't seen her in a while this is what
she is today look how tall she is next
month she'll be officially to
years old and she's starting to talk up
a storm and she's starting to get a
little feisty so a little bit of that
New York personality in her so that's
pretty cool but but overall good girl
very very smart girl and she just a
little sick that's all I think I don't
know if I told you guys yet 101 degrees
earlier today that i took the
temperature i found but well than that
i'm gonna try to put her sleep now i got
some boxes if you guys found my social
media I uploaded a box from corsair and
i want to hold off until now and unbox
some of the items i have for the
computer built for you guys and also
give you some my thoughts as well so
give me a second let me put her sleep
and I'll be right back ready go
night-night where you go night-night I
don't think she wants to go night-night
can't see by can see by there you go
byebye baby she sees herself on the
cameras there's like by my baby yeah
that's to you saying bye bye to yourself
wow it was crazy here all right come on
um we got changed a diaper you stink
yeah all right folks man she went to
sleep right away so hopefully uh she'll
feel better I know she is like just
tired and she's not feeling that great
either going back to Jim's reviewing
stuff here regarding the business call
yesterday just real briefly it went well
I think I don't want to drop the name
just yet if I conclude you guys in it's
a really really big company i'm really
excited about it about the name that is
the from what they told me they're in
eighty percent of smartphones today so
what they want me to do is because they
are a component of a cell phone
mainstream America or just the average
person is not too much aware of their
brand and they're just looking for
youtubers they're just looking for
youtubers to basically help you know
make a video put on their channel and
just help gain awareness but the reason
why I'm not name-dropping i want to
receive the paperwork first i want to
read the fine print I discussed it on
the phone call yesterday I want to make
it clear is this
review or is this you know something
else and they told me that it's not an
editorial piece so it's not a review
what they want to do is fly me out to
some state which lays it out I guess I
can name drop that they want to fly me
on to Arizona and they want to
demonstrate one of their some of their
products and they just want me to record
it and then give my opinions on it after
my experience so of course lady I want
to make sure that's that's lovely that's
nice I've never been out to Arizona
great but like I said I asked them
specifically is this a review or not
they said it's not a review so it's more
about brand awareness it's just
marketing I guess you can say and they
just asked me to make a video eventually
on it so once I get the paperwork guys
want to redefine details the fine print
and just make sure that there's not a
conflict of interest I want to make sure
that it is ethical as well at least for
my brand I want to build I haven't I
private you know but saying in every
video and I apologize but I want to make
sure it's clear i really want to build a
brand that you guys can trust and i just
want to say that for the bottom of heart
because i do emphasize on that so much
and i try to show it in my work but um
anyways i'll update you guys about that
as as more information comes along like
i said haven't accepted anything that's
why i haven't given up the name but
moving on here regarding my computer
build last vlog i told you guys you know
what i wanted i read almost every want
to become if not all the comments trying
to get an idea of what i want and what's
good out there so after i took
everyone's list and recommendations i
compiled it down put on an excel sheet
ran the numbers and initially my budget
was about seventeen hundred dollars and
then it kind of added up so I'd bump it
up to two thousand and the one thing i
didn't mention my last vlog and one
thing i forgot in general is I do need
new monitors color accurate monitors
srgb color accuracy monitors and with
that being said if I need to add those
two in it's going to be over three
thousand dollars which is obviously much
more much higher than my budget I said
hey I'm just you know shoot a dart at
the board and
wetlands I shot some emails to some
companies some companies graciously has
helped me thank goodness they didn't pay
me anything so all the asses of course
me to show it on camera here as I'm
doing right now and just help gain brand
awareness that's it but they're
reputable companies and I'll start
unboxing them for you guys let's see
this one first is from OCC they i did
email them they did hook me up here they
provided me ocz vector 180 but this is
480 gigs they didn't have a 500 gig
model so this would definitely help me
out here ocz thank you and now of course
air really really was awesome to me
they're really nice very responsive with
their emails awesome guy they sent me
there ddr4 ram and they supplied with 32
gigs which is awesome this helps
tremendously thank you very much i
emailed some motherboard companies and
graphic card companies and didn't have
so much luck with getting any responses
back so unfortunately they can help me
on that but I mean I then day like I
said I wasn't expecting like a whole
free computer build or anything like
that I am grateful very grateful for
these companies tons of respect to them
for just getting back and giving me an
opportunity like this obviously i'm not
linus tech tips i'm not a die-hard
computer channel but just them you know
offering assistance helps big-time so in
my return as want to give them that
exposure that they're asking for of
course here again did hook me up here
h100 very popular water cooling system
for the cpu awesome and they hooked me
up i actually use the corsair CX series
and when I talk to corsair they said
they're going to send me a little bit
more of a beefier unit since how you
know be running the computer for a good
bit of timely like said I do leave my
computer on
1214 hours a day working whatnot and
here goes here goes the items thank you
very much I do very very much appreciate
it this helps tremendously regarding to
build a via ninety-nine percent chance I
am still paying out of my pocket for the
motherboard the graphics card the case
i'm still looking into I think I
pinpoint a specific case that I want but
will see no promises on that I don't
want to name drop that just yet and the
monitors I still have to get you know
personally myself as well so it's still
with the monitors it's still going to be
a two-thousand-dollar out of my own
pocket seventeen hundred to two thousand
dollars or so the graphics card alone
980 TI is what 650 the motherboard alone
maybe two hundred and then you'll just
let other little stuff little things the
case and then again the two monitors so
we're still still a pretty penny still
might be a little bit over budget by
again at the end dad do need a new
computer but thank you guys again thank
you very much this does help alright so
I think that's gonna be it for this vlog
here I need to take advantage of the
time while she's sleeping again thank
you guys for everything again you guys
are following my journey from the get-go
if you guys are new newer to the channel
if you guys had been found me I this
channel I started from nothing and it's
getting to the point where you know
these things I mean it two years ago
obviously this would be impossible and
doors are opening up so thank you very
much follow your dreams work hard and
have high standards high goals for
yourself and just stay persistent that's
locking today alright guys thank you
very much for everything you guys take
care I'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
