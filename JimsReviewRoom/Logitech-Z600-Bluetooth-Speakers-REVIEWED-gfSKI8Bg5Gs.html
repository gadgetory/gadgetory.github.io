by Jim's review room today we'll be
looking at the Logitech g600 bluetooth
speaker now they're new to the market at
the time of this review and they do
retail for 149 dollars now Logitech like
many manufactures are jumping onto the
bandwagon with Bluetooth speakers now
I've done several reviews already with
more of the portable outfits but with
this logitech's latest design and
offered versatility how does this
speaker perform we'll find out on this
review alright so let's get started here
if you're in the market for new speakers
for your laptop or desktop area logitech
offers three different classes in this
product lineup from what i would
classify its good better and best
BeeZee 130 the z3 20 and this pair here
the Z 600 respectively so for this Z 600
that I have here today it's the most
different and unique in design
Logitech's goal with this device is
breaking from the traditional speaker
setup we're only one device in most
cases your computer or laptop being
connected to addressing today's world of
smartphones tablets and computers so
this speaker gives you that versatility
you know sometimes I personally play
music for my phone or I watch TV on my
iPad so either one of those cases I
don't use my laptop so instead of
juggling physical wire connections you
could do all of this wirelessly via
bluetooth so this is the only model in
logitech's
Z product lineup that features Bluetooth
connectivity and it also syncs three
devices at a time and Logitech wasn't
nice enough to include the USB bluetooth
adapter so if you personally don't have
Bluetooth built into your computer
logitech has you covered and for some
reason you decide not to use the
Bluetooth feature Logitech does supply a
3.5 millimeter jack and connects with
your speaker's inline connection in
regards to aesthetic and build what I
thought was a wire mesh grill is
actually a very durable fabric mesh look
at this thing around and setting the
speakers up showed no signs of damage or
stretch when grabbing the floating
fabric now although the speaker has
wireless capability it's not necessarily
a hundred percent Wireless you
do have these quote-unquote lay flat
cables on each speaker that attempts to
give you these clean lines when placed
on your desk and they're designed to
prevent tangling and it actually works
well for a wired setup now separate
cables connect to each other and becomes
one to connect to the AC power plug kind
of like a Wye formation and if you use
the three-and-a-half millimeter wire you
have a maximum of now three wires coming
out the back of your laptop or connected
device so if you look on the back the
rear right speaker features the
Bluetooth sync button power and behind
two rubber caps here the banker USB port
for firmware updates and the auxiliary
port as well so how easy is it to
connect it's simple enough from your
Android or iOS tablet or phone turn on
Bluetooth in your settings then on the
right speaker press the Bluetooth icon
and then go back to your device and find
easy 600 and that's it it's the same
thing for your laptop or computer but
you connect a bluetooth USB adapter
instead plug the adapter in and
right-click your speaker icon to find
playback devices here just right-click
on your Z 600 and make it your default
device and that's it and if you
absolutely have no Bluetooth connection
connect your device physically with the
three-and-a-half millimeter jack it's as
easy as that and you'll have audio in no
time there's no value map or rocker to
keep the look streamlined but the van
control is found on top of the right
speaker and it's adjusted by making
these awesome circles like an old-school
iPod now once you've reached a maximum
level though of value the speaker does
make a specific sound which is a nice
feature since there isn't a valium
indicator so how does it all sound so
let me play a sample and hopefully you
have some good speakers yourself or a
good pair of earphones and you can make
judgement yourself and first up we gotta
get lucky by def pump featuring Pharrell
I gotta go so smooth like I got it on
tap yeah and I'm sick of being a good
night while I'm on my game land while
I'm drinking Bud Light can you get it
when you miss me like a myth whiskey
drinking Jim Beam need baby do you do it
do it that way
did you do that did you take a break you
know that when I kill it on the beach
like a sex on the beach like it's Malibu
California bacon bacon Californication
and there you have it folks
at medium valium the sound was very
clear and you can distinguish the left
and right stereo channels at least in
person though and I'm recording this
from my condenser microphone the sound
did feel small to medium sized rooms
pretty well so it's ideal for your home
office and bedroom or dorm room and if
you were to place this in your living
room though there is sound but it
doesn't fill up the room as much as you
want or expect bass and Jenner was
seriously lacking across all our ranges
my considering the Z 600 does have down
firing speakers on the bottom I was
expecting a bit more bass in general you
really didn't feel that warmth or denim
or depth from these pair of speakers no
again I want to emphasize the
performance was clear though and it is
good for the average user in my opinion
listening to audio when working at their
computer going back at maximum valium
the very high notes does have some hiss
and distortion so in conclusion I
wouldn't suggest a Z 600's if you really
wanted to watch movies or do some gaming
in this sense in my opinion there's
barely any bass for movies and sound
immersion which is very important to me
however again it's a good pair of
speakers for what you need it for
again that's average news and having
speakers to casually watch your favorite
YouTube videos place it music in the
background
from either your device or computer and
I guess the only reason why you would
buy this is if you truly like the
convenience and or need the ease of
Bluetooth connectivity this definitely
might suit your needs so I hope you
enjoyed this review of the Logitech g600
bluetooth speakers and if you haven't
