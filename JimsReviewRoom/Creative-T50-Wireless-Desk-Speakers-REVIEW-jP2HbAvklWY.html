review room so a few weeks ago I had
reviewed one of the best bang for your
buck
portable Bluetooth speakers be creative
roar so I decided to give a try on
another product from the same company
and this time it's a set of desktop
speakers now it's similar to the t40
model which had received good reviews
but the model have here it's new this
now comes with Bluetooth NFC and of
course the traditional wired
capabilities Logitech bows and Altech
Lansing are known for making desktop
speakers but none currently offer the
option of having a wireless connection
and for the reason why you would want to
go with a desktop speaker instead of a
portable Bluetooth speaker is audio
separation you want distinct left and
right audio channels which most if not
all Bluetooth speakers portable
Bluetooth speakers that is really have
trouble in so without further ado
welcome to Jim's reviewer
going over the physical features first
these are bigger in person than what I
first thought they stand a little over
12 inches tall and three and a half
inches wide with a decent depth of 7.3
inches deep the front looks good in my
opinion with its glossy black finish and
it's woven fiber drivers in gold the
middle has a dome tweeter as well in
which I'll discuss the audio performance
shortly but overall it's one classy
looking setup now the right speaker has
your adjustments for both bass and
trouble with the volume knob on the far
right directly below is the power and
bluetooth pairing buttons on either
sides that glows white when in use and
for convenience there's also a three 1/2
millimeter output for using the setup
with your headphones instead now looking
at the very top there is a base port and
rotating to the rears here the left
speaker has a fixed audio cable that
stretches a reasonable 5 feet to connect
this to the right speaker there's also a
3.5 millimeter input for connecting your
device physically rather than bluetooth
the RCA port for connecting again met
left channel speaker and last is your
power port that offers a power cable
that's approximately 8 and 1/2 feet long
but as stated earlier you can pair this
with your phone or tablet and have
wireless music or movies plying from
afar via bluetooth and also a huge plus
for those with NFC or near field
communications you can just tap your
phone on top of the right speaker and
this will pair your device for you
automatically
now I was able to achieve a consistent
signal before the audio became distorted
by going downstairs and a few feet prior
to the opposite side of the house it
basically retained its connection that's
several walls in the first floor ceiling
giving a total linear distance
approximately 40 feet so that's not bad
at all now regarding the sound test keep
in mind the T 50s I have here and like
many desktop speakers they're a 2.0
system basically two speakers with a
subwoofer now bass levels do hit higher
than portable Bluetooth speakers so for
sure these are the go-to system if you
do value a bit more bass now for a 2.0
system again without a subwoofer they're
good but don't expect it to be hitting
those deep sub bass levels mid levels
are clear and distinct for areas of
vocals and music and active voices in
movies now as for high notes they do
good in
general but if watching movies
especially those with a lot of
explosions sounds of fire and glass
breaking or it hit those high notes from
time to time it does vary slightly get
muffled not singing but the highs get a
little jumbled and it loses just a tiny
bit of clarity now as for music for the
average consumer I don't believe they'll
notice it until you put the value at a
very high level now these do get very
loud for small to medium sized rooms and
personal listening leaving these at 50%
volume was loud enough for most
situations and for large rooms yes these
can provide audio in a large room but it
would be just that just audio you won't
be able to hear the my new details to
really throw down a party you can say
now as we're watching movies these
speakers still do well but only for
personal listening at far-off distances
audio separation is not as apparent
however if you're sitting at a home desk
or dorm room desk sitting a few feet
away from these speakers the left and
right audio channel separation is really
good then now I'm glad creative offers
again as mentioned earlier a bass and
treble nap offering on-the-fly
adjustments now the bass doesn't
fluctuate too much on 80 50s but the
speaker's themselves has enough bass
from the get-go to still be appreciated
overall the sound signature feels
balanced to me offering a good range of
music genres to listen to now overall if
you're looking for a 2.0 system these
really do justice if you don't need the
portability and need better sound in
your personal area office dorm room
these do work great so that's it for my
review here I hope this helped you in
some way if you like my work be sure to
add me gems review room on Facebook
Twitter or Google+ to get more updates
from me on items before I put them on
the website so this is Jimmy again with
Jim's review room you guys take care and
I'll see you on the next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
