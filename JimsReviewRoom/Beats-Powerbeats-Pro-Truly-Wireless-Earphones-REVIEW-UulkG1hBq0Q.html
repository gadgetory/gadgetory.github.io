today's awesome video after a while
sometimes I sit here and I think when is
Apple going to update their beats
products other competitors are offering
something better
not only in price but also performance
it's been quite some time and I'm sorry
that's just the truth over the years
Beats hasn't really really said anything
new that is in your audio department but
today finally we got the power beats Pro
and the specs are quite impressive now
it's a hefty $250 retail at the time
this video they're very much on the
upper end with the Sennheiser and the
Vino truly wireless earphones are priced
slightly above and with let's say the
bose sound sports the Jabra lineup and
also the truly wireless earphones from
jaybird those are a little bit below as
always full disclosure Apple / Beats
here did send this in for review my
assessment was not altered in any way
I'll be going over both pros and cons
also click on my affiliate links down in
that video description below for the
most updated prices in real time you
never know when these things might go on
sale I'm Jimmy with Jim's review and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review going over the physical features
first I anticipated these were going to
be bulky and they were going to stick
out that the earphones would also bounce
around during intense movements with my
testing on all fronts they don't they're
actually quite flush against my ear as
you guys can see and for the first time
I can run with a hoodie on and the
earphones don't feel as though they'll
fall out from gently rubbing against
that fabric now with more intense
movements simply demonstrate myself
jump-roping here I'd never had any doubt
that they would fall off and more
importantly I don't feel that the ear
tips will be lifting off my ears and
losing sound quality that's really
impressive we're truly wireless
earphones one of the issues that I've
noticed when I had the power beats 3 now
of course cosmetically I think they look
pretty damn good too now all of this
praise off physically being stable it's
because of these ear
they are adjustable and does retain its
shape they do feel more competent than
the power beats 3 as it's a bit stiffer
and the casing feels a little bit more
durable so we'll see over time now I
love the fit on my draw bars and my
Samsung Galaxy buds more recently those
who were great but I will admit the ear
hooks do provide that extra level of
stability now moving on beats are
claiming these are water and sweat
resistant spraying the crap out of these
things right here they are still working
perfectly fine I was hoping for some
sort of ingress rating or considering
that we've had all this time to design
these having it be submersible although
overkill would have give me more peace
of mind there's a few other competitors
out there that offers just that why not
the power beats Pro but getting a closer
look easily identifiable multifunction
button the actions are identical on
either side which I really liked little
volume rocker buttons are located at the
very top and also are easily
identifiable
everything is there except for
transparency mode maybe some people call
it here through ambient to air whatever
name these companies give them beats
does not have the ability to turn on the
internal microphones so you can hear
your environmental noises nearly
everyone else is offering it and I know
my fans a bunch of you use it for safety
while running some uses these truly
wireless earphones while working to hear
if your boss sneaks up on you we don't
get that again with your power beats bro
last test I confirm you can activate
Siri with your voice as it seems to
always be listening for that command
awesome feature or of course you can
always hold down the beats logo again on
either side of these earbuds now with
Android using my voice didn't work for
me you can only activate Google
assistance with the button press or
telling the button hold all right now
moving on to the good stuff here the
technology there's this new h1 inside
and it's working wonders yes you do get
amazing fast and seamless bluetooth
pairing a very similar experience to
those who had ear pods previously and
with my iPhone I'm averaging about two
seconds when the case opens to when the
iPhone brings up this cool 3d spinning
thing in battery life
in states definitely fast enough for me
though but I love how seamless and more
importantly how consistent it's been
with Android it's honestly not a slouch
either on screen is proof with my new
pixel 3a I've been testing it connects
on average in three seconds either
scenario either phones by the time you
put these earphones back into your ear
adjust them get them properly seated
it's already been paired now since we're
on the topic of Bluetooth yes I can't
connect to more than one device at a
time yes after testing playing video on
either Android or iPhone where the
YouTuber Netflix I had zero syncing
issues now although I couldn't find if
the power beats Pro uses bluetooth 5.0
or not which is typically used to
signify which version a device uses
Apple States instead on their websites
this uses a class 1 signal instead which
means the earphones should be good up to
150 to 200 linear feet and yes wireless
range and stability it has been great
I've been able to walk my entire
apartment here with several walls in
between and had zero signal loss now I
also couldn't find if beats uses apdex
HD to determine how high of a resolution
audio file it can handle but again I
usually don't mention that in my reviews
as there's been some great headphone /
earphones without that high resolution
designation or so if anything you'll
hear my audio test pretty shortly later
in this video in addition to that chip
we get one of the best battery
performance on any truly wireless
earphones that I've tested fast fuel
just 5 minutes on that charger gives you
back an hour and a half this is the
fastest I've experienced on any pair of
truly wireless earphones that I've
tested here on this channel
not to mention beats claims up to nine
hours of use with the case you're
getting about an additional 15 hours of
use for a total of up to 24 hours most
truly wireless earphones I have tested
they've ranged from 12 hours to 15 hours
give or take an hour for the extremes
but the power beats pros they're class
leading with my testing at 50 percent
volume like all my other truly wireless
earphones I'll have that number on the
screen for you and since we're talking
about the case or maybe you have seen
that
in the background here I know some will
say this case is quite large and it is
but to be fair how else are you going to
have these ear hooks attached to the
earphones themselves I do which the case
itself had more than one light to
indicate battery life
I wish the case featured USBC versus
lightning to have a truly wireless port
for all my devices
I know Apple fans will be upset hearing
that but the iPad pro has USB C there
might be a USB C iPhone coming down the
road so if that's the case no pun
intended here that's future proofing
yourself that would be ideal unless I
don't think there's any other company
doing this just yet but if we can make
this case dust proof in or water proof
that would give me 100% peace of mind
but again that's me being nitpicky right
there and wishing for features at this
point oh and before I forget about this
there is audio pause and play when you
take off your earphones the audio stops
you put them back on and the audio plays
again and this also works for video as
well
seconds you can leave either one of
these earphones out of your ear and the
audio will still play you can have the
other earphone on the other side of the
room if you want and the audio will
still continue this signal is not
dependent on the other earphone like
traditional truly wireless earphones
alright let's get into some of the audio
test right now first up let's test out
the microphone get ready
that is and the audio is completely
unedited
and it's a little bit of breeze only
guys can tell us by here being all crazy
or jacked up right now
but let me know what you guys think down
the video description below there's no
good sound bad to pick it up everything
in the background right now you guys
back in studio looking forward to your
comments take care bye alright and less
folks let's test out this audio every
year the channel Jin's review has been
getting better and better for the first
time trying to improve it for you guys
here I can find let you hear my in-ear
earphone test I've done it for the
headphones I do really well on the
headphone test but the in ears it's
taken me about a year just to get the
calibration to write to get there right
microphones etc etc so please please
show your support by throwing some fire
emojis down in the comment section also
please follow my personal Instagram in
or Twitter the links will be down in
that bit of description for your
convenience just click it and it'll take
you right to there alright folks here we
go please enjoy
and there you have folks as nice and
expensive as my microphones are audio
recorded on my end and then played
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio accuracy it's just a
sample but it is better than nothing but
hence my filing audio review here the
power beats Pro is loud enough for most
people
loud but still comfortable to me is at
about 75 percent volume that 75 percent
vom there is some sound leaking
occurring so those sitting right next to
you in a very quiet room library
whatever can hear what you're listening
to so just be a little bit cautious
about that the ear tips do sit around
the ear canal but they don't sit fully
inside most people will find that more
comfortable but keep in mind that won't
give you the best passive noise
isolation as other truly wireless
earphones and of course a little bit
more sound leaking as well these do let
in some noise as much as it leaks out so
if you're in a busy place you might have
to turn it up to maybe 75 percent volume
to encapsulate yourself here with your
own audio and kind of drone out the
outside noise again that's only if
you're in a very busy environment now
jumping into bass it's deep at loud
volumes its rumbling it feels like I'm
wearing wired earphones at times
considering how deep these actually go
if you like bass no question the power
beats Pro is it the j-bird run ex tees
were the next closest in bass for me but
j-bert offers a punchy variation or more
of a bass boosted audio signature versus
offering deep bass like the power beat
pros now going into the mid-range the
louder you go the more basses experience
that's pretty obvious but I do notice
the mid-range is just ever so slightly
overshadowed by bass most having most
average consumers I think they'll be
fine with this or the
tolerance level is still within reason
for most consumers now if you're more of
a technical audio listener or if you
don't like the bass then you might
prefer something more has more emphasis
on the vocals / mid-range something that
may be a little bit more forward in that
mid-range frequency this is simply a
matter of preference the high
frequencies would never ear in your
tingey in my opinion but if anything
that is clear or lacking actually in
some resolution or detail on the top and
especially that loud volumes at moderate
listening levels it's not a big deal a
little bit more detail a little bit more
Sparkle up top would have been much
better
as for soundstage there isn't much of a
wide soundstage either you get decent
audio separation but nothing huge or
class defining these are great with
hip-hop and EDM most but not all pop
songs will do well those favoring vocals
I would consider these don't get me
wrong but they wouldn't be my absolute
first choice just being upfront about
that these are no question bass ear
truly wireless earphones if you prefer a
pair that's more so for jamming outs
verses technical accuracy the power
beats Pro are recommended to at least
give them a try if you highly value the
better life connectivity the ear hooks
alone comfort instability
I'd go from recommended to highly
recommend it as not many other are
offering the core functionalities at
this level again I think the biggest
thing for you as a consumer you have to
consider if you like Basie audio or not
