review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the game capturing device
by el gato I'll jump straight into the
review i purchased this off of amazon
for 159 dollars the construction as you
can see here pretty generic but it's a
plastic construction with two rubber
strips on the bottom of the device just
to prevent it from slipping and sliding
off your counter top or table there the
exterior color is a beautiful beautiful
black gloss finish although beautiful it
is unfortunately fingerprint prone
though but I'm pretty sure we're not
gonna be touching that device too often
there the connections including hdmi
input in audio video input as well and
the other side of the device is the hdmi
output in USB 2.0 now I used to own this
HD PVR offered by a pog or hot page or
god knows how you pronounce it but it
worked great but the elgato itself
comparing to the PVR is definitely a
step up into today's modern electronics
and I'll get more into that later there
now on my youtube channel I did record
the unboxing of the elgato itself so
check that out if you need to to see
what is inside the box and instructions
for the connections for your specific
device or system as you will see it
comes with all the wires that you need a
component cable that connects to the L
gatos audio video input 1 component / d
terminal cable I guess that's what the
places are three calls it an hdmi cable
and a USB wire as well so it's
definitely nice to see all the wires
come in the box for you without having
the need to purchase additional wires as
you notice there's no power supply the
reason being this device is powered
through the USB 2.0 action which in my
opinion is a huge huge bonus for me just
one less wire and again consumes a
little bit less power I guess you can
say since its power through your pc one
snapshot now the software itself is very
simple the elgato is literally plug and
play there's no need for installation
software or CDs plug it in let the
system give about a minute or so to
recognize it and that's it you're done
after you've connected everything you
can download their capture
software which is free from their
website at wwlp.com / download now their
software is very intuitive which with
features of course for recording your
video to your laptop or desktop however
it does have a live stream capability
where you can stream to sites like the
twitch TV and such another huge bonus is
everything that can be adjusted and fly
either prior to gaming or while gaming
or streaming I can adjust the brightness
in or contrast the valium form a mic for
the live commentary and also the in-game
audio in real time if need be again very
intuitive very simple to use and as you
can see here on my screen I'm just
illustrating showing you as an example
I'm just changing the colors as you can
see in the background you know the
colors contrast is fluctuating now i'm
going to start showing some gameplay
footage pretty soon here and our further
discuss the specs and conclude the
review pretty shortly now the features
include a much smaller form factor it
literally fits in upon my hands i knew
it was small before but i didn't know it
was that small until i got it which is
pretty interesting itself just less
desktop space you can say and your desk
itself less cables and it again it
powers itself through its USB connection
another plus compared to the HD PVR is
its bit rate at 1080 and the resolution
of 1080 the elgato is twice the power of
the HD PVR 2 and about 30 megabytes per
second bit rate vs 4 megabytes per
second bitrate respectively so for most
youtubers though it's not really a big
deal considering youtube will compress
your video down to the 224 may bite
range anyways now however for
professional videographers equality
stays intact a video does not pass
through of them sorry the video does
pass through from your gaming system to
your el gato then to your TV and with
what you can see here there's no loss in
quality or lag as well so now I gotta
admit though I was a bit skeptical at
first utilizing the component / d
terminal input selection because I do
have a ps3 since it was not a door
hdmi connection that was a little bit
skeptical to be honest with you but the
quality is still intact and again the
pastor who worked well works fine now
comparing the image quality to the PVR I
see absolutely no difference you can
check out other reviews on YouTube where
they do a side-by-side comparison
unfortunately I did some my PVR prior to
buying the elgato so I can't do that
personally myself and there's not much
of any change or difference you can say
from the PVR to the alga to itself and
of course I have to show you some videos
of zombie killing here so and
considering you can adjust the contrast
and colours on a fly I'm sure your
videos will never look washed out again
so I don't think that's a big deal there
overall it's such an amazing game device
again capturing device that is as you
can see my videos it's pretty fun to
record your moments in gaming and share
those you know with folks on YouTube
less cables better bitrate consumes less
electricity a smaller form factor on
your desk simple use software to be
after there's so many pros I'll just say
why not so oh another thing here I
forgot to mention I personally have not
tried this myself however i have read
that individuals were able to connect
this device to their cable boxes and
record their own TV shows or movies if
they so desired so it's pretty cool
there so all in all that's about it I'll
just leave the video playing for a bit
here so you can just see zombie killing
in general and my crappy gameplay in
this video clip here it is resident evil
6 and now just having a static moment or
where I did it move this is show you
know what the image quality looks like I
don't want to move around too much here
I did change a little bit of the
contrasting colors so that's why you see
the fluctuation fluctuation of darkness
there so I hope you enjoyed this review
of the game capturing device by el gato
if you have not please take your time to
like in or subscribe to the videos in my
channel for future alerts to new
products the video is playing right now
is the unboxing on the left and how to
connect your PlayStation 3 on the right
so that's it this is Jimmy from Jim's
review room take care of
