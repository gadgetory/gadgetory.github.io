industry and it's shaping to supplement
our lives
smart activity bans wearable fitness
gear that goes beyond just counting your
steps like a pedometer what I'd like to
do is not a review as I traditionally
perform but an outlook on what's they
come in 2014 so sit back and I hope you
enjoy this as this is my first attempt
and reporting on an industry
here's activity bands shaping our lives
pedometers have existed for some time
keeping count of every rhythmic bounce
taken for every step performed but in
2007 James Park and Eric Friedman broke
new ground into an industry that didn't
really exist with their product called
Fitbit it was the first company to
propose a wireless activity tracker to
be worn all day and claimed to track
steps distance calories burned and even
sleep at the time performance comm most
a recent interview with James Park by
Christmas of 2009 just two years after
the company was established when a
product first launched the company had
over 25,000 orders today it has 77% of
the market of full-body activity
trackers Fitbit is one of the pioneers
that created that demand a demand to
understand ourselves better these bands
are typically worn 24/7 that provides
data to track your health and fitness
but I believe even for the non fitness
person it's an insight to view our
habits and behaviors
now imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery and giant audio technology
company jawbone followed suit with their
own tracker in 2011 with the jawbone up
currently it's in its third iteration of
the band with the up 24 released late
2013 enhancements over the years for
companies including jawbone and Fitbit
included food logging flights of stairs
climbed and improved amp for details of
your sleep and your tivity levels now
her NPD consumer market research firm
from January of 2013 to January of 2014
Fitbit accounted for 68% of sales while
jawbone up accounts for 19 and Nike
accounted for 10% of sales all remaining
percentages are from other activity
manufacturers like misfit and polar and
that really brings us to where we are
today the outlook for 2014 is full of
options and the technology behind them
is even more fascinating and advanced
and I'll start with the small companies
first as a January 2014 basis released
what they claimed at the moment to be
the most advanced tracker on the market
measuring your heart rate calories
burned during a specific activity and
not just in general multiple sleep
stages like REM sleep and there's also a
perspiration monitor and skin
temperature reader right under watch
itself now how well does it perform at
the moment I personally don't know but
once I get my hands on this I'll be sure
to review it but that's where the
direction of these bands are heading for
2014 another band that will basically
revolutionize this industry is the move
where it's your personal fitness coach
instead of putting out another wristband
the move is placed on your body
corresponding to your workout it's even
placed on your bike pedal or golf club
as shown on the moves a website the
reason being as simple as it is more
accurate readings than on the wrist for
jet shorten your stride and
while most trekkers read three axis of
movement to measure performance the move
has nine axis sensors per their websites
the move collects your body's position
and data and advises in real-time the
correct posture this has performance
tracking injury prevention for
monitoring 3d motion sensing and it is
waterproof as well
the former Apple engineer that founded
moved started her crowdfunding in hopes
of raising $40,000 and this was
surpassed in just in 90 minutes of
starting because of that move is slated
for release summer of 2014 at least to
its backers and from reports early
adopters are buying two at a time at a
discounted price of $99 Atlas fitness
and amigo are both similar and concepts
yet different in its technology
currently funding has surpassed and sits
over $500,000 for both companies with
Atlas and amigo the analytics can tell
the difference between bicep curls
versus alternating bicep curls because
different exercises burn different
calories both companies focused on
differentiating each activity and
individual performs in the Atlas
promotional video that claims it can
read your posture to ensure you're not
cheating while at the same time showing
the current heart rate on the display
the Atlas tells which style swimming
you're performing and distinguishes what
lap you're on amigo does the same it
also counts type speed and quality of
every movement down to reps and sets
it's that intuitive pre-order is still
currently open at the time of this video
with 189 dollars being the minimum
pre-order cost for the Atlas and as low
in $99 for the amigo in retail of course
will be a little bit higher once these
products are fully released now Atlas
plans are shipped to its backers
December of 2014 and I believe the amigo
is still in its prototype stage so I'm
not sure when the release date is on
that one
now with these small companies mentioned
first there's no question of these tech
giants will try to get a piece of the
pie as well
recently announced at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona Spain Samsung is
releasing the latest wearable tech the
gear fit it'll feature a beautiful Super
AMOLED screen that's focused on health
but also has some SmartWatch features as
well like media control and
notifications from your phone like text
email and incoming calls because it's so
new at the moment the only features
confirm so far are a heartrate and sleep
monitor with a pedometer tracker as well
the band will work in conjunction with s
health which is Samsung's fitness app
currently available on the Galaxy s4
smartphone there's tons of metrics that
can be seen and additional features that
some other tracking software don't even
have for example I'm real big and food
logging and counting protein sugar and
sodium intake is a huge plus for me but
keep in mind the Samsung gear fit comes
to market as more of a lifestyle band
and I would speculate this is not as
deep featured like a move or atlas
mentioned previously where it can
measure your posture and differentiate
your activity as of this video
Samsung has yet to review pricing and
release dates Sony as well entered into
this market for their first time the
Sony focuses on life logging with
activity monitoring as we record your
basics like distance traveled calories
burned how active compared to very
active moments and from what sony claims
this band will differentiate and see if
you've been walking running cycling and
how while you slept but sony focuses on
recording your date automatically though
which includes non sports and non
fitness related movements again think
lifelogging
this will keep note on what games you've
played how much time you spend
socializing with your friends and what
music you've listened to this i'm sure
will not be for the person with a strong
focus on fitness but actually overall
quality of life
and how their days are spent at first
the band didn't have much substance but
the concept is different in painting a
picture of you as an individual now one
example may be not yourself but i'm sure
you know someone who puts on facebook or
twitter which restaurant they're
currently at and basically their meal or
dish they have for that night
tapping this Sony band bookmarks this
life event for you storing your photo
you taken and basically bookmarking it
for retrieval later it'll also store the
restaurant location you're at and also
the friends they were with you that day
and Sony says they're smart band will be
about $135 and released later in March
of 2014
Garmin one of the pioneers of GPS will
be releasing the vivofit counting the
basics like steps calories and distance
will be provided this will also be
waterproof up to 50 meters and having a
one-year battery life and sleep
monitoring capabilities and it being
Garmin I can only anticipate this being
very beneficial for runners again just
speculation but I would assume this to
have GPS tracking and showcase your
distance over a map but more importantly
I'm hoping and anticipating for hardcore
runners this will detail your pace per
mile in detail elevation changes as well
now perfect for those training or just
wanting a bit more detail than just
counting steps in the distance in
general this is being released end of
March of 2014 for the price of one
hundred $29 and
which I do highly recommend though if
you think $170 is a lot it's actually on
par with the polar loop and the basis
price
so it's interesting to see where the
world is heading with connected and
wearable technology it's only a matter
of time until these bands measure our
entire lives holistically from a matter
of health and a matter of our habits and
behaviors of course there'll be more
bands coming out and possibly some I
haven't touched on in this video if I
forgot please comment on them below so
here's to 2014 and what comes ahead this
is Jimmy from Jim's review room up to
your FEMA soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
