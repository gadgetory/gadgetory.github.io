noise-cancelling headphones that I have
here at the studio now there's other
brands out there but you asked the
average consumer about ANSI headphones
these two always come to mind with that
being said I have that individual video
reviews on the channel check those out
for a detailed assessment but today it's
purely just a direct head-to-head
comparison to see who's the best
I personally paid for both of these both
retailing at $350 each as always I
placed my affiliate links down in the
video description below click on those
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time they never
know when these things might go on sale
so I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
first off one of these headphones does
very good while another pair does great
in regards to comfort this Sony's do way
slightly more Wow Bose comes in as one
of the lightest pair of ANSI headphones
that you can currently get on the market
a testing book for several hours each
the clamping force is ever so slightly
less with Bose and they perceived weight
and they crowded the head is not as
noticeable compared to the Sony 1000 X
Mark 2 if you don't have both side by
side like what I have here you'll feel
both as being very reasonable in general
but then on the flip side if you are
swapping them back and forth like I have
been doing so there is a slight
difference that you will be able to
notice now moving down the over ear ear
cups on the boast QC 35 twos are very
airy very open leaving my ears untouched
with the lining on the inside of the ear
cup itself awh 1000x are not bad either
but they're over ear style does press
against the crest on my ear while
wearing never server hours of use this
sony 1000 tech does heat up my ears more
often and on hotter days or in how-to
rooms I would get slight air is what
it's pretty nasty now I'm taking a
closer look at how gorgeous each one of
these headphones are Boyce QC 35s are
plastic with the ear cups be metal and
how do I know these are metal after
testing them in the field I accidentally
dropped them after just three days of
owning them right on the concrete and
you can see the some of the expo is
metal on the sides and you guys know my
OCD is going off right now but with this
sony WHS man these like good very subtle
up top love the exposed aluminum
headband and then going to the ear cup
it's a little bit textured here as a
texture finish that makes these look a
bit more premium at the end of the day
and this is just my personal opinion I
think I like the smaller thinner look of
the bose qc25 twos over the 1000 X's
folks let me know in the comment section
below which headphones looks good to you
and be sure to use those fireboat G's as
well now moving on to the buttons and
function of these headphones the bose
qc25 to have very easy to identify
tactile buttons here on the back pause
plays skip and going back and songs are
all there with these sony 1000x sony
takes it several steps further and
offers highly responsive touch sensitive
controls gently swiping left and right
up and down
performs all the same functions as the
QC 35 s but you also get smart features
like placing hand over the right ear cup
like so
and the music is lowered down to near
mute active noise-cancelling turns off
and ambient we're then turns um here's a
quick demo now looking at bose
unfortunately they don't include that
feature the one last physical button
before if you get here the boys QC third
parties does have a dedicated google
assist button built on the left side of
the ear cup press and hold to get
directions ask questions etc which is
convenient in its own way
but on this Sounion like many other
headsets you can still pull up google
assistance or siri by holding down the
multifunction button if they basically
have the same or similar feature and
give you guys the same results now
getting into these smaller details both
pair of headphones have NFC or near
field communication both headsets have
bluetooth 4.1 with both achieving 58
linear feet of connectivity while sony
had 64 linear feet before the audience
start to crackle when i walked away from
my phone now both headphones also
feature of micro USB ports no USB type-c
just yet for some odd reason and with
those ports bose can't rapid recharge
its headphones for 15 minutes and you
can get back two and a half hours of
playback the sony charges for ten
minutes and you're able to get an hour
and ten minutes so boasts in the end
here provides more value now regarding
actual battery life most claims up to 20
hours of use i was able to achieve 23
hours and 22 minutes of performance
while sony claims to I possibly
industry-leading 30 hours of use and
that's with ANC and just to be clear and
with my test these Sony's achieved 27
hours and 23 minutes so he definitely
wins them better like now both of these
headphones again had a and C on and both
were played at 50% environment from a
full battery to dead now in previous
reviews I know some have asked if the
headphones were still able to function
if the battery died in the end
thankfully both still worked here by
using their supplied audio cables you
don't have a and C or active EQ but the
fact that you can leave these off and if
the battery does run out here both
headphones still provide pretty darn
good on you still able to use them for
those possibly using this for phone
calls both headphones were superb an
audio quality my voice comes across very
clear but sadly the headsets did pick up
a lot of background noise from like cars
driving by people
talking etc finally do we get to the
bread and butter here the active
noise-cancelling performance I'm jumping
straight into this no fancy editing and
such be sure to put on your own
earphones or headphones as I'll be using
behind ural microphones to capture 3d
audio it's a pretty cool experience be

to bring you this level of detail it
would mean the world to me thank you
better you 100%
connecting to Jimmy's iPhone
our oh whoa our on
Bluetooth connected everything but it
blocked up most could get really active
noise-cancelling headphones
look
now with both headphones no question
these two are the best on the market at
least for the $350 price range
now taking these things repeatedly on
and off I notice they both QC 35 twos or
blacoh a lot but Sony have refined their
active noise-cancelling and it clearly
shows with the old models they were
nearly neck-and-neck but with the new
ones here in this video the SUNY can
clearly be heard blocking out more noise
now touching base on the audio test I
will admit I've always liked you boys QC
35 I love the post QC provides for a
long time including the newest model
here I would almost consider them as
being bass boosted it's punchy fast
distortion free yet not overpowering
other frequencies and surely not
underpowered either the poses is like a
jack-of-all-trades and I felt did well
regardless of what genre that I threw at
it if you go with these Sony WH 1000 X's
bass is slightly deeper more resonating
warmer also helping to emphasize John
Rizzo pop hip hop in certain EDM so I
know this is a comparison video by a
recently tested B Beats Studio 3s this
Sony's are not as bassy but thankfully a
lot cleaner you can say across the audio
spectrum now if you're on the fence
about bass think of both being very well
rounded and Sony's still well-rounded
but an emphasis on those channels that I
mentioned earlier now as for the mid
this is where both sounds absolutely
phenomenal the most QC 35s offers some
of the best audio resolution and detail
of any headphones on the market it's
full balance and articulate and if
you're big on singers and vocalist
singers voices does draw you in and get
you hooked when you have this going at
about 75 to 80% vine pretty loud the
compared to these Sony's I don't know if
Sony did retune or adjust their audio
signature this time around but it does
sound better in my personal opinion the
vocals are slightly more forward and at
times brighter than the Bose here and
because the Saudis are a little bit of a
seer the mid-range sounds to have more
body and warmth yet not muddled and
muddy the Sony's also have a high level
of detail resolution to its audio as
well
now both headphones are airy and offers
a good bit of soundstage but these
Sony's once again was ever so slightly
wider here and having a bit more depth
you can say letting you be able to hear
left and right audio separation of
course but it's surely audio in the
forefront and also a bit
back as for the high notes Bose sounded
great but these Sony's did sound they
have a bit more brilliance and crisp
I'd be very high-end now every beat
reached a higher peak in higher
frequency before they became too sharp
or become distorted or worse even ear
ting II didn't get that with these sony
1000 x's so in the end here
I love the Bose QC 35 twos and they've
been one of my favorite lineup of NC
headphones for a very long time ever
since the wired QC 25 s also had
experience with the QC 15s if you guys
remember that far back now if you are to
go in Bose you're not getting a bad pair
of headphones
not even close I still highly recommend
him if anything I still prefer the QC 35
just for the comfort alone but on the
flip side the audio was better on the
Sony's the active noise-cancelling was
proved to be better on the newest model
and last this was more of a bonus to me
were all be high tech features that are
built into the whe 1000 X last but not
least and I should have mentioned this
earlier Android 8.0 was support L deck
which is the highest resolution of
wireless audio they can get at the
moment and this feature was only
available on Sony Xperia phones in the
past now since these Sony headphones are
Eldad compatible as long as you have the
latest Android you can take advantage of
this so alright folks this video was
long as heck here a lot of effort and
testing went into this so please help
support my channel by liking subscribing
and sharing this video to someone on the
fence of making that purchase decision
out of Jimmy with Jim's review guys take
care and I will see you on the next one
