video I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
and here are the best speakers so far
that I've tested on the channel for this
year I'll break them down into different
categories as every speaker will be a
little bit different for your taste
there simply isn't one speaker to rule
them all it has always been transparent
none of these speakers are sponsoring
this video all products in this video
are ones that I've conducted a full
review on so if you want to see an
in-depth look please check out those
links in the video description and last
but not least my affiliate links are
also in that video description click on
those for the most updated prices in
real time you never know when these
things might go on sale now first up
let's talk about the best budget please
with speaker so this year there's been a
number of brands budget brands that have
been testing from anchor to amaze to
trivet etc some of these speakers look
like total knockoffs of the big brands
at times but the one that has been
consistent with a quality product and
the one that provides the closest audio
quality to the big names out there has
been dass more specifically the models
the boss sandbox sandbox pro in the
sandbox XL this is possibly the best
value if you simply just need audio and
the prices range from $30 for the
smallest one to the biggest speaker
which comes in at around $70 again my
links are down in that video description
for the most updated prices now
authoring comes with splash resistance
and the better life goes from good to
pretty decent and besides these sound
box Pro which does come with LED lights
and the ability to pair to those
speakers together at the same time the
other speakers really just nothing
special and I'll be frank about that if
you're looking for a budget speaker and
are afraid of raspy sounds maybe the
plastic feels cheap near the battery
doesn't last as long through my testing
the DAW speakers are made with metal
grills and if there are plastics they
don't feel cheap or hollow which is very
important now when I tested the
batteries the batteries do last up to
what they claim they claim 12 hours 12
hours and 10 hours for the biggest
speaker now when I tested this against
big-name brands out there it don't sound
exactly like them they don't have that
little magical touch that make the
big-name brands
shine in their own way but
can say the dose sounds closed again
some people just need wireless audio and
the honestly don't need the rest so why
bother paying for more well let's move
on through the next one here number four
so number four it's the smallest
bluetooth speaker that you get in
regards to audio quality and size it's
the bose micro now although the you you
wonder boom was on my list so was the
sony XP 10 even the JBL clip three now
all those were good in its own way but
the micro if you can get it for $80 or
cheaper check my links in the video
description the bose provided the best
audio signature while retaining its
ruggedness this is IP 7 certified which
means it can be dunked into water but
being transparent the only thing I would
caution though and sadly doesn't float
so don't drop this into the poor
especially that Lake but you get voice
prompts that tells you which device
you're connected to a strap on the back
felt much more versatile compared to the
competitors the competitors have a
smaller latch or a new ease case it was
just simply a loop the micro was all
around much more practical and
functionality and that's one of the
biggest reasons why it was on my list
now better life and the funny thing both
even amidst this on their website is
somewhat short at 6 hours when I
personally tested this at 50% volume I
did however achieve 14 hours worth of
use that's insane so at the end of the
day if you're looking for size with the
least amount of compromises and the
audio I'm telling you they both micro is
be solid choice alright moving on to
number three so what about best audio at
home one that you leave plugged into
your wall but still have Bluetooth
capabilities now with these type of
speakers they usually sound much better
and more full since they're bigger and
because they have a continuous supply of
power instead of having this speaker
built around battery efficiency I'm
giving this to the Harman Kardon onyx
studio for now the five was released but
it wasn't as impactful on audio and I
think 99% of my male audience said it
looked like a purse so that was kind of
shot down pretty quick here but yes the
Onyx to do four hands down get that if
you're on the fence it's rich sounding
and very full when I tested this against
my Sony X between an DJ
extreme the clarity is still there and
it's great but it also confirmed the
base on the attics studio for was much
deeper thumping make me mad my head a
little bit more with the music that I'm
listening to the studio for does have a
built-in battery it's only rated at 8
hours and with my personal testing I
only achieved 6 hours and 20 minutes
that's the best but keep in mind this is
more so to be used with its wall adapter
last but not least it's probably the
price I've seen these as low as $135 or
so but I think they're usually averaging
150 it's a great deal again my updated
prices in the video description so the
runner-up was perfect for rock music
classical and more instrumental tracks
that goes to the Marshall speakers and
they're pretty damn unique check them
out just want to give them a quick shout
out there as well as they deserve some
praise all right folks let's get into
number 2 so who has the best 360-degree
audio it's the Bose Soundlink revolve
plus the smaller evolve for some reason
that maximum vomit got quite raspy and
distorted but the Plus model there's a
nun getting the bigger one you're going
to get room filling music plus a very
deep resonating bass experience for a
360 degree speaker you places anywhere
in the room in the center of the room
and wherever you walk there's no dead
spots make this great for entertaining
now with the revolve plus you get some
drop resistance and a speaker that's
splash proof if you want something
absolutely rugged or waterproof in
general for the pool or for strapping it
onto an ATV and getting mud all over it
I will look into fugu Yui and maybe even
some of the braathens speakers for
rugged speakers that is but keep in mind
you do lose a little bit of audio
quality on those for the revolve plus
battery life is rated at 16 hours this
has voice prompts for a battery life and
connected devices the revolve plus also
has stereo and party mode available for
you to pair two of these speakers at the
same time folks this is the best
360-degrees speaker on the market from
my personal testing so alright folks
here goes number one now with everything
I've been testing and it doesn't matter
if it's new or old
for some reason JBL kills it this is
hands-down the best overall audio
experience from the JBL foot for which I
have right here to the charge for to the
extreme to when these speakers were
refreshed more specifically the charge
for in the extreme to their audio
signature didn't change too much and if
you own any of the older models I'm talk
about the charge 3mb extreme one I've
said it in the review and I'll say it
here again I'd rather have you save your
money towards your Lambo or whatever it
is rather than upgrading to basically
the same thing again and I thought the
competition was going to destroy these
older speakers or Eve the new speakers a
charge for in the extreme to because
shoot they've been out for a while the
audio signature is the same basically
and these other brands keep coming out
with new models every single year so
when I tested other speakers to compare
it's crazy to say JBL still sounds the
best and I know I was a big fan of Sony
here I love the xB 20 X B 30 X B 40 and
if you can still find those I highly
recommend buying those for the audio
signature but the newer xB 21 31 and 41
there's just so much bass that makes the
mid-range recessed I want Sony to sound
great but considering they didn't even
make it on my list this year sucks
JBL wins in the audio category for best
sounding portable Bluetooth speaker and
the other competitor is the LG X boom PK
3 PK v PK 7 they looked great but the
audio doesn't beat out JBL so the flip
for the extreme 2 has the most features
like the speakerphone option you able to
change that play button to enable voice
assistance like Google assistant and
Siri and with those two speakers they're
going to flip for the extreme 2 plus T
charge for there's this thing called JBL
connect plus meaning you can pair over a
hundred these speakers if you have them
mix and match if you want and have them
all play at the same time they're not to
mention just only charged for and just
on the extreme to you're able to use
those two speakers like a power bank and
plug them into your phone empower them
hopefully I didn't confuse you just yet
it has a word of caution again looking
out for you guys the JBL charge for ally
gets rid of the speakerphone option you
can't go back on a song but you can only
skip forward with those physical buttons
and at least at the time of this video
Google is
in Siri does not work it's not an option
to select within its app that's up to
you if you use any of those features
that are missing if you need those
features definitely look out for the
charge 3 if those are still available
now if you can forego that you're
getting you're still getting a
waterproof speaker that is able to flow
you're getting decent battery life
you're getting portability and most
important of all you're getting the best
audio quality compared to the
competition with no frills no gimmicks
just good audio now when I compared this
that JBL speakers are the only ones that
gives you some sort of depth or
dimension it doesn't sound just like
audio is just blaring at you but that
soundstage is ever so slightly better
than the others being a little bit wider
having audio separation that somewhat
distinguishes the background and
foreground for you guys not to mention
the punchy bass hits the nail on the
head for a portable Bluetooth speaker
it's not deep not droning yet not too
light either the voices are also very
bright still slightly forward for you
guys and on all three speakers flip for
a charge for an extreme two I never had
any kind of ear piercing listening
fatigue experience overall
if you're on the market for just playing
good audio a playing good speaker that's
mostly ruggedized JBL is the way to go
all right folks hopefully you enjoyed
this video please let me know which
speaker is right for you
be sure to follow me on my personal
social media accounts at jimmy loom
official and if you want all that techie
stuff follow jim's review room alright
guys I'll catch you guys on the next one
