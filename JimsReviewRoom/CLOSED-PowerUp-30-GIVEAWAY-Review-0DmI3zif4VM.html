review room now do you remember when
you're a kid and you used to make paper
airplanes I was admitted making them
from typical paper airplanes and the
slowly introducing flaps and then
winglets and then moving on to gliders
and so on seriously and genuinely I
loved making them so I personally
reached out to power up toys calm which
makes a lightweight motor that attaches
to paper airplane templates and then the
plane is actually controlled through
your smartphone the powerup 3.0 is
another awesome and successful
Kickstarter campaign that I'm looking at
today raising over 1.2 million dollars
to have this idea come to life and they
were nice enough to provide me with two
units one to give away which I'll
provide directions later in this video
and the other one to test retailing at
$49.99 we'll see how well this nostalgic
yet modern-day toy works so without
further adieu we'll get started
now what you get in the box is five
diagrams or templates to create a paper
airplane with a USB charging cord and
most surprisingly a charge Bank is also
included this holds 1200 ml amps worth
of power so when you're out at the park
let's say and when your airplane dies
you can recharge it right then and there
there's no need to run home and recharge
it again and you can use the power bank
to slightly charge up your cellphone as
well if you ever need some juice
yourself a spare rudder and propeller is
also supplied and last is the powerup
3.0 itself and the user guides which is
a must-read now the power of 3.0 is a
simple design but simplicity is always a
trait of success I believe but looking
carefully at this you can tell many
hours and careful thought has been put
into this there's a very soft and rubber
bumper and affronts that absorb impacts
clips to it attach this to your paper
airplane transparent window where you
can see the Bluetooth receiver and
battery pack inside and contrary to
belief from just photos this is actually
a carbon fiber frame it's not plastic
and last is the motor for your propeller
and rudder and going straight into the
field-testing charging the unit takes
approximately 20 minutes to fill up and
while doing so I highly recommend
reading the instruction manual there are
steps in there that you do have to take
to ensure a great flying experience or
claim so in the manual it wasn't as
simple as creating my own airplane you
can say and just attaching this and
flying to illustrate the template as I'm
using here is different from your
standard paper airplane for the lack of
a better word the upper deck is folded
at an angle instead of a traditional
airplane where it's really a straight
line the cutting and pulling these
elevators up is a necessity since the
airplane will be somewhat front heavy
again in general it's not difficult as
long as you follow the instructions but
I want to illustrate that you can't just
install this on any paper airplane that
you've made at home now after throwing
this in the air without the motor to
ensure it glides smoothly then you can
go out for your first official test run
now I've downloaded the app which I
confirmed works on both Apple and
Android power devices and with Android
you do need at least version 4.3 and I'm
just showing you this on my iPad since
it's a bigger screen for me to record
off of but overall the app is very
responsive and even just slightly
tilting your device does change the
rudders position
you can also control the throttle to
help me to plane go higher or lower by
tapping anywhere on the bottom of the
application and there's estimates and
indications and how strong the Bluetooth
signal is and the battery remaining as
well and I knew after several initial
attempts this might not stay afloat but
I would need to fine-tune it and sure
enough I had to do it on the very first
try second try and the many many tries
after that I would basically try it
again fine-tune the plane try it again
and again and again and rest assured I
read the instruction manual several
times and everything seemed appropriate
I allotted more time on this than
initially thought and tested this in
three different parts in the span of
several days in different wind or lack
of wind conditions
I even tried this on my day off on the
side of my house and in the end this
left me unfortunately quite frustrated I
honestly thought there was something
wrong that I was doing and I've seen the
power of toys flying other reviews now
the power of 2.0 and Amazon received 3
out of 5 stars where people didn't
mention it didn't work as originally
thought and it had taken much more
effort basically to fly for those who
were successful in their attempts but
those who weren't able to fly it it
looks like they had a blast though and I
can imagine so as well the product does
work as proved online and no question
it's fun when it does work the idea is
great it has a nostalgia factor but
after my experience a toy shouldn't be
this hard to get up and go though so if
you want to test out the product
yourself you can go to power of toys
calm or you can enter this giveaway and
maybe you'll be the lucky one to give
this a try here's the giveaway rules
