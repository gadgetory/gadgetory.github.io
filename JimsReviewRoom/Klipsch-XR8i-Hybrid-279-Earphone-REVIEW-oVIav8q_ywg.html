room clips just released their reference
x-series of earphones as for earphones
in total with each giving their own
unique sound signature the model that I
chose here is a hybrid and offering both
a physical miniature subwoofer and an
armature or high performance tweeter
built in it's offering both base and
clear audio at the same time but of
course we'll see how they sound in the
audio test now prices are on your screen
with the XR 8i coming in at two hundred
and seventy nine dollars retail and as
of this video and I'll place a link in
the video description so you can check
what the most updated prices are today
so without further adieu I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room and my channel is here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
going over the physical features first
the housing on these are a die cast zinc
with a brushed metal look and the rear
edit is slightly contoured for your
thumb here to press these into your ear
canal and it is textured to feel like a
stiffened solid piece of rubber of our
construction has been top notch that's
been withstanding me throwing these into
my bag here and taking some abuse on a
daily basis
there's no Nick's or marks that I've
noticed regarding the wires this is
really unique as the cord is transparent
exposing the copper wire for its
positive connections with a twist of
black for the negative the wires in
general or tangle resistant it does a
decent job of being so but I notice the
wires being a bit stiffer than most
other ear phones that I've used so
they're not as free-flowing as I had
expected not an issue on my end but is
something that I noticed the inline
controller is very well done offering
more range or motion with each press
compared to any other earphones that
have tested in the past and also keep in
mind the model that I have here is made
for Apple products I didn't see clips
offering an Android version so only
pause and play works on my LG and Nexus
phones but tapping volume didn't do
anything at all last moving down to the
end here there's a straight 3.5
millimeter plug
moving on to ear tips five are offered
in total from clips each are in an oval
shape for a more natural fit the entire
X series including the XR 8 is that I
have here does go in ear and the 2
flange designs worked best for me the
air phones in general blocked out a lot
of ambient noise and with music on
blocks out nearly everything in my
environment regarding comfort they do
stay in the air well but you do need to
wear these very snug the earphones
aren't necessarily heavy but because
these are the hybrid models I felt as
though these stuck out ever so slightly
and if it's not a snug fit the earphones
would slowly lose that sound isolation
and fall out however went in when in
snugly here again these were perfectly
fine for me and during testing I would
wear them for about 2 to 3 hours
straight and had no issues at all the
very last item before speaking about the
sound test there is an ear tip holder
with a clothing clip that you've seen
already and a carrying case which I was
completely shocked here that they
offered a case like this and certainly
these are nearly $300 pair of earphones
now I was hoping a more rigid case with
a zipper that we traditionally see or
worst case scenario a pouch to toss
these in and move on about your day
but getting into more positive territory
let's talk about the audio test the
x-ray eyes definitely gets a lot enough
for most people
Clifton does deliver on their promise of
bass though it's tight controlled and
sounds natural and mat bass boosted on
the other side those who aren't looking
for a deep sub bass they won't find it
here though now if you're looking for a
balanced sound signature that offers
punchy bass but doesn't overdo it by
spilling into the mid-range these are
particularly for you the mid-range is
clear and does offer dimension that not
bright nor underwhelming yet in general
these are very balanced sound stages
appearance with recognition of audio
from left and right audio channels and
Ford and rear as well indeed I was
hoping for just a little bit more at
this price range nonetheless a
soundstage is still very well done in my
opinion regarding highs never did I have
listening fatigue even listening at high
bands for a good bit of time I
personally didn't notice roll-off in
turn I didn't notice any sharp highs or
ear piercing screeches now I would say
if you're into either rock pop EDM
especially and some general hip-hop
definitely take these into consideration
for its fidelity and balance now if
you're a bass head I would say look
elsewhere overall these are a really
really good pair of earphones and it's a
pleasure to listen with so that's it for
