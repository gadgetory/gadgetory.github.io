review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the Iron Gym pull-up bar
found at your local Target for $30 we'll
look into the pull-up bars construction
and style specifications and features
and lastly my pros and cons on its
performance and usage and lastly I do
have to advise I'm not a fitness guru or
claim to be a buff toned or jac guy at
all I might have had bad posture or form
in the video but please be advised I'm
just the average consumer looking for a
good product in use and to keep healthy
in the review is focused on the product
itself so without further ado let's get
started here the exterior color is grey
and black constructed with steel tubing
and rubber mounts the handles do have a
decent mount of foam on them the unit
comes unassembled and comes with the
screws nuts and washers to put together
the assembly was easy and took me about
10 maybe 15 minutes the most the
exterior features offers closed wide and
neutral grip positions this pull-up bar
is securely held by the door frame and
does not require any drilling or
screwing this unit fits standard door
frames from 24 inches wide to 32 inches
wide and lastly the products F weighs in
about 12 pounds so let me get start with
the pros and cons here the pros simply
flat out it works it's easy to use it
fits appropriately and I feel safe and
secure on it and use this pull-up bar
for over a year now haven't had any
issues with this construction
I can easily dismount this and place it
in hiding or move it to a different room
in seconds the foam groups have lasted
and haven't flaked or torn on me and you
can perform an assortment assortment of
pull-ups you can have your hands face
your body and you can do that you know
standard pull-up to working your biceps
you can turn your hand with the other
way around face your hand the opposite
way and work on your forearms and lats
as well I hold myself up sometimes and
do leg lifts to work out my legs my abs
or my core muscle groups now I'm I don't
but you can also place this on the
ground and do push-ups and dips off of
the elevated bars so that's a good
variety of new suits regarding to cons
now for some reason they leave these
black marks on my doorframe and above my
door as well now I that's why in the
video see black electrical
tape or what appears to be black tape
wrapped around the two ends or they have
the phone and also also on the back side
where it's pressing against the wall as
well it's black electrical tape which
did help but for some reason it still
caused these black scuff marks
it might not pur appear right away but
using this pull-up bar several times
over several months on the same
doorframe it'll show I've tried this on
two different doors and both doors have
these black marks now I personally weigh
in at a feather weight of 160 pounds it
supports me well and I never lost
confidence in the product and again I
had this over for over a year now so I
do have some experience on it now my
brother he's 180 pounds had him come
over to the house and had him try it and
I can see the middle of the bar been
somewhat I was I'll probably a little
bit worried it didn't look too stable I
held him he did his pull-up - did you
know eight to ten of them or so but I
think over time the ball to the screws
will eventually wear from all that flex
and the metal tubing may disconnect
causing injury and again I'm 160 / 160
pounds it's no problem
180 pounds throw caution as I've
personally seen this bar Bend under
stress just a little bit but again over
time and maybe of a concern so is this a
buy try or don't buy at all I'd say it's
worth to buy it's a great workout tons
of versatility for only $30 and if you
buy a set of dumbbells it's probably
cost you at least $30 depending how much
weight you buy so I'd say if you're
concerned about the support or the
weight load consider a beefier pull-up
bar of course it's going to be more
expensive or considering purchasing this
and trying it out yourself and of course
as you know target usually has a great
return policy with little to no fuss at
all if the bar doesn't work out for you
so give it a shot
but again best bang for your buck and I
hope this review and all my reviews
helped you making decisions like these
so I hope you enjoyed this review of the
Iron Gym pull-up bar from Target for $30
