room I'm jumping right into this own as
I've been waiting as long as you have to
test and review these I have the best of
the best active noise-cancelling
headphones sent over from Beno the h8i
and the h9 I now this one is an out of
your word method and this one is the
over here wearing method this comes in
at 399 and this one comes in at 499
dollars as of this video so they're both
pretty premium prices as always in be
transparent be noted send these over for
review but watch my entire video for
both pros and cons my affiliate links
will be down in that video description
below click on those links for the most
updated prices in real time they never
know one of these things actually might
go on sale
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review now you can be the judge on how
these look in the comment section down
below let me know what you guys think
the Danish has always impressed me with
their design and these are up there with
other modern and minimalist styles
now there's cowhide leather up top with
frayed edge and to give these a little
bit of character these solid brushed
aluminum arm gives the headphones much
classier and not to mention the
retractable arms smoothly slides in and
out here with such an elegant feel
now the ear cups are plastic with the
closed back front facing areas made of
aluminum and on the over your h9 model
that I have in my hands they have touch
controls while the h i h8 eyes that is
does not know more on that a little bit
later but touching base on build quality
my trying to break these but just to
hear any kind of chatter or creaks
listening for errors that are loose or
so both the h8 eyes and nine eyes are
filled with absolutes high quality
detail and craftsmanship now going over
comfort on paper the idear h8 eyes are
the lightest pair of ANSI headphones
I've tested the h8 eyes felt great from
my experience now those who prefer an
all-encompassing fully and close over
your style
the h9 eyes were money they are not
- on paper compared to the competition
but the weight distribution these subtle
clamping force along the jawline here
the headband design never gave me any
kind of wearing fatigue even when
wearing these for several hours straight
at the office while testing music both
headphones never felt bothersome now
before going over the controls I got a
mention here the removable ear pads
unlike most other ear pads that needs to
be stretched and pulled to remove you
just base a twist these off and they are
easily replaceable they're the best that
I felt on any pair of headphones baby
lambskin against your face feels ever so
subtle smooth and soft here now these
things are plush and if focusing on the
little details these ear pads adds that
finishing touch on the overall build
looks and comfort they were on the best
again now moving on to controls going
over the h8i first power button is in
the middle falling down turns on and off
active noise-cancelling and pushing up
here activates transparency mode now
transparency mode stops your music and
pumps in your environmental noises so
you can hear what's around you without
taking off your headphones now for the
h8 eyes this is the most disappointing
feature and aspect of the headphones yes
I'm able to hear my environment but the
feature does not allow me to hear my
environments and music at the same time
and if I ever were to activate
transparency mode I have to go to the
right ear cup or my phone here and press
play to resume my music turning off
transparency mode does not reactivate
the song I had previously play now
getting back to the physical features
the left ear cup has it three and a half
millimeter port for physical connections
and last I'm very glad to see Beano
placing a USB type-c port for charging
now looking at the h9 eyes physical
controls or on and off and pairing USB C
and a 3.5 millimeter ports to control
the features there's a touch sensitive
Aaron that is common on most high-end
headphones these days swiping up and
down toggles here transparency mode
thankfully music does resume on this
model unlike the h8 eyes but you can't
have transparency mode and music going
on at the same time
swiping forward and back skips and goes
back on your music swiping down turns
of ANC and last you can spin your finger
around the air cup to adjust volume now
some features simply missing that are on
other competitors here there's no voice
prompts for when ANC is on or off
there's no voice prompts indicating
battery level and no indication whenever
reached maximum by method spinning this
thing infinitely basically pairing is
indicated by a simple beep voice prompts
I think we're absolutely key now moving
on Bluetooth connection is version 4.2 I
was able to achieve 92 linear feet and
102 feet and the h8i and the h 9i
respectively regarding better life we
did the same test that we perform on all
over ANC headphones basically 50% Vaughn
with a and C on the h8 I claims up to 30
hours of use we got 33 hours and found
there was still another 50% battery
remaining the AJ ice it seems to last
forever now as for the h9 eyes Beano are
climbing only up to 18 hours we ended up
with 21 hours and 30 minutes until the
battery officially died on those the
last but at least phone call tests were
extremely clear hear my voice felt to be
very much amplified extremely well while
reducing a good bit of my surroundings
which is a very typical other high-end
headphones these are really performing
great the only thing that it really
picked up that the other person the
other end noticed was wind noises on a
breezy day but that's most headphones
for you so right now getting into
something that I've been waiting for
let's get into the active
noise-cancelling performance but one
thing I wanted to point out these did
have a moderate amount of air cabin
pressure feeling when I first put them
on some of those some people with
sensitive ears might feel that but over
time it did go away after several hours
for me personally with my experience
they removed as much environmental noise
practically identical to my Bose QC 35
twos but up against my Sony WH 1000 X's
which are currently the leader of all
the headphones and she had one to have
tested so far the Sony's did slightly do
better now next up is my audio test here
we go
these are bye-bye neuro microphones
hopefully you can hear that
other side here it's not my fingers for
proof and the headphones are going here
goes the h8 eyes from you know
you want me to Rahila forget you all I
know it can't be done I'm only asking
once would you let me take a little bit
I might just be surprised where it gets
you
all right folks so both headphones do
get loud here I'm able to listen
comfortably at about 70 to 80 percent
volume starting with bass Pinot is very
clean here with zero distortion slightly
above neutral base with a slight punch
on certain songs it's very similar again
to the boast QC 35 twos and compared to
these Sony WH 1000 X's Sony has a little
bit more bass provide slightly little
bit more resonance but the Sony does
slightly sound recessed in the mid-range
an emphasis on slight it's very minimal
but there is a difference
now either or the abidos will sound good
across all genres here of music and if
you want a little more bass simply use
an equaliser the h8 eyes and h9 eyes
sounds crystal clear high resolution and
offers high fidelity with offering not
necessarily a bright audio signature but
surely enough in the forefront to make
them stand out and for you to hear all
the detail you can distinctly hear audio
on the sides in front of you behind you
et cetera
you can perceive a different height in
your audio and quality audio files this
is where I noticed a slight difference
between the on ear versus over here the
h8 eyes did not offer as a lot of a
soundstage though as the h9 eyes but
nonetheless the ant ears they're still
one of the best for ANSI headphones
while still giving you clear and
accurate audio from my experience in
regards to audio quality as a whole now
lastly high frequencies I noticed and
some songs were able to hit higher it
just ever so slightly beyond the verge
of becoming sharp over the competitors
both binos never gave me listen to
fatigue though and never had any of
those ear screeching or ear piercing
moments now as for an app experience the
B note app is quite sparse here there's
some presets and modifications the
tuning is called tone touch and it
functions as an equalizer for your
headsets you choose a quadrant from for
sound profiles warm relaxed excited a
bright and the sound is altered to fit
those moods the 2d was ok but the
headphones I'll be honest with you were
too great right out of the box in my
personal opinion other than that sound
presets in better life there's not much
more that the app can do so that's it

take care and I'll see
you and the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
