extreme for a very very long time I was
maybe expecting something more rugged
better battery life maybe refined audio
but better yet maybe they would add in
some LED lights shout out to the JBL
pulse but what I recently ordered is a
complete surprise this is the JBL
boombox and this thing is huge
I personally paid for this at the retail
price of four hundred and forty nine
dollars very expensive indeed but what's
offered might be justified as always
I'll place my affiliate links in the
video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices as of today you never
know when these things like the one sale
I'm Jimmy with jims review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
all right folks so let me show you my
JBL extreme first just for comparison
purposes and remember this was huge last
year now take a look at this this is the
new boombox reminiscent of the boom
boxes back in the day with a sturdy
handle on the top the weight comes in at
11 and 1/2 pounds or five and a quarter
kilograms for my international fans out
there and if you can't lift up a 10
pound dumbbell and find this heavy man
up as the speaker is all about being
rugged from the turbo fabric mesh grill
that's on all the JBL speakers these
days to the ipx7 rating meaning that you
can drop this and submerge this into
water up to three point three feet and
up to thirty minutes with my testing
because my bucket at the office was too
small that tosses into the nearest and
nastiest water fountain I could find
nearby my hands are okay also the
speaker is still functioning fine I'm
also glad to see that the speaker floats
now bring this back into the office and
contaminating my black table here
the passive base radiators on the side
are exposed like all JBL speakers
although not recommended to be pressed
on I press them in anyways all the way
in here and the rubber surround doesn't
tear up or rip hopefully they hold up
fine over time now for those who are new
to JBL although rugged fabric goes all
the way around there are no speakers on
the rear and I don't think the trend of
folks carrying the boombox and their
shoulders will ever return maybe well
who knows but considering how big this
is considering foogoo you Ian the newer
Bose revolved plus has 360 degree audio
that would have been great here that's
what we're lacking on the boombox
looking at the very top the buns are on
your screen pretty straightforward very
clicky and satisfying to press the
biggest and most notable feature is the
JBL connect plus feature if you're
looking to fill up large rooms and I've
had viewers and fans on the channel here
ask about filling up conference rooms
birthday parties and such if you're able
to for two of these you can pair them
together and have them play in stereo
with the Kinect plus feature you can
pair over a hundred of these speakers
and have them all play in sync if you
would like now one big benefit you can
mix and match with other kinect plus
products as a quick illustration here's
two of my JBL pulse 3s on either side
and the JBL boombox
now going back to the buttons on the far
right you have the option to change this
to answer phone calls which works well
but captured all my background noise
unfortunately option 2 through the JBL
app you can change this to activate
Google assistance or Siri by holding it
down as a side note going into 2018
we'll start seeing more speakers with
Google and Alexa built in so instead of
pressing a button we can physically say
the command and have it worked be on the
lookout for that I have two speakers
already at the office under embargo
that's releasing soon with this feature
and last on the front at the very bottom
there's a battery level indicator lights
and although they do justice I think
it's time for JBL to move them up to the
top for better visibility it's kind of
hard to see down there quickly touching
base on Bluetooth JBL utilized bluetooth
4.2 which is still very good these days
considering this is the boombox meant to
be used in large open areas attest the
blue to the range and was able to
achieve 90 linear feet outdoors with my
Samsung si+ rotating to the rear there's
a water sealed flap that offers a
three-and-a-half millimeter input for
physical connections not one but two
charged out ports here so you can charge
two devices at the same time just like a
power bank and to the right is a wall
adapter to leave plugged in for jamming
sessions now if you're on a boat or at
the beach with no outlets JBL is
climbing up to 24 hours of playback time
with my testing playing at 50% Bob to
get a middle the road result for you
guys I was able to achieve 20 hours in
46 minutes now one thing I want to point
out after 12 hours of use out of the
five white LEDs on the bottom I only had
one remaining thinking it was going to
die soon but it didn't it lasted close
to another nine hours now the very last
one I want to show you there's an indoor
and outdoor mode this is completely new
here either one offers a different audio
profile meant to sound better in the
environment that you're in of course
I'll demonstrate this for you
so first up here please put on your
headphones or earphones as I'll be using
binaural microphones as always be sure
to LIKE and subscribe to help support my
content much gratitude to those who
helped make these videos and tests
possible
and there you have it folks holy freak
doesn't sound crazy I'm going to try my
best to break my audio analysis down for
you guys there's four categories there's
indoor performance outdoor performance
and testing these at moderate volume at
last it's high volume they'll keep that
in mind
so starting with how loud these can get
the boombox makes the JBL charge three
and extreme sound like small medium
sized speakers respectively in general
yes this will fill up large open areas
and those catering to events family
gatherings at the park birthday parties
for sure on the boats at the beach this
can handle it
now indoors I'll admit it is a bit
overkill but if you value bass and can
shell out that 450 dollars this who
rattled the house bass is super
predominant on the boom box especially
indoors here this is the type of bass
that if you go downstairs you can still
hear the sub bass beating and pounding
through the walls and moderate levels of
volume I'll be honest with you guys I
love the audio signature every beat is
emphasized and specific genres like EDM
pop and hip-hop stands out that much
more this speaker gets you in the mood
to littering Jim out now hands down the
boom box is a crazy good experience now
if you are entertaining and pushing vine
close to maximum the bass does somewhat
unfortunately get distorted the clarity
and depth is somewhat lost for a louder
experience now again that's indoors now
going outdoors and more so for
entertaining having music in the
background when you're standing further
away and working on something let's say
in the distance you don't notice the
issue that much
if anything being outdoors the base
somewhat goes away despite how busy it
was initially indoors either or the
still out performance practically every
speaker I've tested on the channel so
far in regards to loudness and bass
since we're speaking about the outdoor
performance once you tie with a button
on the rear and switch it to the outdoor
profile
I mostly notice the mid-range and higher
frequencies becoming slightly more
forward and pronounced it is slight but
it does help nonetheless I went ahead
and measured my distance to help you
engage what you need for your situation
at 50 percent vom audio was enjoyable up
to 50 feet from the speaker beyond 50
feet it's still audible of course but
it's simply not as loud or as present in
your ears now bump is up to a hundred
percent vibe and it's enjoyable up to a
hundred and forty linear feet which is
very very impressive now jumping into
the mid-range frequencies we're talking
about vocal performance where most
instruments are heard by the human ear
in the area of course where if there's
bad audio most people can distinguish it
from my experience the boombox sounded
great at moderate bombs with clarity and
detail vocal performance are pushed
forward enough to make them stand out
and appreciate it again once you start
pushing vibe up based us somewhat
distort the mid-range a bit here but if
you're intending on using this outdoors
standing further away does help standing
further away does give the speaker a
chance to disperse its audio this is
common among entertaining and loud
speakers in general now the higher tones
from instruments like cymbal crashes
snare drums some of the fast paced EDM
music does get jumbled and sadly a
little raspy at those higher volume
levels now very similar to the mid-range
frequencies if you stand further away it
does help but listening to this within
say a 10-foot radius or so at loud
volumes you're going to hear the quality
dissipate that medium volume indoors
though I very much like the audio
quality and the boombox accompany the
other frequencies bands very well so
overall this speaker is loud it's in
your face it can get the job done for
those large events and outdoor areas now
that's where I see the most value now
for those who are using this indoors
don't get it wrong it sounds great
if you have the money the boom box is
outrageous for a Bluetooth speaker but
as I stated earlier it might be a bit
overkill the boombox indeed had some new
features but it wasn't much to sway
decision and the
physical front in my opinion for indoor
users you're paying essentially for how
loud and how bassy that this thing can
get which has some value though you make
the call let me know in the comment
section down below so that's it folks be
sure to support my work by liking
subbing and following you guys take care
and I'll see you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
