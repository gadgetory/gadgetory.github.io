review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the Allen Sports trunk
mount 2-bike rack model 102 DB well look
into the bike racks construction and
style specifications and features and
lastly my pros and cons on its
performance and usage so glad to get
this review out here I was meant to do
it two weeks ago but the entire
northeast two weeks ago was just having
a bunch of rain and even some spots snow
in the middle or late April but I
finally got about to go out to the
trails this past weekend on Sunday and
was able to get this tested so let's get
started here I purchased this bike rack
from amazon.com for 37 dollars and 75
cents about two months ago and finally
mounted this this past weekend check
Amazon for the current pricing when I
did the unboxing the price went up to
about I think $50 or so and I just
checked it today which is May 1st 2012
and surprisingly it's for $34 so it's
always jumping up and down this
continually check on it the construction
itself it's aluminum tubing a beliefe
and it's in black certain areas are
protected with a black vinyl or rubber
end caps as well
it carries two bikes and designed to fit
most vehicles and you can check out
their website
Allen sports usa.com to find the
compatibility list on there for your
make and model of your vehicle some
exterior features it does have fabric
tie-downs which I found worked out
pretty well the fabric tie-downs are
found to clamp to the upper part of the
trunk mount and as well as the bike
rests as well there's foam cushions that
are used to support the rack when
resting on the vehicle which I found was
ample enough and a very soft and
cushiony the products itself weighs
about 8.6 pounds so I usually start off
with the pros but I want to start off
with the cans this time well in general
the product yes it does work just get
that out the way it does work but the
number one issue that I have or had with
this product was just having peace of
mind
this probably just personal opinion but
with any bike rack while in transport
the bike does bounce a little bit you
know when it's on the road you know the
wind kind of shakes it a little bit
especially when you're in the highway
but just looking at his construction you
can see how small this bike rack is and
look at the upper mount that touched the
trunk and then the bottom arm that
touches my rear bumper and you can see
the distance the expansion is not as
wide as I would like or as you would see
with other bike racks again it did carry
my bike however I have to admit I was a
little bit nervous like I said once I
was on the highway a second flaw is the
first bike support that is closest to
the trunk the first mount that is close
to trunk it's too close and the other
bike racks that I've looked at I've
noticed now that the mount is a little
bit further away from the resting point
of where the arm pivots I'll most likely
draw a circle on the video here for you
it's a little bit too close and in turn
the the bike frame the wheels they have
more of a potential chance to rub
against the bumper and just cause
damages to your vehicle I also made it a
little bit harder to mount because the
bike does hit the other supports so a
little bit tough there now when you do
put your bike on be sure to tie your
front wheel to your bike's frame so the
front handlebars don't wobble while in
transit going to the trails is fine
after I tied it down but on my way back
I assumed that it wasn't tight enough
and I did scratch my rear bumper
unfortunately but to be honest that's
more of user error and just a tip for
any bike rack that you eventually may
choose though another tip in general
weather this it's this bike rack or
another tie down the pedal I noticed on
the highway you know when you're
traveling you know 60 70 miles an hour
the wind blows the rear wheel will
actually start spinning backwards and in
turn will cause the pedals to spin
backwards as well and while it was
spinning
spreading quite fast it could you know
one jolt one bump could cause that pedal
just to land right on top of the bumper
and cause it scratch so fortunately
didn't have that issue but again tie the
pedal to the frame of the bike to the
rear wheel or I don't maybe to the frame
of the bike rack itself so that way the
pedal doesn't spin freely as with most
bike racks it does fit most cars but it
almost didn't fit the the bike my track
is a standard mountain buy again if you
have like a specialized bike the brand
specialized the frame is a bit more
unique and you might not be able to fit
it on the rack and same with female
bikes I read other reviews if you do
have a female bike where the
construction is a little bit different
you may need to buy an adapter to have
that fitted because of its horizontal
bar that is different from the male
bikes it may not fit but again this does
apply to most bike racks so it's not a
flaw of just this one bike rack I just
need to make sure that's clear I regard
the pros again it works and it did
transport my bike for over an hour and I
was on the highway at the speed limit 65
I was doing 65 to 70 miles an hour the
straps are fabric and I believe this
will hold better than most of the other
plastic or rubber mounts that will
eventually crack and dry over time and
you may see on other bike racks the
metal place didn't scratch my car where
it was clipped to the trunk lid I moved
them side-to-side and I did take the
risk out myself however it did leave
black marks and the paint and I did I
thought those were to scratch though
they excuse me I thought those were
scratches but I rubbed them with a
little bit of water my hands and my
fingers and I came right off so thank
goodness that my trunk was not scratched
from those mountains but as long as the
straps are tight the plates shouldn't
move I would highly suggest probably
wrapping the metal plates with black
electrical tape to prevent any movement
that may potentially scratch a car at
least I'm going to do that on my end
on that that's it for the pros and cons
so is this a buy is it a try or does it
not buy at all
I truly believe it's worth a try and
especially if you're planning to buy a
cheaper bike rack compared to the others
at either your local Walmart or even on
amazon.com between 35 to 45 dollars or
so our reviewed items before in general
not just bike racks but other products
that are cheaper and lower priced and I
mean they worked out great so this is in
the Middle where I'm a bit worried
because of its small construction but I
read a lot of reviews where people have
driven across several states drove
several hours and had no problems at all
and they were fine with it
so again for me it's me personally it's
my opinion it's for peace of mind and it
works as it should and I like the straps
on that it does what it needs to do
me personally I might spend an
additional whopping $80 I guess just in
case and just get the bones bike rack
the clearance and those are very good in
the supporting arms looks very well
placed tons of clearance and that just
give me the peace of mind that my bike
won't fly off in the highway or if I
have to make a sudden jolt you know left
you know when I'm turning left or right
if I have to make like a sudden move the
bike rack isn't gonna you know I don't
know twitch too much as it should the
more than it should I guess so I hope
this helps you out here like I said it's
more on my personal preference you can
take it as your discretion mmm give it a
try Walmart you can try if you're not
satisfied with it you can always return
it but this is my review so I hope you

trunk mount 2-bike rack model 102 DB and
