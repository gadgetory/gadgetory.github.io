last few years but after the most recent
Google assistant demonstration they're
becoming a bit more practical to the
average consumer I'm talking about
multi-tiered commands and actions not to
mention more products around the
household compatible with voice a same
company that made tic watch a pretty
impressive SmartWatch maker early in the
year released their first ever
voice-activated speaker called the tick
home many they sent over reviewing it to
test but as always being transparent
with you our assessment was not altered
in any way please watch the entire video
for both pros and cons so take home any
retails for $100 making this one of the
less expensive options for a Google
assistant speaker as always I'll be
placing my affiliate links in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things bike on sale so folks I'm
Jimmy with jims review room and we're
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over the physical features the
body is cell a plastic with a rubber
like coating on top and the bottom is a
friction pad that prevents these speaker
from sliding off the table and then
there's one overlooked but very simple
feature it's the attached leather strap
because the speaker is IP x-6 certified
this can take on water jet sprays so
with that leather strap you can hang
this on your shower head and have a
audio going on in the morning so just
imagine how easy it is to walk to the
bathroom and ask for the time they ask
how the traffic is to work at that very
moment that is or have a speaker play
the news whether in or your podcast at
the morning now one could take the
leather strap does feel somewhat cheap
as it feels dry and not supple at all
now some ideas on why the portability is
ideal you can pull up recipes for food
while you're in the kitchen and let's
say you want to go into the living room
you can bring your tick home there and
use it to pull up YouTube videos Netflix
etc and last as an example again and
bring these same speaker into your
bedroom and if you hear the doorbell
ringing maybe downstairs ask Google
assistant to play the live video feed of
your homes nest game or logic amp
security cameras to see who's there no
side note obviously I'm not filming at
my house here but for those who want a
quick demonstration I'm doing this of
course in my studio also the benefit of
portability alleviates the need to buy
several speakers now looking closely at
the buns I'll have a photo of them on
your screen here the tikka watch does
include NFC called tap connect tap your
phone on the upper left side of the
speaker and it easily pairs with your
device now rotating to the rear I'm
noticing there is no three-and-a-half
millimeter port for physical connections
the only port in the rear is microUSB
for charging battery life is rated at up
to six hours of use that's it committee
and with my test to play music from full
to dead at 50% volume it gave me four
hours and 50 minutes worth of use now
keep in mind this is not a dedicated
Bluetooth speaker so a better life does
seem low but the tick home was meant to
be an around the house kind of product
now Bluetooth 4.0 is available on take
home and testing to range I'm getting
about 53 linear feet before the audio
starts to crackle here testing the
microphone and the tick home I was able
to stand up to 35 feet away speak in a
normal sometimes slightly elevated voice
and is still able to pick up my voice
commands now when you do have music play
modern vibes the microphones do have
somewhat of a hard time differentiating
your voice from the music or podcasts
and this is somewhat common though I
noticed this also on my Amazon echo now
jumping into audio performance the tick
hole mini provides 360 degree audio
sound which is great Tikhon mini fires
down words offering audio to bounce back
up here from the table and this method
does help to provide a bit more bass
versus have any more direct performance
and I'll play several quick samples for
you guys please put on your headphones
or earphones to get the best audio
experience
and there you have it folks audio
recorded on my end and then played
through your speakers or not the best
depiction of audio quality but it's my
review here and take home it does get
loud enough for personal listening and
it works great in a small room keep in
mind how small these things are these
provide more background like music from
medium to large sized areas you're not
necessarily feeling like you're gonna
jam out or dance in private while you're
in an open living room now with that
being said and playing at low to medium
volume bass did not overpower the mids
or high ranges and perform without
distortion because of how small the
speaker is bass is enough for casual
listening and nothing bumping or
thumping you can say to really get you
flowing now turning these speaker up to
higher volumes there was Distortion
notice on the upper levels where the
bass and mid-range frequencies would
overlap now in the mid-range they take
home any provided enough support for
vocals and provided good ambience in the
background for a casual listening
experience heading into the higher end
of the audio spectrum the high
frequencies that is the tickle mini was
a bit high pitch that louder volumes at
medium vomits the speaker performed well
for its speaker size now I wish there
was slightly more detail on the top end
but considering how small the speaker is
again it's perfect for casual use now
coming in at $99 the eat at home mini is
a reliable Bluetooth speaker any
fantastic voice assistant for a small
spacious it provided a very good audio
experience however it does struggle at
the higher volumes necessary in larger
rooms the fact that I can place it to
come in E in any room that I need Google
assistance be at the kitchen the bedroom
the garage I could see the allure of
going with a more portable option and
not needing to buy additional speakers
you can be the judge on your situation
so that's it folks that's the tick home
mini review hopefully it helped you in
some way as always like comment and
share you guys take care and I'll see
you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
