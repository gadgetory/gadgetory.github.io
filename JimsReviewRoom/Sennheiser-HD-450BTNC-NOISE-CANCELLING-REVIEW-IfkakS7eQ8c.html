room itesm Sennheiser's traveling pair
of headphones the PXE size 50s several
months back and they feature the same
active noise canceling technology in
this pair of headphones that I'm
reviewing today these are these
Sennheiser's 4.50
bt n Z's that said has it sent over for
review and I'm just going to call them
before 50s in this video for simplicity
sake but the biggest reason why I'm
interested in this pair it for goes some
of the extra features that some may not
want or need and because of that it's
50% cheaper than their flagship again
the PXE 550's yeah it's also cheaper
than some of the competitors out there
so of course we'll see if the sound is
good at all or if the active
noise-cancelling will perform as good as
the competition out there
as always I'll place my Amazon affiliate
links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time so
without further ado my channels here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review of the
physical features first the headphones
are all plastic and not cheap feeling
plastic either they are well-made they
don't rattle or feel finicky they've
been a confident product to test now to
admit I wish the inner band itself where
it does adjust with metal or at least
where the hinges are or metal as well
for peace of mind and long-term
durability of course only time will tell
the headband up top is very thin without
too much padding but I'm discussing my
comfort in detail later but going over
the ear cups they do fold in for stowing
and fits neatly into the provided
carrying case there's no structural
protection it's not rigid which is fine
for most people but surely it does
protect from scratches nicks and bumps
when you do throw them into your bag now
getting back to the ear cups again
looking at the controls the right ear
cup has your power on and off a very
smooth multifunction switches right
below that that allows you to skip and
go back on your music that same button
is also used to answer phone calls as
well and when testing this in public my
voice does come across clear however
light to moderate
background noises are still picked up by
the person on the other end continue
with the physical buttons a vine rocker
is next and if you press up and down at
the same time this turns on or off
the active noise-cancelling when you're
using these headphones wirelessly a tune
F millimeter port is offered for
physical connections not a three and a
half millimeters and just be aware of
that and fan Howser does provide a
locking wired cord so you can't
accidentally yank this out of the
headphones which is great last a
microUSB port is offered to charge a
headphones battery life is claimed to be
up to 25 hours on the retail box but
that would agency off with a and T on
Sennheiser is expecting 19 hours worth
of use now i also attempted to connect
these to my pcs at home both of them
here and maybe this is just me but both
times they do charge my headphones I
didn't see any drivers being installed
or any option to offer music playback
through USB which would have been a
seriously great feature you'll also
having them connected via bluetooth of
course to my phone here and attempting
to plug them into my laptop to charge my
listen to them once the USB plug goes in
the headphones unfortunately turns off
you can't listen to them and charge them
at the same time now the only other
feature that is included with the 450s
is NFC or near field communication for
streamlined pairing with your NFC device
just simply hold it on the NFC logo and
the Bluetooth connection establishes now
regarding signal strength Bluetooth
technology to be honest with you is
really great these days with all devices
with the 450s I can walk upstairs
walk anywhere and basically in my house
and the connection never cuts out and at
the connection goes through several
walls and at times these first floor
ceiling now moving on to comfort one day
of testing or the first day of testing I
did feel as though they clamped too
tight at the jawline and wears batik did
somewhat set in it wasn't until day two
and day three and um that's when I felt
more activated with the headphones and
then I could wear them for extended
periods of time and wouldn't have an
issue at all
now the weight on these are quite
impressive coming in nearly identical to
the PXE 550's and my very comfortable
both QC 35 and because of how
lightweight they are many will
9450 to be a good level of comfort
though those with a bit more of a
sensitive head the clamping force that
we draw line is a bit more firm than the
competition and I mentioned earlier
about that thin headband up top I do
notice I slight way down at the crown of
the head after wearing these for again
extended periods of time now jumping
into the active noise-cancelling
performance I went back into the city
and Tesla's outdoors every local coffee
shop essentially Starbucks and various
other environments while I was there the
active noise-cancelling performs
practically identical to the PXE 550's
which again are sennheiser flagship anc
headphones and just like the PXE 550
you don't get much if any of that air
cabin pressure feeling when you turn on
the AMC unlikely both QC 35 release only
1000 acts and those with more sensitive
ears - of course value that over the
competition and with that being said I
felt indeed the 450 did block out a
decent amount of noise but same with the
PXE 550's voices around the coffee-shop
the background music in the same coffee
shop or slightly silenced and the
flagship headphones did do better but if
you're comparing prices apples apples
the Sennheiser 450
then blackout as much noise as the JBL
Everest elite 700 and appearance big
headphones just to name some competitors
out there last but not least jumping
into audio performance Sennheiser
provides very balanced audio
characteristics accurate and clean is
what you're going to get with these now
base is neutral and not altered or bass
boosted the mids are equal with other
frequencies and not being bright or
recessed either however I do wish there
was a bit more resolution or detail in
the mid-range though to get a more
vibrant experience you can say but for
most average consumers
I am confident you guys will surely be
fine the highs does have roll-off and it
plays it quite safe but because it
doesn't come anywhere close to being
tinny and sharp which is good the 450s
are very easy to listen to
there's no listening fatigue whatsoever
now those who are not big unnatural or
neutral sound characteristics may find
them not as colorful as they would have
light it's simply a matter of preference
now I do wish they were a bit louder
though as I can listen to these at full
volume for some songs and other tracks
I'm usually around 80 85 even at times
nine percent volume levels now the sound
stage is there and it is moderate
be open you can hear some audio in
different directions but it did perform
more of a mid tier mid-level experience
so as we're sound looking at higher
bottoms these do slightly leak and it is
audible in very quiet environments
so overall the 450s at its current price
point I believe they are good they are
cheaper than a lot of the competitors
out there now granted there's no extra
bells and whistles like touch controls
and being on and sound profiles and
being upfront
JBL average lead 700 and pair of Zeke's
to name a few that I'm familiar with for
a few dollars more yes you can get those
extra features on them but honestly if
you don't need them why spend the extra
money the 450s already gives you clean
and accurate audio great battery life
and equivalent noise canceling
performance as they - recently mentioned
competitors if you're in this price
range if you're concerned about money
seriously look into the Sennheiser 450 s
