review room now I edit a lot of video
throughout the day as you can imagine
and my video editor Adobe Premiere saves
my work automatically every 10 minutes
like many other programs like Microsoft
Word and whatnot and indeed you can
change the autosave feature to save in
every five minutes or every 15 minutes
it's really up to you but within my
personal 10 minutes I could have made
crucial fine adjustments to my work and
if the power goes out
I don't recall those exact changes of
course and all is lost so that's where
these UPS systems comes in handy and I
provides uninterrupted power through a
charged battery in addition offering
surge suppression as well and I know for
some people they rarely - never lose
power in their home but I'll mitt it
really does come in handy in those
unsuspecting moments now I personally
bought mine for $169 and now go into
these specifics on why I chose this
particular model as this will for sure
help you pick the right one - not all
UPS systems are created the same so
without further ado welcome guys to
jim's review room I'll try not to be too
technical here as my channel does focus
on the average consumer but I was very
close to buying an APC branded system in
this price range when the power goes out
APC offers a certain type of power
output from the battery in their lower
end and even their pearl models called
step approximated sine wave typically
less expensive consumer UPS systems
produce simulated sine wave outputs that
steps up and down rather than having a
smooth sine wave output now what the
CyberPower model I have here produces is
a pure sine wave with power factor
correction now that's a lot of jargon
there but what this all means to you is
with new and modern-day PCs they're
using much more efficient power supply
units in their computers and then use
again power factor Corrections and if
the back of battery does not support
this you may encounter humming or
buzzing noises from the computer or a
worst case scenario the battery won't be
able to keep your computer on when it
switches over to battery mode now I have
seen in cases here where the UPS system
cycles down and restart itself causing
your computer to turn off altogether and
I'm not targeting a PC but many other
backup solutions offers the steps sine
wave as well so just be careful when
you're on the market looking now all
right here so enough with electrical
engineering 101 looking at my units and
finally rotating to the rear here you
can see just like most UPS systems
there's battery and surge protection
outlets and the left here and only surge
protection on the right 10 outlets in
total with coaxial and phone ports being
protected and the USB in serial
connections our communication ports to
work with the supplied software now
these ports are not meant for your
printer and such and now returning to
the front again and scrolling through
the on-screen information first to be
displayed is the voltage coming in from
your wall which is this standard 120
volts here in the United States now as a
side note this does not take in 220 or
240 volts as seen in some other
countries overseas next is what the
voltage output powering your devices are
which should be the same and after that
is the frequency now moving on to the
following screen details the total
wattage consumed in real time by all of
your devices
connected and as you can see on screen
I'm drawing about 200 watts on a normal
basis with 300 watts when the computer
is under load now think of this as a
wattage meter which comes in handy to
determine if you're drawing too much
power or not
now my specific cyber power model
produces 810 watts of power which is
more than what my computer generates
under maximum load and not to mention I
have not one but two monitors a cell
phone any lamp connected to this backup
power supply to give you an idea of my
power consumption now the next piece of
information displayed are the actual
voltage amps and its percentages to
follow on the next screen now the last
three here are critical the unit informs
how much battery we have left on the
system and of course mine is fully
charged at 100% next is how many minutes
I have left before the battery dies
while I'm running my current setup and
for me 20 minutes seems appropriate to
save my work close out any and all
documents here and shut down my computer
properly and last how many events have
occurred with this unit and just to
finish the front panel here there are
two USB ports rated at 1 amps each
enough to power your smart phones at a
normal rate for tablets and more
demanding devices they'll still charge
normally but it may take a little bit
longer to do so
two amps would have been better suited
and after receiving a response from my
email to CyberPower
they disclose the two USB ports in the
front are only charging ports they're
not protected and just for testing and
demonstration purposes here's my
computer at full load and yanking the
power cord from the wall and you'll hear
that audible alarm each time you lose
power and the alarm can be silenced at
your choosing and I'm sure that you saw
my lamp did turn off because it's
plugged into the surge protection side
only now and a battery backup side on
the back of the UPS but as you can see
the computer and the monitor didn't even
flinch or make any changes from
traditional wall power to battery power
I'm very impressed by that now the only
thing that I saw changed was the timer
on the UPS before the power interruption
it was calculated at 20 minutes as you
seen earlier in the video now as soon as
I lost power it dropped to about 15 or
16 minutes worth of juice not
detrimental but something that you
be aware about no one on battery mode
there's a very minuttes very small fan
that kicks on just to keep things
running cool and it's not loud at all
and from my testing the unit never
became hot or unsafe in my opinion now
everything performed as it should
nothing went wrong with my computer
which is my biggest investment here and
it did what it performed or advertised
to do now the only gripe that dropped to
fifteen or sixteen minutes here from
twenty minutes was a slight shock but
I'm glad I tested this and now I know
what my quote-unquote window time is and
I wish the USB ports on the front were a
bit more powerful for the tablets and
such and did also provide protection as
well and the biggest gripe I have here
is the power cord is only five feet from
the back it's too short from my personal
needs but a PC comes with a 6 foot cord
which isn't too much of a difference but
at the end of the day everything
mentioned are really not issues or
anything wrong with the device but more
wants for a future product so hope this
video helped you in some way if you like
my work add me gyms review room answer
Facebook Twitter Instagram or Google+ as
I normally post updates on items I'm
currently testing before I put them on
the website
again this is Jimmy wood Jim's review
room you guys take care and I'll see you
on the next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
