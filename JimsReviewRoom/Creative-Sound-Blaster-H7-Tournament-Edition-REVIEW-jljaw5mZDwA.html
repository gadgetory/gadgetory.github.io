room last year I tested on the channel
some gaming related peripherals and also
showed you guys my computer build as
well those videos did pretty well here
so for 2017 I'm going to go ahead full
steam and review more PC and console
related peripherals to help you guys
make that purchase decision be sure to
comment down below what you guys want to
see and help keep me in the loop here it
doesn't have to be gaming related so
today we're looking at the new creative
h7 tournament edition headset for
PlayStation 4 Xbox one Xbox 360 and of
course the PC as always being
transparent with you guys
creative did send me this review units
but retail you can get one yourself for
just one hundred and nineteen dollars as
always I'll leave my links in the video
description below as you never know when
these a kid go a little bit cheaper here
click on my Amazon affiliate links and
they'll give you the most updated prices
in real time so without further ado
welcome everyone to Jim's review room
going over the physical build creative
throw there's a quote new sleek look but
in my opinion that much physically has
changed the same premium look and feel
the brushed aluminum on the side arms
and ear cups are still here the air cup
themselves are still plastic and we have
that same padding of the headband as
before there's no crazy durable and at
times feels more solid and something
competitors out there but really the
biggest difference at least
aesthetically the durable wires are not
red which gives off a nice pop of color
and the end creative went with if it's
not broken why fix it kind of mentality
now we're getting into comfort mode
headsets I've tried are usually quite
heavy and it's always odd to me gaming
headsets rarely if ever published the
weight of their headsets online compared
to other flagships these are not bad at
all
now while wearing like the h5 the h7 are
lightweight for a pair of gaming headset
and wearing these for about three hours
straight
they produce very little wearing fatigue
for me there's very minimal pressure on
the crown of my head and the jaw line
clamping force was very minimal as well
during this time my ears do warm up like
most other headsets but nothing to the
point where it's sweating and
uncomfortable getting back to the
headset and looking closer the ear pads
are easily detachable just in case the
full-leather ever starts to flake off or
so your cable connection looks to be
detachable but it's not here moving down
there is an inline volume control here
for pause play and answering phone calls
if you connect this to your phone that
volume scroll wheel is nearby with some
good resistance here so you don't
accidentally adjust volume and on the
front is simply the mute button to
toggle on or off and the very end
creative offers you to connect this two
ways here via USB or the
three-and-a-half millimeter chord then
last but not least before talking about
the audio performance we start seeing
where the upgrades are really made the
mic has been upgraded here no longer do
you get that unsightly foam piece at the
end and they mic performance at least
compared to other flagship headsets do
sound to offer very similar yes good
performance now moving on to sound
creative states that they've also
upgraded these 50 millimeter drivers
these are focused as competitive
headsets with virtual 7.1 surround sound
so using this right out of the box as if
you're using this on Xbox or Playstation
the spatial sound is quite good you can
hear a moderate amount of spatial
awareness
competitive edge however when I did test
these against my HyperX cloud revolvers
I didn't hear my surroundings more so on
those verses the h7 tournament edition
it's not a drastic difference but a
difference nonetheless as for a bass it
is a flatter signature and I wish there
was a way to increase the immersion of
it with a deeper rumbling during
explosion crashes etc and the mid-range
is simply perfect for hearing the voice
acting and narrating the trees blowing
through the winds and many other ambient
noises are very much distinguishable
within this frequency but the high notes
thankfully are not pinging and ear
ringing and was more controlled versus
the Sound Blaster h5 s now sound leaking
is kept minimal and because these are
closed back headsets you do get good
passive noise isolation to blackout your
surrounding environment so overall just
speaking about counsel use only if I
compare this to other headsets around
this price range other headset did offer
slightly better audio performance all
around there's more bass more spacial
awareness a little bit more clarity as
well and I'm not saying that h7r bad at
all there's still great but with my test
there's better out there but what I do
switch gears and jump onto my PC you
have access to their blaster ex acoustic
engine pro software and with the help of
that Wow these headsets finally do shine
they offer a lot of control over base a
lot of control over clarity down to the
amount of surround sound that you want
bass then does Rumble with the tune of
their equalizer ambient noises are much
more distinguishable when you do have
their proprietary Scout mode on I'm
hearing how clear these are they do
absolutely great short does provide a
competitive advantage now in the
beginning though tuning can be harsh at
times but fine-tuning them to the way
that you like it
the h7 tournament additions will then
sound great to you now compared to the
competition the h7 for PC is worthy
better than my much beloved HyperX cloud
revolver headsets I'm the super premium
and a do admit the sound on the $200
Logitech Artemis 933 do some more refine
and offer some more natural sounding
surround sound experience but then those
things are heavy as heck compared to
these I would say if you're in this
price range for councils get the HyperX
and those
and we're better but if you're on PC and
around this price range it's hard to
beat the comfort and audio performance
you get with the h7 sternum Edition
simply there's tons of value so that's
it for this review here I hope you
