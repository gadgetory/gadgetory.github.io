Jimmy with Jim's review room I've been
holding off on getting a 4k TV for a
while but considering I have this
awesome computer that can run 4k games
and it might be purchasing the Xbox one
X for Christmas I think it's finally
time first off thank you guys for
supporting me all these years because of
you I finally got a sponsor to help make
this studio even more badass the folks
at haizen sponsored this video and sent
over this massive 65-inch 4k HDR TV to
show you guys this thing is massive for
my assessment the spec shows they're
offering some high-end specs but at a
much cheaper price I'll place the links
down below and links also the Hisense if
you want more information
now taking a look at this thing the
quality on the front and the sides looks
well-crafted
brushed aluminum metal surround the
entire units and looking directly in the
front the TV has decent sized bezels for
the average consumer the TV is wall
mountable or if you're a tabletop kind
of person the metal feet on the bottom
of the TV is quite sturdy looking at the
rear of the h9 plus it comes with four
HDMI ports you could be to judge offense
enough for you but all the connections
are available such as components and AV
cables as for audio there's an optical
and 3.5 millimeter jack nearby and lasts
for data connections if you don't use
Wireless there's a LAN port and USB
before connecting a flash drive or SD
card reader if you want now I'm turning
on the television here and looking at
the menus it's quite intuitive and
simple to use it's very easy to navigate
to pressing the home button on the
controller brings up a horizontal
scrolling menu allowing you to quickly
switch between features like your apps
live TV and the input menu everything is
huge and from the remote navigating
through their Smart TV platform give you
services like YouTube Netflix and Amazon
videos and although there's no
chromecast built-in you can still browse
YouTube and Netflix content on your
smart phone and have it cast into your
TV so right before jumping into the
display this really stood out to me the
built-in speakers / loud as heck and
just a fine level of 20 the ht9 plus
fills up medium-sized rooms very easily
and the audio quality remains intact not
getting raspy or distorting for speakers
on a TV which I'm usually against if you
don't have a sound bar or tower speakers
the HM plus was surely good if not it
did take me by surprise I'm gonna play a
quick audio sample again put on your
headphones and earphones for the best
audio experience plus my parents were
like super rich so it's like well I get
a job right yeah just keep using their
money right all right folks now taking a
look at this massive 65 inch display no
question the 4k resolution helps
tremendously this also has a built-in 4k
UPS Keller
so lower resolution images can be up
converted to look better on this TV I
have a 4k Netflix account and it looks
amazing
watching YouTube in 4k looks so pro
nowadays and not too
engine gaming in 4k for the first time
was a whole new experience for me and on
a 65-inch man
everything looks crazy sharp the high
sense provides what they call ultra LED
it's a combination of wide color gamut
and high dynamic range similar to what
other flagship TVs have today now
throwing in some very colorful content
I've been shocked the colors pop without
going overboard and I admittedly watched
GoPro videos as a form of inspiration
for their cinematography for their
angles to use of color to simply evoking
emotion and watching the latest 4k
videos wow they look clean as heck just
take a look at this that a smooth motion
rate is quite impressive here and
offered a smooth and consistent
experience considering its 4k and how
big the TV is I was afraid that fast
paced games the TV wouldn't be able to
keep up causing screen tearing or some
nasty framerate stutters and such now
testing this on the latest Forza 7 with
my new steering wheel this is an
immersive experience maybe giving some
people motion sickness if you guys look
or set a little too close to the TV
but I'll seriousness throwing on several
more games for you guys like FIFA 2
playing overall just for fun nothing
competitive the TV never gave me second
guesses or having noticed if there were
any issues overall very very much
enjoyable and last but not least one of
the biggest issues with low-end TVs are
its black levels when watching movies
you get screen bleeding blooming and
blacks that doesn't look like blacks at
all but a very very dark gray but a
closer you get to true blacks colors
next to it tends to pop and offers a
higher contrast ratio for the HD 9 plus
this is not an OLED TV but the blacks
are still very good as you can see on
your screen for movie watching for
Netflix watching etc so that's it folks
for today's overview as always be sure
to like and subscribe and comment down
below what you guys think again thank
you very much for this opportunity more
videos
surely to come you guys take care I will
see you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
