hope you guys are doing good road to 100
of course I didn't check the number this
morning but I think I looked at it
yesterday I'm about 79 thousand
subscribers out of a hundred thousand so
far so thank you very much
welcome to the newcomers if you guys
watched my last vlog I told you guys I
was gonna show you my computer back
there and I just need to do a dust thing
I didn't do it in the last video because
it was raining outside but here's my
chance and I'm sorry for screwing things
so much I've been inside all day I was
inside all day yesterday - trying to get
that Samsung Tab s2 tablet review up for
you guys so I've been I don't know I've
been a vampire for for like the last day
and a half two days but it's not even
sunny right now at least the sun's
behind the clouds parking gets sunny
real sunny later on but uh I'll show you
what the computer looks like I haven't
really looked at it deeply so I don't
know how dirty it is so don't judge me I
usually blow it out every six months or
so so you guys should do the same
alright guys I know I usually cater to
the average consumer review Channel I'm
gonna list off some specs here so I know
it might get a little too technical what
I have here this system is about four
years old it's it's ancient in computer
years I guess you can say it usually I
switch out my computer's every five
years that's when it starts to have some
hiccups and some issues and whatnot but
underneath that coolermaster heatsink
thats aftermarket it's a I seven core
processor it's the model 2600 Kay but
that i7 processor that thing is still a
darn beast when I compared the
performance against the hospital
processors of 2015 I believe the
hospital processors compare comparing to
another i7 processor it was only about
maybe a 15% increase in speed I was
expecting a little bit more but it
didn't warrant for me to replace the
entire system and whatnot but let me
show you guys what I think is the best
investment ever made
hopefully the lighting picks up here if
they Samsung pro SSD and I got a 512
gigabyte model this runs basically my
operating system all the programs so it
launches it really quick and whatnot the
best investment ever did much faster
than these old school platter hard
drives that take some time to spool up
and spin down here it's a terabyte each
their Western Digital blue models so
really economy models going over here we
got 16 gigabytes of ddr3 RAM nothing too
special those were from Corsair power
supply units and this is newer
it's a corsair 6 600 watt model and if
you guys have been following me for a
while on social media i posted photos
when i bought this and there's about
maybe a year ago so maybe your and a
half i bought this and then i bought a
new graphics card and this is actually
not the new one either this is actually
very old long story short i am still
using an ancient PCI 2.0 Express video
card it's a Nvidia if I can remember
here at 9800 gtx+ I believe it
what it is and this is why I want to
show you my computer yes it is all this
crap but you guys see the videos that I
produce you don't need a super duper
crazy system to produce the videos that
that that I do and not even the video is
today but if you even go back a year ago
my videos even look that great but this
is the same system that did my ugly old
videos to compare to my good looking
videos today it's still the same system
that's practically it that's one I
really wants to show you guys wireless
card in the back I mean the guy saw the
antenna sticking out back here Wireless
and is not in wireless AC my router
upstairs is a wireless AC but haven't
upgraded to to the AC standard as of yet
so that's about it here this is an
old-school cooler master case only one
person has mentioned it so far that have
seen this this case I had this I bought
this after college and that was probably
that was 2005 so this case is about 10
years old completely aluminium 100% all
aluminium there's no flippin vents
except I guess for the top part there
but it is old-school look at that
there's no there's no filtration either
so that's why it accumulates a lot a lot
of dust over time and and that's about
it keep it as simple man keeping it
basic it's about using the tools that
you got and just using it efficiently
that's all I can say but on that let's
go to the next clip here and I'm gonna
answer some of your questions that you
guys submitted last time hey guys
you don't almost forgot freaking
unboxing time freaking I'm so out of my
element I'm not in the car that's why
but I got the questions here but that
let's unbox what's in this one here is
gonna be most likely the next item to
review right if you guys follow me on
social media you guys prior uh heard
that I was gonna get this anyways but
these are the brand new sound link twos
from Bose and they look almost identical
to the bose qc25 s but I'm pretty sure
there's no nose cancelling on these but
they are wireless which is the beacon
behind the convenience behind that and
if I remember I believe these are two
hundred and seventy nine dollars
I personally pay for this obviously you
see it from the Amazon box here I
personally pay for this most didn't send
me anything Bose has never sent me
anything before but anyways got these to
try out and I probably see this sometime
either late end of this week if not
sometime next week
so alright question time alright so I
apologize in advance if I pronounce your
name wrong first one here is to true the
bad thing is that this is most likely a
Vietnamese name and I'm Vietnamese
myself so totally embarrass I'm sorry
about this man but he asked did I ever
think of giving up YouTube because the
channels growing too slow or the support
isn't what I set up to have and he also
asked was quitting corporate smart to do
two part question here regard the
YouTube thing I set up a 12 month goal
just like any other business that you
should do dedicate 12 months to it at
least minimum and then I went balls to
the walls did what I could and just see
if it was something that would be doable
in the long run so those first 12 months
the channel grew and it grew very well
grew fast and every month I have a goal
or a number that need to reach and I
reach those goals every month and of
course at the end of the year as well so
thankfully by at the end of month 1212 a
it's I broke even I guess you can say
I'm able to pay pay for the mortgage pay
for my health insurance like I just
broke even and it's nothing but up from
here so I guess you could say it for me
I wasn't growing slow considering that I
didn't have any videos that went viral I
don't think my videos are meant to go
viral there so how you say
structured reviews and usually those
kind of reviews those kind of videos
don't go viral they don't get a million
views in like two or three days or
anything like that no
I it steadily grew and it grew at a pace
at a trend that I could easily follow
and it's sure enough hit the goal that I
needed it to so thankfully it worked out
was putting corporate smart to do and I
would say hell yeah man I hated
corporate um here I can work at my pace
and don't get me wrong I bust my butt
but I'm able to put what I create out
there and I guess it's no different from
when you were like five or six years old
and you made some kind of painting at
school or at home or so and you brought
to your parents and you're like hey look
mom you know what I got and it's no
different here I I want to produce
something that I am proud of and I'm
happy about and Here I am doing it but
am I ever gonna go back I can never say
never maybe some catastrophic thing
might have in my life and I might have
to you never know but for now for the
time being I don't foresee doing so and
I hope I never will I hated it man all
right next question here Ben Smith best
advice to give a college student who
wants to succeed I would say for your
academic career this is what I
personally did sounds total nerdish or
whatever you call it I kept a sheet of
paper folded it until like this little
square and I kept in my pocket with a
pen I got a total nerd but I put down
everything that needed to do that day on
there down to the time down to how much
time is allotted for each activity and
on time by the school and studying but
down to working out down to leisure time
down to the time that needed to sleep
and I'll be honest with you they always
probably the best most organized time in
my life now I have a kid and whatnot and
it's a little bit tougher now but back
in the day man I was going to the gym
getting my 1 hour 45 minutes to an hour
workout was it Monday Wednesday Friday
and Sundays and I was setting or a lot
of time to cook and eat healthier meals
than my other fellow college students
and I don't know I just live there
really structured but it was real I got
a lot of my goals done basically so a
lot of leisure time was
lated but a lot of work not only you
know physically for myself but also
academic work as well so a lot of that
got done all again by that sheet of
paper another suggestion I would say is
now in hindsight like I said last time I
was in college was 2005 so kind of
getting old now looking back I had so
much like compared to today I had so
much time you don't realize it as a
college student you think your day is
jam-packed and don't get me wrong I mean
it is busy but compared to today and I'm
not talking about because I have a kid
or because I run a business even when I
was working in corporate compared to my
college life college life you had so
much time on your hands and I would say
take advantage of that if you can go out
and tour go out and travel go out and do
some volunteer work and that time I'll
do volunteer work at your local
community or whatnot I'm saying that
there's a I don't for example if there
like some catastrophic event in the
world if you can as always programs out
there fly out there and there are times
when either churches or student
organizations do pay for some or half or
whatever the expense is so it does help
you financially I know it's not cheap
but at least look into it at least just
ask you won't know until you ask and if
it's something that you can do go out
and do it it's a life-changing event it
opens your eyes to beyond your
neighborhood that you grew up in and
beyond the city that you grew up in
beyond the college life that you know
once you go out there and see the world
man it just changes your perspective and
I didn't learn that and I'll be honest I
didn't learned that until after college
because at that time I felt like I was
very limited whether it be school
whether it be financially but now
looking back at it I had more time then
and financially again those programs
they were there in the summer time I
work part time I didn't save up my money
but I saved up my money to pay off
school which is you know a good
alternative but then if I look back if I
can just do one summer or one semester
where I saved up that money and used it
to travel
just help somebody somewhere out in the
world through some kind of program or
organization man that would have been
great but I didn't do a lot of that
stuff until after I graduated but then
I'm limited to how many pto days how
many days off that a gift from my
employer at the end day I am so
restricted and it could be a week off
you know helping people that's great but
I don't know man I think I want to do
more than that
you know I mean it's just not just a
one-week thing an entire year out of 52
weeks I don't know I I just I find joy
in it that's just me personally but
again the most important thing is you
use your time and you have more time
than you think open up a business look
into business investing so things that
school doesn't teach you look into those
kind of things
next one Stuart Phillips where do I
envision my channel two years from now
and he also says to check out Casey nice
that Casey nice that's a badass man I
really do like him after watching his
videos I really want to do a time lapse
as a video transition I swear to god I
really want to do so but I have I have
held back in doing so I don't want to
imitate his style but answer his
question where do I vision the channel
from two years from now I I don't know
man I'll be honest with you I'm I'm just
going with the flow for now obviously
like I said in my previous video I am
trying to you know eventually make
enough so I can put my little girl in
preschool that would be you know four
years or so down the road we do need a
new car on the house so we need that up
obviously and so I mean that that's
probably my goals it's more personal
goals but other than that the channel
it's it's doing fine I don't I don't
want to be like I don't know I don't
want to be sold worldwide known I guess
you can say it's nice but I don't know I
I'll be honest man I'm I don't even know
if I want to strive for a million
subscribers the reason being is because
once I had that number focused in my
head it's a numbers game I still want to
focus on what I want to do and just help
people and
and no matter how long it takes to get
to a million than it is what it is and I
know I'm doing a video about a hundred
thousand subscribers but it's more about
you guys to be honest with you I'm doing
these vlogs so you guys get to know me a
little bit more as you can see the vlogs
they get what two thousand views and
whatnot and compared to my other videos
where they get 50 60 80 100 thousand
views you know I'm doing these vlogs
they don't make me any money which is
fine if I'm doing it for you guys and
I'm taking my time answering this
question so that's what I want to do I
don't know it just money money is
evil man that's all I gotta say next
question
Wesley erlan and Marko Napolitan sorry
if I pronounced it wrong where should
you start if you want to get into
YouTube more specifically on a budget
like I said if you're on a budget I
start out on a budget just now recently
like I said I just bought the camera and
whatnot and prior to that man for a good
year and a half and my channel is only
two years old full-time a year and a
half I was using a old Nikon d5100 today
it's the equivalents of d50 500 or so
and that's how I was using and some
cheap lighting forty dollars for a set
of two or three off of Amazon and I had
a crappy tripod the thing that I would
recommend tripod do you know you don't
have to get a decked out camera you can
use you can use your phone's camera but
the more important thing is proper
lighting spend a little bit of money on
lighting spend a little money in your
tripod and a video head tripod that is
and other than that practice on your
speech I know my speech isn't the best
when I'm doing vlogging that's why I do
two narratives that's why I'm not on
camera focus on your strengths and be
consistent that is the number one rule I
know so many people who want to do this
they put up five videos maybe eight
videos which seems like a lot but over
the course of 365 days 52 weeks a year
it's not much it's not consistent and
then they just fall off the bridge and
no one no one remembers your name no one
remembers Jim's review room if I just
stop doing videos and whatnot you know I
mean so consistency is key
um first do it as a hobby don't focus on
the money don't focus on the and the I
don't know popularity that you would
gain just just do it with a personal
purpose and of course it shouldn't be
money because you will make nothing in
the first several months that you do is
you make nothing you probably won't even
pay your own cell phone bill but on that
you just got a start
be consistent and again yeah okay camera
more importantly the lighting and a
video head tripod that's about it so
that's all the questions I know this is
long-winded these questions this
question session alone was freaking
eighteen minutes so far sorry about that
but um I don't know I try to answer
these questions because they're genuine
questions and I try to answer them with
a lot of meat and hopefully I I don't
know man if I can influence somebody to
do something you know great down the
road I know some people in the past have
done so for me it's because they taking
the time to do so and I hope I've if I
can then be great so more questions
write them down below I'll answer them
next week and this video is about an end
I'll talk to you guys later
count subscribe and I'll see you in the
next video you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
