that time again getting back to school
some of you might be excited as this may
be your first time out of your parents
house and gaining that independence more
than ever and being able to schedule
your first class of the day at 10 a.m.
instead of being there at 8 the college
shouldn't be dreaded but should be
embraced but on a more serious note
here's a guide to some tech essentials
that you'll need some might be more
common sense but at least I'll tell you
which ones do work the best from my
experience and some might be real small
but again they're essential and I'll
teach you which ones work so without
further ado we'll get started
starting off the list here you really
need some sort of a computer whether it
be a big desktop or a portable laptop -
something ultra portable as a tablet you
need something of your own indefinitely
now this will be subjective and relative
to your needs but if you're looking for
something basic don't sleep on
Chromebooks ultra cheap starting around
$200 and averaging around just 250 it's
perfect if you're just typing up at
paper
checking emails and reading up on all
your social media outlets and don't
worry these will play Netflix and
YouTube perfectly fine it's perfect for
those situations but one thing about
Chromebooks though you cannot install
programs so let's say you're studying
graphic design and need to install
Photoshop you basically can't so that's
just something to be worried about that
but for the basics it's perfect again
now if you're looking for productivity
in a tablet format consider of getting
one of these large Samsung Galaxy Note
pro tablets not the tab series but the
note series just for the fact that it
comes with a stylus pen you can take
notes highlight and do some other useful
things with your pen in general now I've
tested this and this is one of the most
highly praised devices I've reviewed so
far again with this tablet you cannot
install programs though now prices range
from $500 and up to 750 dollars for the
large 12-inch model and if you have the
money absolutely need a tablet and you
absolutely need Windows so you can
install programs the Microsoft Surface
pro
three that just came out can be had for
as low as seven hundred and ninety nine
dollars with all those features
mentioned above
now pricey I know but it's an investment
over the next several years in your
college career
now click on any one of these videos
playing or watch the reviews on my
channel jim's review room for more
in-depth information now this is going
to be a double dose but I highly
recommend an Ethernet cable Wireless is
very convenient but going back to the
old-school cable here for your computer
it's much much faster more secure and
more reliable now having a short cable
in the bag isn't much of a nuisance and
cables can be found for crazy cheap now
check Amazon if you don't care too much
or go to monoprice comm for some crazy
good deals on all those cables now I'm
not sponsored or being paid by them but
I've been shopping there personally for
some time now again mama priced calm but
the other item is a flash drive any
flash drive will do for the average
person but if you have a USB 3.0 port
take advantage of that port and get a
SanDisk Extreme I personally reviewed
the one I bought here and it's again
crazy fast but the reason why SanDisk is
the way to go
it has a secure vault with a hundred and
twenty eight bit encryption few years
that I was in college I've seen several
flash drives forgotten in the computer
or right in the desk at the library
private information just laid out there
and you need to protect it
I went with 64 gigs for close to $60 and
the 32 gig drive is around $35 on Amazon
currently again worth the investment and
you can watch that video as well on my
channel get yourself a good pair of
noise cancelling headphones or these
ones with very good sound isolation it
doesn't matter if you're in the library
or just walking through the hallways
blocking out the outside world keeps you
focused and more often than that music
has always been my source of motivation
and determination and those late nights
are just cramming for that test there
that's just getting some in-ear monitors
so they can go right into your ear canal
blocking out outside unwanted noise now
I know some people might find them
uncomfortable but they do fit well
though they transport easy and there's
some decent sounding ones out there now
I personally use the Jabra rocks as
they've stayed in my ear very well and
then use them for working out too
jogging and too
casual listening now more importantly
their Wireless making them very
convenient and clutter-free now this
specific pair cost 129 dollars found on
both Amazon and at the Apple Store and
of course there's other brands out there
that are a little bit cheaper as well
but definitely no matter what get a good
pair of headphones next item here get
yourself a printer but not any prints
are though if you really don't need
color get a laser printer not a inkjet
laser printers although they toner
upfront cost more this will last you
much longer than an inkjet can making it
cheaper to go laser now I have this
simple Samsung printer for years now and
ever since I switched to laser I haven't
looked back there is cheap as $80 or so
for a real basic one but I recommend
getting a wireless one although you
might be a few feet away from that
printer it's again very convenient to go
wireless on this one school will more
than likely be a social event for you
and just for that aspect get a wireless
Bluetooth speaker now you might be in
organizations school clubs or just with
a group of your now lifelong friends you
don't want to contribute i reviewed some
small ones here that are only $100 but
they sound great for small dorm rooms
you can bring them to your friends room
or to the park and surely others will
ask what is this cool little speaker
that i suggest getting the UE mini boom
or the Jawbone Jambox mini both small
but loud for their size and like I said
I've tested these and their audio
quality is still good and again they're
both Wireless and also durable and
affordable now be sure to buy a decent
camera that comes with a lens even if
you already have a nice camera phone
already it doesn't have to be a big DSLR
but consider the Samsung and X Mini that
I reviewed you're going to be in a new
setting with new friends and sure enough
those friends are going to bring it to
new places take it out on your first
skiing trip or reveal your inner foodie
when you visit all these new restaurants
either way a nice camera will preserve
those memories for more of a
storytelling nostalgic look when you
look back at them one day if you have
the money trust me years down the road
those are going to be some awesome
moments captured and you don't have to
be a camera buff or know too much about
cameras with the camera like the NX mini
it snaps gorgeous photos on auto mode
and if you do decide to get a bit more
artsy you can say all those settings
in manual mode can be customized just
like a big DSLR camera and you'll take
even more impressive shots later on
it's about $550 but again it comes with
a lens a flip up screen it's also
wireless and the biggest selling point
here
it takes gorgeous photos while still
retaining a very thin camera body nemzer
and you'll have a TV to kill time on
those rainy nights or watching The
Walking Dead with a group of friends but
as college students Smart TVs can get
quite expensive but for sure getting
Netflix Hulu or HBO go accounts
especially if you don't have one right
now it's definitely worth it the
cheapest and best bang for your buck is
the chromecast from Google at only $35
it's a great device that streams all of
your shows right onto your TV it just
plugs into the back of your TV's HDMI
and it's connected wirelessly to your
internet and you'll be able to make the
most team of TV's into a smart one for
watching your favorite shows
now another alternative if you do have
the money and into video games either
the Xbox one or the PlayStation 4 will
do Netflix Hulu etc as well and having
friends over to play some Madden never
hurts so those are just some suggestions
to make life a little bit easier during
your college career and I know they're
on the pricey side but again think of
them as an investment that you're using
hopefully beyond your college years or
at least through those several years
that you'll be there
you can always purchase more budget from
the items as well by selecting different
brands and models and indeed some of
these items also will be an awesome
social sharing experience now if you do
have anything that you think I forgot to
put in here which I'm sure I did please
