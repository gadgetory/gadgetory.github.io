due to popular request here goes the JBL
charge for and the sony xba-1 down so
here we go so both retails for $150 i
have seen the JBL on sale for 114 and
these sony xba-4 118 as always I'll
place my affiliate links down in that
video description below click on those
links for the most updated prices in
real time you never know where these
things might go on sale don't pay retail
so first up the biggest difference the
sony has these amazing LEDs while they
charge for doesn't instead there's these
passive base traders on the side that
pulsates with your audio output now
although the charge for it does have a
full fabric and closed-shell or body
there are no speakers on the rear most
of your audio is actually coming out
from the front the Sony XP 32 and the
other hand does have a woofer actually
on the back and that does help push
audio more specifically bass when you
put this against the wall
does it help does it sound better than
JBL I'll demo that later in this video
other than that they're both similar
inside the Sony is slightly longer in
length but the JBL is slightly bigger in
diameter they both weigh nearly the same
at about a 6 gram difference between
both but for me if you're looking for
portability JBL is good but sony is
easier to grip here now diving a bit
deeper both speakers have the same water
resistance certification with an IP 7
rating this is currently the best in the
industry
now both speakers can be submerged
underwater and with my testing both
speakers do have the capability to float
as well a huge plus if you drop this I
don't feel like diving into the deep end
to get it probably drowned but anyways
this was a draw the JBL is rugged with
its fabric going all the way around here
but no indication that it's drop or
shock resistant now with Sony they do
claim that it is shock resistance but as
stated in my review the plastic
protecting these LEDs right here can
crack if you drop it right on the corner
the JBL is tough and even though sony
has that claim the
I can still be compromised I give this a
draw for both products as well no button
wise JBL feels much more tactile a
little bit more clicky up top here and
the essentials on both speakers are
there with pause/play vibe up and down
and answering phone calls
the only thing missing you can't go back
on a song with the JBL speaker you can
skip forward by pressing the play button
twice pressing it three times doesn't do
anything now with Sony you get this
function what you also get is this thing
called live sound that alters the audio
characteristics which again we'll talk
about later in the audio section the
only thing that simply wasn't intuitive
to me with the sony xba-4 s of the
buttons are back here behind this
water-resistant flap and this is from
turning off the leds to check in better
life to appear in this speaker with
another sony speaker it was all back
here with JBL that JBL connect plus
button which is right here is not
illuminated this allows you to pair with
another speaker right on top a little
bit more convenience the battery level
indicator is also on the front which i
think is technically better but with
sony though you can press that button
here an actual voice prompt now consumer
useful eyes which one is better as much
as I love JBL and the button placement
on the Sony could have been better and
Sony technically does have more features
more options more specifically live
sound skipping forward on a song and I
personally prefer a verbal prompt on
battery life not to mention the Sony
speaker does have NFC for easy parry now
a touching base on phone call
performance the JBL surprise e doesn't
have a speakerphone option which was a
quite a letdown here the Sony speaker it
works great within just three feet or
less which isn't much at five feet it
starts to break up a bit and at eight
feet you have a lot of trouble hearing
what the other person is saying so it's
not even good in that aspect as well
getting into better life JBL claims up
to 20 hours sony claims up to 24 hours
but that's with extra base and the leds
off with JBL i got 9 hours and 14
minutes on a battery performance at 50%
bond with sony I did the test with the
LEDs on and extra base
extra base does sound a little more
equivalent to what JBL offers I was able
to get 13 hours in 27 minutes and again
at that 50% volume level as well
Sony got it there but then I have no
clue why here but Sony went with micro
USB to charge the speaker on the back
while the older charge for has USB C for
those who don't know USB C is the future
proof for future connection Universal
connection for most devices is moving
forward you might have seen him under
laptops obviously your new smartphones
and such it's all there we're moving
forward folks now jumping into bluetooth
both of these speakers are possibly the
most popular most well-known Bluetooth
speakers on the market but oddly they
both only offer bluetooth 4.2 we're now
at Bluetooth 5.0 testing this JBL
achieved 100% coverage in my apartment
which is impressive though and again for
Bluetooth 4.2 with the signal going
through several walls and literally from
one side of the apartment to the other
the Sony I'm getting about 75 to 80% in
coverage before the signal starts to
crackle or skip JBL simply did better in
regards to connection if you need range
JBL is the way to go testing this with
video the Sony played really well with
no syncing issues on both Android and
Apple with JBL i retested this again as
last year they did have syncing issues I
thought there'd be new updates or so
that would have helped this out again
same problems Android perfectly fine
with Apple devices Netflix had a
nanosecond delay with YouTube that's
where it had horrible delays with lips
just moving and then the audio playing
Sony wins this one for sure so folks
let's get into the audio sample here's
some quick comparisons and be sure to
LIKE subscribe follow me on twitter
instagram at jimmy little official and
also the twitter handle should be j loom
official probably have a tin screen or
at least it's in the video description
hi folks here we go
Heys what you lean on me I cut your lip
you fall so take a leap up if difficulty
is clouding up come and see it supplies
the Sun I need you to let go
probably secret stick with me you're the
only reason is your Leone's
we
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded on my
microphones and then heard through your
own headphones or earphones are not the
best depicted on audio quality but hence
my review here so when I received these
sony xba-1 firms it did sound slightly
better than the XB 31 from the year
prior it's less muffled and less
distorting I will admit though it's back
to being close and at times neck and
neck with the JBL charged for either
speaker is good they're not bad at all
and honestly they're two of the best
mainstream name-brand speakers on the
market
here goes the little details and see
which one is technically better now
getting to basemen in general you can
hear Sony attempts to hit lower
frequencies than the JBL charge for but
the charge for although it doesn't hit
that low JBL offered additional depth
that Sony didn't achieve with or without
extra bass activating there's this very
nice thump and punch on every beat that
was a bit cleaner and what I personally
appreciate on the charge for I also
mentioned in the independent review for
Sony the XP 32 does have this odd bass
flutter I mean low end when you have
this at very loud levels the bass on JBL
was more so at the mid and upper bass
levels and somewhat into the low mid
range because so the mid-range did have
a bit more warmth at vocals while this
sony had a slightly more neutral level
the mid-range on the JBL does sound much
more direct on most songs a bit more
forward and alive the JBL for some might
sound a bit too ford but I personally
don't mind this as it gives the
impression of being clear the high
frequencies were also slightly better on
JBL with a nice snap for snares very
much identifiable and again quite clean
the sony did well overall but when doing
this head-to-head there's times when the
sony was just a bit higher and sharper
and at times it sounded to roll off
depending on song now getting into
soundstage if you utilize live sound and
these sony xba-40 tube there is a
difference and you can tell that the
audio output is a little bit wider you
do lose that more
recked in-your-face audio but again it's
a trade-off to get more of a wider
soundstage that audio separation but
again soundstage the last thing I want
to mention them sony does have this
thing called el deck which allows you to
play high resolution audio files that's
great but the audio characteristics
these sony xba-40 this wasn't up to par
with the JBL in my personal opinion the
JBL sounded a little bit better now bose
speakers played up up the same vayam the
JBL was again a little bit more directly
bit more forward and now jumping into
audio separation the JBL was a bit
better you can hear bass separately then
you can hear the mid-range separately
and you can distantly hear the high
frequencies independently and it creates
much more of a dimension or depth here
to your experience so in the end sony
has a lot of features and does prove to
be better than JBL here in several areas
the lights alone the better life and
live sound the bluetooth performance
although it didn't reach the end of my
apartment for the fact that it plays
video without sinking issues is a huge
plus but towards the second half of this
review video JBL Shaklee still provides
better audio even though Jamie I went
with a single speaker it's crazy to
think about it but the audio output was
simply better as always it's tough to
choose folks let me know down in the
comment section below
both great speakers but please vote did
Sony win or did JBL this is just my
personal preference but I honestly went
with JBL myself alright folks let me
know in the comments section I'm really
eager to hear this it's always a good
debate here between these two companies
I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
