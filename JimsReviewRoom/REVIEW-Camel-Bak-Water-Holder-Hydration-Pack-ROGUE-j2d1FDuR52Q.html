review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the portable hydration
unit call it the Camelback my particular
model I have here is called the rogue
and it's still currently available for
sale on camelbaks website and also in
your sporting goods stores as well well
looking through the back packs
construction and style specifications
and features and lastly my pros and cons
and its performance and usage so let's
get started here I've personally used
this for almost two years now and I
specifically use it when I go mountain
biking per camelbacks website people use
these hydration backpacks to not only
hold water but their gear as well such
as first aid kits spare tires wallets
Keys etc while running or biking or even
hiking other outdoor sports I purchased
this Camelback from Bass Pro Shop
personally for about $60 at the time
there's a wide variety of camel backs
out there from kid sizes to adult sizes
in various men and woman styles in
addition they come in different
capacities as well holding liquids from
50 ounces and that's about one and half
liters and it holds up to 100 ounces
which is 3 liters my particular rogue
line holds about 70 ounces they come in
a variety of colors as well mine is
black and gray and it does come with two
smaller reflective strips if you're
intending to use this either in the
evening or maybe early morning if you're
jogging or biking the construction
consists of nylon plastic clips a rubber
bladder with a easy fill cap rubber hose
with closed off valve and a mouthpiece
fablet fabric mesh and soft padding for
your back as well
the exterior also features two zipper
Bowl pockets and a open pocket as well
so I'll start with the pros real quick
here it feels very comfortable and
sturdy even when I'm on the bumpy trails
when I'm mountain biking the straps held
very well when tightened and never had a
problem slipping off or becoming loose
during my trail riding surprisingly my
shoulders never felt weighed down or
fatigued even when I filled the bladder
up to full capacity and even play some
ice in there water was kept cold even
when riding in the middle of summer the
70 ounces definitely held all the water
that I need
the trout's that I personally ride on
are about two to three hours longer
that's how long it takes me
and it's about 11 miles can I drink tons
of water while riding
I got a mitt I'm my stamina is not very
greater I'm weak sauce so these trails
by the end and usually have a little bit
of water left
so the 70 ounces really was a sweet spot
for me it held just enough for me to get
through everything is very durable the
rubber mouthpiece is still intact no
cracking no piece breaking off or so
same with the rubber hose as well that
comes with the Camelbak the packets were
just enough as well just to place my
wallet in there and phone and this still
had room for possibly a small portable
bike pump and a of course a non inflated
spare tire as well in regards to the
cons there's virtually none at all the
only one thing that I did notice was
it's not waterproof so if you're caught
in the rain your wallet and the items
inside will unfortunately get wet
other than that oh and I forgot to mark
pros per camelbacks website there is a
lifetime warranty which is a huge plus
so if you ever have a puncture
especially in that bladder where it
leaks out water make sure you just fill
out the warranty card or register your
product at least that it's a lifetime
warranty on there which is fabulous
which is great in other than that the
other Pro the last Pro is it's easy to
use it's very easy to clean it as well
nothing but praise it does what it's
supposed to do with ease so is it a buy
is it a try or is that not buy there's
no surprise it's definitely a buy if
you're an outdoors person that likes to
hike or bike this is the way to go to
carry water and usually carry three
16-ounce water bottles while biking and
be jostled everywhere and the three
bottles were just not enough to last me
my entire biking trip or trail so
overall great quality reliable product
and it does what it advertises to do in
a very comfortable man
