room looking for a new gaming headset I
needed certain characteristics to be met
spatial sound performance for somewhat
of a competitive edge clear audio that's
not distorted and enough base to get
immersed into the action don't forget a
great price point as well I ran across
the number one selling PlayStation 4
headset on Amazon the PlayStation gold
Wireless at the time this video I bought
them on sale for just 74 dollars but
they do retail for $100 now click on the
link in the video description below to
see what they are priced for today so
without further ado add me on to
instagram twitter or facebook and check
out Jim's review room calm welcome
everyone to another review keep in mind
I have the 20th anniversary edition
which resembles the original PlayStation
1 from way back in the day that they do
sell the more black and blue model which
looks more like the PlayStation 4 but
they perform identically the same as the
model that I have here going over the
physical features first these are bigger
than what I saw on the photos they do
feature a pretty wide band up top that
follows through down to the sides here
now each side does feature a detachable
plate for customization if you choose to
do so the cushion supply that the
headband itself is very soft and supple
with a cool feeling leather texture but
more about this in might comfort test a
little bit later
moving down the arm of the band these
earphones do graciously fold in for
easier stowing but I wish the hinges
were a bit more firm in feedback oh this
is just me being a bit picky but they do
click and clunk around a bit same with
the ear cups there isn't just subtle
resistance to get rid of that loose
feeling but they do work perfectly fine
though
now the ear pads are not memory foam but
they are cushioned enough for comfort
now we're in these for the initial three
hours straight I do admit these have
some weight to them they weigh in at 302
grams on my personal scale and
unfortunately not many manufacturers put
on their websites the weight of the
product itself so I really couldn't do
much of a comparison but the crown of
the head didn't have discomfort but the
clamping in the sides were a bit firm
than other headphones I've used now
after that first three hours taking a
small break and then
doing this for another three hours I
really had gotten used to them the
following day and every day after that I
do notice the weight but the comfort was
fine thereafter I never had sweaty ears
and never did my jaw hurt so comfort
wise I just really had to get used to
them and same regarding the buttons as
well the volume and chat button buttons
are all located on the left ear cup and
they're seamlessly covered by silicone
buttons to work out very well very
clicky and over time you will remember
where everything is on top of the ear
cup is VSS abbreviated for virtual
surround sound and then moving to the
bottom here there is an on/off switch of
course with numbers 1 &amp;amp; 2 available
leaving this on number 1 basically
offers a standard sound while putting
this and number 2 provides bass boost
which I highly recommend there's a
three-and-a-half millimeter port so you
can physically connect this into your
controller or your phone to use
basically listening to music and once
you plug this headset in the headset
will turn off saving battery life the
microphone will still work but
everything else turns off so no control
over bass boost and no control over the
volume levels you just need to adjust
the audio in the Play Station settings
or on your phone if you're connected
that way and before I forget here
there's also that little mute button on
the bottom rear of the left ear cup too
but the last connection it is a microUSB
port for charging the headset and oddly
companies don't list how long their
headsets last for I personally left this
on my desk from a full battery and play
this app e maximum volume with bass
boost and virtual surround sound on
until the unit died these lasted me a
total of 7 hours and 45 minutes to be
exact
fully charging these did take about
three and a half hours to complete
though I think those are very good
numbers especially at full volume
now as for sound leaking when playing
these do leak a lot unfortunately
although they're closed back ear cups
now those around you will basically hear
what you're playing in a similar
experience for a passive noise isolation
if you have the volume up you don't hear
too much obviously but if you're playing
a more silent game there's really not
much passive noise isolation as well you
will hear the laundry machine running in
the background or your family members
around you for me although noise leaking
and lacking noise isolation it wasn't a
big deal since I normally play when no
one's home so just something to take
into consideration if you're considering
buying but to the moment you've been
waiting for hear my
personal sound test now first off these
do get loud and I really found myself
playing around 60 to 70 percent volume
for most online first-person shooters
and about 50 to 60 percent volume for
single-player campaigns now for $100
Wireless pair of headphones and keep in
mind on cell attempts or $75 this does
provide very good sound stage you can
hear ambient noises from the left to
your right but more importantly from
front to back this does provide that
more competitive edge than those who are
just using those 40 or $50 headsets that
only provides stereo left and right
separation the clarity is there hearing
all the little details of what I can can
offer and with base boost on which I
highly recommend as it does provide more
immersion into the environment you're in
it is not overpowering
there's no distortion though it's just
subtle enough to be really enjoyed for
multiplayer especially first-person
shooters your own gun isn't too high
pitched and tinging which causes
listening fatigue from your gunshots
going off this was a common problem I
found on lower price headsets when I
wanted to hear my surrounding better by
turning the volume up higher but in
exchange after hours of gaming I would
need to gently rub my ears out there
take off the headset this didn't have
that problem here again that spatial
soundstage is very key for having that
competitive edge and this headset does
provide that playing online and using
the noise canceling microphone my friend
did say that they could hear some very
minut noses in the background if those
noises were close by but my voice came
through clear like I used an extending
boom microphone from the headset so are
these the best headsets you can get for
the PlayStation 4 I'll be honest I don't
think so but I think this is the best
bang for the buck at the moment if
you're looking for more bass more
spatial sound maybe something a little
bit lighter with noise isolation you
will pay more but if you're in this
price range you will be absolutely fine
with this purchase
