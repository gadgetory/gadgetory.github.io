room it's been a while since I've done a
budget review helping you find some
lower-cost
items that functions as well as some of
the other mainstream brands out there
now this one is coming from das and they
sent me the boom box retailing for 99
dollars but as always with these Amazon
sellers at the time this video these
things are going for 32 which is
impaired at all now I would recommend
clicking on my Amazon link in the video
description below click on my links and
they'll give you the most updated prices
in real time now jumping right into this
one das has been making some quality
stuff solid metal grill on the front
rotating tahrir is unfortunately all
plastic but because it's textured it
doesn't feel cheap at all and like the
front it's solid and not hollow feeling
now to the right you have a slot to use
music stored on your microSD card if you
like a three-and-a-half millimeter port
for physical connections and last is a
microUSB port for charging the speaker
the daus is climbing up to twelve hours
of use which compared to the competition
of other small bluetooth speakers on the
market it's on the upper end now looking
at the top of the speaker it's a matte
black finish that doesn't attract so
much fingerprints here which is always a
plus the buttons light up with a classy
white LED and then on the top left the
letter M is for your mode selection to
select where your music is being played
from either Bluetooth that micro SD card
slot or using the auxiliary port now
pause play and answer phone call button
is next and to the far right this is not
Big Bang controls though unfortunately I
wish they provided me more Universal
arrows but these are to skip music
forward and backwards now to adjust
volume though and I do love this about
doll speakers its touch sensitive and
you circle or swirl your finger here
around the logo to change by them up and
down it is sensitive and it works
without any issues now let's do the far
right here is the on and off button
which physically works great but das
needs to change the voice prompts one it
sounds like George decay for some reason
in second there are times the grammar is
off which really takes away from the
physical build and equality of the
speaker
here's a quick sample Bluetooth mode has
be on waiting for Perry regarding
Bluetooth signal it has been great
using bluetooth 4.0 I use this
name test on all my Bluetooth speakers
standing on one side of the house with
my phone and the speaker on the other
side signal was never lost going through
several walls but other than that the
boombox is simple its bare-bones it just
simply provides audio then that can be
surely enough for many people out there
who doesn't need all the action features
but let's take a look at the audio
performance right now and see how it
sounds now play several samples and then
I'll give you my verdict afterwards
they chase
to
when I said
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded on my end and
then play through your speakers are not
the best depiction of audio quality but
it's my review here hands down the
speaker is good but really just for
casual listening having some sort of
audio in the room or maybe in your
garage or so that would be a perfect
example the bass is quite lacking you
don't get that immersive sound
experience as you would with some of the
other brands out there but with that
being said the sound is clean though and
clear and it provides a distortion free
experience
it doesn't sound cheap at all the voices
are present in neutral the highs are not
your ringing and tinging or sharp and
depending on what you're looking for
either this is a great speaker for those
casual moments and a small maybe a
medium-sized room others might find the
speaker to play it too safe and not be
as loud as you want or not having enough
color to its audio performance now I
would recommend the speaker for its
price and only for personal and more
casual listening so hope this review
