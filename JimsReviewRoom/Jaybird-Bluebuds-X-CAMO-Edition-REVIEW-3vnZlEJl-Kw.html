review room now as some of you follow me
on Facebook or Google+ you know I was
invited to Jaybirds press conference for
the Jaber train but while I was there J
Bert was very nice enough to provide me
there blue blood X earbuds for me to
review but they provided the Kimmo
Edition which has yet to be released in
stores as of this video now today the
blue blood X's are currently priced at
169 dollars retail and you can get them
for as low as 140 on Amazon and
considering I've tested these about a
year ago it's great to have another go
at it
we'll see how these have held up against
many other brands I've tested over the
past several months so without further
ado welcome to another review the blue
but X's and I'll brave eight them the BB
X's are wireless Bluetooth earbuds focus
on the active and sports oriented
individual their sweat proof and jaybird
does offer a lifetime warranty against
sweat related damages now the housing is
still the same featuring all plastic
construction including these chrome
accents and it does come with a very
stiff and durable wire guards to prevent
them from dislocating or fraying when
throwing these around in your pocket or
your gym bag and last are the now more
common amongst the industry lay flat
tangle free cords and after testing
these for the past month and a half
bring these everywhere with me and
tossing them in my car my computer bag
and even in my pocket at times the BB ex
is still holds up very well with those
signs of paint chipping or flaking off
and no compromises to the ear wings or
ear tips as well now if you're wanting
protection jaybird does also provide a
very nice hard case that's felt line and
includes a pocket which is always a plus
to hold off your accessories now with
the right earbud you have the cap that
covers the microUSB port for charging
the device with the supplied USB cable
and testing the battery life here Jaber
claims up to eight hours of news and
from my real-world testing leaving these
at 50% volume which is very comfortable
and pleasing for casual listening with
pandora iheartradio
the BBX has lasted seven hours and 18
minutes to be precise until the battery
died and before I go into my comfort
test the last physical feature the BB x
is the inline volume control
it's mused of course for adjusting sound
but tapping the metal button allows you
to answer your incoming phone calls now
sound on my end performed as Norma's can
be with the person any other side
stating conversation sounding decent and
good enough for use but to the rural
test here how do they fit in how do they
sound then the packaging three different
ear tips and earring sizes are provided
and j-bert provides two wearing options
with the traditional wire going down the
ear and the wire hanging on the back of
the neck or option two here is using
these supplied clips to reduce the slack
and having the earbud wires go above the
ear and the regarding fitment it was
mentioned in my last review as being an
issue now from my experience over time
during a workout or jog the earbuds
would lose suction in the ear canal and
become loose you can say require me to
push the earbud gently back in now with
the camo audition this is not a redesign
but just another color option for the
sport earbuds and I again tried as hard
as I could to try to make these work but
yet again with wearing these both ways
above and under the ear as well
they still unfortunately lose the sound
isolation again this only happened to a
small handful of people that I could
tell including myself here and it
happens slowly over time during your
physical activity but as a tip to
viewers out there many MLS review
recommended to visit comply foam comm as
they specialize in earbud foam tips its
memory foam that after pinching and
sliding to my ears the foam expands
after about 30 seconds or so and the
craziest thing these really do work the
BB axis now stays in my ears very well
even with the wire just hanging and
doing light activities they still stayed
in so I think for sure these are a great
investment for those who already have
the BB X's and has the same fitment
issues and thank you to those who
recommended them on my last video here
but getting to the sound test the sound
quality however is quite the opposite
from its factory fitment again it's been
about six months or so since my initial
review on these and since then I've
tested many other brands on my channel
and still the blue but X's sounds
phenomenal now starting with the very
basics here these are very loud many
other manufacturers I listen to them or
test them at around 70% volume just to
hear the audio quality in the little
minut details in each earbuds but with
the blue but X's at 50%
actually equivalent no I like bass but I
do prefer balanced sound and these at
least reaches that medium for me from
the likes of rap and hip-hop from Nicki
Minaj to Iggy Azalea their beats really
stand out listening to EDM which is my
personal favorite genre Armin van Buuren
do something deep like blackmail really
gave me the sense of audio immersion and
appreciation for these artists and
listening to pop rock and alternative
music again all sounded very good it's
just a very well-rounded pair of earbuds
but now getting to something more
specific and gaining more experience and
comparing other brands and manufacturers
what makes the blue bud axis stand out
from others is its fidelity voices are
clear instruments are distinct but the
biggest appreciation is its open sound
stage and sound direction it's something
that I notice now going back to the blue
boxes you can pretty much hear left and
right audio separation but the sound
stage is so open that you can hear
what's in front of you and what's behind
you as well
now if you happen to listen to these
while watching movies you won't be
disappointed either similar to its music
performance movie performance is
impeccable for these earbuds again very
well done direction of sound bass
response and in general sound clarity so
with all that being said after my
testing I can say the blue bud X's are
still the best sounding ear buds that
I've personally tested to date I wish
the fitment would improve and it's clear
it's an issue with some others out there
on review sites and also in my previous
video as well and I've had several
people state that they love their blue
butt axes the sound quality but which
they fit in the ear canal a little bit
better so hope this review helped you in
some way and if you do like my work here
be sure to follow me on either Facebook
Twitter or Google+ as I do have behind
the scenes information and news that I
normally post here and there so this is
Jimmy again with Jim's review room you
guys take care and I'll see you on the
next one bye
