think these Samsung headphones were
coming to the States but just a week or
two ago they were announced being
available at Best Buy Amazon and other
select retailers the model I have here
is the level over which is Samsung's
flagship headphones at the moment priced
at 349 dollars these are quite expensive
compared to some of the other
competitors out there but having tons of
features and such a premium design I
only hope the audio quality will be the
same I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
welcome to another review these things
do look amazing in person with such
intricate attention to detail now
starting with a band up top is hard
plastic with the level / logo they flex
to a reasonable amount with literally no
plastic squeaking or cracking and one of
my favorite features is the cross
stitching and the amount of padding they
used up top this thing exudes luxury
like an interior of a Ferrari feeling
very supple in its material and now
discuss the comfort shortly in the
comfort test coming up now moving down
the band comes to a pivotal quality
standpoint the adjusting arms which
appears to be metal and not spray down
metallic paint or plastic
I even tried scratching this metal with
my house keys and no scratches were even
left behind and after reviewing so many
headbands and headsets these has to be
the beefiest most sturdy arms I've seen
now regarding the rest of the frame it's
all plastic construction with Samsung
having a balance of a matte white finish
with a glossy white on the ear cups
themselves now subtle mounts of chrome
trim is included to accentuate this
high-end chic and classy looking
headsets they are Cubs themselves barely
swivels and only slightly pivots when
compared to other competitors on the
market but wearing these haven't been an
issue but again I'll go into detail
during my comfort test but the ear pads
are amazingly plush soft and supple and
more so than the beats solo2
that i reviewed a few weeks back now
they both seem to have the same memory
foam padding but the Samsung level is
just a little bit softer in general now
going through its unique features that
competitors like v-moda Sennheiser or
beats doesn't have this makes Samsung
really stand out from the rest
first and the simplest these are
wireless bluetooth headsets and they're
also courted as well
now sampson provides the option of using
a 3.5 millimeter chord with an inline
mic that's supplied in the case but
built-in noise cancelling mics are also
built right into the headset for clear
conversations as well and i sat outside
at a fast-food restaurant next to a busy
road and performing a google hangout
video chat it yielded perfect results
actually video chat with my brother he
said that he saw the cars go by in the
background but didn't hear them nor any
wind noise and my voice actually sounded
natural as if I was indoors and not on a
speakerphone now moving on to the ear
cups themselves the left ear cup
features NFC connections for easy
syncing to your compatible NFC devices
and on the right ear cup are touch
sensitive controls swiping up or down
raises and lowers the value while
swiping in front of you skips the track
and the last feature is active
noise-cancelling built right into the
headset now when sitting outside I could
still hear the cars drive by somewhat
with or without noise canceling features
but where it did notice it was different
was inside a room actually tested these
sitting inside a McDonald's and notice
voices and other movements were still
noticeable
however the ambient sound in the room
was gone now if you can think of this or
actually perform this put both your
hands and cup your ears or basically use
a empty cup if you have one nearby
you'll notice you're hearing basically
has is now sounding more hollow or
droned and you might even actually hear
some kind of a hissing now with the
active noise canceling feature that hum
hiss or hollowness you hear is removed
and it does create a cleaner sounding
performance but again voices and other
noises in the background are still
present when listening to the level
overs especially on low volume like most
other headsets so does it work yes it
actually does but have I ever noticed a
hiss or hollowness and other headsets to
really want noise canceling features and
to be honest not really in the last test
before going into comfort
sound leaking on screen is the actual
sound test prior to putting these on and
of course afterwards as well and sound
leaking is very well minimized when worn
due to the thickness of the air pads and
overall construction and overall the
comfort has been very well done like I
said earlier their ear cups don't pivot
or swivel too much but
earpads are so plush it feels like it
fits over the ears very well an award is
for several hours straight and overall
they haven't provided as much wearing
fatigue as other brands now Samsung did
not disclose their weight on their
website but I do have my trusty scale
here and it reveals that this weighs
about twelve point four eight ounces and
if you translate that it weighs about
353 grams a little bit heavier than some
of the other headsets again reviewed on
my channel previously now I do feel a
little bit of pressure at the crown and
also at the jawline as well but compared
to the Sennheiser's my jaw would have
been so close to the third straight hour
and compared to the beats solo2 the
samsung overs stayed on longer before
feeling fatigue set in and although it's
so plush the air pads in my opinion
hasn't caused my ears to become hot or
sweaty and the last thing I don't know
if you have noticed yet but these look
absolutely huge at my head they don't
look too bad when you're holding them in
front of you but just from my experience
these are much bigger in size compared
to the other headsets again I reviewed
so far so that's something to look into
if you're into buying these and the last
thing I wanted to talk about was the
case and the supplied wires it's a
premium soft case with a fabric material
on the outside now on the inside it's
felt lined with no pockets or elastic
bands but provides a smaller pouch for
all of your wires the level overs don't
fold in and because of that you do have
to carry a pretty big case with no other
compartments unfortunately and I'm
pretty sure this at the moment you guys
have been waiting for these sound tests
know as usual starting with sub bass and
bass in general there isn't much there
it's not bumping or thumping I like bass
for certain genres but I prefer a
balance between all notes but the
Samsung overs really doesn't have bass
to complement its other sound fields
now forget hitting bass but warm notes
aren't much there either
now try cascade I remember and that
rhythmic beat just doesn't immerse me
listening to heavy bass listen to 2
Chainz his song riots the first minute
isn't as deep as I expected for rap now
don't get me wrong
it's not bad it's not flat as you'd
expect from let's say a $50 headset but
it's really subtle bass in my opinion
when compared to the last several
headsets are reviewed and again I want
to emphasize I prefer balanced
than heavy bass headsets but this still
wasn't enough for me now despite the
level over lacking bass it still has
clean audio and doesn't distort it hits
high notes pretty decent the mid-range
again where vocals resides it's clear
but there's no depth you can say it
doesn't sound like a soundstage no you
can laugh all you want but Mariah Carey
has really good notes in her voice and I
just didn't feel immersed I felt
desperate and then eventually gone old
school with Whitney Houston mary j blige
testing instruments from Earth Wind &amp;amp;
Fire's September and again the harmonies
are not there in my opinion now
shockingly lacking for this price range
now never once that I subconsciously Bob
my head to a beat or get chills I guess
you can say from listening to a deep
crazy good song
compared to other lower priced headsets
I'm confident the sound on the level
over is cleaner and better in a sense
but for the price Samsung is asking for
I personally don't feel these are studio
quality and that's the key word studio
quality at this price range it's to be
expected the features are really nice
the build quality is good and styling is
sexy in my opinion but it felt Samson
was trying to look pretty then target
audio files again they don't sound bad
but for this price I was honestly
looking for the sound to match its looks
and the funny thing is I review a lot of
Samsung products and I personally do
like them it's subjective Baidu person
like majority of their products in
general well this is just one of those
items or products where it does fall
short in the most important feature
again the audio quality again thanks for
