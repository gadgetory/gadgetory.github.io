room if you've been watching tecnu
tubers for some time you might have seen
some audio engine speakers when they're
doing their rumored desk
tours specifically the a 2 and a 5 plus
models they're a really good set and
every youtuber that I know really gives
them a lot of praise
well audio engine decided to raise the
bar once again and release a bigger
speaker it's completely redesigned here
with different components for the
woofers and tweeters and the cabinet's
have been beefed up as well now they're
a pretty penny though at $750 retail as
of this video for a pair but they might
be worth it we'll see in this review
I'll place a link in the description
below you can click on that to check
what the updated prices are today so
without further adieu I'm here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's review room
going over the physical features first
these come in two different wood veneers
walnut and cherry or if you'd like these
do come in these satin black option
which comes painted on regarding size to
ensure this fits on your desk as they're
quite big each cabinet measures 11 and
3/4 inches tall 7 and a quarter inches
wide and 10 inches from the front to the
rear now if you're intending on using
speaker stands the heaviest speaker
weighs in at 17 and a half pounds and on
the bottom it does feature a half a
quarter inch thread looking at the front
audio engine like some of its other
products includes a magnetic grille
which stays on very well from accidental
bumps or when music is blasting behind
here the woofer is bigger than the a5
Plus model coming in at 5.5 inches and
the new dome silk tweeter are an inch in
diameter
staying on the front the left speaker
does have your volume control knob which
also allows you to put the speaker into
sleep mode and there's LED lights to
indicate when the speaker is on or not
the only thing that I found missing here
that would very much been very helpful
is a volume level indicator now rotating
to the back and this is one of the
things that audio engine is really
emphasizing on is its versatility
starting with the very top Bluetooth
comes standard to wirelessly connect
this with your smartphone or other
bluetooth enabled devices audio engine
unfortunate doesn't have a built in
discreet antenna so an external one is
provided but you can always turn this
downward to hide it from sight now the
connection has worked great from one
side of the house and walking down
stairs to the other side my phone has
never lost connection next is the
tried-and-true three-and-a-half
millimeter input and directly below that
is a speed of connection for a Toslink
cable which every bluetooth player
PlayStation Xbox and I'm sorry every
computer nowadays has now this would be
the best audio connection providing a
lossless signal RCA in and out stereo
connections are provided and if you
happen to purchase a subwoofer from
audio engine or use a different brand
you can connect the subwoofers LFE cable
to the right RCA output for that to work
I might have missed that in the
instruction booklet but now you know
moving down because this is obviously a
stereo setup audio engine does provide a
16-gauge speaker wire 13 feet in length
or 4 meters for those outside of the US
and graciously they include very simple
banana plugs which basically stands in
and stays firmly connected if you need
something longer than 13 feet you can
always purchase your own speaker wire
and twist the ends into the
connections here very less is the on and
off switch the power cord port on the
bottom and to the left is a heatsink for
the built-in amplifier now I never was
concerned about the heat generated as
the hd6 only remained warm when these
speakers were blasting over for the time
of moving these around to different
rooms testing these with different
devices the physical build quality has
been exceptional and that wood veneer
held up really well there's no Nick's or
scratches that I've seen the only areas
that I would physically critique as I
mentioned earlier volume indicator knob
or bottom indicator in general would
have been nice but oddly you do receive
all the wires that you need to connect
this except for the Toslink cable I mean
it's only like a three or five dollar
cable but it's all minor and not
deal-breakers these issues and I'm
bringing up here but something I just
really noticed that's all but moving on
to sound quality I'll play several
samples for you guys and I'll give you
my verdict afterwards she's just a girl
when she's on fire
hide it in the fantasy longer than a
highway she's bringing in oil and it's
on fire
feeling the catastrophe but she knows
she can fly away
me down the ground and she's burning it
down
ah
and there you have it folks now sound of
course recorded on my end and then
played through your speakers are not the
best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review here bass is simply
amazing for a two-channel setup these of
course won't vibrate your walls or cause
picture frames to slightly rattle but on
quality sound files and more recent
modern date music bass is very punchy
and almost full-bodied it doesn't sound
bass boosted as they do have a more
natural sound to them yeah it's still
very very solid it's very pleasant and
deep enough for most people regarding
the mid-range with vocals it's clear not
bright nor flat and it complements the
rest of the audio range very well now
testing these add more recent artists
with strong vocal performances like
Adele and Alicia Keys their voices sound
amazing with clarity and distinction
regarding the higher frequencies these
are very good with retaining details of
snare drums banging and cymbal crashes
but the only thing that I did notice and
it's not apparent right away at least
not for me the top-end are ever so
slightly laid-back or gentle again
testing with Adele and Alicia Keys when
they do exhaust their breath into the
higher notes the higher frequencies just
ever so would cut off and you would lose
just a little bit of that depth it's not
bad at all not even close
critiquing as an audiophile that's
something that I did slightly notice
touching based on sound separation
basically left and right audio channels
separation is apparent and you'll
appreciate it but the overall soundstage
for music listening isn't as open as I
would have hoped so hearing some
instruments or singers sounding like
they're in the back while other band
members here are in the front wasn't as
evident as for movies these speakers
does wonders and I would highly
recommend them for providing deep bass
for voices in audio separation a
soundstage does much better for movie
watching however vs. music listening if
you're curious about room sizes small
medium sized rooms hands down these
would do great in large open room slash
studios these would still do great but
it's more for general listening but to
conclude although at first the pricetag
sounds high compared to bookshelf
speakers and for under $1000 you get a
very versatile system that can clear
some clutter here because you don't need
a separate amplifier there's possibly no
need for a subwoofer
on your taste and when you do add in the
audio performance again these are
amazing for entertaining yourself and
those in the room so that's it for this
