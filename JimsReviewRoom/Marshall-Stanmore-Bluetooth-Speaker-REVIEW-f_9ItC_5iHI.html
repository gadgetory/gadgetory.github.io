review room welcome to another review
now after several followers or
subscribers mentioned the Marshall stand
more I looked up some photos and read
about Marshalls history and I had to get
one this is the most expensive Bluetooth
speaker that I've reviewed so far and I
purchased this for 399 dollars here the
states and it comes in both black which
I have here and also cream now what you
receive the box itself is a three and a
half to three and half millimeter audio
cable to power cords one for the states
the other one here is to use over in
Europe and lastly is a user manual
that's very detailed if you ever need it
so without further ado we'll get started
listen closely
now Marshall is known for making apps
and cabinets more specifically for
guitar players in the genre of rock and
roll now it's actually one of the most
recognized names in guitar amps and
Marshalls been around for about 50 years
now and visiting their websites
there's tons of endorsements from bands
and their guitar players sticking with
the Marshall brand over the years and
even decades now with the stand mark it
sticks to that classic look and I'll
admit it's beautiful in my opinion
everything is very well built with its
black leather and iconic gold knobs and
switch now the front has that same
acoustic fret as the amps and keeping
that classic look from the 60s and this
thing is not small either it measures 13
and 3/4 inches wide 7 1/2 inches tall
and a little over 7 inches deep and
although it's bluetooth isn't that meant
to be portable like the other reviews
I've done is a past the controls on top
start with a three-and-a-half millimeter
input for your devices where the red
lights indicating your source of audio
and we'll go over that shortly and with
a stand more you can adjust your value
bass and treble levels with these very
smooth and quality finish knobs and a
source button to select which device you
have connected to and the pairing button
for wireless bluetooth connectivity and
lastly far right here is this large yet
very premium feeling on and off switch
now rotating the rear shows the base
port for the speakers along with
physical inputs such as digital optical
audio that uses light to transmit in
near if not lossless audio signal then
you have your traditional RCA cables so
altogether the stammer connects in four
ways bluetooth 3 half millimeter cable
optical and RCA and lastly is power
saver and standard modes European Union
regulations requires electronics to
consume less than 0.5 watts of power
when on standby
hence the switch but living it on
standard will leave the stammer
connected to your Bluetooth device after
the 20 minute limit when inactive so
everything physically is very well built
but how does it sound though I'll run
through several samples and give you my
verdict afterwards
you
you
let me get a good look at you so flag
fits it's so sick can you get me like a
heaven yeah cuz I got it like yeah flow
so smooth like I got it on tap yeah and
I'm a shake it be a good night while I'm
on my gangland while I'm drinking Bud
Light can you get it when you miss me
like I'm wit whiskey drinking Jim Beam
me baby do you do it do it that way do
you do that
did you take a brain you know that I'm a
beast when I kill it on the piece like a
six on the beach like it's not lagoon
Tish you see the California way we do it
yeah baby she could Californication and
there you have it folks now sound of
course is best heard in person and when
playing through your speakers it's not
the best depiction of audio quality the
hens my review here the Stanmore is more
of a lifestyle product from Marshall
which I believe aims more towards the
general public but playing rock music to
stick to its traditions the stand more
to me is the clearest sound any
Bluetooth speaker that I've heard so far
it's really impressive again coming from
reviewing predominantly Bluetooth
speakers now starting off slow and light
listening to the beginning of under the
bridge and Weezer's say it in so the
highs of the guitar and snare
introductions right off the bat are
crisp and accurate now moving to a song
that involve more layers was earth when
in fire September where the highs are
very pronounced and very accurate as
well the Stanmore does a good job in
distinguishing instruments as they all
have their own distinct sound and with
some lower quality speakers the clarity
can sound jumbled together mid levels
are good as well as that's where most
vocal notes reside in although I like
bass I do prefer clarity and
it's more butter regards to base though
the Stanmore I believe hits it almost
perfectly not hundred percent but almost
it may need a bit more the sub base
category for warmer tonalities I believe
but overall it's a really good balance
in general now listening to something
more modern the sweetest love from Robin
Thicke let's say was very well done
overall and if I ain't got you from
Alicia Keys her voice is still really
immersive hi infidelity in my opinion
the only John was that I really didn't
feel as immersive you can say was house
and techno again it's great that I've
noticed in mid that he√≠s doing well but
again with house and techno when the
beat drops in say Armand Van Buren's mix
around that three-minute mark I wasn't
feeling it and the rhythmic beat through
the song didn't really had me saying
bouncing and nodding my head even
silently nodding it in my mind now the
same lack of immersion was found in the
rap genre as well and although Marshall
does graciously provided just both
settings with the NAB's on top the NAB's
I've noticed are subtle and conservative
in adjusting how things sound but to
wrap things up playing this on maximum
volume with going back to a 50% bass and
treble levels did provide a mostly
distortion free experience and when at
maximum this speaker does get very loud
enough to fill a large room or space
with no problems
testing the range it was as good as the
other Bluetooth speakers bring my iPad
downstairs on the other side of the
house and going through several walls
and the first floor ceiling as well
posed no issues and as a side note most
Bluetooth speakers does have a built-in
battery but the Stanmore is designed to
stay stationary and does not have a
battery pack it has to remain plugged
into the wall but overall is it worth
the $400 premium for a Bluetooth speaker
I say yes the fit and finish loudness
and quality is all great and if you're
into this design it's a home run for you
the Bose Soundlink 3 is a premium
speaker and my personal favorite but for
$100 more the sound is even that much
more louder with the stand mark up
several notches that is you can say now
if you don't need portability this
speaker I believe is worth it so hope
this review helped you in some way
