room you guys have been asked me to
review some budget-friendly items and
one Brinn I totally forgot about is the
Amazon basics in line of goods I kept
hearing some great things about them
looking at the customer reviews most of
their products are getting about four
stars or higher and the prices are
practically dirt-cheap now I personally
pay for this at $40 again off of Amazon
and I place my link in the video
description below that way you guys can
check for the most updated prices so
without further ado my channel is here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review
getting right into this the speaker does
fall into the small category with Amazon
offering a large model for $70 now this
one here measures seven point three
inches wide two point eight inches tall
and two point four inches from the front
to the back now everything on this is
built very well for less than $50 here
the front and rear uses a very stiff
aluminum grille that does help protect
the two drivers on the front and the
woofer and the rear respectively now the
rest of the build is a very glossy
finish here that's very fingerprint
prone and has this pearl paint scheme
going on here which I personally wasn't
too fond of now a deep solid piano black
would have been perfect or even a matte
black would have been even better but
again looks are subjective now the buns
up top are extremely tactile and clicky
offering moving back and skipping
forward songs on either side the volume
up and down buttons here are next and
right in the middle is the function
button used to pair your devices or hang
up phone calls when using this as a
speakerphone now directly below that is
a tiny LED indicating a charge or if the
Bluetooth connection is established now
rotating to the right
is simple on and off switch a microUSB
port for charging the speaker and a 3.5
millimeter port for physically
connecting your device for audio now in
regards to battery life the Amazon
basics offers a very high 15 hours worth
of playback here
I personally tested this leaving this on
at about 50% vibe overnight and I was
able to measure 13 hours and 48 minutes
of use basically until the unit died
compared to others on the market this is
up there and performs longer than most
of the competition now in regards to a
wireless range Amazon's a webpage did
say it should go up to 30 feet here with
my daily driver the Samsung s7 I walked
downstairs here and have a signal pass
through several walls and I didn't have
an issue at all and for my personal test
I was roughly about 40 linear feet so
that's it for the speaker here it's
pretty basic hence the name here there's
no NFC there's no charge up port there's
no water resistance it's not ruggedized
it's simply a portable speaker there to
provide audio now to the moment that
you've been waiting for here I'll play
several songs and then I'll give you my
verdict afterwards
I want you to freeze me and maybe your
hair let me run your body no inhibition
no fear how deep is your love
I
nothing
and there you have it folks now sound
recorded on my end and then play through
your speakers are not the best depiction
of audio quality but hence my review
here now starting off with bass the
woofer on the back does help the little
speaker a bit here we're still not
looking at sub bass levels but this does
beat out the UE role for sure and
possibly one of my favorites the JBL
flip 3 now for most songs that are not -
bass heavy for the price this sounds
decent at moderate volume now for bassy
songs and when volume is up at maximum
levels this doesn't beat the UE roll or
the JBL flip 3 there is some distortion
and it's a little bit of raspy as well
it's a bit noticeable so just a heads up
on that now listening to the mid-range
for the price it does well with vocals
being clear and instruments being
pronounced in a neutral or natural
sounding characteristic as for the highs
although the speaker is loud enough for
small bedrooms and only for casual
listening in midsize environments
thankfully it didn't sound dingy or ear
ringing at the top and now didn't have
any listening fatigue either after
having this blasting for a good hour or
so now as with nearly every Bluetooth
speaker the audio separation of left and
right audio channels is really
experienced any sound stages of course a
bit lacking so overall for the price at
say a percent volume and lower it does
great though the battery life is
exceptional and the build quality is
top-notch but again if you want
something loud and intent on having this
at near maximum volume again the bass
any low-end does distort a bit though it
is noticeable so that's it for the
Amazon basics small bluetooth speaker
