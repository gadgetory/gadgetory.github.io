review room welcome to another review
now Sony's jumping on the bandwagon with
their own smart band not necessarily a
strong focused Fitness monitor but more
of a life monitor recording almost
everything that you do in life through
your phone it's a real unique concept
compared to the many bands I've reviewed
since last year it's priced at just $99
retail making this very budget-friendly
but does it have enough features and the
features you want to justify a purchase
so without further ado we'll get started
starting off with its physical build
sony provides two silicone wristbands
one small on the other large with
notches to fit your wrist the smartband
itself is very lightweight and is
actually one of the lightest I've
reviewed so far the wrist strap itself
is textured and it looks very modern but
sadly over testing and wearing this for
a while now it does attract slight dust
and lint overtime but this can be
remedied by periodically washing the
band away now sony has tested and rated
this at IP 58 certification meaning it's
able to be submerged underwater for a
period of time by wearing this it's been
very comfortable very lightweight and a
strap does stay secure and the band does
come in 9 different colors you can
purchase personas websites in swapping
colors to accessorize for the day is
very easy the main computer is
detachable enabling you to switch bands
now Sony does provide a micro USB
charger that you can connect to either
your computer or in my case I'd use my
existing phone charger to charge the
battery the battery takes just 30
minutes to charge and I'll detail how
long the battery lasts later in the
review and Sony keeps this very simple
with very minimal displays there's just
one button on the side and when pressed
turns on and off the unit but also
you'll switch from daytime or nighttime
mode in all this is indicated by three
consecutive lights for daytime recording
and alternating lights for sleep
recording and before going into the app
itself here are some of the requirements
that you'll need to ensure this works
for you you'll need Android 4.4
Bluetooth 4.0 smart band host smart
connect and the life log app and those
last three items mentioned our apps
found for free in the Google Play Store
in a word of caution this was just from
my experience I had some frustrations on
getting this to install and work the
first time I had to install each app
wait until they updated it and after
each update
I had to manually restart the tablet and
restart the Sony smart band and this
wasn't indicated in the instructions and
typically with any app is just a
download and install procedure but that
wasn't the case here so hopefully with
this information it should go smooth for
you now getting into the app it's a
one-stop shop for all of your
information the very top here is a
graphical timeline that shows your
actions throughout your day and it's
activity
one that shortly now below is a very
simple interface with tiles that updates
periodically with your life bookmarks
calories burned steps taken for the day
how much time you spent walking versus
running how much sleep you've had time
you spent on social media like Facebook
or Twitter in the second row here shows
how many photos you've taken for the day
and the photos itself once you click it
next how much time you spent listening
to music movies playing games reading a
book and the very last icon here I have
is time spent on the Internet in each
category can be clicked on and expanded
for further information here calories
breakdown your day to show where your
most active and the bar chart separates
your passive calories burned versus
calories burned when you're exercising
you can set up a goal to to try to
achieve your efforts in the top right
and you have the ability to compare your
previous days weeks and months worth of
performance now backing out here is the
same exact concept for steps taken
walking and running times with a bar
graph as well with goal setting changes
and different time periods to view but
what is also very well done I believe is
the sleep mode the sleep mode is good to
determine if you're getting a good
night's rest the band just senses any
movements you have during your sleep and
associates that with either light sleep
deep sleep you can distinguish when you
get up and walk around and this feature
is just another tool to help you in
becoming more self-aware of your own
habits now going into the communication
and social media tile the life log app
breaks down which apps you are
specifically on and how much time was
devoted to each this is again the same
for the other tiles like music videos
gaming books and internet surfing the
only real different tile here is your
photos as stated earlier once you click
it you can see what photos you have
taken for that day and once you click on
a photo it brings you to your built-in
photo viewer on your tablet or
smartphone and as stated earlier you
have your visual timeline above where
you simply press play on the top right
corner here and this will scroll through
your day seeing all the icons where you
were active in the activities performed
and while this is moving your metrics or
numbers below populates as well and with
each icon in the timeline you can tap
this and this will review what you had
done at that very time now other
features includes a vibrating alarm that
wakes you up in the morning and also a
vibrating alerts when you're receiving
incoming phone
calls now because there is not a display
you unfortunately don't see who's
calling in
you still need to pull out your phone to
determine if you want to pick up the
phone caller or not the only issue that
I really had was apps that I've used
like Flipboard and Netflix I believe
were categorized in the wrong tiles
Flipboard is mainly for reading of
course but my register time is recorded
under internet news and Netflix was
registered under the gaming tile which
clearly Netflix was meant for video
watching and when using your apps on
your phone or tablet only the app in the
foreground is recorded a perfect example
to help illustrate this is when I have
Pandora on in the background and I'm
working on other apps or just leaving my
phone or tablet playing music that time
is not recorded pandora has sustained
the forefront for it to log in time that
makes sense but the LifeLock app doesn't
record when you have the ability to
technically multitask in regards to
battery life after testing this from a
full charge I was able to achieve four
days and nineteen hours into the unit
died almost 5 days making the Sony
smartband on par with some of the other
competitors out there so as you can see
the LifeLock app with the sony smartband
is unique in seeing how much time you've
been wasting or how much time you've
been productive and all this is logged
automatically and by the end of day and
when we have several months worth of
data to compare it's really intriguing
to see our habits the sony smartband
works but as you've seen so far it's not
as robust or as interactive compared to
some of the other competitors out there
there's no motivational tips extensions
on your goals or much more explanation
and the life logging aspect but for the
price something very simple to use and
data that's just enough to understand
you a little bit better there's a market
out there I believe so I hope this
review has given you some insight and a
deeper look into the app itself please
