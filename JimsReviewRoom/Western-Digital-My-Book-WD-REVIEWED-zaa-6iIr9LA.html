review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at my book from Western
Digital now one of the most important
things that people take for granted
are the photos the movies and also the
documents that you have currently stored
on your computer and several years ago
one of my hard drives actually died and
I didn't lose just my photos which are
very important to me but I did lose a
lot of my business paperwork my old
resumes templates and macros actually
news for work and they're all very
important stuff to me and it was a very
hard lesson to be learned so my book is
one way to prevent such a loss so
without further ado we'll get started on
my review so the model I have here is
the two terabyte version priced at $99
retail now if you need more storage they
do come in bigger sizes as shown on the
screen the model I have here is for
local connections only meaning this
external hard drive only connects
directly to your desktop or laptop with
the supplied USB cable now my book live
which is a different model and hopefully
I can get my hands on that for the next
review is a similar backup solution but
it's only connected with a ethernet cord
and tied directly to your home network
so for this model if you're just backing
up your computer at home and don't
desire to have your content accessible
and your other computers or tablets
through the network and if you're not
intending on moving this hard drive
around either this is a cheaper option
for you in my case I'm just using this
for a personal and business-related
content and for example I won't be
saving movies on here and then playing
the movies through a different device or
a different room or transporting the
hard drive to a different location so
moving ahead here the hard drive
enclosure comes in at six and a half
inches by five point three inches and
only one point nine inches thick and it
weighs in at two and a half pounds again
this product was not necessarily
designed to be moved around on the back
the three and a half inch external hard
drive does need its own power so you do
have to utilize an outlet though as
stated earlier you do have a connection
for the newest and latest USB 3.0 which
can be found in every new computer being
built currently however if your computer
does not have a USB 3.0 port USB 2.0
also
as well albeit it's significantly slower
now lastly regarding its physical
attributes besides having a glossy
fingerprint prone black finish the unit
runs actually quietly with a very small
hum and minor clicks here and there when
the platter hard drive is accessing your
data then under load I didn't notice the
unit becoming too hot where it may
become unstable
now with that all out the way the
software is very important you can plug
in my book to your computer and start
using it right away it's plug and play
technology however it does come with
free software as well in which you can
obtain from Western Digital website or
if the installation disk is provided and
I found it essential to install the
software WD smart where to use the
automatic backup feature now my book
continuously and instantly makes a
second copy of your file right onto the
backup hard drive or you can schedule
the day and time for my book to backup
your system and yes once you install it
on your system for the first time you
can back up your entire computers
content the entire process took maybe
about ten minutes or so to backup my
entire hard drive which consisted of
about 75 gigs of data and the automatic
backup is just that as a test I saved a
new video file right onto my desktop and
checking on WD smart where they found a
new file on the computer right away and
moments later the file was backed up
onto my book it's truly a set it and
forget it kind of concept whatever you
do in the computer the software will
make a copy of it if you needed to
retrieve it later now in regards to
retrieving files you can transfer your
entire computers content or you can
select certain files to be retrieved in
place to its original location all you
do have the option to retrieve that file
and basically put into an assigned
folder in the computer so it's pretty
simple either way but what happens if
you accidentally erase something off of
your computer or maybe even deleted an
entire folder well that same file I save
earlier on the desktop I'm going to
delete it here and then going back to WD
smart where I go through basically the
computer tree and basically look where
the original file was located and as you
can see here it's still available for
basically retrieval there's a
strikethrough
however as soon as I click the checkbox
here and click retrieve it is basically
downloaded or basically reinstalled back
onto my main computer so overall this
thing worked great for mine uses some
other quick features my book has is 256
bit encryption password protection and
also the ability to upload your items to
the cloud via Dropbox and the only
reason why I didn't go deep into Dropbox
is because it's technically a third
party company
aside from Western Digital and then
after their promotional period is over
Dropbox only offers two gigs of free
online storage and when my book holds
over 2,000 gigs of data Dropbox
obviously here is just isn't enough the
only cons I can think about this for my
book and I guess it plagues a lot of the
products in this segment unless you're
willing to spend $700 now there's no
raid configuration raid 1 in simplest
terms allows you to have two hard drives
literally mirroring each other so if one
fails you still have the other one in
most of the consumer level data backup
devices they only have one hard drive
like this one from Western Digital now
if this drive fails you're basically
done everything's gone
second it's nice to have a second hard
drive or second external hard drive like
this one but in event of a fire or maybe
a water damage to your home if your
laptop or computer is damaged and then
your external hard drive is also damaged
you basically lost everything again the
only other alternative is going with
cloud storage so hopefully with this
video I did help you in some way or at
least put you in the right direction on
making a purchase that's more suited for
your needs as always I appreciate all of
your comments and I do read every one
and of course subscribe to the channel

also my Google+ pages as indicated on
the screen and this is Jimmy from Jim's
