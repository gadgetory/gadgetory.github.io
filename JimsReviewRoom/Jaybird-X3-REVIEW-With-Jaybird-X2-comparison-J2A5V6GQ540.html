consider many have been anticipating
when the new experts were coming it's
finally here j-bird then hooked me up by
sending a review unit a few weeks back
here and I've been dying to show you or
at least announce it on my Instagram but
I had to hold off but anyways there's
tons of changes and the first one I
think you'll be excited about is its
price the x-series now retails for a
hundred and twenty nine dollars versus
the $179 price point that they've had in
the past undercutting the power beats
three by a pretty good margin I'll place
my links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time and
also place a link for the X 2's as I'm
sure those have dropped in price pretty
significantly so without further ado my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
gems review because we're too far from
don't over what comes in the package
jboden once again offers an assortment
of fit options silicone and expanding
foam ear tips makes a return but with
this model instead of these sport foam
tips that were offered on the x2s we now
have the isolation model from comply
helping to further block out outside
noises their air wings have been
redesigned featuring more of an angle to
help stain the crevices of your ears in
my previous reviews I've mentioned it
before the X line works for most people
but a select few like myself
unfortunately the earrings would pop out
especially while running now the new ear
fins do help a slight bit though
now the third change here they've
incorporated these same audio output the
canal some calls up a nozzle
other cause of the tube it's the same
design that is as a jaybird freedom's
having the earphones go into my ears a
bit smoother a bit easier with the
previous models you can see the
difference in just how big it was at the
X twos now with the X rays with those
three changes the ear took the your wing
and the tube I'm having much more
success versus the previous generations
now compared to the competition I'll be
up front
I've had other earphones actually be
more comfortable and it goes in with
more ease versus the X threes the other
option though which is how I've been
wearing the x2z now the X threes is the
over your method it does provide a
little bit more for secure hold you
basically use the supply clips to create
some tension and they stay on better
with this alternative method now one of
the features that jaybird is promoting
it's a first for the x-series it's a
smaller profile in turn it sticks out
less and for the average consumer I do
notice the weight isn't pulling the
earbuds out of my ears as much as the
previous generation again this helps a
lot with having the ear buds remain more
stable while wearing overall the build
feels more premium the accent of metal
and chrome on the ends adds a nice touch
and the plastic has a nice coating to
give it some texture there's still water
resistant and jaybird offers that
lifetime sweat proof warranty that we've
seen and testing these my pouring water
all over them here they're still working
perfectly fine now on the end of each
earbud is the battery and essentially
the antenna has moved down to the inline
controller the previous models used a
micro USB cord to charge the earphones
the x3 does
fortunately require a special attachment
a little bummed on that considering if I
do travel or if I just didn't bring that
attachment with me I simply can't charge
it most other sport earphones are still
using the micro USB port which is highly
convenient wherever I go everyone has a
phone charger basically the under flip
side though jaybird is claiming up to
eight hours of use which is still the
industry's operand of battery
performance testing these I was able to
get eight hours and 23 minutes of use at
about 50% volume now j-pod also
discloses there is a new microphone that
has been improved but here's a quick
test for you to judge it you have two
minutes from testing microphone
alright cool how do i how does my voice
sound right now I'm using Jaybirds
brand new earphones in about to hear
kind of background noise with the car
driving five you hear that a little bit
okay let us all for a very light jog and
just let me know if you hear anything
you know a little bit of 100 overall to
clean up the details as usual the
wireless signal is great having the
phone on one side of the house and
walking to the other side was no issues
whatsoever when I use these outdoors
because these are in ear ear phones
there is passive noise isolation that
works great and lastly there is minimal
to no sound leaking at all with the
chamber X threes so as you've seen in
this review so far this total redesign
has improved on itself a lot
it still has the same loudness as the x2
but bass goes deeper while the mids are
still clear and present take the old
earphones off and switching the x3 span
right away I can tell the x-series
offers a more detailed and much more
rich sound from sub bass to the mids
through the high frequencies there's no
listening fatigue there's no tinging
there's no overexposed characteristics
the mids where vocals and most
instruments resides are still forward
and slightly bright which I personally
like in a soundstage has been improved
by offering a wider presence and you're
able to hear distinctly where
instruments are located either
front of you to the side of you etc now
to sum up the experience the biggest
changes are the details and base it has
been increased and a wider soundstages
offered compared to the x/2 but compared
to the competition the x3s gives that
nice base boozy signature while
providing a nice afford vocal
performance than other earphones
sometimes don't offer now I still think
jaybird offers one of the best sound
signatures of any sport earphones at the
moment especially for those listening to
hip-hop EDM pop and if you don't like
the factory audio signature for some
reason or maybe prefer to listen to
instrumental or listening to some
awesome ACDC j-bert introduced a my
sound app which you can use to adjust
your sound profile the app and these
earphones it tunes very well with the
equalizer and so getting out of the way
that you like it there's a good amount
of presets but manually doing it
yourself is quite easy so in the end
here I'll be honest I'm not fond of the
proprietary connection since I use
earphones everywhere not just going to
the gym and back so I can't just leave
the dongle my bookbag and the fit
although it has been improved over the
years I've had other sport earphones
that I've been able to test and they
stay in much easier but again my ears
are probably oddly shaped or so and most
people usually have success with wearing
these Jaybirds but considering
everything that is new on these
earphones though from fit being improved
I have to admit that to the sound
signature and more importantly this
crazy entering price point for its
performance and that's the keyword their
performance this is for sure going to be
one of my most highly recommended sport
earphones for a while so hope this
review helped you in some way be sure to
