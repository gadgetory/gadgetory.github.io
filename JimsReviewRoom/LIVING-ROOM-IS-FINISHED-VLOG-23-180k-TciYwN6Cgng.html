doing good welcome back to another one
of my vlogs the new milestone today is
180,000 subs on the channel here if you
guys are new to the channel I try to
make a vlog at every 10,000 subs and I
mean if you guys are new to the channel
just keep in mind a hand pass the vlogs
look nothing like my my review so just
heads up on that anyways hope you guys
doing good I am out today I am looking
for some caffeine because it is that
time of day again it's about 2 o'clock
and I'm starting to get a little little
sleepy pride pick up a monster or
something like that um and also some
packages I wanted to film something in a
little bit of a different area today
I've been filming at at home in the
studio for quite some time and I haven't
done a recording or vlog in the car it's
been a long time it's how I usually do
it and I also want to unbox some things
in the car for you guys as well so give
me a chance or give me a second here let
me get to the get you to stop and I'll
continue the vlog for you guys alright
guys I recommend getting the white can
is part of the best-tasting one out
there a bomb biast John price I'm pretty
sure all of them are bad for your body
but it's the only thing that actually
works and keeps me up if I ever need a
little kick here I think I'm immune to
soda
anyways got the box for you guys I
personally purchased this from Newegg
little story behind this so for jet home
my computer she is making this weird
grinding noise whenever I put the CPU on
the load and I'm very confident 99% sure
it's coming from the water cooler the
CPU water cooler to have installed if
the Corsair H 100 I v2 or version 2 a
lot of people were saying that it's the
fans the white Corsair provides if the
fans are not that great for some reason
on that particular radiator which is
very unfortunate
they've been quality made products and
this is really the first time ever
experience something like this which
completely sucks but I mean it is what
it is I mean no company is perfect but
the same time is you know it kind of
sucks but a lot of people said it was
the fans I'm hoping I'm hoping it's not
the actual water pump of very people few
people did mention that if it's the
water pump then I'm pretty much screwed
I take a whole thing apart put it
through you know go through the warranty
wait for a month before you get it back
if that and yeah meantime I got to hook
up my traditional you know heatsink and
fan and get arctic silver you know the
whole shebang if you guys know I'm
talking about anyways hopefully it's
just the fans that's making that noise
so I got these as a replacement I did
like setup purchased these these are the
core cierk white edition 120 millimeter
radiator fans to help push that air
through the radiator fins at the 2-pack
and it's probably like 25 bucks or so I
did some research on this this is not
the best ones but again I just got it
because it's coarse here just of you
know match the system it does come with
these blue red and white rings which I
honestly don't care about but what I
want to do for the next computer build
on a computer upgrade technically
is paint these and let me just preface
by saying tastefully paint these and now
make it look cheesy in gold so that way
it matches the system and that is just
keep with the Jen's review room look
which is black and gold black and orange
black yellow kind of that Forge color
foundry colors so hopefully it's just
the fans like I said it's just a
nuisance it just takes time that's it
so anyways next section of the video
here I'm going to show you my living
room and before I show you guys this I
did pre record it like maybe a couple
days ago or so and it was raining
outside so the lighting is not the best
so just a heads up on that just don't
expect you know perfect lighting but
anyways hope you guys enjoy this next
section here let me know in the comment
section below what you guys think and
we're about to start in three two one
you
hey guys back with you here the room is
seriously super simple and most of this
stuff has been items I've been
accumulating over the years this has not
been in one go no I'm a consumer just
like you guys some budget-conscious
where I can be and if I have some play
money then yeah I do like nice stuff
just like anyone else out there so don't
hate because some of this stuff might be
a little bit old in this video but I got
this 55 inch Samsung LG TV it's not 4k
just yet still waiting on 4k to become
mainstream before jumping onboard here
but in the meantime it's still a very
nice television deep colors from Samsung
and still a viewing pleasure
it's an 8000 series TV so at that time
the 8000 series was the second best from
Samsung's HD TV lineup and that's why
I'm not too fond of jumping over to the
new TV so fast these tvs were quite
expensive back in the day if you guys
are interested in specific model numbers
I'll place all the items in the links in
the description below now I did
temporarily have my old out of the box
home theater system employees but I
brought my tower speakers back down from
upstairs to have them showcased in a
living room as you guys can eventually
tell I went with the entire clips set up
here with a massive sub woofer and
reference line of tower speakers I also
have their center channel as well but
sadly it can't fit in the table here so
I'll be able to look out for a
replacement and last around up the audio
side of things when I first moved in I
did install ceiling speakers myself and
they are seriously very easy to do
they're very inexpensive and they do
provide great entertaining value when
you need some ambient background noise
and bear last year rocking my
PlayStation 4 one half time and yes I
will be getting the PlayStation neo and
xbox Scorpio whenever those are released
and that's probably when I'll get myself
a 4k TV so as always here I try to keep
sponsored videos exclusively on my vlog
so it doesn't interfere or jump into my
dedicated review videos you might have
noticed some actually transitions or
changes here video black sponsored this
video and hooked me up with their

living room here and my 180,000 sub vlog
