welcome back to another one of my videos
today we're not necessarily doing a
polished or premium review
it's just really a comparison video that
you guys have been asking for between
the beats X versus the jaybird X trees
and I'm gonna try to really hard to not
confuse the names here in this video but
getting right into this
they beat X its retailing for a hundred
and fifty dollars with the x3 they're
retailing for a hundred and thirty and
what I want to try to figure out is
basically yeah even though these are
cheaper but which one provides the most
value which one fits the best for me in
particular and also general
characteristics to help you hopefully
make a purchase decision so with that
being said I'll include my link down in
the video description below click on my
links they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things go on sale especially with
beats here I believe the power B 3 is on
sale right now for a hundred and fifty
dollars on Amazon again I'll put the
links in the video description but first
up here as you guys can see the beach X
is the an your neck or over your neck
wearing method with in ear ear tips very
similar to be j-bird x3 they're both in
ear earphones now with that being said
the in-ear ear tips on the beach X I
believe does provide a more confident
hold confident feel it does stay snug in
my ear you can do whatever with these
here and they will not fall off
whatsoever I've tested this it's more in
depth in the review but with the jaybird
X threes
no matter which ear tips I tried the ear
wings the combination of small and large
and all that stuff it doesn't stay in
the air quite as well I feel as they'll
be drivers on this thing
or maybe the opening of that ear canal
behind the ear tip itself right here is
it's like a micro fraction just a little
bit bigger than the X threes so when I
put this into my ear canal I feel like
there's a little bit more above it just
feels bigger basically like a little
black egde so it doesn't stay in the ear
as well as the beats X threes and I'm
going to put this on really quick so
this is just one way of wearing this is
there's two options with the jaybird X
threes and that's what makes it pretty
unique here but if I put these in over
time I do feel the ear buds become a
little bit loose and then I'd especially
the right one here and I just have to
like kind of push it in a little bit so
there's vigorous activities I do feel
more confident with the beats X now with
that being said there
is and over the ear we're method and of
course I do use the comply foam ear tip
that they're not on here right now
but the comply foam ears that do help
the over ear method does increase its
stability and it prevents the earphones
from becoming loose even further more
success in that wearing method but again
the beat X at the end of the day still
provides a more secure fit now moving on
here both of them provide an inline
volume controller up and down to hold
those down for a little bit they do
provide
songs to skip and to go back the middle
button can activate Siri and also Google
assistant they're both equivalent and
both of these earphones with the
regarding battery I did test these both
both of have achieved over eight hours
of use a little over eight hours of use
they're rated at eight hours
specifically the only thing that's
really different and probably a big
feature that would determine if you were
going to buy these or not the jaybird X
threes are water resistant sweat proof
the offer and lifetime sweat warranty on
these things too with the beats X when I
first bought them I thought they were
sport earphones myself but after their
testing of course and getting more
familiar with the product these I feel
like are more of a lifestyle product
they are not sport earphones at all you
can see how long these wires stick out
when you're running with these the wires
do bounce everywhere and hips the my
jawline here hits my upper chest etc and
I can hear wire chat or can hear the
sound transfer up to the ear phones and
I can hear it over my knees my music at
times with the j-bert x3 the wire is so
thin and if you wear it behind the neck
again trying to make these app you know
compare apples to apples I barely hear
it at all because it's just really no
weight these things are just super light
the control is very close to my ear lobe
here so there's not much room for it and
bounce around you can say and if I do
wear over the ear there's basically no
movement at all so you don't hear the
wire chatter compared to the beep acts
so with that being said I don't it's not
really apples to apples to compare these
I know people have asked for it and I of
course it's out of curiosity I want to
help you guys in that aspect to
distinguish both of these products but
again sport-oriented
lifetime sweat warranty no water
protection at all and the beats X and
just be careful about that if you sweat
profusely then
take that into consideration so prior to
the point where the the biggest selling
point the biggest change or what would
make your purchase decision is these
sound signatures
Beach X for the beats in general the
earphones our varied based focused and
you love that resonating deep sounding
rumbling towed Beach X is for you with a
jaybird X threes they are a bass boosted
sound signature and is still basically
but it's bass boosted very bright in the
mid for both earphones both of them and
high notes are bright as well but one
leg up you can say j-bird has the my
sound app directly from j-bird bass
doesn't have an included equalizer now
you can download one from the App Store
the Play Store so but these the jaybird
x-rays they tune very well with the
included app you can customize it to a
sound signature that you would like or
you would prefer and I believe because
of that I'll probably lean more towards
being jaybird X threes the reason being
is because they're much more versatile
they're more well rounded so if you are
kind of dancing around a shot I get
basically earphones or not I believe
maybe the X rays with its included app
these tune again very well this might be
for you if you want a little bit less
space you can do it on these and the
sound signatures feel very balanced it
sounds great would it be to X again
you're getting that basic sound
signature it's in your face loud the
jaybird X's are allowed as well I
believe with the sound isolation being
better and the beat X you do have better
a better sound stage I can hear
distinctly you know left and right audio
channels of course but an open sound
stage meaning I can hear audio in front
of me behind me and how open the
soundstage is with the x3 they still
have an open sound stage it's still very
good here but if you make a compare or
direct comparison
I believe the beat X does overcome or
beat the jaybird s3's in that aspect so
that's it for this video here I hope it
helps you in some way to give you an
idea of what may be a better fit for you
