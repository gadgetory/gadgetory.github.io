unboxing by Jim's review room today I
have the Allen Sports trunk bike rack it
mounts to bikes for you and fits on most
sedans they and purchase this back on
March 27th for thirty seven dollars and
seventy five cents plus shipping and
handling and today on Amazon today's
date is April 18 2012 unfortunately it's
gone up it's 52 dollars and 79 cents off
of amazon.com but biking season is back
in session I have a trike not sure I
have a track mountain bike myself I'm
usually just bringing up their trails
around the city here and there's some I
want to say extreme mountain biking but
it's pretty pretty aggressive pretty fun
but today likes it it's just an unboxing
and I want to show you what the box
looks like I'll show you the back side
which has the list of vehicles that it
fits and pressure you can get that on
the website as well just want you know
this particular model by L support is
1:02 DB and again it fits two bikes you
know let me just rotate out it back here
and apologize I'm trying to fit this
into the frame and I've just admire to
the maximum setting and I can - I can't
change it or adjust it any further but I
think it was the list here and like you
said you can probably find a list on
their website and they said if it looks
like it fits most vehicles and what I
personally Drive is a old old 2002 Yoda
salera so we'll see how that fits but
let's give let's get her open here and
see what we got my friend he's a avid
mountain biker as well he has a pretty
that's abstract but and she actually
went out and bought a cheapo bike rack
and he said you know I don't need a
fancy one just get a cheap one that's
fine I went to Walmart Walmart at the
time back in March had their bike racks
for about 50 bucks I said yeah I passed
I looked on Amazon my favorite place to
shop and it was cheaper 37 bucks so I
couldn't go wrong and like you said he
said it's no it wasn't a big deal just
to get a cheaper bike rack so let me
give this a shot and hopefully it works
out for me I'm just going to rotate the
box backwards here and yank this thing
out if I can and I don't want to be too
rough because under this cloth this
white cloth here is glass I got a glass
steagle underneath and that's it box is
empty let me try to get this into frame
as much as I can
instructions but one thing I was a
little bit concerned about and likes I'm
just taking the risk on this was because
it is a cheaper product I just hope that
it doesn't scratch my car but it does
provide ample cushioning here these
pieces of foam are ridiculously thick
but they look like a good fitting most
of it is feels like some kind of a steel
aluminum construction and I got some tie
reps here I didn't bring let me see if I
got my razor here
kit and I just flipped around here and
like I just briefly looking at this it
looks really basic I mean a lot of steel
tubing everywhere and I guess where the
main important parts are cushioned by
this thick foam that's the end of the
aluminum pipes here do have a very soft
the rubber end caps these are the they
have metal plates to mount to the bottom
of your trunk or the bottom of your
bumper now this is what I'm a little bit
concerned about because over time I mean
even you tightly tie this bike rack down
it may chatter or shift or dirt and
debris may collect under here and in
just the slightest vibration or chatter
will cause you know damage to your
vehicle with the interesting obtain so
that's something I'll definitely take a
look on a keep an eye on it once I
install this so that's about it guys
what I'll do is how it you know mounted
on the vehicle mount on my trunk and
take a look at it and also drive down
the highway and see how it performs the
location where I usually go mountain
biking is about 30 minutes on the
highway so it's a pretty good distance
I'll see how it performs and I'm pretty
sure I'll work out Lee said I did see
other good reviews on it mostly good
reviews but like I said you have just a
personal concern now I'm usually pretty
anal about you know trying to keep
things in good condition not having it
stuff scratched specific with my car and
I know my car's 11 or 12 years old so
that's it for this unboxing I do
appreciate your time if you haven't done
so already please like this video and
most importantly subscribe to my channel
to receive a notification of when my
review for this bike rack comes out and
also future products as well and I'll be
doing a bunch more so again I thank you
for your time this is Jimmy with Jim's
review room take care
