review by James review room today we'll
be looking at a Bose Soundlink mini I've
been anticipating this for quite some
time since I do own its bigger brother
the Bose Soundlink speaker 2 now I did
do a review in this already and it's an
excellent speaker but definitely check
out the review for the in-depth analysis
but again we're speaking about the
Soundlink mini and this competes in the
smaller bluetooth speakers segment and
it competes with likes of JBL flip b
Jawbone Jambox or the beats by dre pill
so how does it sound
we'll find out
you
all right so let's get started here so I
purchased this speaker for $199 at the
time of this review now in regards to
price I've had a hard time finding a
cheaper deal from reputable retailers
both online and in store so pretty much
in both fashion they rarely go on sale
so the speaker comes only in silver but
you have skins to put around the unit to
personalize each skin retails for about
$25 and it does come in blue orange or
green the finish itself is very sleek
and clean and it has a sophisticated
feel it's an all aluminum body with
rubberized bottom and rubberized buttons
on top now the speaker weighs in at 1.5
pounds which he does feel heavier than
the other Bluetooth speakers in the in
its segment right now but because of its
weight it really does feel solid and you
want to expect this thing to sound not
good but actually great I guess you can
say when you hold on to it it feels like
it has a lot of meat to it so in regards
to size this speaker stands 2 inches
tall 7 inches wide and 2.3 inches deep
this figure comes with a micro USB wall
charger and a cradle to dock the speaker
for charging you can charge the speaker
without the cradle as well but the
cradle actually came in handy as you
just drop and pick up the speaker at
your desire there's no need to unplug
wires just again pick up and go the
speaker has a front and rear-facing
grille with the front having BOCES
moniker again the buttons on top are
rubber and features on and off mute
volume buttons bluetooth pairing and
lastly the button to connect your device
physically with a three-and-a-half
millimeter cable the aux cable which is
not supply now Bose has two smallest
speakers on the front and directly in
the middle is a passive radiator that
helps with low frequency performance
which in turns means better base and on
the rear also has another passive Raider
so with any subwoofer or speaker that's
great on bass put this against the wall
a corner of the room and you will get an
amazing increase in bass compared to if
you did it so the big question is does
it really perform hey I'll tell you hell
yeah it does so for her speaker in the
small / portable bluetooth segment this
speaker is possibly the best I've heard
so far the bass is amazing surprisingly
it is as good as the bigger
brother the Soundlink - there's just
absolutely no distortion and low-end
whatsoever
so for all you base lovers this is very
pleasing to the ears the highs if you
pay real close attention though had a
slight ringing at the very high pitches
but in general the audio sounds amazing
for the smaller booth to segment that's
what I've heard so far so sounds are
crisp deep and warm so let me play a
small sample here this is recorded on a
condenser microphone with a pop filter
hope you guys enjoy let me show you
yeah and I'm sick of being goodnight
while I'm on my King land while I'm
drinking Bud Light um can you get it
when you miss me like I'm a whiskey
drinking champagne then baby do you do
it do it that way do you do that
did you take a break you know that I'm a
beast when I kill it on the Beast like a
sex on the beach like it's not a girl
just to the California way we go we can
visit you in California Kayla Brianna I
said it might I put it there like
this 24/7 they had the get in
sequence so there's a small sample there
so moving out in connectivity as easy as
you can get I've used my iPad and it's
flawless during setup and you only need
to do it once simply press and hold that
Bluetooth button on the speaker and then
choose the Soundlink mini from your
source device and that's it next time
you need to sync them just press that
Bluetooth button on the speaker itself
and it'll find your phone or device like
it sound link to both claims to memorize
up to six devices and no need to connect
any wires to the speaker itself or
connectivity now the range of the
speaker is decent my house is
approximately 2,400 square feet and
again Bose claims up to 30 feet of
connection so during my test I was able
to get about 35 feet or so
and it went through one wall before the
connections started breaking up at about
30 feet going through several walls and
through the first floor ceiling there
before the connections started breaking
up and lastly the better is intended to
last up to seven hours of continuous
play so this speaker doesn't feature a
speakerphone function like some on the
market today but if you don't think
you're needing to conduct hands-free
phone calls or doing a corporate board
meeting you probably don't even need
that function now the battery life is a
bit lower than the competitors but
honestly I want a speaker that sounds
great first before I consider better
life and besides seven hours of play
isn't too bad at all and prices on other
speakers in this range and the size have
slowly gone down over the years now this
Soundlink many did just come out there
and both again really I've seen reduce
their prices but you honestly get what
you pay for
as my previous review on the Bose
Soundlink speaker - I said Bose was
probably overrated before I listened to
that speaker and TV actually did that
other speaker blew it out of the water
it's an amazing speaker and there's no
exception to this one as well they both
sound like many again phenomenal product
I haven't listened to other Bose
products but the two that I have
listened to so far and owned
I mean bass sound amazing this is
perfect the mids the lows especially the
lows are really good the highs are very
good as well again the like I mentioned
earlier there's a little bit of
tanginess but you have to really pay
attention to that but again it's very
fulfilling it's a very warm sound from
this little speaker here I would
recommend it if you were to purchase it
you know get it free a bedroom your
bathroom and that's where I have my
other speaker located every morning
before I get to work or start work you
know I play that you know bring it on
the boat bring it to the park have an
outdoor barbecue and bring it out there
and you know just entertain your guests
it is a phenomenal speaker but again you
do pay for what you get and again
there's no exception to either one of
these Bose products these sound like
speaker 2 or the Bose mini again these
are both excellent products so that's
about it if you have not yet done so
please subscribe to my channel right now

Google Account get on Facebook and like
me on facebook comm slash Jim's review
