when you're on a tight budget and you
want to spend it right you don't want to
buy it dud tribe it asked me to review
their budget speaker the X movement
after seeing how similar it looked to my
favorites small Bluetooth speaker the
JBL flip before I said this might be a
good comparison I haven't done a budget
review in a while either if you are
budget conscious yourself if you're
about stretching your money comment down
below I need to gauge how many of you
like this kind of review or trying to
stick more so with the more expensive
stuff out there as always being
transparent tribe it sent this over for
a review but my assessment was not
altered in any way I'll go over both
pros and cons and I'll do the same test
that I do on all of my speakers they
also did include a discount code down in
that video description below so if you
do end up buying use that code to save
some money I believe it's about 15% off
or so alright folks
I'm Jimmy with James review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review going over the physical features
the tribe @x Puma has the same rugged
fabric that you find on JBL the Ultimate
Ears and the new Sony speakers there's
similar bass radiators to think jb on
either side then vibrates and pulsates
up and down with your music now both
speakers include a carrying strap as you
guys can see and then last rotating to
the rear it looks very similar once
again power battery level indicator
which is always a plus any water
resistant cap for your connections and
the first real difference that rabbit X
boom claims to offer 360-degree audio
with the JBL 54 it's more directional or
simply front facing front firing walk to
the sides or the back of this thing and
the audio isn't as a parent the second
difference the tribe it doesn't have an
array of buns
instead the buns are located on the
front that somewhat resembles the UE
boom speakers plus and minus to adjust
volume and in the middle is to pause
skip and go back on your music
what's cool though holding that metal
button down does initiate google
assistant on your phone now before I
forget here on the back the tribe it
does have a bass boost button which
demonstrate in the audio test now
although the try bet is the cheaper
option the quality feels practically the
same as the JBL flip for the plastics
base radiators and down to the fabric
feels identical with no exaggeration the
buns although different have that same
tactile feedback as you guys can hear
that clicky and also responsive if I had
to critique though having the buttons
slightly raised would have helped here
and identifying them physically they
both have an IP seven rating which means
both speakers thankfully can be
submerged underwater up to a three point
three feet and up to thirty minutes and
now I love my JBL flat for but during
testing the speaker doesn't float if you
bring this to the pool the lake whatever
and it falls in there the either better
know how to swim down there and get it
or you need to tie this to something
crazy enough the cheaper speaker floats
so before getting into the audio test
let me do a quick rundown of all my
other tests here to try to help you guys
make that purchase decision with the
flip for it you can pair to multiple JBL
connect speakers and have them all play
at the same time with try but you can
only do a dual pair both uses bluetooth
4.2 and do my quick test of leaving the
speaker here in the office in the back
over there and walking down the hallway
both speakers were able to get about
eighty linear feet before the audio
started to crackle that's both very very
good both do take phone calls and works
like a speakerphone both speakers
however did not perform or do well at
all
both had my voice sounding very far away
and at times raspy and staticky that's a
word but if we do compare the tribe it
sounded the worst asthma voice was lower
in volume for the other person and at
times the person I tested this with
could hear their own voice last item to
discuss better life tribe it claims up
to 20 hours of life and JBL claims only
12 I tested both at 50% from like I do
on all my speakers and was able to
achieve 14 hours and 53 minutes which is
impressive as some big speakers I've
tested are only getting that much but
testing the foot for after 14 hours I
still had 50% battery life remaining so
alright folks let's put on your
headphones or earphones if you haven't
already I'll be using professional-grade
bye
neural microphones to get the best audio
experience if you're new to the channel
please try this and for those who have
been part of Jim to review room please
send some fire emojis down in that
comment sachet here yeah keep in mind
the drivers are on the side as well on
the front here you're not gonna get much
direction of ot we kind of turn this
around
it goes the extra base extra base I'm
gonna switch over to eat
JBL support
so first up the tribe it for a
360-degree audio speaker did very well
here only being slightly lower in volume
than the JBL and other various
competitors out there
the sound characteristics and the
quality are very similar with only
slight differences with the JBL the
tribe it has a moderate amount of bass
for a small speaker with or without that
bass boost button on I noticed bass was
more apparent at lower volumes and Vons
higher than 50% the bass boost was
pretty much minimal now although the X
boom isn't the Basya speaker it's very
close to the JBL flip for it doesn't
sound raspier droning but offers a bass
boosted sound signature JBL is also very
similar on that front as well the
mid-range where most vocals and
instruments are heard by the human ear
both performed very similar by offering
a clear and for performance a try but is
slightly less forward though by just a
smidge but comparing to the you wonder
boom that schribman X boom is hands-down
better and the high notes on both do
tend to get slightly stretched these are
technically small speakers but what they
can output is still good quality
there's no ear piercing moments or very
high pitched rings when high hats and
cymbal crashes are hits overall music
has been very much enjoyable on the try
but X boom as it has been on the JBL
flip for in the end both the physical
aspect and also the audio performance it
is nearly identical with the JBL flip
before but yet it does beat the UE 1 or
boom which is also another direct
competitor and it's cheaper than its
competitors this is probably your best
bet
I personally highly recommend this
speaker for you guys to get again I'm
Jimmy with Jim's review room hopefully
hopefully I helped you guys in some way
here be sure to light up the comment
section with fire emojis and follow me
on Facebook Instagram and Twitter
you guys take care I'll catch you guys
on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
