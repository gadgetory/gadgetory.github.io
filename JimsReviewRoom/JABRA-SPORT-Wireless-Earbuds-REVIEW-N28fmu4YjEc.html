review room now several viewers and
followers had asked about the drama
sport plus their Wireless blinked with
earbuds with weather and shock-resistant
features and dropper earlier this year
made a very nice higher-end earbud
system the Jabra rocks priced at $129
retail now the Sport Plus I would
consider middle tier priced at $99 and
Jabra has their newest earbud system the
Jabra step priced at only just $69 which
I'll have a review of my channel so
without further ado we'll see how these
fit how it sounds and some of the unique
features that makes it stand out for the
rest so everyone welcome to another
review right off the bat the Sport Plus
are the biggest of the bunch with an
over the ear design the entire back and
the yellow portion of the earbud is that
silicone rubber like finish giving a lot
of grip when holding while the sides are
a plastic finish the angled part of the
Sport Plus is very flexible and the very
end is the ear but at South with again a
yellow silicon surround now the left ear
but itself doesn't have any controls or
buttons or features but the right
channel has the pause / play button and
slightly above that is the junction
microphone now going to the back here a
better indicator light with volume
controls to follow and last is the FM
button for receiving live local radio
stations and considering these are
wireless they don't have any connections
to physically connect this to your phone
but the only chord that you'll encounter
is as tangle free wire in between while
wearing now this is the most amount of
fitment buds that I've seen but Jabra
provides six in the Box ranging in
different sizes and kind of odd though
with so many different designs instead
of making one good one with varying
sizes now from my experience and I've
been testing many audio related products
including earbuds and headsets this is
the first ever set that I've had where
the silicone tips ripped while being
stretched and placed on and I don't
think I was being too aggressive and I
applied a reasonable amount of effort
and the one earbud tip torn and while
testing other tips for fitment and out
time getting more careful another one
ripped while being more gentle very
disappointed in experiencing this
indicating not so good quality control
on this pair but overall the fitment
works once everything is on though
now these earbuds are not the type to go
inside the ear canal and create that
suction causing a seal you can say
offering sound isolation now instead
these sits outside of your ear canal and
louder background noise can still be
picked up despite having music on so
overall the entire unit is very light
and does well sting and my ears
even when jogging in my casual
weightlifting however this is just from
personal experience I prefer the way the
drawbar rocks fitted considering they're
in your ear canal or the new powerbeats2
although they're not in the ear canal
but they did fit a little bit more snug
to the ear and had less less ear canal
to earbud gap you can say that regarding
its audio quality just for some
background information I'm not a big
bass person myself actually prefer a lot
more balance than heavy bass but I do
very much respect those who do enjoy
more bass Ford headsets but because
these earbuds are not close to the ear
canal as can be I lose very much of that
bass definition and sound it's not bassy
at all tracks from hip hop rap and more
bumping EDM will sound under power to
you and in general listening to more
other genres out there it sounds like
the bass is more off in the distance
almost like you're listening from the
other side of a large yet open room now
regarding the mids where the vocals
resides are good with clarity and
loudness to suffice most listeners
however for more audio files out there
vocals will be missing body and fullness
of sound the highs are thin in my
opinion and not as detailed or
describing this in detail here with some
closed or lacking in openness and
lacking in fine detail but overall sound
quality doesn't sound distorted or bad
in a sense but it lacked immersion that
I personally look for didn't feel hooked
into a song didn't feel connected in the
music and as my channel goes our focus
is more on the average consumer I think
that demographic will feel the same as
well there just wasn't that wow factor
now as we're features this is where
Jabra stands out
as mentioned earlier these are water
dust and shock tested against military
standards per jabra so it should hold up
while you're jogging and sweating or if
you get caught in that rain on your very
last mile
now the Sport Plus also comes with a FM
tuner which works indeed and I think
it's a great feature for times you don't
have Wi-Fi or don't want to use a beta
on your phone or just when you want to
listen to the news in general you can
switch these on real quick and scroll
through the radio stations by holding
down the volume button
the only real downfall is the headset
doesn't tell you what radio frequency or
radio stations that you're on though
there's a very slight hissing as well
when using the FM feature but again
having radio as a sub or secondary
option I believe is a great feature that
I wish other earbuds would have now as
we're testing the microphone option to
accept phone calls works as well as it
should and I would hope so coming from
the company Jabra and in regards to
better life draw our claims up to four
hours of music right on their box but
three hours of music news on their
online instruction booklet which is odd
but the headset does take approximately
two hours to fully charge from a dead
battery and during my personal testing
at 50% volume listening to music the
Sport Plus lasted 3 hours and 50 minutes
to be exact and I usually don't read
reviews on products that because they
usually distract me and what I
personally want to say but I do look at
them if I run into issues from my own
personal tests just to ensure that it's
not just me having problems but if you
go to amazon.com and read the reviews on
there many have mentioned the product
stops working in a relatively short
period of time in other random issues as
well so just be wary of that overall
from my experiences of testing other
headsets I can confidently say for sure
there's other products that are better
for around the same price range
the driver racks although $30 more and a
bit more bassy in a good way for those
baseheads out there they just work
overall much better than the Sport Plus
but also check out the Drobo step review
which just came out of my channel to see
how those sound so hope this review
helped you in some way please take your
time to like and subscribe and also find
me on Facebook Twitter and Google Plus
