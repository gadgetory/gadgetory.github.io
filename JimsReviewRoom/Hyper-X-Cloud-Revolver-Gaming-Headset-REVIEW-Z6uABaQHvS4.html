continue to focus on PC gaming products
on the channel I wanted to review McLeod
revolver headset from HyperX considering
the prices on these are not bad at all
for what it has to offer
now retail it's a hundred and fifty
dollars but on Amazon they're going for
about a hundred and twenty and
considering HyperX is claiming
studio-grade surround sound a quality
built headset and a noise cancelling
microphone this might be a great
alternative to the more expensive
competitors out there now click on my
links in the description below my links
will give you the most updated prices as
of today in real time if you do decide
to purchase it does help go towards the
channel so without further ado my work
is here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review room
going over the physical features these
are a beefy pair of headphones yet with
some originality as well the metal band
going across the top is not only for
Cosmetics it's fixed and it holds the
actual headband in suspension when you
have this on your head the headband
automatically extends up when you put
these down here creating almost like a
floating effect but I'll detail more in
my comfort test shortly moving down to
the ear cups these are huge of 50
millimeter drivers on either side with
very comfortable ear pads that were
softer than the creative soundblaster
ht5 headset that I just finished
reviewing now this is a closed back
design made of plastic with some metal
parts being exposed to touch on the
other side here there's no RGB or any
sort of lighting on these headphones so
these cloud revolvers won't be glowing
while you're playing which I'm perfectly
fine with now as for quality and
durability during my stress test here
these things didn't crack or squeak here
and as HyperX predominately uses the
metal band up top the band doesn't
stretch or bend which is always great
now the only thing though if you aren't
any on traveling with these the cloud
revolvers and don't fold in they again
are pretty bulky now moving down there
is a detachable microphone that's very
flexible I do admit the performance is
very good for a gaming headset here I
notice this does make my noise or nose
I'm sorry a little bit nasally if that's
a word there but comparing to others in
this price range the microphone and the
revolvers here it does perform better
now here's a quick sample alright folks
here is the microphone test on the cloud
revolvers as you guys can hear it sounds
pretty darn good pretty decent for a
pair of headphones again this is the
top-of-the-line model from HyperX so
hopefully we're anticipating some good
audio performance again this is all
completely unedited at any changement
voice or anything and I hope you guys
enjoy this sample here after the review
enjoy the rest getting back to the
headset and finishing up
although the mic is detachable I would
have liked to see the audio cable
removable as well it's long enough
coming in at one meter or 3.3 feet for
those in America here to use with my
PlayStation 4 controller now if you are
intending on using this headset
predominantly on the PC there's an
extension while offering another two
meters or 6.5 feet that splits into a
mic and audio jack now the only problem
if you are a console player though you
don't have microphone capabilities since
the headset controller is on the
extension cable and without that
extension cable the headset will work of
course but you can't mute or adjust
volume so just
heads up on that again if you are a
console player and last regarding
comfort here I did weigh these myself
and got around 336 grams
coming from reviewing tons of other
headphones so far on the channel
anything over 300 grams is usually heavy
to me however these things feel
surprisingly light for the weight and I
think it's very much due to that
suspension system that they're using now
they're just very minor pressure the
crown of the head and right at the
jawline but having these on for about
two hours straight gaming no wearing
fatigue whatsoever but now getting into
the sound test here one of the first
things that you will notice right away
is indeed that open soundstage
headphones do give you a sense of
airiness when you're environments
especially in the division when you're
in the middle of the city hear the
ambient noise around you will flood in
and immerse you into the game now
playing doom this sound is very
expansive the bass is tight is not deep
or rumbling if anything it's more punchy
the mids are great with voice is very
much standing out here almost as though
they're coming from a dedicated center
channel and the highs here although at
highs at times sometimes a little bit
more than what I want though but it's
not ear ringing especially at the log
here it's a game play and there's very
minor listening fatigue after playing
for a good hour to two with behind
pretty much up high but other than that
for personal gaming or even competitive
play the spatial awareness the clear
mids this is the way to go and on all my
headphone and headset reviews here I've
tested this with my DAC or amp and I
didn't notice any improvement on these
ones here putting these right into the
computer words and great from the get-go
so that's basically it for this review
