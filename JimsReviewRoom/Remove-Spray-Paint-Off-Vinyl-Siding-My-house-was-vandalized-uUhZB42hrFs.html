review room welcome to another review so
this morning after getting the newspaper
I found the side of my house vandalized
and yes that is my house in the video
right there and possibly some kid
representing the east side as you can
see in the video and you can imagine I
was pretty upset now it's not too bad
but nonetheless spray paint on vinyl
it's nearly impossible to get out
without damaging the paint on the siding
now I looked all over the internet and
many suggested to use goof-off but it
did leave a haze or blemish from what I
read online so I ran across Matson
Barker's lift-off specifically designed
for spray paint removal on hard soft and
also porous surfaces and this included
vinyl siding now this works on removing
spray paint that's of all sorts of make
where their enamel acrylic primer and
brands like rust-oleum which is a little
bit more unique formula and even down to
permanent markers now the bottle is $8
at Lowe's or Home Depot and keep in mind
you need to test your own area first as
this may cause something damage to your
siding and I'm not responsible for those
damages so be sure to read the
directions and warnings in its entirety
so without further ado let me show you
what did not work and then show you some
tips on how to get this removed so real
quick when I first discovered this mess
I tried using rubbing alcohol
after several wipes with first a paper
towel I'd flip it around just to make
sure that there wasn't any paint
stripping off now when it was safe then
I used an abrasion pan for about $2 at
Lowe's and it helped a bit more now with
the alcohol the results were not the
best but some did come off though
mineral spirits I had laying around in
the garage is usually stronger in my
opinion since it's used on refinishing
wood and other paint or stain issues now
try it with a paper towel first and then
an abrasion pad and just really poor
results surprisingly the rubbing alcohol
did a better job but now I'm getting to
Matson Bacher's never using this
chemical before I work gloves just in
case and yes by the end of this video
the latex did start thinning and the
gloves started to tear and fall apart so
just be a little bit careful there for
Lu no X long exposures that a chemical
now started again with the paper towel
to ensure no paint was coming off and
sure enough it looks fine to me
just the paper towel alone was just
doing justice as you can see the video
now jumping over to the abrasion pad and
this thing eventually works miracles you
do have to spray liberally and press
firmly to get deep into the textured
vinyl if not you'll just smear the spray
paint to non affected areas now in
between abrasion scrubs
I would hose down the excessive residue
so just to reduce the smearing but be
sure to wipe down the excess water now
for this instance here it took two
applications minimum to have everything
removed areas where spray paint is real
deep in the grooves and a text of the
siding was just a little bit too pitted
I guess you can say take about three to
four scrubs in total now be sure to wear
safety goggles as in my sake here the
spray paint was about eye level or at a
height and the mist does get into the
air and I guess the last tip here I
would give is just two by two of the
abrasion pads the first pet eventually
gets gummed up and it starts to smear
everywhere again the pants were just two
dollars each so here's the results right
afterwards looks good like nothing
happened there but there was some minor
errors that still had some residue but
that's because again it was heavily
sprayed and or the texture was really
deep in the vinyl siding now eventually
that was removed with some elbow grease
and patience and lastly here is deciding
later in the day when the Sun isn't
shining directly on there now I was
hoping there wouldn't be any obvious
spots or a paint coming off that I was
not able to see earlier because the
vinyl is wet but as you can see there is
some spotting though the funny thing is
the untouched vinyl is lighter in color
than the areas that were spread and
cleaned now one way they got around this
was to wipe the areas down with a spray
and this helped blend everything
together so in the end it looks
obviously better than not doing anything
at all and it's health a lot cheaper
than replacing panels or making an
insurance claim now after rubbing over
the area at the end of the day with a
paper towel it did help a bit to blend
everything in and hopefully it will stay
that way again
test your area first before trying and
hope this worked as an alternative for
you and be sure to visit my Facebook and
