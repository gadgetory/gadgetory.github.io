hey everyone Jimmy with Jim's review
room before the bose qc25 came outs all
we have really both qc25
a wired version of BOCES legendary noise
cancelling headphones at the time i had
reviewed a little adapter from b tunes
that the headphones wireless great at
the time but looking back now it stuck
out quite a bit and the performance as
indicated in my review was good but not
the best
well ball in the Raven developed the air
mod making the qc25 here Wireless but
offering a much more discreet attachment
it did send me a unit of test air so
this should be interesting to see how
well it performed it retails off of
their website for one hundred and
nineteen dollars
however I've seen them on Amazon for as
low as 69 at the time of this video what
I'll do is I'll leave my links in the
video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time so without
further adieu I'm Jimmy with jims review
and my channel is here to help you make
a purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
before getting into this review I want
to discuss the benefits of any adaptive
not just the air mod itself and heavier
today one if you already own the qc25
obviously it would be much more costly
to either sell or give up your current
qc25 and then go out and buy the QC 35
one could argue though and this is a
very valid point
the QC 35 does have this one big
advantage it does have much better
better life than any one of these
adaptors out there on the market so keep
that in mind when you're trying to make
a purchase decision the second benefit
the accusing 25 does have a switch so
you can turn on or off the active
noise-cancelling feature and still have
the wireless function work the QC 35 has
no option whatsoever at least at the
time of this video third this goes back
to pricing again if you don't own any
Bose headphones just yet bind the QC 25
plus the air mod adapter at its sales
price it's still cheaper than the QC 35
at retail so keep that in mind but
anyways let's jump into the review here
and see how this thing holds up the air
mod is indeed discreet and lightweight
you won't feel any additional weight
whatsoever once you put the headphones
on and of course have the Ehrmann
attached it's completely plastic yet it
does not feel cheap here but it would
seem to snap if you were to accidentally
sit on this the wrong way I would think
that would be a very rare occasion
though now once the air mod is inserted
into the headphones it provides a very
confident and stable fit your standard
power on and off is there which is also
used to activate your Google Voice
commands in Siri which I did confirm to
work vine buns up and down with simple
pause and play button is right in the
middle
now bluetooth pairing is done with that
pause and play button and not with the
on and off switch that I usually find
with other devices that did tripped me
up a little bit here but once you're
aware appears easily every time either
on Apple or Android
now blew through the range is really
good here I did the same test that I do
on my dedicated Bluetooth headphones
same test I do on my own Bluetooth
speakers I usually leave the phone on
one side of the house here and walk
upstairs onto the other side
the air mod itself never lost connection
although the signal did go through
several walls and of course be first for
sealing the last knot before talking
about audio performance battery life is
rated at up to eight hours of use in
during my time testing I've been
averaging about 6 hours and 30 minutes
sometimes at 6 hours and 15 minutes by
the time it dies sometimes 6 hours and
45 minutes it's possibly the only real
downfall that I could see with this
product though and although I'm not
listening to my qc25
for 6 hours straight or so in real-world
use I do have to recharge them more
often than I would like not to mention
when I've personally tested the QC 35
that's the wireless option here I was
able to achieve 23 hours of performance
on one single charge which is phenomenal
recharging is done on their own
proprietary cable that connects via USB
to the two and a half millimeter jack
and the air mod itself now recharging
isn't bad though it takes about an hour
and a half to basically fully charge
from a dead battery so let's start
talking about audio here one of the
things up emitters and the B Tunes
adapter was audio becoming slightly
suppressed versus using the wire and
sometimes that is inherent with just
bluetooth technology of course Bluetooth
has been improving quite a bit here and
with the air mod you don't get that
problem whatsoever music is still plenty
loud here now I've tried time and time
again of trying to see if there was a
true difference by taking the air mod
off sticking back in the wires
of course vice-versa time and time again
I'll be honest I really couldn't tell a
difference for the average consumer you
most likely won't notice a difference
either in equality and the fidelity vs.
using the headphones stock overall I'm
really glad that a third-party roster
they have to work this great here it has
barely any weight that I can tell it
blends in very well cosmetically it
looks pretty natural would be qc25
again the only downfall though was the
better life but other than that if
you're considering of wireless 40
QuietComfort headphones look into the
air mod adapter itself so that's it for
