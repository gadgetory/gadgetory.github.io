by gyms review room today I am looking
at the botch laser rangefinder the DLR
165 now I bought this product two years
ago however it is not currently for sale
anymore on amazon.com where originally
purchased it however there is a
equivalent model with these basically
the same specifications and performance
it is the model DLR 130k and that's for
sale on Amazon for eighty two dollars
and ninety nine cents as of this upload
of this video now I just want to give
you a little bit of background I was a
field adjuster for five years for
property damages for a pretty big
insurance company and every day I would
look at either claims such as fire
damages burnt down kitchens lightning
hit homes and burned down their the
attic and a roof I have looked at the
homes where they have suffered water
damage is a pipe burst in the second
floor water spews and damages all the
first floor suicide that's cars through
buildings etc and I would use this tool
to measure you know drywall framework
doorways for great rooms that are 18 to
20 feet high I can place this on the
ground and shoot all the way up to the
ceiling and measure that one length of a
wall many many uses for this tool and as
you can see I'm used it every day and
there's a lot of wear and tear on it so
I just want to go over the products
exterior and construction style the
products features and specifications and
also the pros and cons at the end of
this video on its performance and usage
so let's get started here the product
itself it is small and lightweight again
it fits easily in your pocket and it
does come with a pouch as well the
pocket can be attached to your belt
which is very convenient as well now the
unit does take triple-a batteries 4 of
them in total and you can see in this
video here I just take off the cap and
reveal them the battery does come in the
box for you which is great so that's a
head plus and the box does come in the
that 4s green color that box is known
for and it's all of its tools and
gadgets and also features the black
rubber grips as well on the sides and
also on the very top of the
tool where it protects the laser and
also be lens as well
now the my particular model shoots up to
125 linear feet
the current model but that is for sale
it's the DLR 130k it measures up to 130
linear feet now this particular unit it
does measure inches inches and feet
decimals and also in metric as well so
there's a wide variety of measurement
readouts that you can select on the fly
by just pressing one button on the tool
for you
it also features measurements of not
only linear feet but also measures area
and volume as well now as you can see in
the video right now I just turned on the
laser and when I press the button it
does offer a measurement and I'm
pressing the button on the lower right
hand corner and it changes the formats
like I said inches or inches and feet or
metric and it cycles through that
process for you in selecting what you
would like or desire now here what
impressing on the upper left hand corner
is changing the amount of area that I
would like to measure again linear feet
square feet or volume of a particular
room or area as well and lastly I press
the center top button and you can see
the abbreviation for Co n comes up it's
basically a continuous laser where I
don't need to press the button wherever
I move the Bosch laser rangefinder it
will measure for me and once I press it
again it's turn it off as you can see
the number stays fixed so let's start
with the pros here again it's
ridiculously easy to use it's literally
just pointing shoot and see what a red
laser is and it would spit out a
measurement for you I like that metric
or the USA system of measuring it it's
very durable they said I've used it for
two years straight five days a week and
I'd use it multiple homes in multiple
areas I've 95 98 degree weather I've
been through you know three floors and
condos probably shoot over 500 different
measurements a day if not more for those
bigger losses dropped it several times
at least you can see a lot
wear and tear on there but again all the
buttons filled still feel perfectly fine
some of the cons I would say is in
bright sunlight or in very very bright
rooms when you shoot the laser sometimes
you can't see especially in far
distances as well you can't really see
the laser Amazon does sell in glasses
that you can put on the pricey the laser
a little bit better I didn't purchase
those I did read some of those reviews
and it does help a little bit so that's
one flaw the other flaw is the the
screen to LCD screen I will show is a
backlit screen as well sometimes when I
do go into basements and I do
measurements of the area down there or
even crawl spaces just measuring a
certain area I can't see it as well as I
should maybe that's just a
recommendation to have that improved or
have that as a feature on that is it a
buy is it a try or is it not buying at
all I would definitely say if your
contractor a claims adjuster if you do a
lot of handyman work yourself at home or
remodeling project it's the way to go
I'll definitely definitely use it but if
you're rarely cutting anything cutting
any wood doing some drywall etc the
old-fashioned $10 you know fat max tape
measure by Stanley might be the way to
go okay so that's it for this review
guys I hope you enjoyed it again this is
the bosch laser rangefinder model DLR
130k as found on amazon.com for the
price of eighty two dollars and ninety
nine cents as of this upload and if you
