me you know I just upgraded to the nest
cam here at the house but today I wanted
to showcase an alternative at the market
that's a bit more reasonably priced
guardzilla reached out to me to showcase
their more budget from the alternative
price that $100 and the are sold at
Target Walmart and Best Buy in addition
to Amazon as well now you can click on
the link in the video description below
for the updated pricing now of course
I'll show you the performance and
features of what this model can and
cannot do so jumping straight into this
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review rom-com I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
video going over the physical features
first it's mainly durable plastic and
very lightweight the camera base in
camera lens behind this tinted dome is
fixed not motorized or adjustable I have
found cameras providing a pivoting neck
to be more versatile but those models do
provide the option of wall mounting
their guns illah model here is designed
to only sit on a flat surface now if you
don't need wall mounting the camera
works fine and does offer enough
vertical viewing height in its video
feed which I'll show later going below
is an LED light that glows in certain
colors when certain settings are in use
now this can be turned completely off
which I always prefer to keep us hidden
in the dark when we're away now below
that similar to the nest cam features a
microphone is present and on the back a
speaker for speakerphone functionality
the microphone does do a great job of
picking up even the smallest of noises
and voices while the speaker in the back
I do which was slightly louder but I
have to admit again the audio quality of
my voice coming through is very clear
though and the very last feature is on
the right side the guardzilla there's a
slot that allows up to a 32 gigabyte
micro SD card to be inserted for local
recording which is a huge plus and every
camera believe should have this feature
now you can have the camera record
continuously and replace your old video
with new one or leave the unit to record
only when there's motion detected and
speaking of motion and introducing you
into the app here the guardzilla offers
you two arm in this arm the security
camera
arming the camera will activate motion
detection when someone walks in the
field of vision the speaker will release
a loud audio high-pitched tone as
demonstrated here the alarm will go off
for 30 seconds on default but you can
adjust this from five seconds all the
way up to a two-minute duration in the
settings now backing out here I'll show
you what the live feed looks like last
since the other features are quick to
explain activity log will show when you
armed and disarmed the guardzilla in
addition any motion activity that's
captured time-stamped and everything now
with motion capture it did a pretty good
job especially in larger areas and open
spaces if you place this in a more
narrow path or area the camera will
still pick up the motion and alert you
but the camera I'm assuming is not fast
enough to take the photo at times living
just an empty room to be seen but again
wide areas works perfectly fine in the
following option the setting allows you
to change your options of receiving
email text and/or a push notification
when the system is armed and motion is
detected
siren settings I have shown you earlier
and adjusting how long the siren is to
go off for auto arm is a unique setting
here that I must show you guys when you
leave your home or your home network
your Wi-Fi network the camera knows and
will automatically put this in armed
mode when you return home it disarms for
you automatically moving forward with
other settings you can adjust motion
sensitivity recording enables you to set
the SD card to only record when an alert
goes off or have it continuously record
guardzilla fine print does indicate with
the 32 gigabyte card this will hold
approximately five days worth of video
before the camera starts to replace the
old file the old video with new ones
basically creating a video loop now
backing out
picture quality adding in camera
changing your password and the rest of
the options are all self-explanatory but
to the part of the review that you've
probably been waiting for the video
quality and it's nighttime performance
the first thing you do notice is the
resolution it's limited to 640 by 480
basically VGA quality to get at least
720p resolution from any major brand on
the market
whether Samsung weddings simply came or
other d-link and Belkin cameras they're
going to run a bit higher around a
hundred and thirty with most at one
hundred and fifty dollars and up the
image and video feed is still very much
usable in fluid but at this resolution
it is hard to discern facial features or
any kind of lettering on one's shirt or
jacket if you're intending on using this
for a general monitoring and general
movement ensuring a workers at a desk or
office or making sure your son or
daughter is home at a certain time in
doing their homework this will work well
in those situations now ask for a night
time performance the distance viewable
is pretty impressive here as you can see
in the video here it goes all the way to
the other side of the house and it
really didn't show any issues at all the
only thing missing from its video
features is the lack of cloud recording
where your video footage is recorded
off-site now I personally don't go for
those services as they do require a
monthly or annual subscription fee and
considering this is a low resolution
camera having video that can tend to
fire intruders face - well really it
defeats the purpose anyways the only
other home that I ran into is the lack
of adjustments to the base or camera
itself wishing that I could tilt up and
down a bit more than what it currently
can do but again for this price range
and depending what your needs are
this camera is still a very good
consideration the guardzilla when
compared to other mainstream $99 cameras
found in major stores this offers very
promising features a robust lineup of
settings and options to customize your
experience and then unique features like
the motion detection alarm does set this
camera apart from others now if you want
clearer video of course then you have to
look beyond be $99 price range so how
this video helped you in some way if you
enjoyed my work be sure to add me on
Facebook Twitter or Instagram and you
get to see something really cool
behind the scenes info and stuff that I
personally do on a daily basis and as
always visit my website jim's review
room comm for news and reviews on things
you might consider buying for yourself
or for others again I'm Jimmy woods
review room comm you guys take care
you'll see in the next one
