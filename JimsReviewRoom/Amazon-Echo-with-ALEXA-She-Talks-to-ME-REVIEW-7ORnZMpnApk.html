room I just did the Amazon tap review a
few days ago and I didn't get into
detail about Alexa as I'll be reviewing
her here in this video now I really want
to see if echo is useful if it is
something that the average consumer
would use and how this thing performs I
purchased this for a hundred and twenty
nine dollars on Prime Day which was
almost two weeks ago but this does
retail for a hundred and seventy nine
dollars and of this video I'll place my
links in the video description below
click on my links and you can check for
the most updated prices in real time so
without further ado my channels here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review
going over the physical features first
looks are subjective you can beat a
judge on that but the quality so far has
been absolutely great with echo it's
physically connected to the wall and
uses your home Wi-Fi making this online
24/7 on the top there's a glowing light
that indicates when Alexa has been
activated and rotated as smooth Ringwood
adjust your volume now less there's a
mute button to turn off the microphone
and to the right has your action button
if you physically need to bring up Alexa
without using your voice commands on the
very top there's a total of seven
microphones allowing the echo to pick up
your voice from nearly any direction and
from my testing this thing works
exceptionally well from speaking far
away to admitting that speaking clearly
first thing in the morning and testing
this when I'm outside of the room Alexa
is able to catch my boys majority of the
time here's a quick sample as proof
Alexa how long is it gonna take me to
get to the airport the fastest route
takes about 24 minutes via I 485 in 977
Alexa please and Drake shuffling Drake
from prime music the UPS Store on selwyn
Avenue is currently closed but will be
open tomorrow from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
the echo can get pretty loud here and at
maximum volume this can be enough for
larger open rooms but when volume is at
8 or above out of 10 which is max saying
Alexa can be quite daunting as she can't
pick up your voice but for most
situations in everyday average consumer
use I normally have volume at 5 to 6 out
of 10 in which the echo does pick up my
voice nearly every time now regarding
audio performance you do truly
experience a 360 degree sound in places
anywhere in the room and you still get
the same experience now I have tested a
bunch of Bluetooth speakers portable
speakers on my channel so far here but I
do admit spatial sound is a bit lacking
here since it's just a single firin
tweeter and one single woofer pointing
up and down instead of outwards so it
doesn't perform as well as again dead
speakers but the audio experience is
still very good for the average consumer
it's clear enough you can tell there is
some bass though the speaker doesn't
distort or crackle and there's minimal
hearing fatigue after long listening
sessions as for speech as the echo can
read audiobooks for you
voices comes off clear well enunciated
and with clarity for any listener to
recognize overall it sounds good
for not being a dedicated Bluetooth
speaker but here's a few audio samples
for your consideration
now getting into Alexa and showing you
guys what she does great and calming
down the hype here what she doesn't do
so great just to have a fair review now
you use this thing every day and I
personally keep this in my bedroom as
I'm getting ready in the morning from
checking the current weather conditions
through simply getting a reminder what
half of my calendar for the day
tremendously helps here are the next
three events announced give away a
winner for one plus three is in progress
and lasts all day tomorrow there's a
jury duty which lasts all day and on
Monday Alexa what's the weather for
tomorrow tomorrow in Charlotte you'll
see partly sunny weather and can expect
a high of 95 and a low of 75 Alexa how
many minutes it was gonna take for me to
get downtown the fastest route takes
about 25 minutes via I 485 in 977 a lots
of Sun up and low for tomorrow 6 a.m.
alarm set for 6:00 a.m. tomorrow
hopefully you're a Prime member and if
you're not a prime member already
through Amazon I would highly recommend
to get it and if you are you do have
access to prime music now I can be very
broad in asking what I would like in
regards to my taste of music here to
being very specific prime means it
usually has what I'm looking for
99% of the time ad free and unlimited
skipping of songs you can also use
Pandora which works as an alternative I
Heart Radio is available
but I noticed asking for specific
stations I normally listen to or
somewhat hard to find for Alexa and I
know many of you guys use Spotify it is
supported but you do have to have a
premium account to use Spotify in
general and keep in mind although you
might not be able to use Apple music or
Google music you can always pair the
echo to your phone like any other
Bluetooth speaker and have audio play
that way directly from your device now
moving the device downstairs into a more
mainstream area and this part might be
very handy for you when a thought pops
up in your head and you don't want to
forget it
Alexa can create either a shopping list
or a to-do list right on the fly and
then the list is saved right onto your
phone to use later now this is also very
cooked friendly when in times you need
conversion of measurements setting up a
timer or ordering items right off your
echo when you do run out the only issue
though and this is with the latter with
making purchases Alexa does have some
trouble in finding the exact item you're
looking for and it does become a little
bit cumbersome at times I eventually
stopped using that feature
here's more demonstrations and seeing
how this performs in real life I added
milk to your shopping list
I've added eggs to your shopping list
with homes slowly transforming into
smart homes Alexa has had a decent
amount of updates recently not only nest
thermostats are able to be controlled
through Alexa but the other popular
brand here in America is honey wealth
they have a smart thermostat that works
too the other brands includes eco be
Scentsy and ven star as other
alternatives smart lightbulbs are slowly
making its way into the market as well
and Philips hue lightbulbs are the most
popular but if you don't want to invest
into Philips and instead smart outlets
Wemo is the perfect option with a Wemo
outlets you can control your normal
everyday lamps and lights via Alexa and
being honest I personally didn't test
this myself as they're quite expensive
but there's tons of other videos out
there that demonstrates Alexa working
with the smarter applications and
devices out
now regarding those who are out and
about Alexa is now able to get movie
times for you based on your zip code
which comes in very handy you can ask
for some suggestions on restaurants in
your local area based on your zip code
again and last is the settings in the
app here or online you can put your work
address on here and simply ask for
traffic updates here's a quick demo
Alexa what movies are playing this
weekend
here are five movies playing near you
this weekend Jason Bourne bad mom's
nerve Barbie Starlight advertiser stop
Alexa what time is Jason Bourne playing
this weekend which day on the weekend
Friday Saturday or Sunday Saturday Jason
Bourne is playing at a few theaters
nearby on Saturday ask me to skip ahead
at any time at Studio movie grille
epicenter 5 show times are 1 o'clock 4
o'clock 7 o'clock and 10 p.m.
Alexa stop Alexa what's the traffic
conditions into the city the fastest
route takes about 26 minutes via I 77
and West 5th Street thank you now
looking at the app here one of the
biggest perks but yet very limited are
these things called skills that amazon
offers there are third-party companies
that once you sync your account with you
can pull up additional information for
example if you do have a Capital One
banking account here you can check your
account balance with your voice now this
is where it does get limited though as
this is possibly the only national bank
that is available I didn't see Bank of
America Wells Fargo Chase etc those are
some of the biggest banks in the nation
there might be one or two other ones but
that's a little bit smaller but again
that's just an example but with the few
that does seem to be beneficial if you
have an account it's great
there are many skills though that didn't
seem worthwhile to explore and try
though now the last thing here and I'm
sure this will be the bulk of all of
your questions for Alexa besides the
time date alarm and weather are really
general questions in your life that
works great for more general questions
but deeper questions are just real time
questions of up to date information
Alex
may have a little bit of trouble but
here's my last set of examples I've
shown you what works and what doesn't
for me and that way you can be to judge
if this is something that you could see
maybe fit into your life here's a quick
example Alexa what time does the Sun set
today sunset is at 8:30 p.m.
Alexa what is aspartate the word
aspartame means an artificial Sweden are
made from aspartic acid exercise Alexa
what is the average of rent in New York
City New York City's average rent is
three thousand six hundred forty nine
dollars Alexa what's the average rent in
San Diego California sorry I don't have
the answer to that question Alexa what's
the average rent in San Diego sorry I
don't have the answer to that question
Alexa who's the most paid athlete in the
world I wasn't able to understand the
question I heard Alexa who's the most
paid athlete in the world sorry I didn't
understand the question I heard Alexa
who is currently leading in Formula one
hmm I can't find the answer to the
question I heard Alexa what is a healthy
heart rate sorry I can't find the answer
to the question I heard Alexa he's set
up an alarm for weekdays at 7 a.m. alarm
set for every weekday at 7 a.m.
Alexa can you set up an alarm from
Monday and Thursday at 8 a.m. I can only
set a one time alarm within the next 24
hours Alexa what's the first rule Fight
Club
don't talk about Fight Club and there
you go folks my review on echo and Alexa
used and tested with the average
consumer in mind
I honestly do use this everyday of
course checking the weather jamming out
in the morning or getting my morning
news it does come in very handy and a
speech recognition is simply amazing
from my test it's not perfect as I've
demonstrated I got to say the echo at
its current state helps a lot and it's
only getting better as Alexa is ever
evolving with software updates so
subscribe guys if you haven't and follow
me
social media keep an eye out for when
Google home is released as I'll be doing
a head-to-head comparison in the near
future you guys take care and I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
