the nectar is
it's true
hey everyone Jimmy with Jim's review
room welcome back to another one of my
videos as you guys know I focus a lot on
audio and video abortion on every one of
my reviews that I do here on this
channel so I want to show you guys
something I've been using for the last
several weeks these are the Sennheiser
and vo headsets now Senna has a
different shot to me and asked me to
demonstrate these for you guys as a
response to this video and instead of
filming in North Carolina where it might
be a little triangle a little quiet as
in to fly us out to New York City of all
places here it has the most life than
most people everything's going on here
to give you guys the best demonstration
possible so please put on your
headphones put on your earphones as this
will give you the best audio experience
again guys these are the Sennheiser and
Bo headsets
all right folks so what are my nails
binder or microphones record audio with
two mics instead of one for Sennheiser
ambi O's in the most simplistic terms
there's basically a microphone in each
one of these earbuds here usually
oriented or separated equal distance to
what your ears are in person
now with the Sennheiser ambience you get
360 degree audio as if you're right
there with me hear me in your left ear
and also hear me in your right ear and
also right behind you these things are
ridiculously easy to use all you have to
do is plug it into your iPhone open up
your camera app and start recording it
that's literally it also besides
listening to music and listening to
Sennheiser's legendary audio experience
and quality you're able to pause and
play a skip songs with the inline
controller there's also an audio
surround feature bump this up and the
microphones amplifies your environment
allowing you to hear what's going on
around you
149 of 140 50s 39 to it yeah we're
making YouTube videos

and let's see if Casey nice tats in his
office
