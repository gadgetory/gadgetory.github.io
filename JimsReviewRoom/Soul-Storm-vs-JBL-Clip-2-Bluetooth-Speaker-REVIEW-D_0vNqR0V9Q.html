were back with you with another budget
review I hadn't tested the JBL clip 2
that was released earlier this year that
was priced at $60 retail today I'm
testing out a very similar competitor
with some very similar features like
waterproofing a small design and an
included carabiner clip to attach this
to your bag or bike or whatever it may
be
so electronics provided these units for
showcasing here and currently they're
going on Amazon for $46 as always I'll
place my links in the good description
below click about links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
so without further adieu my channels
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review
go over the physical features it's
nearly the same size and weight as the
clip to fitting right into the palm of
my hands the exteriors wrapped in a
silicone or rubber like material with a
very strong aluminum grille on top
person this part did not compromise the
speaker at all now there's an included
carabiner that folks can use this to
attach somewhere in the shower or
wherever you'd like the clip isn't as
beefy though as the JBL's but it still
works nonetheless now go over the
buttons there's power up top that also
works for a bluetooth pairing and answer
phone calls button makes this figure
basically work as a speakerphone and
during my testing it sounded pretty good
folks can tell that you're on a
speakerphone though with a very slight
echo but the mic can only pick up my
voice when I may be within 3 to 4 feet
of range beyond that I would have to
speak much louder now finishing up the
buttons here there's a bottom up and
down on either side and if you can hold
it down here you can also skip songs at
the very bottom is an LED light
indicating the storm is charging or
synced and then rotating to the rear
there is no three-and-a-half millimeter
port or wire like the JBL model but
there is a microUSB port for charging
the sole is climbing up to eight hours
of use and with my testing leaving this
on at 50 percent volume and waiting for
this drain the storm lasted nearly
exactly basically eight hours but with
an additional two minutes testing this
at full volume Aksum basically sadly it
only lasted an hour with the JBL clip -
I was able to achieve a crazy 22 hours
at 50% volume and about four and a half
hours at full blast and last one of the
main reasons why you would get either
the JBL clip 2 or the SOL storm
they're both water-resistant however
with the JBL clip 2 its IP 7 rated
meaning JBL can be submerged underwater
and with the soul it is IP 6 rated
meaning it's only splash or spray proof
however during my testing the storm does
float if you accidentally drop us into a
body of water which is great now I
wouldn't recommend doing the following
but I just went ahead and tested it
anyways I press the speaker underwater
several times and the audio still works
fine I didn't experience the muffled
audio when the speaker is wet as some
other consumers have mentioned on Amazon
reviews but the vine does decrease a
slight bit and once it's dried it does
work perfectly fine again now moving on
to the final part here the sound test
I'll play several samples for you guys
and then I'll give you my verdict
afterwards
you're my baby fooling myself lately
looting is what they contain
yes
it's ooh
me to be a sushi
and there you have it folks both
speakers and especially any speaker of
the size you're not going to get big
sound for this price class that's really
geared towards those who really just
needed music in general or maybe
listening in a very small room or just
on a small budget but just want
something better than your cell phone
not to mention portability and before I
forget here they blew through the range
and the speaker performs as well as
other name-brand models having the
speaker on one side of the house and
then using my LG v10 smartphone upstairs
on the opposite side never did I lose
signal but getting back to the sound
test here both speakers surprisingly
sound nearly identical the only way they
can tell a difference if you did have
them side by side or back-to-back here
and both the clip two and the storm has
the same loudness a storm on the other
hand though has an ever so slightly less
amount of bass as you may have noticed
in the audio test that regard the mids
they're clearly perform as well as the
JBL clip two and for the high
frequencies at maximum volume still a
very minor amount of distortion on top
and from both the JBL and soul storm but
overall for the price and size of the
speaker this is still very much
reasonable performance I would say if
you're just needing sound you're not
intending on dropping this into the pool
or lake accidentally that is this storm
is a good alternative for $15 more if
you need peace of mind for waterproofing
your speaker and if you're intending on
using this at full volume most of the
time the JBL clip 2 will be suitable for
your needs at the end of day both still
provides good audio for the price range
and I believe the soul storm is priced
perfectly for how it performs and what
it has to offer so that's it for this
