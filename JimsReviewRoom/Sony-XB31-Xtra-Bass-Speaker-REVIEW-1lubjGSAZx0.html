you guys to suggest some items for me to
review so yes
JBL extreme to here is coming products
and how yes the new Samsung Galaxy gear
is on the calendar now in the meantime
this is the Sony extra base 31 retailing
for $149 but I personally paid 120 as
always up place my affiliate links down
in that video description below click on
my links for the most updated prices in
real time you never know when these
things might go on sale
I don't Jim II with Jim's Ruby room and
I'm here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone
review this video is sponsored by me
visit the website jim's Ruby room comm
and sign up with a free account I might
have a comparison video with this
speaker and JBL and they're quite
shortly alright folks back to the
reviews now all of these Sony speakers
look practically the same if anything
they're now very similar to the JBL
charged JBL extreme 2 or the ue mega
blast was such a highly durable fabric
mesh grille like compared to most other
mainstream bluetooth speakers out there
the Sony XV 31 is still front-facing
front firing directional audio it's not
360 degrees now I'm personally ok with
that as directional audio has always
sounded powerful or more impactful for
me now if I wanted 360 degree audio I
would go with the Bose sound like we've
all plus or the fugu speakers I highly
recommend those now the best and most
improved feature all of the xB speakers
are ip67 certified it's dust proof is
jock resistant from up to 4 feet or 1.2
meters but more importantly to me
they're waterproof from both fresh and
saltwater the number seven in ip67 means
it's capable of being submerged for up
to one meter and up to 30 minutes last
year's model were just splash proof with
my testing the speaker still works and
not all speakers float I tested this
this actually does actually all the xB
speakers do float in water now moving
out of what is new on all xB speakers
even the smaller xB 21 is party booster
chop the back of the speaker and while
you and hopefully your
are around you you can tap on the front
side top and bottom p.m. make of beat
basically now let me know in the comment
section below if you are actually going
to use this feature while you're moving
out or this just plain gimmicky now if
you're going to use it it's actually
audible compared to the sony xba-40 one
where the beat at times
didn't seem loud enough because that
speaker the xba-40 one was just
overpowering what I'm saying party
booster is a usable and functioning
feature if you're into that kind of
thing more so on this particular
mid-tier speaker now looking at the
buttons they're tactile and clicky with
no issues for my testing sony has three
different sound profiles there's
standard extra bass and live sound
unfortunately this is kind of a up what
the hell kind of moment there's no
dedicated button for this you have to
hold down play and the volume down
button for three seconds then the other
matter is you can only switch between
two sound profiles that standard and
extra bass if you want the more spacious
audio experience called live sound you
need to do that with any sony music app
what the hell but all seriousness if
you're not intending on changing the
audio profile often not really a big
deal I'll demo the audio profiles and
the audio test later the up buttons are
located on the rear here behind this
water-resistant flat you can turn off
the lights from the back here and check
your battery life now there's this thing
called WPC for wireless party chain
where you can pair over a hundred sony
speakers together and have them play in
sync now I recommend that route there if
you're planning on using these speakers
in big open areas or events now next to
that is the option to add one other Sony
speaker and have true stereo separation
as a side note I was indeed able to pair
last year Sony XP 20 which is here in my
left hand right here and paired it with
these sony xba-1
if you need directions click the link in
the video description I got directions
on there for you guys now finishing up
the rear there is a USB charge up port
you charge your phone or devices using
the XP 31 just like a power bank and
next to that is a micro USB port to
charge the speaker
an 8-3 1/2 millimeter input for physical
connections then the sony xba-1 offers
bluetooth 4.2 which is perfectly fine
for most average users out there testing
this with my samsung s 8 plus i'm able
to get a range of 68 linear feet with
two walls in between my studio here in
the phone and a speaker basically cutted
out or starting to crackle at that 68
linear feet mark now last but not least
let's talk about the LEDs they pulsate
and glow with your music and there's two
strobe lights on the front here which
aren't blinding but they do help with
the aesthetics with the very limited
customization options though now I'm
hoping by the next year maybe we can
control which way maybe the lights move
creating different patterns etc similar
to the JBL pulse speakers overall I
loved how bright these were and I loved
that they included lights on the side as
well alright on the topic of batteries
sony claims up to 24 hours with the leds
off and without the extra base on i
personally tested this with the leds on
an extra base on similar to how the
average consumer would use them now
letting it play until EO is officially
dead the results are on your screen now
alright folks enough of the physical
stuff here let's get into the quick
audio test be sure to put on your
headphones or earphones as I'll be using
by neural microphones offering you some
of the best audio tests out there before
I start be sure to follow me on Facebook
and Instagram all right here you start
off with standard
all right folks hopefully you guys
enjoyed that
first up the sony xba-1 is perfect for
entertaining and jemmye out in small and
mid-sized rooms it's so capable to be
loud enough for large sized rooms very
open areas but when used for personal
listening for entertaining you're still
getting audio of course in the
background but it's not as defined or as
clear I would highly recommend to buy
this first though and see if it's
suitable for your needs as the xB 41
although louder and more full it's not a
gigantic leap if anything when the xB 30
ones are on sale get two of these
instead of buying just one Sony XP 41
and you'll most likely spend the same
amount of money but you have more room
filling music 2 is of course better than
one now this seems to be common on the
new Sony speakers but vibe 90% or higher
there are times you're going to hear
this rasp Innis and around that upper
base lower mid-range level you'll hear
some flutter it's not on every song but
more noticeable though if you're
standing 10 to 15 feet away from this
speaker not a deal-breaker again but
keep in mind that's when you have this
speaker near maximum Vine they're gonna
notice that jumping into the sound
profile switching between extra bass and
live sound the difference is very
noticeable unlike the xB 41 which
sounded tinny and thin at times when
live mode was on turning this audio
profile on the xB 31 instead it was much
more enjoyable you get really good
assimilated soundstage the audio game
and certain songs does become altered
and does sound a little funny here but
keep in mind live sound isn't perfect
but when it does work it's possibly the
best soundstage simulated experience for
a Bluetooth speaker to date now this is
certainly a bass you speaker and this is
what most people will appreciate it's
called extra bass for a reason when
you're using this speaker for enjoyable
listening and that maximum fine
necessarily the bass is bumping it's
kicking and for this size speaker it's a
very nice thump and compared to every
other speaker in the mid-size category
that is that I have personally tested
Sony beats them in bass the mid-range
were vocals that most instruments are
heard by the human ear the xB third
is super Ford here it's almost visceral
compared to the JBL charge 3 now if you
want to see a head-to-head comparison on
that look in the video description I
might have it there and the only James
reviewer website now is the XP 31 high
fidelity no this speaker isn't to be and
in-your-face
colorful alive bayesian loud all at the
same time here pop EDM hip hop is where
it really shines the hi-hats cymbal
crashes basically the high frequencies
are such are did a really good bit of
attack here on the top and that's sharp
so it's ear piercing I didn't have any
listening fatigue but it's only just
offered enough to be enjoyable
so do I recommend the speaker hell yes
actually prefer this over the bigger XP
41 that I just reviewed because of value
listen if you can get two of these on
sale pair them together and they'll
sound much better than just one xp for
two one I love the waterproofing the
dust proofing and all these speakers I
love knowing that all their speakers
float now even the biggest one
the Audi's look great and I love JBL but
this might take the cake from most
average consumers out there sorry folks
be sure to comment down below light up
the comment section with fire emojis and
again follow me on Facebook and or
Instagram at Jim's review of I see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
