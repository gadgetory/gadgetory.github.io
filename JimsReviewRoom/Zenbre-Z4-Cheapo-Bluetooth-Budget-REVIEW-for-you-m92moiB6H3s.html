room welcome back to another one of my
reviews today we're taking a look at a
budget-friendly Bluetooth speaker this
is the Zen breezy floor that I picked
off of Amazon this is priced at $40
retail as always a place my links that
in that video description below as you
never know when these things might go on
so I don't think it's gonna get any
cheaper than this to be honest with you
guys as always I'm Jimmy with James
Revere and I'm here to help you make
that purchase decision welcome everyone
to another review guard over the
physical features the reason why I
picked this up was because it looked
very similar to JBL flip 4 it's the same
nylon braided fabric grill on the front
this isn't water submersible which is
very unfortunate but again you're only
paying $40 this at least has ipx4 rating
which means that you can splash the crap
out of this thing we did test it here at
the office with our spray bottle as you
guys can see in video we're spraying the
crap it on this thing and it's still
functioning perfectly fine now on the
website it doesn't mention if it's drop
resistant or so I do notice that it uses
some sort of silicone or rubber that
goes over two buttons and of course the
top and the bottom I do want to mention
it's a very hard silicone that is
compared to you some of the other
Bluetooth speakers on the market grant
it again it's only $40
it doesn't claim that strap resistance
but just having something little bit
more beefier maybe a little bit softer
to absorb the impact would have given me
a little bit more peace of mind now
moving out looking at the buttons here
we've got power
we got pause and play we got vine up and
down pretty casual pretty usual now the
vibe up and down if you double tap and
you can skip and go back on songs and
for the pause and play if you do hold
that down you can actually pair two of
these Zen brain z4 speakers together and
have them play in stereo separation the
stereo sound and I'll demonstrate that
pretty shortly for you guys but going
back out here the only thing that I
found missing in regards to features
there's no NFC and also with these
buttons here there's no Google assistant
or Syria which was kind of a bummer here
they have said many times on a channel
we're heading more towards these voice
assistant speakers we don't get that
here now under this flap we have a 3.5
millimeter port for physical connections
which is great and we do have a micro
USB 2.0 ports for charging the device
now under website Lee claimed 3-2
ours are fully charged this thing better
life and their website and this is all
over the place they're claiming 12 to 14
hours I believe I look in your user
manual it was claiming 20 plus hours as
always on this channel just to help you
guys out here within test is at 50%
Environment and we got 21 hours in 27
minutes right on the dot
not too bad at all again for just $40
now moving on we did test phone calls on
this phone calls were absolutely
horrible unfortunately standing about
three feet away from the speaker it was
somewhat audible but once you step out
of that three foot range four feet five
feet and on the microphone sensitivity
is very low you can barely hear anyone
out and I did test this on two different
speakers two different phones and
confirm that it did not work on either
or in other situations now jumping into
bluetooth we did test this this has
bluetooth 4.1 bluetooth 4.0 and up is
still good in my personal book here it's
still good for the average consumer this
claims up to 33 linear feets who we
tested here in the office I left the
speaker back there walked outside the
hallway here and we're still able to
hear music all the way up to 77 linear
feet and that's with my phone going
through two walls and again in a
commercial setting a commercial building
basically we did test this on the iPhone
10 and also these Samsung s 8 plus so
let's get to the audio test as always
put out your headphones and earphones so
you get the best audio experience be

help support this channel and to help
support my work and as always put some
fire emojis in the comment section
alright folks here we go alright folks
make sure you guys have your headphones
or earphones on and I'll be using some
binder or microphones give you guys a 3d
audio experience here it goes
drinking
all right folks hopefully you guys
enjoyed that audio experience jump right
into this if I can compare this figure
with another more mainstream Bluetooth
speaker on the market this sounds more
like a Yui product like the ultimate
ears boom or so the reason why I say
that is just like the Yui speakers this
does not have bass it's not deep it's
not resonating it doesn't help what
genres of like hip hop and rap EDM a lot
of 808 beats it doesn't get that deep
and resonating thump going but like the
Yui speakers at least isn't that raspy
it's not droning into the mid-range it's
not poor quality basically now in
regards to loudness this is more for a
small room I would even say even for a
medium sized room blasting this at 50%
vom it was very low in my personal
opinion putting this up to 75% vom it
gets to the point worth more casual
listening and then at 100% vom that's
when it's loud enough again just for a
small room where I would see this
fitting in the average consumer
lifestyle is again putting this in the
bathroom maybe in a small bedroom dorm
room perfect having this in your garage
to have music play in the background or
so something that your kids would play
with then it would be perfectly fine
there but if you guys are looking for
some really big explosive sound for
medium to large size rooms I would look
elsewhere but then again you're paying
for a lot more for $40.00 this is not
bad for that college student or again
just small confined areas now jumping
into the mid-range this is where the
human ear hears a lot of instruments
vocal detail fidelity resolution do we
get that here unfortunately not and
again I'm not expecting that because
this is a speaker that's under $100 but
we do get a very acceptable amount of
audio that can be used for casual
listening this is where the z4 shines
and again with that price this is where
I would justify a purchase
now as I stated earlier if you really
want to jam out for a small room that is
and you blast this up to 100% in volume
the trebles the hype
frequency's this is where I start to
lose a little bit of detail you do lose
a lot of that resolution and they very
tap-in way it just doesn't sound crisp I
guess you can say you're sharp and just
hearing those little minor details of
like cymbal crashes sneer jumps and such
does help with the immersion you just
don't get that here what I would say is
II for a while is from Zen break it's
more for casual listening back up
Bluetooth speaker have us in the back of
your room back of your car maybe
something for just general use so again
