room not sure if you guys know but I
attempted to make a website for Jim's
review room about two years ago or so
trying to learn everything from scratch
some basic coding some basic HTML etc
and it was somewhat of a learning curve
for sure that is and wix.com sponsored
this video and as always sponsorships do
help me tremendously here and getting
better items for you to basically
showcase here on this channel but Wix
gave me access to their editing software
the same program online that you guys
have access to as well you don't need to
pay for it is completely free and Wix
calm all you have to do is create a
username and password which I'll be
showing you very very shortly here so
what I do they want me to show you guys
how versatile this thing is show you
guys a brief tutorial on how whoops comm
works and hopefully you can try to make
a website for yourself so first up after
signing in here all you guys need to do
is create a username and password no
credit card information is needed for
the time being because everything I'm
doing right now is in the free package
click on my site and click on create a
new site and here this there's your
particular most popular niches or John
Rose of web pages if you're a
photographer you want to showcase your
photography skills if you have a resume
or you're a freelancer this is an
excellent way to get exposure to show
off to the world you know your previous
work experiences of course they're
bloggers out there you can create your
own blog page what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna click on online store that's the
one with the most amount of features
which I can easily show you guys what is
available but once you click on that
there's a slew of templates again this
is all for the online store on the left
here this of course different templates
for those different genres or niches
again but let's just scroll through a
couple of these here show you guys what
everything looks like some of these are
really plain and simple like this one
right here very clean-cut let's click on
one of these items right here
I think there's sound like health juices
or so let's click on another one let's
click on the one to the left of it click
on view if you guys sell them t-shirts
hats whatever it may be
it goes another template you guys can
use this one's a little bit more chic
pretty straightforward
yeah bit hovering feature we can hover
over the item kind of zooms in a little
bit give it a little bit more
personality gives it a little bit more
what you call it dynamic to your webpage
here and it kind of gives you an idea of
what is offered it's from very basic
really clean to pretty pretty slick
stuff it's not a how you can say it's
not a really generic build it's pretty
powerful you can have videos playing in
the background like I'm showing you guys
here have static images where it stays
fixed on your page while the viewer
Scrolls down like I said this is all
completely customizable so anyways let's
get back out here I'm gonna pick a
simple one let's click on this one or a
quick I'm just randomly choosing one
let's click on edit and again this is
the free version which I'm showing you
guys right now all the tools that are
shown on here is the same tools that you
guys would have yourself with the
e-commerce platform if you are opening
up an e store which is the genre or
industry that I'm showing you guys right
now that does require the premium plan
I'm going to show you guys a premium
plan pricing which is not bad at all it
starts off at like five dollars a month
and goes up to $25 a month now each of
course does offer different types of
bandwidth and of course storage space as
well
if you go with the free version it
offers you 500 megabytes of storage and
500 megabytes of bandwidth that's not
bad if you're considering of just making
a like a blogging website maybe if
you're starting out it's great if you're
maybe doing a like a resume upload a
portfolio upload where you're not
anticipating many people to look at your
webpage just yet
the free version will be perfectly fine
for you but if you a little bit more
serious about like selling stuff online
having google analytics and metrics
being measured the premium plans are of
course the option to go but anyways back
to the Wix editor here everything is
customizable let's click on this I can
change the image let's randomly pick one
of my photos here
here goes the UE roll to that I reviewed
a little while back you can literally
just click on anything
and just type in your new font uh I'm
gonna make our type in your new text
there's a new year sale let's go all out
here let's say it's a up to 45% off of
my goods here and everything literally
is moveable like so doesn't make sure
everything fits here and color wise you
can change that as well click on custom
customize like make a little bit more
transparent and let's give it a nice
cool blue let's say I don't know like
said isn't that meant to be pretty but
this is just showing you guys how easily
customizable this thing is again with
these images here you just click Change
image I don't something random in here
for God's sakes let's say choose image
and let's see fonts and let's put this
up here like so you can click on here to
the far left there's other apps and
tools that you guys have at your
disposal I notice up on the top right
there's no social media links so let me
do that for now looks like on social and
I like the ones with colors that way it
stands out a little bit more again click
drag drop and of course this is just
telling you that with the header which
is the very top portion of your website
it's a fixed or static image so no
matter what page the viewer is looking
at this will always be up there same
thing with the footer which is on the
very bottom this will always stay on
every webpage that Avira will see so I'm
gonna leave this up here and of course I
can link my social media accounts to my
web page so instead of absolutely
Facebook that kind of slash Wix
this will be Jim's review room and we're
gonna basically see done we're gonna
open up in a new window we don't want
customers to close out our current
windows wouldn't leave that there this
is gonna be a web address and let's say
done close I'm just gonna leave that
right there of course you can do the
same thing with the other ones not many
people are using Google+ let me just
delete that we don't
that down there delete please okay there
we go
and we just move that a little bit over
to the right make sure it is a little
bit clean-cut there okay next up is
inventory management now this was
something that is sometimes tough to do
sometimes tough to manage with the Wix
editor it's a little bit easier actually
a lot easier the reason being is because
once you add in a new product I'm gonna
show you guys step by step here let's
say since I got the be you know h6s here
let's apply the binos we're gonna call
it the be in oh this is all headphones
just for simplicity sake it doesn't need
to be a specific model let's say these
are $599 here great over ear headphones
that uh rose gold there we go
delete that extra are and what's
important is here that you could
actually input your SKU number or a SKU
number for the particular product so you
can have the ability to track your sales
I'm gonna make up some fake number here
the weight for shipping purposes let's
say the total package with the box let's
say it's about 10 pounds of show or
maybe a little bit more realistic let's
say five pounds to ship you can adjust
your return policy or care and
instructions let's say you just
basically want to have a 14 14 day
return policy if you're awesome you want
to offer a 30 day return policy you can
of course include that in there of
course has to be a new condition just
type that in there for yourself
quickly in put that in there and
important as well the color options and
this goes option one won't choose color
and of course we've got rose gold and
we're trying to find the closest color
do that so that's great that you can
actually choose your individual colors
more importantly you can customize the
name of those colors so instead of just
calling something white basically let's
say that's no white let's call it arctic
white like so and put a comma and I'll
basically choose white right here I'm
gonna call Arctic white and we're gonna
call another pair of these binos
stealth black let's just do that and and
click done and we click save and that's
basically it your headphones are now
within your inventory management system
very neat very quick and easy very
simple of course you can put this into
your headphones categories category that
is so if anyone is looking up for
headphones the binos would of course
show up here there's also the trek
inventory section which is a godsend
let's say in shop I know that I have 20
units on the shelf and let's say at the
end of you know 20 units or so when I
completely run out these system wicks
calm will automatically say this is sold
out online you do not need to track it
yourself your customers won't say hey
these were listed in stock on your
website why basically you know your
website isn't that up-to-date so that's
one excellent feature right there that I
know some other websites do not have so
let's get out of that close out of here
and that's inventory management let's go
a little bit further and show you guys
what other images or what other I don't
know specialties I can add for you guys
let me move this down here I'm gonna add
in an element or a some photos here for
reviewing and let's see it's a gallery
and of course we got there's a really
cool special one right here which is you
know the diamond patterns we can click
that click the word delete on our
keyboard we can do the grid very simple
and straightforward very classic I'm
gonna do that and if we want to change
our images one thing that I loved about
this is click on add images use your
social media I have already linked my
Instagram account and I my Instagram
account of course I try to make or take
the best photos that I can here and I'm
gonna use these photos for my website so
it's already uploaded it's already on
Instagram let me click on the 1000 acts
here from Sony another 1000 x QC 30s
from Bo's Harman Kardon Bluetooth
speaker and we got the JBL Everest elite
700 and my my personal computer at home
the forge basically is the name of my
computer so we're gonna add that to the
gallery wait for it to upload basically
and we're gonna delete some of these
photos which we don't need it all
anymore
just a couple and click done and you see
some of my photos or my photos basically
are now I'm the main page so very quick
and straightforward here whoops very
quick and straightforward and I'm going
to extend you can basically make this a
little bit bigger so you can see how
streamlined is everything is literally
click and drag and drop you can
customize anything on this webpage now
one of the things I want to talk about
is any time that you create a desktop
version of your web page which is what
you guys have in front of you right now
there is a mobile version that's
automatically generated so this is the
mobile version Mobile is very important
today since everyone is basically buying
stuff and using their cell phones more
so sometimes than their at-home desktop
and as you can see here this is what it
would look like on your cell phone your
sink headers shown here
your logo the name of your company your
social media links that I personally put
up there earlier is here as well you got
your menu drop-down box and you got your
main banner that we created earlier that
image I showed you just now the gallery
of photos here and then scrolling down
you got your items that are listed for
sale look at that you can actually click
and scroll through the particular
products that you have listed go down
here you got your some of your sponsors
or so and then of course your footer so
everything is transported or transferred
over to the mobile version automatically
seamless for you which is very
straightforward let me click on save and
here goes the actual website
again as you can see here my website is
Jim's Bama Mets the email address that I
used to create this here that with site
comm again if you do go with the premium
version you get your own domain which is
a little bit more professional or a
little bit more straightforward so I'm
gonna click publish now and I'm gonna
view the site so if you guys right now
go on to your web page and just type in
this website you will see this act
xual webpage that I created just enough
for this particular sponsored video and
as you can see pretty straightforward
and that's basically a very streamlined
very straightforward everything is
customizable the image the management
for the inventory is I think it's very
good for a very simple drag-and-drop web
editor so again that's wix.com for you

information down in the video
