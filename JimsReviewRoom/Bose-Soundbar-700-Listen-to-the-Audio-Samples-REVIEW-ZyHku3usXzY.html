700 review it's not cheap it's not for
the average consumer and for some reason
it's been a hot request lately on the
channel so I personally paid for this at
the retail price of seven hundred and
ninety nine dollars and at that price
point it's not too bad for a premium
sound bar most of my premium sound about
reviews have been over on that price
point but what the competitors offer
that boast doesn't is a sub woofer that
alone from Bose was sent you back an
extra $700 which is insane it not to
mention we don't even get Dolby Atmos
and this thing so what I'm thinking it's
gonna sound really good but for the
price it might actually kill a deal but
I could be wrong here but we have to
wait and see until the end of this
review folks I'll leave my affiliate

life was outliers by Malcolm Gladwell

those links will be in the video
description below but folks let's get
back to that review so first going over
the physical features here's everything
that you get very straightforward but
one item that is truly unique here is
the headband that you wear to calibrate
the audio other than that the only thing
that doesn't come included is the wall
mounting bracket that's about $40 more
direct from Bose now that sound bar
itself is gorgeous with a metal wrap the
grille on the front the top is tempered
glass that helps supplement the
aesthetics of your entertainment area
now although it looks super premium here
it is a fingerprint room and a dust
magnet over time it's not an issue for
me personally since it's a trade off for
the looks but my bear concern does it
reflect the TV screen it does at some
angles though but when it does reflect
the TV I never felt as though it was
glaring or
tracting even those with recessed
lighting in my case I have simple track
lighting
I never said holy crap it looks horrible
I don't think it will bother most
consumers out there but it's something
for you guys to look out for another
thing for reference my TV in the
background is 65 inches as you can see
the soundbar doesn't go all the way to
the left and the right here but it still
fits perfectly fun I think it still
complements the TV in that center
console the TV console as well you can
be the judge with your own setup
finishing up the top there are no
playback features but there is a touch
sensitive area to activate Alexa or mute
the microphone so you don't activate her
that's the newest feature on some bars
these days and more some bars are now
including voice assistance to supplement
the experience having Alexa built in is
highly convenient here and with testing
the microphones from various distances
it's working great even having very far
distances I just wish that Google
assistant would finally update onto the
sound bar it has not yet done so at the
time of this video now taking a look at
the rear the most important connection
is HDMI with audio return channel
connect all of your media to your TV and
if your TV has the audio return channel
abbreviated arc if has that HDMI port
only one wire needs to run to the sub
bar then if you don't have this port on
your TV the sandbar 700 gives you an
optical cable port as the alternative
the last physical item I want to show is
how big this darn remote is it is huge
but it is a backlit universal remotes
eliminating the two other controllers
that I personally have here at the
studio one for my blu-ray player and the
other one for the TV also it uses
bluetooth so you don't need a line of
sight you can behind stand behind a
cabin or sup like that behind your desk
you know still function perfectly fine
now last but not least here's a rundown
of the other features before I jump into
the audio performance and you guys get
to sample the audio as well so there is
bluetooth out here so you can connect
your phone to this and play music
wirelessly that's a plus there is no
HDMI pass-through for the new sambar 700
and 500 again all audio sources connects
to the TV and then one
Abel goes through the soundbar the
sambar 700 and the smaller sambar 500 at
least at the time of this video does not
work with Bose soundTouch products
meaning there's no multi room playback
that's a bit unfortunate since BOCES
main competitor these Sonos playbar
which is very similar in price can play
with other sono speakers that you can
purchase over time and build up your
audio establishment in your household
here you can play music in multiple
rooms basically now from my research I
also found that Apple AirPlay and Google
assistants will be coming to the sambar
very soon which is a huge plus for me
they said early 2019 but here you are
I'm still waiting but just imagine
calling or telling Google assistant to
turn on your TV to play YouTube or
Netflix with your voice only that'd be
really cool alright folks be sure to put
on your earphones or headphones to get
the 3d audio experience especially for
these sound bars here as I'll be using
my by neural microphones and to help
support channel please subscribe you
haven't already but be sure to like and
comment down below with some fire emojis
to show your support for team jims
preview room all right folks here we go
sucks I luck on three but a dumped his
ass all right that makes sense
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded on my end here
and then played through your speakers
are not the best depiction of audio
quality but hence my review here the
sound bar 700 sounds impeccably clear I
know I haven't tested every sound bar
out there in the market obviously but I
have tested a lot of the best models
offered by very good brands out there
such as LG clips and Yamaha Bose has
this extra Sparkle this resolution this
detail that beats out everyone so far in
the studio the closest that I've gotten
has been the LG sambar and the Bose
beats that by just a smidge but jumping
into bass here Bose has the least amount
of distortion the scene from Bright's I
know it's not the best movie in the
world here but the audio sample was
really darn good in person that's seen
with the gunfire and the dogs in the
background both even without that
subwoofer provides this refined punch in
each bullet fired and when I mean
punched that's possibly the best way
that I can describe its fast as punches
direct the LG comes very close to it but
it's a little bit more muddy and not as
punchy as the bose sound bar getting
into the mid-range this is where the
boast really shines
bassam bar 700 pushes the vocals and
voices to the very much forefront and
does the sophisticated execution of
audio separation not only do you have
clear and distinct left and right
channels not only do you have this
airiness of audio coming from different
angles you can interpret audio maybe
slightly to your left here and some to
the very far right but the fact that
audio separation is very apparent you
can hear each sound affect the audio is
not performing on this one single plane
you can sense layers of depth and that's
very impressive now the biggest outlier
and many will debate this both is
missing Atmos from my testing Bose does
a phenomenal job for not having a true
Atmos setup you can still hear our audio
slightly above you from there very well
to to soundstage but having trudeau be
at most speakers then you can clearly
make those sounds above you above your
head those are noticeable then I
wouldn't knock Bose per se for not
having Atmos because they're still
getting a very good audio experience
it's not there yet but very good now
touching on the high frequencies I never
had any listening fatigue in every kind
of your screeching or ear piercing
moments especially during those
high-pitched noises screams jets flying
buyers some sort like that those high
frequencies are very much kept within
reason no overall just a sound bar by
itself it's the best that I've heard so
far I love my clips
RSB 14 when it was released but it's
starting to show its age that LG's sound
bar which is a newer sound bar that I've
tested is amazing and has very similar
characteristics with Bose but that Bose
700 had a bit more refinement and again
the key word here is clarity even though
the Bose was smaller that thing still
produced as much bass as that much
bigger LG sound bar that I have and now
this leads me to that subwoofer for the
extra $700 is it worth it assemble for
in general and my humble opinion here it
is a must for any home you need to quote
feel the explosions you need to feel the
vibration of the truck rumbling by and
fast and furious this stop of the
jaegers and Pacific Rim the explosions
and infinity war the base module bose
provides fulfills all of that without a
doubt I would say if you can get it this
leads me for this sound bar plus the
subwoofer now we're talking about a
total package of $1500 you know I
haven't tested Sonos yet but at least I
can say the LG model is around $1000 at
the time this video which includes a sub
and Dolby Atmos so you're saving about
$500 but I'll admit it's just not as
clean sounding I would say if you're on
a budget so your budget conscious I
would say look at LG maybe some other
newer sound bars are the way to go but
if you can shell out that additional
$500 make a couple more deals at work
final dollars is not a big deal to you
or maybe you can back off and eat ramen
and Bagel Bites for a while you can get
the best audio
with boats right now it's crazy how
boats always seems to be overpriced but
when I test them to execute really
really well again I just wish that
Google assistant was on here I wish
there was multi room capabilities to
compete against Sonos as well but other
than that man this sounded so flippin
good on that guy's down in comment
section below let me know what you think
is it overpriced over budget for you or
do you get what you pay for
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review hopefully
this video helped you in some way helped
you in making that purchase decision
I'll catch you guys on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
