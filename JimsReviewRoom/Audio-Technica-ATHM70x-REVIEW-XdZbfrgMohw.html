review room now audio-technica's has
always received much praise offering
tons of value for the sound quality that
you get now when you hear that you think
specifically of the audio Technica's MTH
50x it's their most popular professional
studio monitors nonetheless possibly the
most popular pair at their entire lineup
now they just release their flagship
monitoring headphones priced on their
website for $419 and i was able to buy
them for 300 so let's see how they sound
to me considered i've tested pairs from
sennheiser boasts beats and the likes
and tell you what you think so without
further ado welcome to Jim's review over
the physical features first it's clear
that the headphones are not flashy no
high-end materials skips out on the
fancy stitching it's just simple no fuss
mat in your face of fashion statements
now you can look closely and you can
tell the plastic snoozed are not
anything special but it's not a cheap
material either nonetheless this updated
look actually works and good in my
opinion Audio Technica provides just the
right touch of plastics leather like
material and aluminum arms and accents
on the M 70s now when I'm putting this
side-by-side the M 50s you can see these
slight differences in styling now
starting with the top and moving down
the band is majority all plastic with
the crown of the band offering a decent
amount of cushion now I was kind of
shocked considering the M 50s 40s 30s
and even down to the M 20s offer a full
ban of leather and the cheaper
headphones are wider offering of course
and beefed your look but possibly better
support but more on my comfort test
later now moving down the aluminum and
not plastic extensions are built very
well very cliquey but more importantly
they do stay in one place now each ear
cup does swivel fully out and several
degrees back which works fine and I've
noticed this design similar to other
headphone manufacturers before now with
the M 50s they do swivel a full 180
degrees offering more range you can say
but the limitation and the M 70s doesn't
seem to hurt fitment
most head sizes now the feature I found
missing is the mid grade level models do
offer much easier stowing by folding
inward while my new monitors don't now
that may be an issue for something while
others may not be an issue at all now
moving to the earcup themselves these
are a matte black finish with now the
logo being made of milled aluminum
giving a nice subtle aesthetic look
while feeling slightly more premium than
all the other models before it now as
for the ear pads they are just enough to
be good and not pose any issues now
removing each ear cup for a possible
replacement down the road is easy enough
by just pulling and then reaching them
back in now the last feature I wanted to
show before I go into my comfort test is
the locking three-and-a-half millimeter
connection the three wires that comes
with the headphones basically slide in
twist and it provides a very secure hold
and the three detachable wires are one
super long nine foot cable basically
three meters straight the other is a
coil cable when short it's four feet or
1.2 meters and it fully extends out to 3
meters and the last one here which I
love is just a plain short 1.2 meter for
casual listening basically about a four
foot cable that's perfect for connecting
to your phone making this perfect for
on-the-go
now this doesn't bother me too much but
there's no volume or media controls no
inline mic as well with any of the
quartz provided so overall when
listening to this it's quite comfortable
even though it's not as plush as say
these Samsung level overs or the Beats
products now I had worn these for one
long stint of three and a half hours
straight and the air is where I test all
my headphones is the crown of the head
and the jawline so no wearing fatigue
was noticed no sharpness of pain on top
as I do encounter this with some other
headphones at the market now at first
these did feel like they clenched a bit
right at the jawbone
but after breaking these in I didn't
notice any issues there as well now one
thing I must say just within the first
30 minutes I did feel my ears heat up a
bit and he stayed slightly warm
afterwards but overall never did I sweat
or encounter any further issues now I
have to say the minimum design does work
and it truly feels like Audio Technica
knew exactly what the
was for indesign and application but
still retain its quality subtle looks
and just enough comforts and for those
who do own the m50x here's a real quick
look at the ear-cups
side-by-side showing a proving that
they're almost the same size matter of
fact they're both nearly the same weight
with the m50 s weighing in at about 200
85 grams while the M 70 s weighs in at
about 280 pretty much average weight
when compared to other manufacturers and
regarding sound leaking here's my test
and you can see on screen this room is
100% quiet nothing han insu net plays
MIOSHA certified in decibel meter about
two feet away which I try to simulate
someone sitting right next to me and I'm
trying to say quiet here's the results
so after all that being discussed how's
the sound test and keep in mind my
review still comes from the standpoint
of the average consumer the m70 provides
some of the most balanced or neutral
characteristics of any headphones that
I've tried and that's where these
headphones really do shine the details
are very clear and crisp and to briefly
compare the EM 70s do get louder than
the EM 50s where both are set at the
maximum volume but on very high notes
cymbal crashes and very much s sounding
notes the m-72 do get slightly distorted
now however when I lower the volume down
to a more reasonable level equivalent to
that of the maximum volume and M 50s
everything sounds within harmony now
when compared to other brands the
quality is quite distinct and does offer
a very clean sound again voices are
crisp and clear but with other
instruments in the mid-range being very
much identifiable now moving down to the
lower frequencies bass virtually has no
Distortion
but I'll MIT basses distortion-free I
believe because it's so lightly hits
these headphones work better for artists
like John Legend Robin Thicke Michael
Buble even other songs of maroon
in one Republic where guitars the piano
and voices are the focal points no rock
and alternative music works quite well -
with voices forward enough to hear even
a slight nuances of artists taking a
breath and for those looking for deep
bass or slightly more bass ford
headphones to get that 808 beat thumping
it's not there granted an equaliser does
work I'm just reviewing this right out
the box and considering most modern-day
music are more synthesized and has
electronic dance music applied pop and
hip-hop / rap still sounds good because
of the clarity but it doesn't get my
head nodding to the music at least it's
not as much as some of the other
headphones out there and I'm not talking
about getting close to the beats by dre
headphones but more on the level of say
the Sennheiser Momentum's and the likes
now there's no artificial base or an
emphasis on bass whatsoever now the
sound signature I would say it's not
flat but I believe it's neutral and just
balanced and clean audio now some may
like the sound signature as it may sound
more accurate to you or others do prefer
a bit more rich or warmth to their music
and now for those who do own the m50 s
currently and curious to know if there's
a big difference to be honest it's not
as distinct besides the obvious
higher volume notice at the EM 70s once
it lowered the ladder to the same volume
levels playing the same song and
switching one right after the other
I found the EM seventies do offer a
slightly richer sound a slight increase
in spatial sound slightly a bit more
warmth in the music over the EM 50s that
is there's just a bit more immersion in
detail of the fine notes with the EM 70s
but with that being said it's so my
nudes
it's not night and day and for that
price difference I think those who
already own the mm 50s are perfectly
fine where they are so in the end I
believe these headphones offers and just
enough in physical build quality where
it does surpass my expectations but it
focuses on just good audio in a sense
based on your characteristics however
now there's no microphone no controller
to adjust the volume there's no noise
cancelling but again is just pure clean
accurate audio so hope this video helped
you in some way if you like my work add
me Jim's review room and to Facebook
Twitter in
or Google+ as I normally post updates on
items I'm currently reviewing before I
put them on the websites again this is

take care and I'll see you in the next
