review room welcome to another review
now it's not often you get a breath of
fresh air something really original that
comes our way and that's the case with
lenovo's yoga tablet 10 HD plus the 10
HD plus is priced at three hundred and
sixty nine dollars at the time this
review and with its unique design and
claimed 18 hour battery life will see if
these features and some others included
are worth the price so without further
adieu we'll get started
this year's model physically stays
practically identical it's the same size
at ten point three inches wide 7.1
inches tall and only 0.4 inches thick at
its thickest part this model also weighs
in nearly the same at just one point
three eight pounds which is light weight
as the more premium tablets like these
Samsung Galaxy Pro models and the Apple
iPad air and they both weigh in about a
pound now overall the physical
construction is a slightly textured
plastic backing with a premium feeling
metal base and a physical design and
materials worked well the large lithium
ion battery is located here and doing so
creates that bulge where majority of the
weight is located so every time you pick
this up it nearly becomes a natural
instinct to grab it here and doing so
you're grabbing that metal base again
feeling that solid yet cool and
temperature piece of metal and what's
truly unique about the 10 HD plus is it
built in stand the novo markets it's
three modes that you can place this in
you've seen the tablet on the table so
far where it's angled and elevated on
one side you see me hold this as well in
one hand resembling holding a book or
magazine and the last is swiveling the
stand itself out and propping this on
the table and it actually works pretty
well and it's clearly not a gimmick
placing this on my desk in front of my
main computer I can see news feeds come
in or Facebook statuses update right in
front of me watching movies is also
convenient considering it's up right now
and a stand is very sturdy you can
adjust the angle to your desire and
continue to type on the screen without
the screen bending further back now the
last few physical aspects are its power
button on the left side here the other
side has your microphone
vine rocket buttons and a 3.5 millimeter
input for your headphones and the unit
all charges with a supplied micro USB
charger now on the back of the tablet
does feature a 8 megapixel camera which
takes mid-range quality photos in my
opinion and if you do buy this make sure
to increase the resolution as it's set
to one megapixel from the factory
resulting in not-so-great photos but
once adjusted the clarity is good but
the colors on the other hand are
slightly washed out and whites are
slightly overblown you can see in some
photos very dark areas of shadows while
areas of sunlight is overexposed
low-light performance was okay with some
noise but keeping a steady hand was even
more challenging the photos on the
screen are not edited and right from the
10 HD plus and the last feature here
that I want to talk about on the back of
the tablet is a micro SD card slot which
I almost didn't see it's hidden behind
this cover here and I always find
manufacturers who provides SD card slots
to be very beneficial to increase the
amount of memory that you have and
transferring files and folders onto the
tablet now moving on to the screen this
is where a huge improvement is made from
the previous generation the resolution
gets bumped up to a more reasonable
level at 1920 by 1200 giving this
display a 224 pixel per inch density the
more density of pixels the more clarity
you'll have in text and images and
although in today's tablets most are
hitting closer to that 300 pixels per
inch range but to the average consumer
sharpness on the screen looks fine in my
opinion and keep in mind the 10 HD plus
is not a premium pro or high-end tablet
but it's aimed to get mainstream folks
who value some of the more unique
features the 10 HD plus has now at first
turning on the tablet the colors of the
user interface appeared really good my
eyes were enlightened by all the colors
but further testing after several days I
started to pick up on over saturation
watching the movie with Ted in high
definition
Marky Mark here has almost an orange
skin tone on his face
colors are blown out and colors and
clearly do not look accurate only when
playing games or watching Disney or
Pixar movies does it look somewhat fine
it's not a bad screen but if you take a
minute man in person to notice colors of
people's faces are either a warm tone or
too warm giving it Browns orange like
color in the last physical aspect before
talking about
performance are these front-facing
speakers these speakers are one of the
better ones out there
thanks to Lenovo having Dolby Digital
audio enhancements sound in general when
Dolby Digital is on does give any movie
or song a bit more depth and loudness
for a tablet speaker and they're really
good now moving on internally the ten HD
plus runs currently on Android 4.3 jelly
bean with the latest Android 4.4 KitKat
coming soon / Lenovo's website the unit
runs on a 1.6 gigahertz Snapdragon 400
quad-core processor with 2 gigs of RAM
on board there's 32 gigs of storage and
as stated earlier you can add another 64
gigs of memory with a microSD card now
with that being said web browsing
including social sites like Facebook and
Google+
- just reading up on the news and random
other entertainment sites ran perfectly
fine what's unique about the 10 HD plus
similar to LG and Samsung tablets you
can multitask several windows at the
same time but lenovo does this a little
bit better though impressing on the
recent apps button and dragging an open
app up and then doing this again for
another app will eventually split your
screen you can press the middle circle
here to resize the window to your
choosing
now with samsung galaxy tablets only the
biggest 12 inch model can you split four
screens at the same time while the
smaller tablets you can only do two at a
time with the 10 HD plus you can do four
all at the same time and it's pretty
fluid all together the only exception
you can't do this with games and several
other apps as well and just like the
other tablets but for the most part you
can do quite a bit of multitasking for
your needs now in regards to gaming it's
capable of playing games some ran
flawless while some ran with slight
slower frame rates plants vs. zombies
candy crush fruit ninja all are flawless
however intense games seem more
graphically intense games that is like
real racing 3 soft frame rates drop it
wasn't hiccups but just not a smooth
frame rate in general it's still
playable but not as enjoyable now going
back to lenovo's homepage I want to say
there isn't a apps button to view all of
your apps you've downloaded instead all
of your downloaded apps are on your home
pages similar to Apple iOS devices where
everything is on your screen and of
course you can drag and drop them on
other homepage screens of your choosing
but
it's something that you'll need to do to
stay organized and stay clutter free as
much as you can it's not a big issue but
consumers may have their own preference
now in regards to other Lenovo features
swiping from the right or left inwards
reviews the smart sidebar which includes
the most recent movie you're currently
watching your photos and your books and
a pre-selected amount of apps on the
bottom here for quick selecting and a
last main feature I'll discuss is the
battery the 10 HD plus is known for an
industry-leading
unheard-of up to 18 hours of battery
life per Lenovo now I left brightness
out at about 50% to obtain a
middle-of-the-road base you can say I
played a movie leaving this on Pandora
the entire time and use this for a
typical web surfing I left everything on
normal settings with Wi-Fi continuously
on and the screen never timed out in
general the test is a little bit more
demanding possibly compared to the
average consumer so in total I achieved
9 hours and 51 minutes of news with 3%
battery remaining which would have
possibly given me about 10 hours of
total news now it's somewhat far from
the 18 hours however it's still a
class-leading result and considering
you're not using the tablet for 10 hours
straight and I wouldn't think you're
leaving this with Pinder on all day the
tablet should last you a little bit
longer than what my results are and
should last you pretty much throughout
the week so I hope you enjoyed my review
of the latest yoga tablet 10 HD plus
from Lenovo let me know your thoughts
below and this much improved tablet over
last year's model despite some minor
setbacks on this year's rendition find
me on Facebook or Google+ and as always
I appreciate the support this is Jimmy
