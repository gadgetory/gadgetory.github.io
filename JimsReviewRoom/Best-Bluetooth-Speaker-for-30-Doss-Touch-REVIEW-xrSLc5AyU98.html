the best bang for your buck Bluetooth
speaker now a few days ago I reviewed
the Amazon basics model which sold for
just $40 they can check that review in
the video description but I'm trying to
get as low as I can for you guys here
while still keeping that small profile
nothing too tiny here where it becomes
unusable now order this from Amazon this
is the sound box from Dawson I believe
that's how pronounce it and this one is
$30 at the time of this video now plays
the link in the description below that
way you can check for the most updated
prices so without further ado my channel
is here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to gems review
room
go over the physical features the unit
is quite portable with smooth edges
making this easy to toss around and stow
away in a tight bag the entire unit is
wrapped in a very solid aluminium grille
pressing this yielded no flexing at all
now there's two drivers that I can see
on the front here but there's nothing on
the rear despite again being wrapped all
the way around in aluminum and no sound
comes out the rear just to clear that up
on the bottom and the top is a matte
finish which looks simple you have
classy although the speaker does give
the look of having a base radiator or
maybe our woofer pointing upwards here
slotting a piece of paper all the way
around prove there's no opening the
design is just peel aesthetic
nonetheless it's still a unique look
though looking over the buttons they're
all touch sensitive and they all work
very well when a unit is on the unit
glows a very bright white and not a
cheap dim looking LED the top left is
your mode selector to enable bluetooth
switch through the 3.5 millimeter
physical cord or use a micro SD card
slot which I'll show you later now the
right is pause and play with
disconnecting the speaker if you use
this as a speakerphone and the bottom
two are for skipping songs left and
right and that blue ring in the middle
here is also touch sensitive it's a
volume Dow which works perfectly fine
just rotate your finger here now
rotating to the rear there's your on and
off switch with a three-and-a-half
millimeter port to physically connect
your device a TF card slot which is the
acronym for transflash which send a snap
using that name a while ago but micro SD
card slides basically right into this in
place music off of that and last is a
micro USB port for charging the device
there's no wall adapter so you do have
to use an existing USB port like on a
computer or maybe a power bank unless
there is a tiny LED under that that
indicates if the unit is being charged
or basically if it's full now one issue
the light is very small when a cord is
plugged in it does block the light so
checking it it's somewhat of a slight
nuisance though now regarding battery
life the sound box is climbing up to
twelve hours of battery life in general
like all my Bluetooth speakers I test I
did leave this on at 50% bottom from a
full battery to dead and I personally
achieved 14 hours and then I just
stopped there had to go to sleep but 50%
vine was a little low in volume but the
volume level is a good medium to
basically gauge how long this speaker
should last so compared to the
competition it's right there in the
upper to middle range of battery
performance now regarding range I did
walk from one side of the house the
other went downstairs and had a signal
password
walls with my Samsung s7 and no problems
at all
that's about 40 linear feet so other
than that the speaker doesn't have all
the bells and whistles like NFC or being
waterproof or offering bass boost but
the build quality and the aesthetics so
far I'm really enjoying the only other
era that would have to critique nothing
against George decay here but highly the
voice commands sounds very similar to
him here's a sample we do Perry paired
now to the point that you've been
waiting for the sound test I'll play
several songs for you guys and give you
my verdict afterwards
and there you have it folks
of course sound recorded on my end and
then play through your speakers are not
the best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review here starting off with
bass for the price it's pretty good now
you're not getting sub bass levels or
that warm vibrating bass but a common
factor here on cheap speakers they
usually distort a crackle or they sound
muffled now this sounds great for the
price and it does sound cleaner compared
to the Amazon Bluetooth speaker that I
have just reviewed the mid-range is
clean it's clear and pronounced well
with the high notes not being ear
ringing or pinging on the snares and
hi-hats now having this in my garage
while working for about two hours
straight or so never was the audio
quality fatiguing now sound separation
like most Bluetooth speakers are barely
there any soundstage is minimally
apparent even when sitting close to the
speaker
however the speaker is plenty loud for a
small room and good for more casual
listening that is in mid-sized rooms
blasting this at full volume for the
most part the speaker's audio quality
really held together it's not going to
sound like the JBL flip three or they
both sound like mini but in this price
range this might be the best one out
there at the moment so that's it for
this review here again the links are
individual script and below if you
haven't be sure to subscribe and add me
on to Facebook Twitter and/or Instagram
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and my
channels here to help you make a
purchase decision you guys take care
I'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
