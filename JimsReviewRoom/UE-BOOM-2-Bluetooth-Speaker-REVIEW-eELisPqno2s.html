boom was one of the most popular
Bluetooth speakers for most of 2015 in
here again Ultimate Ears offers the
follow-up with the boom - the name is
similar the look is practically
identical but there are some notable
features and upgrades on the inside now
I personally paid for this at the retail
price of one hundred and ninety nine
dollars but you can always click on the
link in the video description below for
updated pricing to see where it is today
again I'm Jimmy Wynn Jim's review room
be sure to subscribe and follow me on
Facebook Twitter or Instagram for more
reviews like these I'm here to help you
make your purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review going over
the physical features first this thing
is 7 inches tall two and three-quarter
inches in diameter and weighs in at just
1.2 pounds the exterior looks and feels
identical to the original boom with a
solid exterior and this nylon like
ruggedized shell last year's model was
splash proof but this new model its ipx7
rated this means you can fully submerge
this up to 1 meter of depth or three
point three feet of water up to 30
minutes that is and from my tests this
works perfectly fine the only hurdle
though if you do bring this on the boat
and let's say accidentally drop this
into the lake or maybe the deep end of
the pool here the speaker does not float
unlike the bigger UE mega boom that I
tested earlier this year however this is
also dirt proof as well from my testing
I also spray this down with a horse a
high-pressure hose here and again no
problems whatsoever now looking at the
very cliquey and rugged buttons power on
and off with a bluetooth pairing button
top sliding to the front of speaker
volume up and down and a feature that I
love that's on all of the UE Bluetooth
speakers currently pressing both of
these buttons at the same time will give
you a much more precise reading of how
much battery life is remaining 80
percent charge now going to the bottom
here there is a small metal loop to hook
this anywhere a flap that covers the 3.5
millimeter ports if you ever decide to
connect this physically to your device
in a 3.5 millimeter cord is not provided
so just a heads up on that and very last
a microUSB port to connect
with the supplied wall charger but
speaking of charging here better life is
claimed to be up to fifteen hours of use
the same as last years and with 50%
volume during my testing here leaving
this from full and all the way down to a
dead battery the boom - lasted me 10
hours in two minutes a bit less than
what was claimed but decent life in most
cases when compared to the other big and
small Bluetooth speakers respectively
now other features that we cannot see
the range on the boom - also has doubled
at least that's what they claimed making
this a class-leading industry standard
for Bluetooth speakers but with my tests
outdoors here using a digital laser
measure to verify distance I was able to
achieve a maximum 70 feet from the
speaker until the connection crackled
however if I turned around while holding
my smartphone here having the connection
go through my body essentially the audio
would crackle as well I could only get
as far as 30 feet away from the speaker
again with the phone on the other side
of my body now testing this indoors
Alice don't know if this is just my unit
only but with my standard test that I do
in all my speakers I was not able to
reach the other side of the house and
downstairs again like the other
Bluetooth speakers that I've tested
previously my connection could only go
through about one wall my phone had to
be stationary for the connection to be
stable it has a side note this distance
test was before I did my water test that
you've seen earlier new to the boom -
you can tap on the top of the boom to
pause and play and a double tap will
skip to the next song with my experience
you do have to pick it up with your
other hand here and tap away leaving
this on the table this feature won't
work but touching based on the free app
here available for both Apple and
Android devices this does open some
additional features that other Bluetooth
speakers don't have on the market double
up as the first option offering you two
pair another UE speaker at the same time
allowing for two speakers to play from
the same source offering stereo
separation an equalizer is available if
you don't plan on using your own
built-in equalizer on your phone and
last is an alarm that basically wakes
you up with your music that's stored on
your phone unfortunately in shock they
haven't addressed this yet the alarm is
only set to go off everyday or not at
all you can't select individual days or
exclude weekends but now to the moment
that you've been waiting for hear the
sound test I'll play several songs and
give you my verdict after
words oh yeah cuz I got it like that
slow so smooth like I got it on chair
yeah and I'm sick of being a good night
while I'm on my game
and there you have it folks now sound
recorded at my end and then play through
your speakers or not the best depiction
of audio quality
hence my review here now first off the
boom - and the mega boom are one of the
few speakers on the market that does
give full 360 degrees sound no matter
which side of the speaker is standing
out you'll receive the same loudness per
uese website the loudness of this
particular speaker here has increased
and it surely shows this speaker is loud
very loud that is for small to
medium-sized rooms and now it can fill
up larger sized rooms at full volume but
at full volume I did notice that bass
does drone a bit once you reduce the
volume slightly then the bass levels are
a little bit more appreciated then
vocals and mid-range are decent but
lacks authority and not as crisp and
bright as some of the other speakers
I've tested at the market specifically
the JBL charge 2 and B both sound like
mini - and as for the highs despite
offering louder vibe output the highs
for some songs do become distorted now I
want to emphasize though at lower
volumes this does well when it's not
pushed to its limits the sound sensor is
good providing I believe a more flat yet
balanced tone but if you're looking for
a speaker to fill up a room for
entertaining the sound quality and I
want to emphasize that key word there
the quality in this case I don't think
it's there if you're looking for one
hell of a rugged speaker to bring this
on your trips bring it outdoors on a
camping trip or so this has to be one of
the best in that aspect so I hope this
review helped you in some way remember
to follow me
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and
thank you for watching I'll see you guys
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
