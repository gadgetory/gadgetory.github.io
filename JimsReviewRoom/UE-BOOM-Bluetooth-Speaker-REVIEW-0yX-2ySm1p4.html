review room now almost every week I have
a fan asking me to review the UE boom
now one viewer said to me this is the
most popular speaker in the UK now I
don't know if that's true or not but
with so many people inquiring the UE
boom sounds like a hit
I should have reviewed it a long time
ago now it's priced at one hundred and
ninety nine dollars retail as of this
video which is in between the high end
and budget-friendly options out there
but we'll see how it sounds and go over
its features so without further ado
welcome to Jim's review room
when a hell this in my hands it really
resembled the JBL flip or JBL charge
that I tested some time ago it's a long
cylinder measuring seven inches tall and
2.6 inches in diameter which you can
either stand up tall or lay flat on the
table for sound now when grabbing
there's this very solid belt no flexing
but uniquely feeling device the exterior
is made of this really nice nylon
braided texture and gives a slight very
minut cushion when grabbed but behind
that material is a premium feeling solid
reinforced shell now on the other side
is a very grippy silicon with vine
buttons up and down and when pressing
both at the same time indicates the
remaining battery percentage forty
percent charge now on one end of the
boom here is the power on and off button
with a bluetooth pairing button close by
now rotating to the other end is a three
1/2 millimeter input for connecting the
boom physically to your chosen audio
source with a micro USB port nearby for
charging the device now from my testing
it takes about three and half hours to
fully charge the speaker from a dead
battery and youie your ultimate ears
claims up to 15 hours of performance
that person left this on at 50% volume
to get an even base or even results and
this played straight for 9 hours and 38
minutes till it died still a very good
number compared to other devices but
achieving close to 15 hours most likely
means playing this at a much lower value
now some of the last few features here
that you can't see is offering NFC or
near field communication for easy
pairing tap your NFC compatible device
and it pairs automatically for you
second the UV boom offers water and
stain resistance Ultimate Ears doesn't
go into detail on their website how
water-resistant it is but for my testing
it appears to hold up pretty well and
last and I believe this is a huge
selling point sound is offered 360
degrees because of its cylinder light
design there's two drivers on either
side offering sound and when placed in
the middle of the room and walking
around sound is evenly distributed
perfect for entertaining or those not
really wanting a dead zone in the room
now to the moment that you guys been
probably waiting for the sound test I'll
place several samples and give you my
verdict afterwards first up is time
flies rendition of Jamie Foxx's alcohol
gee coz I got it like that so so smooth
like I got it on tap yeah and I'm a
shake it be a good night while I'm on my
ging land while I'm drinking Bud Light
ah can you get it when you miss me like
I'm wit whiskey drinking Jim Beam hey
baby do you do it do it that way do you
do that love is swinging in the air
tonight let me show you him there you
have it folks now sound of course is
best heard in person and when playing
through your speakers it's not the best
depiction of audio quality
now hence my review here I am very
impressed I really wished I had tested
this out earlier there's a nice amount
of bass that's not over-the-top but just
enough to get you nodding the mids where
most vocals resides are good as well
with enough clarity and definition now I
blasted this at full volume and for a
Bluetooth speaker
there was not any distortion at all the
sound fields ranging from the lows mids
and highs all hold together very well
even at its highest volume the high
notes are not tingey are sharp sounding
to the ears it's really a balanced sound
quality that I very much liked similar
to the Bose Soundlink 3 now where it
really shines is pop hip-hop electronic
dance music which is my favorite genre
rock and alternative music now it still
does well in my opinion for more bass
focus John Rose in jump and bass etc but
if your focus is on bass look at my
review I mean beats by dre pill excel
but to reinforce again it's honestly
great as a very well done very well
balanced speaker as for the loudness
this will no question fulfill
medium-sized rooms and because of its
360 degrees sound
leaving this in the middle of a large
room still does justice it's as loud as
one of the more expensive brands out
there and now playing this from afar
ultimate ears claims I'm able to achieve
up to 50 feet of connection now I was
able to go from one side of the house to
the other through the first floor
ceiling and several walls and the
Bluetooth connection stayed connected
with no loss of quality and that's about
50 linear feet as well again through
several walls and ceiling then testing
the speakerphone option audio quality
was enough to get by the sound was a
little bit muffled at times but here's a
quick sample you can be the judge for
yourself April this is Jimmy with Jim's
review room so I'm here doing the audio
quality the voice body over the
speakerphone feature MV UE boom so you
guys can make judgment and how it sounds
and how it performs I like it then last
but not least here as an added feature
the UE boom offers an app for both
Android and Apple devices there's an
equalizer with presets available which
I'll be honest going through the
different settings I really couldn't
tell a difference but you can customize
yourself a preset once you update your
boom now there's also a unique alarm
feature that allows you to have your
stored music to start playing when they
set time is triggered and if you don't
have a song setup the boom will have its
own sound go off at your desire and last
is what you eat dubs as double-up
allowing you to pair to UE booms to play
as a single source or you can have each
boom play as left and right stereo audio
channels so that's it I enjoy this
product very much and I hope this video
helped you in some way as well if you do
like my work be sure to add me
