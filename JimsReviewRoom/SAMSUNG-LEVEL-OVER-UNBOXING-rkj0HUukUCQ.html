review room welcome back to another
unboxing now I greatly appreciate it
from the last unboxing that I did which
was the very first one I did in my
channel you guys provided a lot of
feedback and like I said in the
beginning of the video I said it's gonna
be really informal I guess you can say
me with no narrative no scripts you hear
me say um a lot and it's totally
different from the reviews that I
typically do on my channel but today
just get back on topic here what I have
here is the Samsung level over ears
noise canceling wireless headphones now
a lot of people know about it a lot of
people don't know about it it's weird
Samsung when these were first seen I
believe at CES Samsung stated that they
were not bringing this to the US market
but then about maybe a week or two ago
someone on Google Plus on the gyms
review room fan page was fortunate
enough to find out that they were being
released they notified me and I
definitely definitely ought to get me up
here because these look amazing these
look gorgeous at least in the photos you
know looking at websites and whatnot but
uh again we'll do a informal unboxing I
hope you guys enjoy this again Samsung
level overs yeah we're gonna rotate to
the back here for you guys and let me
try to zoom in here and like say it's
gonna shake a little bit little
unprofessional but and just showing you
it does come with these touch controls
there's no buttons I guess you can say
it just all a touch sensitive on either
one of these sides of these ear cups
Alexander goes the inline mic as well
look there you go and it does come with
a carrying case inside and the package
contents um is reading off the back here
stereo headphones obviously
three-and-a-half millimeter audio cable
a carrying case and an user guide is
basically all that comes in here now
this does have built-in NFC as well 50
millimeter drivers which are usually a
you know pretty big for the over the
ears normally they come with about 40
millimeters or so and let's see let's
open these bad boys up I am anxious to
see I have yet to personally see it
myself in person
so as
as you guys see it I'll see it for the
first time as well and plain white box
no Samsung logo on either side all
around nothing on the top is the tag
nothing on the bottom and here we go
guys and if you guys do follow me on
Jim's reviewer you see that I do the
unboxing and every intro that I do let's
see what else is on the bottom here
let's try just a huge user manual kind
of like this nylon kind of like a
neoprene kind of finish on the outside
does have a little bit of texture I'm
gonna if you guys can hear that link put
it close closer to the mic here okay
soft it's not a real true hardcase and
here we go guys jeez and these look
fancy as heck I swear it looks like
something out of a Ferrari or a Bugatti
or something holy jesus and man is it
super plush okay let's see it's go over
the little stuff here comes with that
like a little mini carrying case here
with your wires of course look at that
and here goes your inline controller
three half millimeter inputs obviously
beautiful white with a little bit of a
silver trim let me zoom in real quick
here sorry about that guys
gold-plated
connections again more of that chrome
and silver trim but this white looks
really good on this I always like white
on gold you know that or gold on white
my last car I had a Toyotas to layer
that and 18 really hit me in totalled
unfortunately last year but it was um
you know the gold emblem the gold trim
whatnot but I'm white as well I like
that like that I think I like that
better than the gold on black but he
goes a USB cable to a micro USB port
obviously or most likely for charging
the unit since they're wireless and
let's take a look at the headsets
themselves and these things
thick as hell all right I haven't
touched them yet and not too bad and
wait they are they do feel pretty light
like I said I'll look up the specs and
these and see specifically how much they
actually weigh let me zoom out a little
bit here there's a little tag on here
that says NFC and the ear cups are the
the outside of the headsets
there's no logo or branding which I'm
kind of shot to do it does to me look a
little bit playing just around this area
here it does say Samsung right here at
the band where I'm sure where it does
slide out and this is Wow really thick
premium metal this is like thicker metal
than most other headsets that I've seen
or reviewed that's really impressive
all-metal construction again this looks
amazing I love the stitching on here it
looks like a classic Ferrari or so how
they use a stitch or maybe there's no
stitch of today the way they do a cross
stitch with like a premium Italian
leather so but it feels really good soft
supple really cool to the touch I like
that
I really do and let's see about these
ear pads you know beats has similar let
that memory foam that they have you can
compare to this this is actually a
little bit more softer the and the solo
twos the new ones that is that just came
out and I just reviewed about a month or
two ago they were a little bit stiffer
but these are a little bit more plush
they look thicker but I think they
there's it's still about the same amount
of cushion because it's so soft once he
pressed down in it okay it still feels
about the same but overall just looking
at this and in person that is I don't
know how it looks on camera with the
colors and whatnot like I said I haven't
edited this yet or not but in person it
I swear it looks rich and that's about
it like I said I'll go over more
specifically in detail what all these
things are for fun that that's about it
damn he's look good all right so I'll
charge these puppies up see how they
work out I'll try to get all the
specifications for you and seeing you
know how long the battery lasts down
here obviously what the auto quality is
where these for a couple hours I hope
they don't give me fatigue usually with
you know headsets if they're a little
bit too heavy and you provide you know a
little bit of a wearing fatigue right on
the crown on the head I've mentioned
that a couple my previous reviews
already let's see about the clamping I'm
not bad at all it's it's less firm it's
one little lesser firm grips I guess you
can say in your head compared to some
other headsets down there so it's a
little bit less overall a really light
feel you can say in regards to weight
and also usability so far even at least
said even just down to the plushness
everything just feels light alright so
that's it
definitely definitely show a show you
support by liking subscribing and
sharing this video on your social media
channels as well Facebook Google+ and
again this is Jimmy with Jim's review
room I'll see you when I review these
guys and let's see how they sound I hope
they sound good they look darn good
though alright talk to you guys later
